chair I m here to tell you about some smart people shit Have you gotten your vaccine yet Chances are you were stuck with an RVP needle If the needle was retractable that s the one Retractable Technologies That s the ticket RVP just had earnings last week and it blew earnings out of the water Why Because half the country is half vaccinated dummies That s a shit ton of needles And now the other half of the vaccinations have to get stuck into people And then the other half of the country needs to get their vaccines too But wait there s more Dumbshits don t want to get vaccinated man COVID Vaxxes in the United States are over moron BOMP That s where you re wrong knuckledraggers First off people are getting vaccinated at baseball games and shit now There are still people out there who need their shot haven t had the time don t think it s a priority whatever who aren t opposed but it just hasn t been easy or fun You can literally catch a foul ball choke on a hotdog and get vaccinated at the same time now Also more importantly the United States isn t the whole world People seem to forget that when they buy stock in Apple or Nike or whatever other boring ass companies are stable Those companies have high market cap because their shit is available worldwide and people want it Well guess what people in other countries haven t had the chance to call the COVID vaccine pass bullshit the same way we have here They re still waiting for their shots The White House has a bunch of pull up machine jarhead fuckin Marine Corps motherfuckers packing boxes of RETRACTIBLE TECHNOLOGIES NEEDLES inbetween sets of burpees and puking because they ran 5 minute miles in desert heat and then those boxes are getting shipped worldwide As a matter of fact the demand is so damn high worldwide that the feds cut a 27M check to help RVP increase production capability so that they can keep up with the demand for the worldwide shipment orders that are going to keep coming in from DOD and HHS and so that they can eventually get to the backlog of orders that they still have coming in from the private sector Why the fuck do people want these needles Any needle will do right Are you serious Ever heard the phrase whoever builds a better mousetrap Here s your better mousetrap These are those fucking low deadspace needles you hear about on the news all the time that enable you to get more doses out of a vial These needles retract so that the nurses don t prick their hands when they re juggling between getting a bandaid on your arm disposing of the needle and all the other stupid little steps in the process Between the low deadspace making vaccine supply last longer and the NO ACCIDENTS thing there s talk that insurance companies are going to start demanding that hospitals use these needles if they want to do business both the patients insurance companies AND THE MALPRACTICE INSURANCE COMPANIES duh When I got my vaccine I asked the nurse what she thought about the retractable needle She told me the fact that they had them there was a sign that the admins at the vax site gave a shit about them as employees Admins are literally ordering these to keep nurses happy so they stay on the job So here s the deal Bleecker Street is a short selling firm that tried to sink this ship There are others involved in this that are shorting the hell out of it The shorts are about twice the float right now Bleecker s short report was basically CoViD iS oViD dUmBsHiTs ain t nobody gonna need needles after this which is fucking dumb as hell because they aren t taking into account the following 1 The government doesn t just give money to a company to expand production capability if they don t intend to keep ordering in perpetuity 2 COVID isn t the only disease we need vaccines for 3 Vaccines aren t the only things we need shots for My dentist used one on me Monday It did not retract He openly stated that he wished he could get his hands on those instead 4 The government isn t the only customer ordering these needles 5 OTHER NEEDLES SUCK TOTAL BALLS IN COMPARISON WOULDN T YOU RATHER YOUR KIDS STEP ON A RETRACTABLE NEEDLE IN A DARK ALLEY INSTEAD OF ONE THAT WILL PRICK THEM WITH DOPE AND HepC 6 Needles administer vaccines and medicines to more than just humans Anybody in here got a dog Ever bring em in for a rabies shot Here s the chart below You can clearly see the first few contract announcements Now they re one of the most shorted companies on the market and unlike our other short squeeze Cinderella Darlings like AMC and GME RVP is already cash rich already has a backlog of private sector orders to get to is not dependent on the government but is expanding capabilities I mean this thing has the potential to fucking rocket Let s jump on this thing guys RVP since the March 2020 COVID Crash https preview redd it 6xkgziac4r171 png width 2726 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 12c589c3dfeb30f8fe10974afdb4fb4a605f069f

I m here to tell you about some smart people shit Whenever you see a company with 325 million revenue but a market cap of only 300 million NOT 1 25BILLION BOT MODERATOR you want to take a close look especially when you know the revenue is going to continue in the future The bot moderator deleted this post at first because the market cap was too large BOMP WRONG It s cap is under its YoY revenue It s cap is only 300M dammit Here s the deal Have you gotten your vaccine yet Chances are you were stuck with an Retractable Technologies needle If the needle was retractable that s the one Retractable Technologies That s the ticket Retractable Technologies just had earnings last week and it blew earnings out of the water Why Because half the country is half vaccinated dummies That s a shit ton of needles they went through last quarter And now the other half of the vaccinations have to get stuck into people And then the other half of the country needs to get their vaccines too But wait there s more Dumbshits don t want to get vaccinated man COVID Vaxxes in the United States are over moron BOMP That s where you re wrong knuckledraggers First off people are getting vaccinated at baseball games and shit now There are still people out there who need their shot haven t had the time don t think it s a priority whatever who aren t opposed but it just hasn t been easy or fun You can literally catch a foul ball choke on a hotdog and get vaccinated at the same time now Also more importantly the United States isn t the whole world People seem to forget that when they buy stock in Apple or Nike or whatever other boring ass companies are stable Those companies have high market cap because their shit is available worldwide and people want it Well guess what people in other countries haven t had the chance to call the COVID vaccine pass bullshit the same way we have here They re still waiting for their shots The White House has a bunch of pull up machine jarhead fuckin Marine Corps motherfuckers packing boxes of RETRACTIBLE TECHNOLOGIES NEEDLES inbetween sets of burpees and puking because they ran 5 minute miles in desert heat and then those boxes are getting shipped worldwide As a matter of fact the demand is so damn high worldwide that the feds cut a 27M check to help Retractable increase production capability so that they can keep up with the demand for the worldwide shipment orders that are going to keep coming in from DOD and HHS and so that they can eventually get to the backlog of orders that they still have coming in from the private sector Why the fuck do people want these needles Any needle will do right Are you serious Ever heard the phrase whoever builds a better mousetrap Here s your better mousetrap These are those fucking low deadspace needles you hear about on the news all the time that enable you to get more doses out of a vial These needles retract so that the nurses don t prick their hands when they re juggling between getting a bandaid on your arm disposing of the needle and all the other stupid little steps in the process Between the low deadspace making vaccine supply last longer and the NO ACCIDENTS thing there s talk that insurance companies are going to start demanding that hospitals use these needles if they want to do business both the patients insurance companies AND THE MALPRACTICE INSURANCE COMPANIES duh When I got my vaccine I asked the nurse what she thought about the retractable needle She told me the fact that they had them there was a sign that the admins at the vax site gave a shit about them as employees Admins are literally ordering these to keep nurses happy so they stay on the job So here s the deal Bleecker Street is a short selling firm that tried to sink this ship There are others involved in this that are shorting the hell out of it The shorts are about twice the float right now Bleecker s short report was basically CoViD iS oViD dUmBsHiTs ain t nobody gonna need needles after this which is fucking dumb as hell because they aren t taking into account the following 1 The government doesn t just give money to a company to expand production capability if they don t intend to keep ordering in perpetuity 2 COVID isn t the only disease we need vaccines for 3 Vaccines aren t the only things we need shots for My dentist used one on me Monday It did not retract He openly stated that he wished he could get his hands on those instead 4 The government isn t the only customer ordering these needles 5 OTHER NEEDLES SUCK TOTAL BALLS IN COMPARISON WOULDN T YOU RATHER YOUR KIDS STEP ON A RETRACTABLE NEEDLE IN A DARK ALLEY INSTEAD OF ONE THAT WILL PRICK THEM WITH DOPE AND HepC 6 Needles administer vaccines and medicines to more than just humans Anybody in here got a dog Ever bring em in for a rabies shot Here s the chart below Holy cow look at that consolidation Look at how far down the hedgies have pushed it It s spring loaded baby https preview redd it f2vaarklqr171 png width 2726 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 70e041db0583ce2644a9a12aef8afb8491a4dfda You can clearly see the first few contract announcements Now they re one of the most shorted companies on the market and unlike our other short squeeze Cinderella Darlings Retractable Technologies is already cash rich already has a backlog of private sector orders to get to is not dependent on the government but is expanding capabilities I mean this thing has the potential to fucking rocket Let s jump on this thing guys

401,nmofz4,t2_exycv,1622171557,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nmofz4/palantir_dd_if_you_want_to_understand_company_and/,1,Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it s history better also insider selling explained in detail ,This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it I ve been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023 So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don t understand it because it s hard to hear all the hype and stuff Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought Don t judge me it s just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable They developed the really massive government software gotham specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions It essentially was using what computers are efficient at sorting through massive amounts of data and then combining that with what humans are good at looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I m talking about Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software Foundry That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn t spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data insights But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations You think commercial companies aren t going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that They re only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling Meaning they re this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part Which they ve also said in tons of interviews if you re a die hard Palantirian like me They actually also have the third side of the business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what s going on This other software is different It s called Apollo and its only at the beginning too It s like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it s on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we re going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI The amount of government money that s going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is https www businesswire com news home 20201001005334 en U S Army Research Lab Selects Palantir Technologies Inc for 91M Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Development This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in Sure they re going to experiment with other research but if you do research you ll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6 The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I m not even sure if there s more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get But like again I m an obsessive I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it s very possible and can make them huge and it will But I m actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do It s literally the next Manhattan project and they re absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest I think it s funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong Tom Nash love him or hate him I don t care has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price Well because it s the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments So everytime karp was exercising he s actually buying shares Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars shares And even those when he exercising he s buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE So over the last year plus this year he s essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit So his total income which he s getting taxed at 40 of is in the BILLIONS yes billions Because that s a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there s no issue it s not even like him saying sell today and they do this TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC That s why it s automatically happening so no one can ever claim he s timing it So listen cause here s where it gets important The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he s receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn t actually get billions of dollars So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised So everytime he s selling low its actually good for him because it s less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on If he wasn t selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall So if he thought it was going to tank he d wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes I know this seems really crazy but I promise that s how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong Unbelievable I know If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like 3 6 dollars not low 20s Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low like retail always does to institutions

990,nmvjqr,t2_5205d,1622200489,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nmvjqr/question_about_market_mechanics/,1,Question about market mechanics,We re told that buying and holding contributes to price rises and selling contributes to price decreases But on a more fundamental level my understanding is that that s not really how it works The price of a stock is actually determined NOT by how many people are holding but instead by the minute by minute interplay of whoever is buying and selling at any given moment More specifically it s determined by the most recent trades executed when the lowest sell offer at any given time meets the highest buy offer Theoretically this trade could be for a single share Therefore single share trades in rapid succession could drive down the price Therefore if for argument s sake it s the middle of the night on a weekend etc can t hedge funds or whoever just execute tiny one share trades continuously driving the price down artificially I believe this is called a short ladder attack Ok so perhaps you can approach it a different way by leveraging the millions of people on Reddit to all buy a certain stock leading to an actual scarcity of buyable shares This scarcity mechanic I understand as a way to drive prices but this has got to be rare no If not rare then perhaps only effective when a certain degree of scarcity is reached I e 10 20 scarcity no effect 50 some effect 75 large effect etc What REALLY drives prices Is it scarcity Is it the manipulations of hedge funds and sophisticated investors Is it average people buying and holding on Robinhood What I m getting at is that to my understanding buying price goes up and selling price goes down is a gross oversimplification of what s really going on So my question is is the whole buy stock goes up sell stock goes down while technically an oversimplification is that actually an accurate or at least a 99 effective way of looking at the markets Does it pay to have a more nuanced understanding OR am I wasting my time thinking about all this because buying pretty much contributes 1 1 to price rise and selling pretty much contributes 1 1 to price decreases

other shady options mechanisms Likely yes but will not explore in this post Are Citadel and Friends shorting ETFs directly that contain GME YES but that s not the entire picture Isn t shorting an ETF that only contains 1 5 GME expensive and cost prohibitive NO and here s why Operational Shorting Naked Shorting ETFs at a PROFIT for Citadel What Is an ETF An exchange traded fund ETF is like a basket of stocks that can be purchased or sold on an exchange like a single regular stock Rise of ETFs are concerning since they constitute a disproportionately high amount of US trading volume 25 of all US equity trading volume but only constitute 5 market cap Why is there such a high ETF trading volume Answer Its profitable for the APs What is an AP An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange traded fund ETF like big banks or market makers like Citadel How does Citadel make money on selling buying ETFs Arbitrage The buying and selling of securities in different markets or forms in order to take advantage of the differing prices of the same asset amp x200B Arbitrage Analogy Think of ETFs like XRT as a fruit basket and the stocks they contain fruits Say the XRT fruit basket was 6 and contained a banana GME orange and apple And individual bananas are 1 oranges are 2 and apples are 3 The total cost of buying the fruits individually is the NAV net asset value which in this case is also 6 Citadel can make their own fruit baskets by buying individual fruits but they wouldn t make too much money since the price of the fruit basket are usually similar to the NAV In recent years Citadel and other APs have found a much more profitable strategy Operational Shorting https preview redd it ws8rv6rw68p61 png width 512 amp format png

days later Flooding the market with tons of promised fruit baskets can drive down the price of individual fruits bananas went from 1 gt 0 5 oranges to 1 8 apples to 2 7 only to buy back the individual fruits 6 days later at a CHEAPER NAV and deliver those fruit baskets to you That fruit basket that was delivered to buyers only cost Citadel 0 5 1 8 2 7 5 to make netting them a cool 1 while also driving down the price of bananas by 50 amp x200B Operational Shorting by Citadel When faced with excess buying pressure for ETF shares the AP MM can sell shares naked and then locate or create the shares at a later time up to T 6 for bona fide market making Market makers often commercial banks or hedge funds create ETFs for their issuers by buying the securities that the funds are supposed to represent But they ve discovered that they can make a predictable return by delaying the purchases and selling you nonexistent exchange traded fund shares that they will create later These transactions are a form of shorting Operational Shorting as coined by Richard Evans Professor at the Darden School of Business amp x200B Okay What does this mean for GME Citadel is willing to NAKED

to Deliver Naked Short Selling or Operational Shorting gt If higher levels of FTDs spill over from one ETF to another within the same AP or across different APs with overlap in their ETF market making activities operational shorting could increase financial instability When we examine the impact of FTDs across different ETFs we find evidence consistent with this contagion like effect Moreover we also find that APs that are closer to their maximum regulatory leverage limit are more likely to operationally short These results suggest ETF trading relies on an inter connected network of liquidity providers which at times pursue positively correlated trading strategies that can be detrimental to the overall market amp x200B Additional Findings on Operational Shorting and Financial Linkages APs who are operationally short in one ETF are more likely to be operationally short in other ETFs for which they serve as an AP intra AP linkage Proof in point Citadel began shorting XRT to drive down the price of GME in Feb and more recently have shorted IWM to drive down the price of GME again A given AP has higher operational shorting when other APs have higher levels of operational shorting inter AP linkage Higher operational shorting by Citadel linked to higher operational shorting by other APs Looking at regulatory constraints on AP leverage we also find that the closer a firm is to its regulatory leverage limit the higher levels of operational shorting This is consistent with a contagion like effect that could cause entire market instability amp x200B CITADEL AND FRIENDS ARE FUCKED AND ON THE BRINK UPTICK IN RECENT ETF NAKED SHORTING SIGNALS THAT THEY ARE CLOSER TO THEIR REGULATORY LEVERAGE LIMITS EXPECT MORE NAKED SHORTING OF ETFS BUT THESE ADDITIONAL SHORTING MAY LEAD TO ENTIRE MARKET INSTABILITY I WILL HOLD MY BANANAS TO THE MOON Edit To clarify my summary is that naked shorting of ETFs is easy and profitable for the APs And while operational shorting has no net effect on the NAV of all the stocks in an ETF they have realized it is an effective way to drive and magnify the direction of a single stock in the ETF in the direction they want it to go via other methods like direct shorting of GME Translation today s rise may have been premediated by the APs since they knew they had to cover from shorting IWM 5 days ago Whether GME keeps rising after today no one can answer and specific dates don t matter since APs have multiple strategies to delay or shorten the delivery dates on shares sold short THE most effective way for me to deal with APs who have become more and more leveraged is to just buy and hold Edit 2 Typos Edit 3 Remove call for upvote as mods requested Edit 4 This is not investment advice I just like the stock amp x200B Sources Evans

is important to me please read amp x200B I was in my early teens during the 08 crisis I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life and the lives of those close to me I was fortunate my parents were prudent and a little paranoid and they had some food storage saved up When that crisis hit our family we were able to keep our little house but we lived off of pancake mix and powdered milk and beans and rice for a year Ever since then my parents have kept a food storage and they keep it updated and fresh Those close to me my friends and extended family were not nearly as fortunate My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like My friends got to find out Almost a year after the crisis low my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others he was hiring my friends dads for odd house work One of them built a new closet in our guest room Another one did some landscaping in our backyard I will forever be so proud of my parents because in a time of need even when I have no doubt money was still tight they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it To Melvin Capital you stand for everything that I hated during that time You re a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the 08 crisis were not punished And your blatant disregard for the law made obvious months ago through your for the Melvin lawyers out there alleged illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven t learned a single thing since 08 And why would you Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions I bought shares a few days ago I dumped my savings into GME paid my rent for this month with my credit card and dumped my rent money into more GME which for the people here at WSB I would not recommend And I m holding This is personal for me and millions of others You can drop the price of GME after hours 120 I m not going anywhere You can pay for thousands of reddit bots I m holding You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us I don t care I m making this as painful as I can for you To CNBC you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions agenda is just that short term Your staple audience will soon become too old to care and the millions of us not just at WSB but every person affected by the 08 crash that s now paying attention to GME are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us and tried to tear down the little guys I know for sure I ll remember this In response here is a list of CNBC sponsors and partners https www cnbcevents com sponsors They include but are not limited to IBM Cisco TMobile JPMorgan Oracle and ZipRecruiter Their parent company is NBCUniversal https en wikipedia org wiki NBCUniversal owned by Comcast and GE To the boomers and or people close to that age just now paying attention to these millennial blog posts you realize that even if you weren t adversely effected by the 08 crash your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were We re not enemies we re on the same side Stop listening to the media that s making us out to be market destroyers and start rooting for us because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago and we re taking that opportunity Your children your grandchildren might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we re fighting against You really want to choose them over your own family and friends We re not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet We re just asking you to be understanding supportive and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago To WSB you all are amazing I imagine that I m not the only one that this is personal for I ve read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the 08 crash Whether you re here for the gains to stick it to the man as I am or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement thank you Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance I ve never felt this optimistic about the future before This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible I love you all amp x200B amp x200B Note I can t seem to get a hold of mods and they keep fucking removing the post I have no idea how to get this to stick and its important to me that the

venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield amp Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio In September 2009 Fisker Automotive was awarded a 528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy DOE The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars The funds were to be used to develop the Karma as well as an affordable family size plug in hybrid car The loan facility was frozen at 192 million in February 2012 after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones In December 2011 just as the Fisker Karma was launched its battery supplier A123 Systems recalled all batteries followed by a second recall in 2012 A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012 leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier After selling approximately 2 000 units production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012 in the absence of its battery supplier amp x200B

because of disagreements with management about business strategy Later that year the company declared voluntary bankruptcy Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime The heart of Fisker s business model was in that early deal with Quantum The idea was to design a gorgeous car and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off the shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down But there were problems with this strategy Sometimes those parts had to be custom made to fit the design vision which resulted in higher prices for Fisker Other times parts were delivered late or worse faulty but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves so Fisker didn t own a lot of the internal technology The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive by selling their private shares was Advanced Equities It wasn t until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker s hundreds of investors The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities fund raising for Fisker starting with the D 1 round was what brokers call pay to play As Fisker was running into technical delivery and political problems its valuation was quickly declining But the company still needed more money so the brokers went back to its current investors and said Unless you give this more your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock It was essentially a gun to their heads This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012 alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic In his lawsuit he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan 18 2012 stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker s next round and pay around 84 000 by Jan 27 2012 a little over a week from receiving the letter He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti dilution protection According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities internal sales call in early 2010 Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will suffer no dilution and was a dream scenario That dream would soon end In September 2012 after Fisker closed on 1 2 billion in funding the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 Bloom Energy Advanced settled agreeing to pay 1 million and its co founders were personally fined Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop Later A123 Systems itself went bankrupt causing more problems for Fisker Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it 140 million but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry 15 million Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey The cars first drowned and then caught on fire salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds Fisker said at the time With all of this happening in public and in a presidential election year Fisker s struggles became highly politicized The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE supported companies losers The company didn t seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers For example numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15 000 of some of the parts for its planned 15 000 Karmas It ended up only selling around 2 000 of the cars It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100 000 Nina cars it hoped to produce in the end Fisker didn t deliver a single Nina Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints The company ended up adding 20 000 to its initial sale price Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker s funding Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit At the high point of Fisker the company had around 300 employees plus dozens of contract staff Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly and also impress potential investors with industry names But those people are also used to big auto industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries that s the opposite life of a tech startup Fisker Inc In July 2016 Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look He has pursued battery technology and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025 Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape Forbes Now he s back and three things are different First and foremost he has a vital new partner his wife cofounder and Fisker Inc CFO Geeta Gupta Fisker Second his Los Angeles based company is public this time around raising more than 1 billion in an October 2020 IPO And finally Fisker s stock price up 56 since its debut has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires each worth about 1 1 billion as of Friday s market close The auto industry has seen father son and sibling leadership teams but Fisker Inc s CEO CFO combo is the fast changing sector s first husband and wife power couple Wealth isn t the purpose of the new company Henrik says I never got into cars because of money This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money unlike 99

started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive They married in 2012 When I left Fisker Automotive all I had was my car Henrik remembers I m in a different position mainly because of Geeta Because she cuts the deals To get the new venture off the ground the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings an enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik s prior company Then just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication Geeta learned she had early stage breast cancer She got the call from her doctor during a call with investors

A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018 In October 2018 Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital The solid state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times In 2018 Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt a North American cobalt refinery that produces

quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me architect Bjarke Ingels The idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one It s a design challenge a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others like the BMW Z8 Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage He s a hero for gas guzzling supercars He is a fellow Dane I am a fan and we met of all places on Twitter When we met in person he described his new project an all electric luxury SUV and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics They get you from point A to B They run electric so you don t pollute while driving but that s it They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them and for most of them a battery with a limited range What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way like a full length solar roof recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats It looks incredibly cool and inviting with a great 250 to 300 mile range and at a cost of just under 40 000 it s a luxury car affordable to a mass market I said yes and even became an investor not only because it s a great car but more importantly I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business Fisker then had the idea of calling me sustainability adviser Which I am not Just to be clear Thanks Henrik sounds cool but I am an actor and a citizen and that s really it And what about Hollywood Is our industry changing are we at the forefront Looking at social media you would think so And things are happening but usually only when a camera is pointed at people Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet We made a difference We mattered We showed the way So cool So green so brief Now it s back to the Escalade But hey we are not using plastic straws anymore To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality when did that stop us but we are great at reacting and things around us are changing and changing us I have a good friend who loves his SUV It s not electric But he cannot give up his car He is a good guy he s works for the U N so if he has a problem going electric we all do But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn t mean a reduction in his quality of life something like the Fisker SUV I think he d transition to electric in a heartbeat The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US 2 9 billion with an IPO share price of 10 On July 30 2020 Fisker announced plans for a four vehicle portfolio by 2025 The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept a coupe like SUV and a lifestyle pickup truck All will be electric vehicles On October 15 2020 Fisker Inc announced it

products Magna International Inc was founded in 1957 and is headquartered in Aurora Canada Henrik Fisker Interview quotes I have people on Twitter saying Why don t you just make the car next month You have a prototype Most people don t understand that it takes 18 months to do long lead body tooling for high volume vehicles Most people don t understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else And on the business model itself I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that s going to make a million EVs on one model Today there s nobody doing it Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model a couple hundred thousand But even the big giant established carmakers are not making right now a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model So the way you get volume in my view is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn t have any brand value anymore And obviously as we move forward we always start to do some of the things ourselves But it was really about de risking in our first vehicle to market So we re going to do another three vehicles which we can do because we don t have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car for instance So we have programmed a lot We have hired a head of ESG environmental and social governance and he is really spearheading developing specific we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers and we at least try to bring them in that direction They are not reaching those goals right now but they may reach them later And then we have goals for ourselves So for instance we look at transport Are we choosing a supplier that s closer to the plant or are we choosing a supplier that s on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff So those are the types of things that we re really thinking about now as we re nominating suppliers And finally materials as well looking at sustainable materials We ve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle So we are actually looking across everything supply chain where the suppliers are located what the suppliers are doing for sustainability and also then of course in the vehicle itself in terms of the type of materials there Investor Presentation https s26 q4cdn com 943649897 files Fisker Company Overview April 2021 CLEAN FINAL pdf Key Points Cash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31 2020 approx 1 0bn

Responsible Supplier Policy further below Director of ESG formerly at Nike in place as of November 2020 2021 Q1 Earnings call 18th May Quotes Henrik Fisker In fact we are already working on fulfilling 2023 safety rating for Five Star And also engineering powertrain modeling supports our expected range and acceleration we ll have up to 350 mile range and top vehicle will do zero to 60 in less than four seconds Most car companies start in one market but we re just actually going to do simultaneously Europe and U S We are talking about several hundred thousands of volumes already now we re seeing suppliers giving us great deals on various parts the volume also sharing between the two vehicles and future vehicles Bottom line we have turned estimates and targets into reality We have a clear plan in place for all the 1 600 components that goes into a vehicle Nearly all of the vehicle cost are now based on hard vendor quotes or contracts and support our previously communicated costs pricing and profitability goals The average car is made up of about 1 800 separate parts This includes some large components such as the engine which is inserted as a unit during the car making process but contains thousands of individual pieces itself From Google search https preview redd it zp0yomndiw171 png width 556 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0f3619849f16cbe513fa1983daea148a0cfbcbd7 We have over 200 people in the company and they re all of the highest caliber We do take a little longer to hire people because we wanted the absolute best Hiring definitely accelerated since January We added about 10 people per month in Q4 last year and 25 per month so far in 2021 Engineering is in a great place Now we build out sales and marketing talent and we ve already started to hire quite a lot of marketing people both here in the U S as well as in the EU in Europe And as you know California it is the best place to attract talent Now I feel really good about over 16 000 reservations One thing just to kind of give a little comparison when the Tesla model S was 18 months about 18 months before SOP start of production Tesla had about 3 400 orders we re about 18 months before SOP and we have 16 000 orders I think that s pretty amazing specifically if some people say there s a crowded market out there And on top of that particularly if you have barely marketed the vehicle we really start to ramp up the marketing in November when we show the car at the LA Auto Show where we actually have quite a few surprises which I think will add a lot of extra reservation and interest in the vehicle When it comes to our portfolio expansion we are fully on plan for delivering four different vehicles by 2025 As you might ve read it we had kicked off the PEAR program and completed a binding agreement with Foxconn This vehicle would be quite unique It s in great shape for launch in Q4 2023 as we are about 30 months out I personally think this is my best design work ever Henrik Fisker I think we will easily be able to sell more than 250 000 vehicles of that a year I will challenge anyone to show me a 37 500 SUV that even comes close to the Ocean Burkhard Huhnke CTO We need to own the relevant software stack the customer can see and experience every day like the user interface and the overall customer experience We want to pursue opportunities to monetize product upgrades and other digital data services And in order to accomplish that goal we need to number one own the PIPE that delivers the data back and forth from the vehicle We are building our Fisker software excellence centers with programmers and data scientists in San Francisco Silicon Valley and in India Geeta Gupta Fisker Our balance sheet remains extremely strong with 985 million cash and no debt basically flat versus December 31 2020 as 89 million of inflows came in from warrant exercises this incremental cash offsets our Q1 spending Our current cash reserves are sufficient to fully fund the Ocean program to start a production And to be very clear we have no need to raise additional capital in 2021 We are particularly excited about our cost position on batteries Once an agreement is reached on localized PEAR production we will share more details around our favorable position on batteries and our supplier partner I want to highlight the cashless warrant exercise we executed in March and April The choice to only allow cashless exercises mitigated dilution to our shareholders by 2 5 points and also signaled confidence in a balance sheet future spending plans and access to capital Finally we are very excited to have reached a binding agreement that Foxconn to develop a second platform FP28 with the initial vehicle launching in third quarter 2023 Our overall priority KPIs are number one a stellar product number two our bill of materials that underpins market leading gross margins number three started production on time and number four overall program costs and in that order of priority We also reported a non cash expense associated with the public and private boards I just want to remind everybody that our net loss totaled 176 8 million and 0 63 loss per share however excluding 145 2 million non cash non operational loss reflecting changes in fair value or convertible equity securities and embedded derivatives our net loss actually totaled 31 6 million a 0 11 loss per share As of April 2019 these public and private bonds were fully retired and being listed So we should not see any of this activity in that line item going forward We expect the balance of this year s aggregate spending to be roughly steady across the remaining three quarters of 2021 SG amp A should moderately increase sequentially due to higher headcount R amp D spend will be a bit heavy in Q2 and Q3 than Q4 due to timing of incremental supply ED amp T and a prototype testing and validation program We would expect CapEx to be somewhat lower in Q2 than in Q1 Overall I m extremely proud of the entire Fisker team for all the accomplishments we have in 2021 and the plans we ve established to execute a fantastic profitable product on time and on budget Q amp A How many parts are in this car Geeta Gupta Fisker Over 1 600 parts Adam that includes obviously all the systems and they may have additional substance but it s about 1 600 including subsistence Could you say the company is fully funded through launch of PEAR or is that a totally different situation now and we need to see how those capital commitments play out into next year We do not need to raise any additional capital in 2021 to either fund Ocean or PEAR As you know we took an additional 89 million that brought our cash reserves to a very healthy balance sheet of 985 million We forecast that or we gave the guidance today an additional 30 million which goes to operating expenses to the PEAR program So given the fact that we are leveraging our existing asset base we are on track for pear we re on track for Ocean So at this point in time we re investing 100s of millions of dollars in production tooling and equipment some of that you see in our Q1 numbers And a lot of this can be financed at a low cost in a variety of these in a ESG forward manner Number two we again have a significant amount of IP that s in both the FM29 and FP28 programs and we still have not evaluated whether we licensed them out or not Number three we control all our emission credits and there are opportunities to monetize these ahead of time if we wanted to And again I want to remind everybody my comments last time that capital markets continue to believe that electrification is the future of automotive I think there at least mentioned some additional deals for fleet in the Europe in Q2 maybe talk a little bit about those deals And are they some of those in the reservation numbers Yes so we actually hired a specific person over in Europe to pursue the fleet deals and we are pursuing the top 100 companies in Europe with a highest ESG goals that actually want to go fully electric And I think we will be announcing some interesting deals here in the near future It s a little too early to talk about it right now but I see an incredible positive trend because when you look at the European market in our segment of vehicle about half of all vehicles sold in Europe are actually feed deals and our vehicle is perfect position for that First on the Ocean any update on when we ll see or you will launch the kind of full configurator for all the trim combinations And then secondly on the FP28 anything you could share in terms of targeted range and performance for the starting price Henrik Fisker Yes So on the Ocean we are sort of waiting on still November because we got some pretty significant news on technology that we re going to show it on the Ocean in at November at the LA auto show So we have decided to actually make that coincide with our app and website update will you then be able to fully configure the vehicle colors options packages we ll announce details of specifications details of the pricing and everything is pretty much in line with our forecast So you ll unfortunately have to wait until November but it really is born out of the fact that we added some new technology features in the vehicle that we think is going to really put us way ahead of the competition so we don t want to show that too early When it comes to the PEAR program as I mentioned this is kind of a really revolutionary program In terms of investment the big investment will really start happening in 2023 and at that point Fisker is making a wholesome revenue Questions on chip supply and how Fisker plans to secure supply in that third area Burkhard Yes happy to take that The so called chip shortages it s a difficult challenge for the industry but its not really a shortage the result of the choice by the chip industry to repurpose capacity towards higher value consumer electronics chips and translate from low margin legacy automotive microcontrollers and let s say 28 nanometer nodes and higher So the general industries this situation will work itself out over the next 12 months But even if it doesn t we see a few reasons that will be less impacted than most if at all Let me explain number one we have the luxury of finalizing the concept phase for the Ocean the full knowledge of this situation to our own context in our own partners This allowed us to make design and supply chain choices that focused on needs to areas of supply chain if they need supply for chips For example we are in sourcing the weaker control module chipset through our partner Magna Another example is in displays we are also playing a short term in designing the components right now and sourcing semiconductors based on what is readily available So number two we always have plans in electrical and computer architecture that is more centralized We are focused on high performance domain controllers based on most modern SoCs So this is to the extent it s a general chat with a Mobileye vision systems the solid state for the radar sensors powertrain ECU 5G connectivity module and these chips are not in short supply Wikipedia Mobileye is an Israeli subsidiary of Intel that develops self driving cars and advanced driver assistance systems Mobileye headquarters and main Research amp Development centre is located in Jerusalem operating under the company name Mobileye Vision Technology Ltd So finally and probably most importantly in comparison to other startups is our partner network is Magna and Foxconn financially invested in our ability to satisfy demand We have two partners with deep influence and a vested interest in ensuring supply commitments for all components not just chips We ve always seen multiple instances where this has helped us Next question is do you have a definite date to begin production of the Ocean What s your plan to show early prototype version for the vehicle and what government subsidies do you anticipate We have very high confidence as I mentioned early in our Q4 2022 SOP next year in fact the actual SOP date is November 17 next year if you want to have an exact date And I m super confident supported by Magna that we will actually make that big Secondly we started initial deliveries both in U S and five key European markets also end of next year And then more importantly a full run rate production will happen in the first half of 2023 That s something that no other EV startups have done And I think quite frankly will only be possible with somebody like Magna in terms of demonstrating vehicles I mentioned already we ll show first production vehicles in November We re planning then to show it in Europe shortly after the beginning of next year And then in Q1 next year we ll actually get the first journalist and some analysts in the vehicles and drive them first demonstrate our vehicles and quite frankly both Burkhard and me we already drove our powertrain It s unbelievable the powertrain It actually makes you feel like a Formula One driver because we have some really unique electronics in this powertrain that allows you to handle this vehicle on the limit in such an amazing way I can t wait for people to try it It s unbelievable in this class so I m super excited about it Again remember our vehicles starts at 37 500 in U S Now finally in terms of subsidiaries we believe we are legible for all the subsidiaries that are available at least the way it is today And that includes in Europe And just to give an example in Germany with subsidiaries our vehicles will be priced to low 32 000 Now for anybody on this call you go and take a look at what d you get for 32 000 in Germany and that s including near that total which has sales tax in Germany which is pretty high So that s an incredible competitive vehicle And that s why Germany is one of the first countries we re going to launch in Europe as well and where we ve gotten a lot of orders from already a lot of reservations Fisker is now one of the most shorted stocks on the market Does the company have any plan to help protect shareholder value against short selling and manipulation Absolutely We are only thinking of long term shareholder value Now the challenge is there are so many new mobility and EV companies that are using the SPAC method to raise capital As we ve seen in the last few months and several companies along the way have changed their strategies or targets Now not only casting doubt on all EV players it is also putting everyone in the same bucket The only differentiator is execution and the ability of an experienced and dedicated company like Fisker to deliver quarter on quarter And we are doing exactly that Just want to remind everybody that we knew we needed to raise 1 billion And we did exactly that to de risk whilst we re not generating any revenue over the next few months Number two our original targets are still intact Our original business model has not changed We have not changed goalposts and are now based primarily on contracts not just estimates Number three we have kept true to our asset light business model in a positive way by signing two partners to be able to deliver the cars we planned for in our original filing which is why we have the ability to forecast updated guidance on the PEAR program Number four in 2021 our milestone delivery and spending very much on target with our guidance We are disciplined We are an experienced management team that knows what they re doing So credibility does not happen overnight And we intend to continue to put out our proof points that we re not part of this crowded startup inexperienced EV space And it is no doubt It will be reflected in our stock price in the medium and in the longer term we care for all our stakeholders and we are building the company for long term success Henrik I just want to add something what Geeta just said I know that there s some hedge funds that needs to go out and do some shorting but I actually feel sorry for the people who s invest in those because it s clear that some of those shorts they just are very superficial They don t have deep knowledge of how the complex the automotive industry is And I think if you spend a little bit of time understanding our business relationship with Foxconn and Magna you will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker but hey that s my opinion and I hope we can prove everybody wrong 2020 Q4 Earnings call 26th February 2021 Quotes Henrik Fisker Daily reservations rate up 400 sustainably since we listed publicly And we are now at about 12 467 total reservations I personally sit in engineering meetings starting from five or six in the morning to late at night And I do that because I want to be available for the team to make decisions right there and then with zero theocracy and that is really something that enable us to cut development time in half It also allows us to make technology decisions within 18 months before we launch the vehicle And that has already paid dividend in analyzing market segments improving range and acceleration state of the art ADAS which we call FI Pilot and then modern electric architecture In today s world locking the product 2 5 to three years ahead of time is just going to lead to obsolete products So our second priority is to increase the brand awareness and drive the next wave of reservation growth I m really pleased with the uptake we ve had in the reservation so far considering a lot of these reservations were made two years before we launched the vehicle with pretty much zero marketing dollars We did find out that a majority of the reservation holders are men And it actually is interesting because it allows us to make targeted marketing towards women because we actually think and I personally think that Fisker Ocean is also perfect for women So we are going to create some targeted marketing in certain areas which is normally very difficult when you don t exactly know who s interested in your vehicle or if you don t understand who actually have not ordered the vehicle and why not But those sorts of things we can figure out I would suspect that there s a good chance our launch will be just before November this year coinciding with the Los Angeles Auto Show Our strategy has always been to actually have several multiple partners talking about different platforms for different vehicle segments And we have announced the second part now Foxconn and we are in constant conversation with other groups about other very exciting projects And there s something of course that we will talk about when we are ready But it s always been part of our business model We will prove that we are serious about being on time as a startup and that s something that I personally will make sure I follow up on every single day in the company seven days a week Burkhard Huhnke ADAS FI Pilot the Fisker Intelligent Pilot is the first system integrating digital imaging radar and one of the first programs to use mobileyes next gen camera and chipset It s run on a single domain controller and integrated by Magna Electronics Speaking of connectivity the goal is for Fisker Ocean to become a mobile device We are developing a next generation electrical architecture centered around several domain controllers supporting the major subsystems That system is connected to the cloud by a 5G data pipeline developed by our edge computing team The state of the art collection and machine learning to analyze overall system performance to support predictive maintenance and over the air software updates to optimize range and performance And to enable new revenue streams by offering upgrades to features and functions and integrating third party services Notably the upfront investments we are making in these technologies go beyond the Ocean and subsystems like user interface FI Pilot and powertrain applies for future vehicles as well Overall I anticipate we will execute a sustainable SUV that truly stands out from the competitive landscape we see in 2020 And beyond and will be profitable at an affordable price Geeta Gupta Fisker We have laid out our 2021 guidance today And while actual results may differ from those we project these goals are my personal commitments to all Fisker stakeholders that I will work very hard and relentlessly to achieve We also completed the Volkswagen parts insuring agreement for the Fisker Ocean program last year As a startup we need to maximize the ROI on our assets Every day with my finance team I look at opportunities to make our cash go further and get a multiple return for every dollar we spend In that spirit we are exploring other opportunities such as monetizing a future emission credits or even licencing the FM29 platform to other potential partners Our Q4 results were in line with internal expectations at the start of the quarter Operationally the increase in R amp D and SG amp A expense in Q4 2020 versus prior periods were primarily a result of the Ocean program gaining momentum in Q4 At the end of 2020 we were 101 employees full time and as of today we are 148 While we cannot guarantee everything will go to plan we are highly confident that the many unknowns and risks that all startups face are more limited by Fisker due to our unique business model Q amp A So can you help us understand to what extent the MoU with Foxconn may change your 2025 delivery target If all goes well which I hope it will we actually could see us surpassing our original goal of 250 000 by 2025 I just want to talk strategically as we think about your growth over the next few years And the revenue opportunities beyond the sale of the vehicle and maybe specifically I was hoping to get an update on your latest thoughts on like the flexible lease model Geeta you mentioned some software opportunity that you re pursuing as well as well as are there any potential options for your customers to share their vehicles through peer to peer and other constructs like that just want to get a sense of those thoughts I mean in terms of the larger opportunity beyond the vehicle sale itself So the whole idea about our flexible lease is that we own the asset and we lease this vehicle out over probably from the beginning to the end of his life And it could be somewhere between 12 to 15 years And you could see let s say maybe eight to 10 people getting into this vehicle over those 15 years And if you imagine that the first person leases this vehicle and as they are enjoying this vehicle they re deciding to purchase some feature over the air for 1 000 and enjoying that feature They then hand this vehicle back let s say after two years we now lease it out to another person But before we send this out to for another lease for a slightly lower price we reset the vehicle to zero if you want which means if this person the second person wants to lease this vehicle then there they are again paying for that feature that we have already developed And that shows you the potential of selling a feature multiple times over the life of the vehicle of course also potentially upgrading this feature to give it even more value But it shows you the mobility revenue that is possible when we own this fleet and we operate the vehicle And we also think that our vehicles after four or five years will be way more attractive as a used vehicle in this lease form versus any other competitor because our vehicles going to be maintained by us the OEM And it ll be on the full warranty because we maintain it And that I think is really going to be a unique competitive advantage Geeta Yeah additional revenue opportunities as I mentioned earlier of course is emission credits which are clearly assets that we would generate we are looking at even potentially pre selling some of these emission credits And I think some other companies have shown that can be a great potential to generate revenue And as I also mentioned that there are opportunities for us to share the FM 29 platform So that s another potential source of revenue Another areas into a direct to customer and we have our own app where we engage with our customers on a regular basis we are exploring whether we should look at the business of captive insurance which shared risk with various underwriters I think the press release mentioned some ongoing discussions for fleet reservations Maybe you could share an update on maybe the size or timing around what we might expect around growth in fleets Yeah we see this as an incredibly promising market specifically in Europe because in Europe it s more normal than ever large corporations actually are offering their employees a lease vehicle as part of retaining or attracting employees And we have already we have just added a specific salesperson for fleet sales in Europe started a few weeks ago So that s something that we re going to go aggressive into and beyond discussions with several groups over there and I have high hopes for this because our vehicle as the perfect size in Europe is obviously built in Europe So I think this could be a very attractive avenue for growing sales for us Let s assume the MOU moves forward okay and it seems like that that process is moving fairly aggressively as is your motto to move fast But you d be running two major projects by the middle of the year or later this year with two separate manufacturing partners in two different regions at scale It s an amazing opportunity to take your technology and business model to scale to get jumped on competitors while managing the risk But I m wondering if your current capital base is set up to run these two programs simultaneously or whether there may be a need or opportunity to bring in more capital to ensure your financial strength of a partner during this important time of execution So can you remind us how you think about minimum cash levels as well Geeta And anything else you might give us Are you able to give us right now in terms of if the MOU moves forward how your projections of cash consumption by orders of magnitude could change this year Let me just start by saying that we actually already have started this program And the good news is that I m pretty low patent the company and I do close these jobs So that s a good start And so that s not a big influence right now as we re in the design phase But you re absolutely right eventually we re going to have to spend some money on this project One of the unique things I just want to highlight in this program is that Foxconn has committed to invest in this program And that s something we re going to be going into details over as we move forward But the program is on full speed we re extremely excited about it And a personal electric automotive revolution is something that I think is needed and really could change the market dynamics specifically if you talk about more mass market or higher volume in the right price segment and this vehicle will be priced well below the ocean And I think that s where the real opportunity is Geeta Gupta Fisker I want to confirm that I m a fairly risk averse CFO whilst we have a CEO who looks at very exciting products I am a risk averse CFO looking at a balance sheet and investments that give us the right ROI So first of all we have no debt We ended the year with over 1 billion we have a clean balance sheet So you re absolutely right how would you look at resources for two programs First of all we are looking at how we maximize existing resources in both the company Both the companies have existing IP they have existing capabilities and that s what the next few months will be spent At the end of these next few months we will clearly identify what investments both company needs to make Now let s talk a little bit about our existing balance sheet So today we will in this year we will be investing hundreds of millions of dollars in production tooling and equipment that we will own Our discussions indicate that these can be potentially financed at low cost in a variety of ways if we want to do that specifically for ESG forward company then again I d mentioned about emission credits that can be monetized Now both the companies are committed to investing It s not just Fisker investing And as we all would agree capital markets have decided that electrification is the future of automotive And once we achieve some of our key R amp D and production milestones if we see both the need and an opportunity to further bolster our already strong balance sheet we will do that in an efficient way I m thinking that there could be a battery shortage a very serious supply demand imbalance as we see EV demand and then the number of EV entrance promising such large volumes Now you ve got again you got to jump on this and I would imagine that Magna and Foxconn are two partners that if they tell someone we need the batteries is it that something you want to try to do But am I crazy From your lens Geeta or Henrik you think their battery shortage Where would you rate battery shortage risk on a scale of one to 10 And how can you assure us here that that s not a gating factor for you I m talking cell supply specifically as you know to make good on your SOP and ramp efficaciously So we have already nominated our cell supplier and it is one of the largest cell suppliers in the world that we ve worked quite a long time with And I at this point do not really see an issue for us for Fisker And the reason is that this supplier is very well known for both Magna and Foxconn as you said So it s not like either the three companies have to go in on a cold call there So for Fisker I don t see it as an issue Now can it be issues for other companies entering this space Possibly I also think it depends on how fast of course the EV growth is on each continent Now we have seen that for instance in Europe there is a lot of new factories being set up as well as in Asia I actually think the one that s lacking behind right now is the US And that s just talking generally about battery battery cell and battery pack production So we are already in discussions with our nominated cell supplier about setting up battery cell and battery pack manufacturing both in potential Europe and the US So it s definitely something where you ve got to have a tight knit relationship with long term in mind to make sure you have what you need Geeta you have a few things You re absolutely right by your sceptic because whilst we ve been talking to multiple battery companies they ve been burnt by many OEMs who haven t delivered on the volumes that they requested And as a result what we found is all the battery companies are very very selective in who they want to work with And when you want to have a capacity lockdown you have to have relationships You also have to have a desirable product that the battery companies will want their batteries to be in because they ve heard this story before that somebody wants to make an EV But fundamentally nobody wants to buy So it s not just the function of locking capacity but it s exciting battery suppliers bringing them with you on the journey making them believe that this will be a win win And of course there s only one company that s been able to do that and we are very confident we will be the second one Guys retail investors are important to us They make up a big percentage of our shareholder base and I solicited some questions we ll try to do some rapid fire so we can get back to the analyst queue But I m just going to ask a few I m going to start with one We heard you talking on social media about an IT center you re establishing in India can you give us a little bit more detail on that So it s actually not an IT center it s a Software Development Centre that we intend to grow With our source code in San Francisco Silicon Valley we re building up the software surveillance teams which will focus A on embedded software in the cloud domains and B on secure data pipeline from the cost of the cloud and C edge computing capabilities including machine learning in the back end of our Fisker Cloud And in India we will find all the additional smart talents and resources we need to further develop our software competences in these areas So from the embedded automotive operating system experts and programmers to data analysts and data scientists 10 K Key notes Growth Strategy Our first vehicle will be the Fisker Ocean an all electric premium SUV that is expected to have a starting price of 37 499 in the U S market before federal and state incentives are applied we expect to initiate sales with all of our currently allocated EV credits 7 500 on the first 200 000 delivered vehicles The Ocean will have at least three option packages with prices anticipated to range from a base price of 37 499 to approximately 69 900 for the most highly contented trim level We are planning to develop several unique option packages to broaden the market appeal of the Fisker Ocean including an anticipated extreme off road package which Fisker refers to as Force E The Fisker Ocean has many selling points that will set Fisker apart from its competitors including California Mode California Mode patent pending delivers an open air experience with the push of one button California Mode enables all of the vehicle s windows side windows sunroof and the rear hatch window to open simultaneously This feature allows for long items like a surfboard to be transported by placing them through the rear window without having to drive with an open hatch This feature will not work as well on an ICE vehicle as exhaust fumes could enter the cabin Extra wide track For the size of the vehicle and category We believe the Ocean s extra wide track will among other technical features give the Ocean best in class ride and handling while maintaining the same tire aspect ratios The wide track on sports cars contribute to a visual powerful stance and we believe this will further distinguish the Ocean s design It has also allowed for a more dramatically sculptured body side design and combined with the dynamic silhouette we believe it has achieved a class leading aesthetically arresting and emotional design Fixed hood Major electronic components have been moved under the hood to increase the interior space The Ocean therefore does not need a traditional opening hood where extra cost is spent on hinges and seals This means the Ocean has fewer cut lines in the front end of the car simplifying the design User Interface The Ocean features a large curved center screen with integrated haptic buttons We have done extensive design development on the highest quality UI to enhance the driving experience We believe combining a large touch screen with several haptic buttons provides drivers a user friendly interface that allows drivers to access the most often used functions while maintaining their eyes on the road Autonomy We believe autonomous driving technology will ultimately be regulated produced in high volume by a few large automotive companies and be available to everyone We believe it will be able to offer state of the art autonomous driving features through a partnership with industry leading OEMs and tier one automotive suppliers The Ocean will be launched with Fisker Intelligent FI Pilot which will deliver industry unique features and experiences including over the air updates The Ocean will be engineered with hardware to support future upgrades higher levels of autonomy and advanced driver assistance features delivered through post production software based updates Fisker and Magna are working together to develop an industry unique feature set and a suite of software packages powered by a scalable domain controller architecture We intend to equip Fisker Ocean with a class competitive suite of Advanced Driving Assistance features supported by a sensor suite that includes state of the art computer vision technology and digital imaging radar S olar roof The Fisker brand is a pioneer in full length curved solar roof design and integration into a passenger vehicle We believe that we can continue this leadership and will be providing an optional solar roof with state of the art PV solar cells The solar roof makes a strong personal statement for those customers that want to fully optimize for zero emissions and sustainability See Patents further below Vegan interior We are planning to offer a full vegan interior on the Fisker Ocean and there will be no leather or animal sourced materials available on any Fisker Ocean model Recycled materials in the interior Fisker plans to introduce carpets made from recycled plastic bottles and fishing nets from the world s oceans We are also looking at introducing several other recycled materials throughout the Fisker Ocean Sustainability We aim to make the Fisker Ocean the world s most sustainable vehicle measured by how many components use recycled materials the fact that we offer a full length solar roof option and the fact that we plan on using existing manufacturing capacity rather than building new plants In addition we will work with all of our suppliers to try to make them use the most sustainable manufacturing methods possible amp x200B Thus

possible for cloud computing resources to be used as a seamless extension of the computing power in the car Continuous software updates both for embedded systems in the car and functions hosted in the cloud let the digital car grow and become smarter over its lifetime E powertrain In future generations of Fisker cars we intend to utilize software to improve the powertrain performance making the cars more efficient allowing more instantaneous power output or improving the charging experience For example powertrain parameters could be tailored to each driver in real time based on driving habits traffic density road geometry and environmental conditions The optimal characteristics of the motors could be constantly measured and altered and the level of the recuperation system could be adjusted in real time On board diagnostics combined with predictive models and anomaly detection could guide the customer to schedule a service appointment before they even perceive any symptoms possibly averting a costly repair UX UI We expect that our EVs will always be connected Our next generation connectivity platform will enable the seamless integration of online services and functions whether unique Fisker services or from third parties Features that are visualized on the large center touchscreen or digital instrument cluster will meet strict driver distraction guidelines and will be rendered in high resolution through Fisker s custom UI framework The leading edge head up display will project useful information onto the windshield so the driver s eyes never need to leave the road The Flexee App seamlessly connects to the car ensuring the customer s digital life and driving experience meet in the car With data analysis cloud computing and OTA updates we expect the in car experience will adapt over time to the driver not the other way around as has traditionally been the case We intend to offer a combination of third party insurance and self insurance mechanisms to our customers to provide for insurance against certain risks including auto liability and physical damage general liability and products liability Selling not just the picks but the diamonds too Direct Sales and Service We intend to market and will sell our vehicles directly to customers using our proprietary digital platforms including the Flexee App and website This digital approach allows us to collect prospective customer data and improve the overall customer experience We have designed our digital customer interactive platforms to be both cost effective and increase the value proposition and competitiveness of our vehicles We believe we will be able to quickly build our brand on a global scale and retain our future customers through direct customer interaction In addition we plan to launch a unique miles style retention program which will include awards where our reservation holders and future customers can generate points that can be converted into money or put towards the purchase or lease of a vehicle This program is a unique rewards program that resembles successful programs used in other non automotive industries We are also planning to offer both financing and insurance of our vehicles directly through its digital platforms more key revenue sources We believe we can reduce the total cost of ownership for our customers and potentially generate additional sources of revenue by providing both financing and insurance for its vehicles We plan to keep introducing new direct to customer programs and services to further define our customer experience As described elsewhere we also plan to keep Fisker s lean sales lease and service model in order to be able to continue to offer great value to its customers regardless of the segment we enter Vehicle Maintenance An important element of vehicle ownership to consumers is maintenance and servicing We plan to offer a new approach to service that will result in less required infrastructure higher efficiency and significantly higher customer satisfaction Through consumer requests on the Flexee App or information gathered through on board diagnostics and connectivity vehicle maintenance needs will be designed to be identified proactively We expect that the vehicle will be picked up at a customer specified location and brought to a nearby centralized service facility This process will avoid the inconvenience that service stops at dealerships represent to consumers today Our vehicles will be designed to have no first mandatory service as our vehicles will not need such a service We expect service will be needed for mainly two reasons 1 a fault shows up in the on board diagnostics request to go to service or 2 the customer notices something needs to be fixed and service is needed In each case we will be alerted by either the vehicle s on board diagnostics or the customer and we will then pick up the customer vehicle at an agreed time and place service the vehicle and bring it back at an agreed time and place We expect we will eventually be able to conduct pick up and delivery without the customer being physically present using a digital key and a location map Our efficient service model will be performed in conjunction with select service partners We believe this service model delivers a better faster and more convenient customer experience We also believe this model drastically reduces cost as we do not need to construct and operate dealerships at which to perform service Several existing potential partners have already streamlined their service models and because no customers will be required to visit the service centers the service centers can be located in lower cost areas and be focused only on vehicle service and not customer reception We plan to have several company owned service centers for more technically challenging cases which will be strategically placed across geographies Vehicle Financing We intend to launch a non fixed term financing contract for our customers which we will call the Flexee lease The Flexee lease is inclusive of car use and maintenance We are working on options to add insurance as well We believe we will be able to offer a comparatively low lease payment due to lower capitalized costs lower depreciation and very low maintenance and replacement parts cost compared to traditional automobile brands The capitalized cost reduction occurs through elimination of the dealer margin usually financed in a lease a customer down payment and by including government EV incentives where and when available The lower and more even depreciation of the vehicle cost over its usable life results from anticipation of Fisker ownership of the vehicle over at least eight years leading to a smoother depreciation curve compared to a typical automotive lease where depreciation is front loaded into a three year term Additionally carefully managed residual risk through reuse and refurbishment of the vehicles will minimize wear and tear and extend the vehicle life and value We intend to offer branded financing directly to consumers We anticipate that the loan process and funding will be arranged through financial services partners in different countries Fisker Added Value Fisker brand design and engineering also encompasses our goal to build the world s most sustainable vehicles On the exterior of the vehicle we plan to install one of the largest automotive solar roof installations currently available This feature will be designed to have the capability to deliver annually the equivalent of up to 1000km of completely carbon free miles The technology behind this system is state of the art photovoltaic PV cells We are working with two suppliers that will deliver the PV panels and incorporate them into a uniquely designed opening roof See Patents further below The sustainability features extend to the interior of the vehicle where Fisker will utilize several materials that are at the cutting edge of recycling and reuse For example through the reuse of tire manufacturing byproducts We will significantly reduce the amount of process waste that would otherwise go to landfill We are also working with suppliers who recover and repurpose ocean waste These suppliers recover plastic materials that have accumulated in oceans such as bottles and fishing nets and reprocess them into automotive grade feedstock which can then be used to manufacture new interior trim fabrics and moldings In doing so we expect to reduce our requirement to source new hydrocarbon based feedstock while simultaneously providing an outlet for and thus supporting those suppliers who are investing in ocean clean up as an alternate source of raw material Fisker s Commitment to Building a Leading ESG Digital Car Company Our commitment is to build the world s leading digital first next generation mobility company We are building towards that vision with a commitment to a broad foundation of environmental sustainability and ethical governance policies Through this approach we believe we will create a company that can better serve the needs of all our stakeholders and ultimately deliver greater returns We are committed to leading the automotive industry in alignment with our mission From the thorough analysis of the full life cycle impact of our vehicles to creating solutions that minimize our carbon footprint and ensuring we responsibly source all of our materials Our focus is on the total environmental and social impacts of our business throughout our supply chain We seek to optimize our internal practices and build mutually beneficial relationships with the communities in which we operate We have set strong performance standards through our Responsible Supplier Policy including materials chain of custody of which we will validate We have aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals UNSDG s as a guidance framework and are using Sustainability Accounting Standards Board SASB requirements for measurement and reporting of our goals and targets Through dedicated work streams and detailed research with investors we are focused on providing best in class metrics and public ESG disclosures Our diverse management team and board of directors is a testament to our commitment to diversity and inclusion We will continue to evaluate our governance structure hiring practices and pay equity in accordance with our company policies and reporting agencies We have also created an ESG Advisory Council comprised of non company ESG leaders who will help shape our strategy our commitments and work with us to engage in dialogue with NGO s and other stakeholders on important civic issues Intellectual Property Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect its core technology and intellectual property We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights both in the United States and abroad through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and employees and we seek to control access to and distribution of its proprietary information through non disclosure agreements with our vendors and business partners Unpatented research development and engineering skills make an important contribution to our business but we pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding intellectual property As of December 31 2020 we owned 6 issued U S patents and has 14 pending or allowed U S patent applications and 9 foreign patent applications In addition Fisker has 13 registered U S trademark applications 125 registered foreign trademark applications and 9 pending trademark applications Our patents and patent applications are directed to among other things vehicle design engineering and battery technology See patents further below Emissions In the U S Europe and China there are vehicle emissions performance standards that will provide an opportunity for us to sell emissions credits United States California has greenhouse gas emissions standards that closely follow the standards of the U S Environmental Protection Agency The registration and sale of Zero Emission Vehicles ZEVs in California will earn Fisker ZEV credits that we can sell to other OEMs Other U S states have adopted similar standards including Colorado Connecticut Maine Maryland Massachusetts New Jersey New York Oregon Rhode Island and Vermont Fisker intends to take advantage of these regimes by registering and selling ZEVs in these other U S states ZEV credits in California are calculated under the ZEV Regulation and are paid in relation to ZEVs sold and registered in California including Battery Electric Vehicles BEVs and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles FCEVs The ZEV program assigns ZEV credits to each vehicle manufacturer Vehicle manufacturers are required to maintain ZEV credits equal to a set percentage of non electric vehicles sold and registered in California Each vehicle sold and registered in California earns a number of credits based on the drivetrain type and the all electric range AER of the vehicle under the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule Test Cycle Plug in hybrid vehicles PHEVs receive between 0 4 and 1 3 credits per vehicle sold and registered in California Battery electric and fuel cell vehicles receive between 1 and 4 credits per vehicle sold in California based on range The credit requirement was 7 in 2019 which required about 3 of sales to be ZEVs The credit requirement will rise to 22 percent in 2025 which will require about 8 percent of sales to be ZEVs If a vehicle manufacturer does not produce enough EVs to meet its quota it can choose to buy credits from other manufacturers who do or pay a 5 000 fine for each credit it is short We believe this will provide an opportunity for Fisker to sell its ZEV credits to manufacturers who do not meet their quotas European Union Regulation EU No 443 2009 setting emissions performance standards for new passenger cars in the EU as amended provides that if the average CO2 emissions of a manufacturer s fleet exceed its limit value in any Calendar Year from Calendar Year 2019 onwards the manufacturer will have to pay to the European Commission an excess emissions premium of 95 for each subsequent CO2 g km of exceedance per vehicle registered in the EU In the EU manufacturers of passenger cars may act jointly through a pooling arrangement to collectively meet their CO2 emissions targets The indicative average EU fleet wide emissions target for new passenger cars for the calendar year 2019 was 130 CO2 g km From 1 January 2020 this target has been reduced to 95 CO2 g km From 1 January 2020 until 31 December 2024 this target will be complemented by additional measures corresponding to a reduction of 10 CO2 g km Between 2025 and 2029 the target will be 15 stricter compared to 2021 From 1 January 2030 the target will be equal to a 37 5 reduction of the target in 2021 The European Commission adjusts the Specific Emissions Target each year for each manufacturer on the basis of the average mass of the relevant passenger cars using a limit value curve This is laid down in Implementing Decisions Manufacturers of passenger cars are given additional incentives to put on the European market zero and low emission passenger cars emitting less than 50 CO2 g km through a super credits system These are taken into account for the calculation of a manufacturer s specific average emissions Such passenger cars are to be counted as 2 vehicles in 2020 1 67 vehicles in 2021 1 33 vehicles in 2022 and 1 vehicle from 2023 onwards subject to a cap of 7 5 CO2 g km over the 2020 2022 period for each manufacturer Given that the specific average emissions of CO2 of Fisker s electric passenger cars will be 0 000 CO2 g km per vehicle registered in the EU this will provide an opportunity for other manufacturers which may not otherwise meet their specific CO2 emissions targets to pay Fisker to consolidate their fleets with those of Fisker via a pooling arrangement for CO2 emissions compliance purposes China The Chinese New Energy Vehicle NEV legislation is a modified version of the Californian ZEV Regulation The NEV program assigns NEV credits to each passenger vehicle manufacturer Passenger vehicle manufacturers are required to maintain NEV credits equal to a set percentage of non electric vehicles sold registered in China Each NEV sold and registered in China earns a number of credits taking into account factors such as energy efficiency and driving range Higher performance vehicles receive more credits capped at six credits per vehicle The NEV credit target is 12 in 2020 The NEV credit target is set to increase to 14 in 2021 16 in 2022 and 18 in 2023 The system also allows passenger vehicle manufacturers to use surplus NEV credits to offset corporate average fuel consumption CAFC credit deficits The policy creates a market for credits that will benefit manufacturers of electric passenger vehicles such as Fisker Surplus NEV credits can be sold to other companies and surplus CAFC credits can be banked and carried forward to help with CAFC compliance in future years or transferred to affiliated companies to help offset a CAFC credit deficit If a passenger vehicle manufacturer fails to meet CAFC or NEV credit targets after adopting all possible compliance pathways China s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology may deny type approval for new models that cannot meet their specific fuel consumption standards until those deficits are fully offset Strategic Collaborations Magna On October 14 2020 Legacy Fisker and Spartan entered into a cooperation agreement with Magna setting forth certain terms for the development of a full electric vehicle the Cooperation Agreement The Cooperation Agreement sets out the main terms and conditions of the upcoming operational phase agreements the Operational Phase Agreements that will extend from the Cooperation Agreement and other agreements with Magna that are expected to be entered into by and between us and Magna or its affiliates The upcoming Operational Phase Agreements referenced in the Cooperation Agreement relate to various platform and manufacturing agreements The Cooperation Agreement provides that we would issue to Magna warrants to purchase Class A Common Stock in an amount equal to six percent 6 of our capital stock on a fully diluted basis The Magna Warrants are subject to vesting as follows https preview redd it u9ds96h2jw171 png width 597 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 6c7e19f34507a8dccda071a15d296fbba56ecbca RISK FACTORS SUMMARY Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk Below please find a summary of the principal risks we face Our ability to develop manufacture and obtain required regulatory approvals for a car of sufficient quality and appeal to customers on schedule and on a large scale is unproven We are substantially reliant on our relationships with OEMs suppliers and service providers for the parts and components in our vehicles as well as for the manufacture of our initial vehicles If any of these OEMs suppliers or service partners choose to not do business with us then we would have significant difficulty in procuring and producing our vehicles and our business prospects would be significantly harmed Our relationship with one or more OEMs and automotive suppliers is integral to our platform procurement and manufacturing plan but we do not have any binding commitments from an OEM or automotive supplier to participate in a platform sharing arrangement or manufacturing activities and we may not be able to obtain such commitments We therefore are seeking alternative arrangements with a number of OEMs component suppliers and manufacturers which we may not be successful in obtaining If we are unable to contract with OEMs or suppliers on platform sharing and manufacturing of our vehicles we would need to develop our own platform and manufacturing facilities which may not be feasible and if feasible at all would significantly increase our capital expenditure and would significantly delay production of our vehicles Manufacturing in collaboration with partners is subject to risks There are complex software and technology systems that need to be developed in coordination with vendors and suppliers in order to reach production for our electric vehicles and there can be no assurance such systems will be successfully developed We may experience significant delays in the design manufacture regulatory approval launch and financing of our vehicles which could harm our business and prospects We are dependent on our suppliers a significant number of which are single or limited source suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our vehicles in a timely manner and at prices and volumes acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and operating results If any of our suppliers become economically distressed or go bankrupt we may be required to provide substantial financial support or take other measures to ensure supplies of components or materials which could increase our costs affect our liquidity or cause production disruptions Our vehicles will make use o flithium ion battery cells which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame We have a limited operating history and face significant challenges as a new entrant into the automotive industry Fisker vehicles are in development and we do not expect our first vehicle to be produced until the fourth quarter of 2022 at the earliest if at all We are an early stage company with a history of losses and expect to incur significant expenses and continuing losses for the foreseeable future Our EMaaS business model has yet to be tested and any failure to commercialize our strategic plans would have an adverse effect on our operating results and business harm our reputation and could result in substantial liabilities that exceed our resources Our operating and financial results forecast relies in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us If these assumptions or analyses prove to be incorrect our actual operating results may be materially different from our forecasted results We may not be able to accurately estimate the supply and demand for our vehicles which could result in a variety of inefficiencies in our business and hinder our ability to generate revenue If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements we could incur additional costs or experience delays We could experience cost increases or disruptions in supply of raw materials or other components used in our vehicles If we are unable to establish an arrangement for the sustainable supply of batteries for our vehicles our business would be materially and adversely harmed amp x200B NONE of these risk factors are unique to Fisker or present serious threats to their success share price They are presented here to be realistic and the possibility of failure is greater than 0 chance amp x200B Components of Results of Operations Fisker is an early stage company and its historical results may not be indicative of its future results for reasons that may be difficult to anticipate Accordingly the drivers of Fisker s future financial results as well as the components of such results may not be comparable to Fisker s historical or projected results of operations amp x200B Revenues Fisker has not begun commercial operations and currently does not generate any revenue Once Fisker commences production and commercialization of its vehicles it expects that the significant majority of its revenue will be initially derived from direct sales of Fisker Ocean SUVs and subsequently from flexible leases of its vehicles In 2021 Fisker launched its merchandise Fisker Edition where it sells direct to consumers Fisker branded apparel and goods While merchandise sales are not intended to be significant portion of Fisker s results once production of vehicles begins it will generate revenuepre production amp x200B Cost of Goods Sold To date Fisker has not recorded cost of goods sold as it has not recorded commercial revenue Once Fisker commences the commercial production and sale of its vehicles it expects cost of goods sold to include mainly vehicle components and parts including batteries direct labor costs amortized tooling costs and capitalized costs associated with the Magna warrants and reserves for estimated warranty expenses Related to the 2021 launch of Fisker Edition apparel and goods Fisker will realize cost of goods sold amp x200B General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel related expenses for Fisker s executive and other administrative functions and expenses for outside professional services including legal accounting and other advisory services Fisker is rapidly expanding its personnel headcount in anticipation of the start of production of its vehicles Accordingly Fisker expects its general and administrative expenses to increase significantly in the near term and for the foreseeable future For example the company expects general and administrative expenses excluding stock based compensation expenses refer to non GAAP financial measure discussed below in the year ended December 31 2021 to be in the range of 25 35 million as compared to 22 3 million in the year ended December 31 2020 Upon commencement of commercial operations Fisker also expects general and administrative expenses to include facilities marketing and advertising costs amp x200B Research and Development Expense To date Fisker s research and development expenses have consisted primarily of external engineering services in connection with the design of the Fisker Ocean model and development of the first prototype As Fisker ramps up for commercial operations it anticipates that research and development expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as the Company expands its hiring of engineers and designers and continues to invest in new vehicle model design and development of technology For example the company expects research and development expenses excluding stock based compensation expenses refer to non GAAP financial measure discussed below in the year ended December 31 2021 to be in the range of 185 205 million as compared to 21 1 million in the year ended December 31 2020 amp x200B Income Tax Expense Benefit Fisker s income tax provision consists of an estimate for U S federal and state income taxes based on enacted rates as adjusted for allowable credits deductions uncertain tax positions changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in the tax law Fisker maintains a valuation allowance against the full value of its U S and state net deferred tax assets because Fisker believes the recoverability of the tax assets is not more likely than not amp x200B Results of Operations Comparison of the Year Ended December 31 2020 to the Year Ended December 31 2019 The following table sets forth Fisker s historical operating results for the periods indicated https preview redd it x4uiy41bjw171 png width 593 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 2b30e160bfd8989c827d48af973c080e5d68cf27 General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased by 18 6 million or 514 from 3 6 million during year ended December 31 2019 to 22 2 million during year ended December 31 2020 primarily due to increased salaried employee headcount transaction related expenses of 5 million including 3 5 million in success fees related to the issuance of our convertible security in July 2020 and legal costs of 5 3 million General and administrative expenses includes stock based compensation expense of 377 000 and 30 000 for the years ended December 31 2020 and 2019 respectively On March 18 2021 the Board of Directors of Fisker approved effective as of March 15 2021 at the request of Dr Geeta Gupta the Company s Chief Financial Officer an 82 decrease in Dr Gupta s annual base salary from 325 000 to 58 240 which is California s minimum annual wage Liquidity and Capital Resources As of the date of this Form10 K Fisker has yet to generate any revenue from its business operations To date Fisker has funded its capital expenditure and working capital requirements through equity and convertible notes as further discussed below Fisker s ability to successfully commence commercial operations and expand its business will depend on many factors including its working capital needs the availability of equity or debt financing and over time its ability to generate cash flows from operations As of December 31 2020 Fisker s cash and cash equivalents amounted to 991 million and no debt outstanding Fisker expects its capital expenditures and working capital requirements to increase substantially in 2021 as it progresses toward production of the Fisker Ocean EV model develop its customer support and marketing infrastructure and expand its research and development efforts For example Fisker expects cash usage to fund capital expenditures and other investing activities to be in the range of 210 million to 240 million in the fiscal year ended December 31 2021 compared to 677 000 in the fiscal year ended December 31 2020 Fisker believes that its cash on hand following the consummation of the Business Combination will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this Form10 Kand sufficient to fund its operations until it commences production of the Fisker Ocean Fisker may however need additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other developments including unanticipated delays in negotiations with OEMs and tier one automotive suppliers or other suppliers supply chain challenges disruptions due to COVID 19 competitive pressures and regulatory developments among other developments such as the collaboration on Project PEAR Personal Electric Automotive Revolution with Hon Hai Technology Group announced on February 24 2021 To the extent that Fisker s current resources are insufficient to satisfy its cash requirements Fisker may need to seek additional equity or debt financing If the financing is not available or if the terms of financing are less desirable than Fisker expects Fisker may be forced to decrease its level of investment in product development or scale back its operations which could have an adverse impact on its business and financial prospects Not likely Cash Flows from Financing Activities Through December 31 2020 Fisker has financed its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and to a lesser extent convertible notes Net cash from financing activities was 1 028 million during the year ended December 31 2020 reflecting mainly the proceeds from recapitalization of Spartan shares net of redemptions and issuance costs of 976 million issuance of 46 5 million in convertible equity securities net of success fees of 3 5 million and convertible bridge notes of 5 4 million Net cash from financing activities was 3 6 million in 2019 reflecting mainly proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes As of December 31 2020 Fisker has outstanding public and Spartan Energy sponsor warrants to acquire 27 751 587 Class A common shares at 11 50 per share Any significant volume of exercise activity by the warrant holders would result in material proceeds from financing activities On March 19 2021 the Company announced that it will redeem all of its outstanding warrants the Public Warrants to purchase shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock par value 0 00001 per share the Common Stock that were issued under the Warrant Agreement dated August 9 2018 the Warrant Agreement by and between the Company f k a Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp and Continental Stock Transfer amp Trust Company as warrant agent the Warrant Agent as part of the units sold in the Company s initial public offering the IPO for a redemption price of 0 01 per Public Warrant the Redemption Price that remain outstanding at 5 00 p m New York City time on April 22 2021 the Redemption Date Stock Based Compensation Fisker recognizes the cost of share based awards granted to employees nonemployees and directors based on the estimated grant date fair value of the awards Cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the service period which is generally the vesting period of the award except for the capitalization of costs associated with the Magna warrants Fisker reverses previously recognized costs for unvested options in the period that forfeitures occur Fisker determines the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes option pricing model which is impacted by the following assumptions Expected Term Fisker uses the simplified method when calculating the expected term due to insufficient historical exercise data Expected Volatility As Fisker s shares have actively traded for a short period of time subsequent to the Business Combination the volatility is based on a benchmark of comparable companies within the automotive and energy storage industries Expected Dividend Yield The dividend rate used is zero as Fisker has never paid any cash dividends on common stock and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future Risk Free Interest Rate The interest rates used are based on the implied yield available on U S Treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award Long Lived Asset Impairment As of December 31 2020 our long lived assets were comprised primarily of 0 9 million 2 5 million and 58 million of net property plant and equipment operating lease right of use assets and intangible asset respectively Class A Common Stock

of production SOP 150 2023 I definitely feel 100 is possible by the end of 2021 if another EV bull run happens which is actually quite likely Many thanks for reading my due diligence on Fisker Inc FSR and I do hope you all thoroughly enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed researching this beautiful company and creating it I believe in Fisker s goals and their sustainability missions and genuinely hope they can achieve them all and more Even if you do not decide to invest in FSR I hope you will take a look at their social media pages and consider reserving one if electric vehicles are your thing I personally am heavily bullish on FSR and will likely continue to follow them through their entire journey for years to come I intend on becoming a proud shareholder and will do my best to support them Yours truly Nathan Neddy McLovin amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B References 1 https gigaom com 2013 04 17 a look under the hood why electric car startup fisker crashed and burned

squeezes of many companies the two front runners being AMC and GME they were the literal beginning of and were setting up the actual SHORT squeezes which are going to be never seen before numbers guys if we go back in time to February just about after the squeezes the hedge funds had just lost billions and billions after those gamma squeezes I say gamma cause compared to what AMC is about to do it is nothing and even after the squeezes they didn t even cover all of their positions which you ll see why this is the cause of the current mega squeeze they want to lose the least amount of money as possible so they aren t going to cover ALL of their shorts when the stock is still up around 5x to10x what they would ve owed just days before so they still kept shorting it after the squeeze and got it back down to around 5 per share NOW that 5 per share is still double or triple what they would ve owed before the squeeze so this scares them it would still put them in so much debt that they would probably much rather just not live with it so the only fucking thing they could have done was keep shorting the stock to get it down as least as possible to cover their shares as close as possible to the price they expected it to be at which was very hard to guess but probably around 1 3 per share The only thing that matters is that they didn t hit that mark and that absolutely fucked them not going down to 1 3 per share back after the squeeze in February is the reason we are going to see AMC in the hundreds or even thousands by next week The price not going to where they wanted caused them to be left holding a bag that they needed and still need to pay eventually the thing is there s no set date for when they need to cover so they can keep shorting it for as long as possible and try and get the stock down to where they want to cover the rest of the shorts they owed for the least amount of money possible which i believe was that 1 to 3 mark so they have been shorting AMC for months and have been doing so drastically since that February squeeze the thing is they have been the slightest bit successful and that s why we haven t seen the squeeze sooner AMC has been set to squeeze this whole time since February if it ran through 15 the hedge funds would know it would take off and this squeeze would happen then and there and they are trying to get this squeeze to not happen at all instead you see 15 being tested plenty of times within these months and when it got close the hedge funds had to short the stock drastically to not go rapidly through 15 we would have seen the squeeze sooner once it went rapidly through 15 However their success of keeping the stock below 15 had triggered them to believe it was still possible to get the stock down past 8 cause their new target price to cover their shorts was below 8 dollars So the fact that AMC has held within that 8 to 15 range and didn t ever squeeze has caused the hedge funds to keep shorting it for absolutely no reason other than to get it down past 8 and since it hasn t happened for months they had to short it for months WELL GUESS WHAT THEY RAN OUT OF FUCKING SHORT SHARES TO BORROW THERE ARE 0 SHARES AVAILABLE TO BORROW THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE you will not even begin to understand what this causes this means the hedge funds are having to cover all of the shorts they ve been purchasing since February which is essentially all of the short shares AMC has to offer and they cant borrow any so they HAVE to be payed for the thing is the hedge funds haven t even begun to pay at all like have payed 0 of what they owe and the stock has already tripled in just a couple days the brokers have all the leverage and control over the hedge funds and the hedge funds owe the brokerage and HAVE to pay they cant borrow shorts like they used to anymore cause they bought so much there simply is none left to borrow and it is completely insane and unseen before I know that no matter what AMC is is currently worth to be set up at hundreds of dollars even thousands I had bought in the middle of the last squeeze and have held a 15 per share position since February 2nd because I have know it has always been due to squeeze and there are thousands of people like me that have also known the thing is that if it were to squeeze before it would be on a much smaller scale than what is about to happen because the hedge funds would have had short shares to borrow now that there are none to borrow you guys actually don t know what this means for the stock you can expect it to make one big pull up and a massive sell off before the actual squeeze for those of you that understand this I know how excited you are but you also have to stay calm and remember how much manipulation there is and even if all the data and analysis is indicating huge gains it could possibly turn out to be huge losses If i were you guys id take your own time and scale AMC up to the Volkswagen squeeze in 2008 and see how fucking similar they are Stay safe
