lengthy DD on Palantir Technologies PLTR where I went in depth on my evaluation of the firm s history its financials and why I believe the naysayers are wrong Link included here https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lq8rw4 i think pltr is invincible rn and in the long run https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lq8rw4 i think pltr is invincible rn and in the long run i do recommend reading this first this post is meant to be a follow up supplement to my liking of this stock But I wanted to go more in depth into just why I find this company so special and unique As I mentioned in my DD last night I am just a 19 year old college student not an investment banker or hotshot market maker but I believe the information I have ascertained about Palantir by just scouring the web distinguishes it from any company on the planet but we ll keep it strictly to the software industry in this DD What is truly unique about Palantir s software Gotham Foundry Apollo is how collaborative scalable and advanced it is Let me break this down Palantir s software is COLLABORATIVE b c it meshes the company s clients data into a mega cloud For example the LAPD BP JP Morgan and top law firms all upload their data onto Palantir s cloud where they can get insights into efficiency efficacy and receive suggestions from the advanced software on how to improve their venture these guys are all PLTR clients btw and particularly useful for say defending an embassy or managing a supply chain Now just to get it straight there is no data cloud that can come ANYWHERE close to the insights and knowledge on what Palantir has You might often hear from Wall Street research analysts CNBC shills who complain that PLTR has too many rich clients big companies gov t But I think what boomers don t understand is that building your foundation amongst the biggest fish in the sea is quite the ADVANTAGE not a weakness Let me use an example from our beloved Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Invest s large position in Tesla extremely quickly I promise When asked about how she felt about Tesla s performance in the autonomous driving space compared to competitors like Waymo owned by Google she commented last year that having a vast collection of data would separate those who succeed from those who attempt As a reference Tesla cars all transmit self driving data back to the firm which comes about through the many Tesla owners who drive all over the world On the other hand Waymo is committed to private testing stages only which is shallow minded b c it doesn t have access to trial data on say congested roads Back to PLTR The reason I bring up the Waymo Tesla Ark example is to highlight just how many clients PLTR s revenue base represents and how impactful that is on a company s growth scalability and ultimately the success of their product But I mean when you think about it Palantir s clientele is the ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY SOCIETY Go to the Financial Times and try to find me an article that doesn t talk up Palantir s greatness in the U K and their work helping NIH EU members like Greece France also use it for COVID vaccine tracking Palantir has contracts with the Japanese South Korean governments Palantir has notably helped the U S catch infamous cucks like Osama Bin Laden to Bernie Madoff Quite the diversity The reason for that entire BJ to Palantir right there is to illustrate just how extensive this scale is Not only is all this data accessible RIGHT NOW to all these clients to collaborate on Palantir s platform but is comprised of the single most dominant and sustainable institutions enterprises in the world No matter how the political winds blow or how the global domestic economy winds up you can count on 3M the DoD Ferrari to name a few to continue seeking ways to scale grow expand and Palantir certainly is the way This gets back to another central bulletproof thesis surrounding Palantir Who are its competitors Who can do what Palantir does Let s start with Snowflake All credit to their talented team Warren Buffett and their gang of bulge bracket banks who underwrote their IPO and cheerlead the stock on media outlets on the daily But for lack of a better word their software just isn t dope enough I mean the UI contrast speaks for itself but the intelligence is what matters here Yes data warehousing is no joke and is certainly a scalable business but what kind of innovative insights can you draw from just essentially a digital warehouse that doesn t add any value All Snowflake really is is Salesforce dressed up in pretty bells and whistles Really makes me question Buffett s whole commitment to value C3 AI https C3 AI at least has me interested It seems like a real knock off version of Palantir based on what I can ascertain from their public materials but so what A bunch of washed up junkies from Oracle think they can lead the transition to AI Compared to a company that was seeded in 2003 specifically to work with the CIA and other intelligence agencies after 9 11 PLTR also called the gold standard by these agencies according to TechCrunch why waste your time in C3 AI https C3 AI or Snowflake Don t even get make me started on Splunk IBM who conceded they suck by signing on w PLTR last week or MSFT And while we re at it let s talk about valuations to drive the point home According to the Financial Times PLTR is valued at a 48B market cap and is trading at 34X 2021 estimated sales To start yes that is very lofty even after accounting for the recent sell off due to earnings lock up fears But I ll pick on my prime targets SNOW and AI if we can even call them competitors we ll be nice SNOW has just under an 80B market cap but is trading at 80x 2021 estimated sales AI is trading at a 15B market cap and is trading at 70 5x 2020 estimated sales That s fucking crazy and Buffett should sell SNOW immediately if he cares about value or he just doesn t understand technology Since the whole speculation is going to be about earnings in the next few years let s talk about that As I mentioned in my DD yesterday PLTR reported EPS of 0 06 share on a non GAAP basis which is TRIPLE what the street predicted But thanks to a 100M stockholder compensation expense the GAAP basis was a loss of 0 02 share and Wall ST took the opportunity to AMBUSH PLTR If you understand how business development works these incentives are necessary in the early stages of a company How else do you expect to attract top talent to the company and incentivize existing brains to stay But as you grow into your valuations like PLTR will why do you need to do it PLTR has essentially promised 30 growth for 5 years and earnings are on the way this year thanks to their earnings report Who does Apple need to incentivize to stay Wall St is simply trying to make something out of nothing I also mentioned PLTR was a direct listing yesterday unlike any of these other names here If you don t know what that means basically PLTR didn t have its IPO underwritten by banks or pay them massive fees in the process So equity research investment banking asset management and other areas of lucrative finance have no incentive to talk up PLTR just Jeffries it seems for now And this is what I mean Again as I mentioned yesterday it happens with all megacap tech companies Think about it as evolution Facebook Apple Tesla Google Microsoft These guys weren t oversubscribed by the money makers either nor were they cheaply valued either But by the time the robust top line translated into earnings these firms were worth hundreds of billions of with the snap of your fingers which is exactly what will happen with Palantir we are already seeing this their institutional ownership nearly doubled from 12 in January to 21 right now This is what I want you all to think about As a disclosure I am very long PLTR you can view my positions on yesterday s DD but irregardless of whether you will invest in it or not read about Palantir Technologies This is the company of the future able to tailor its cutting edge technology to all the intricate challenges the 21st century projects climate change further space exploration geopolitical nuclear tensions renewable energy adoption inequality police reform and so much more while providing a platform for all these parties to collaborate and improve Given the world is an ever expanding place and the dominant players are already seated at the table I could not feel more relieved or excited than to have all my chips in the one waiter who will serve them all This is not financial advice I recommend you read up on PLTR pour through its financials and hear more from its CEO Alex Karp and Chairman Peter Thiel then make your own informed balanced intelligent rational decision Without a doubt this will be the company being discussed in the decades to come and I just want to expedite the conversation now

are produced by machine learning models trained on past closing price data Essentially the models try to learn the underlying dynamics of the closing price and then project future closing price based on that They are by definition not sensitive to any company fundamentals or macroeconomic conditions To limit the effects of this limitation I am only showing short term price forecasts 2 weeks I consider these models to be performing automated technical analysis Specific price forecasts are almost certain to miss the mark but by looking at projected returns and projected price curves we can identify promising entry points and temporarily undervalued companies DISCLAIMER What you see below are the median forecasts projected by the model In backtesting evaluating forecasts against historical data these forecasts missed the mark by an average of about 8 with forecasts for larger companies being somewhat more accurate closer to 5 This is not investment advice I currently have 2

address you dumbasses who lump Rocket in with United Wholesale Mortgage Company and Loan Depot LoOk HoW LoAn DePoT aNd UwMc ArE DoInG MoRtGaGe CoMpAnIeS SuCk Listen you simpletons Rocket Companies OWNS THE ENTIRE HOUSING ECOSYSTEM From the Front end with their Rocket Homes business Zillow Redfin competitor To the origination of the loan via Rocket Mortgage whether direct to consumer or through their broker channel To their Amrock title insurance business which orders the appraisals and title insurance To their Nexsys Solutions with tools that allow for Remote Online Notarization enabling the mortgage process to be 100 digital And with their servicing business which allows them to think about their clients on a lifetime perspective rather than on just a transactional level As they continue to grow their entire housing ecosystem they are also leveraging their tech platform for other ancillary businesses such as Rocket Loans and Rocket Auto Link to all of Rocket s companies below https www rocketcompanies com our companies https www rocketcompanies com our companies Let s talk Rocket Auto Investors mistakenly think that Rocket Auto hasn t launched Yet It s true Rocket Auto hasn t launched publicly but it doesn t mean Rocket Auto hasn t launched Rocket Auto currently handles all of VROOMs sales marketing and customer service Rocket even powers their e commerce platform They literally run every part of Vroom s business except for the delivery of the vehicle If you look at VROOM s 10Q you ll see that Rocket Auto inked a 4 year agreement with VRM The deal enables RKT to receive up to 8 641 914 shares of Vroom common stock over the four year period in addition to a percentage of each car sold on Rocket s e commerce platform That s 430M worth of shares Let s not forget that Gilbert was a very early investor in Vroom 2015 so we don t even know how much he already owns See section of Vroom s 10Q below Paragraph in VRM 10Q On May 15 2020 the Company entered into an agreement with Rocket Auto LLC and certain of its affiliates collectively Rocket providing for the launch of an ecommerce platform under the Rocket Auto brand for the marketing and sale of vehicles directly to consumers the RA Agreement The Company will list its used vehicle inventory for sale on the Rocket Auto platform but all sales of the Company s inventory will be conducted through the Company s platform Rocket Auto is expected to launch publicly during the first quarter of the year ending December 31 2021 and during the term of the RA Agreement Rocket has agreed to ensure that not less than a minimum percentage of all used vehicles sold or leased through the platform on a monthly basis will be Vroom inventory The Company issued Rocket 183 870 shares of the Company s common stock upon execution of the RA Agreement The Company will pay Rocket a combination of cash and stock for vehicle sales made through the platform Rocket may earn up to 8 641 914 shares of common stock over a four year period based upon sales volume of Vroom inventory through the Rocket Auto platform As you can see above Rocket Auto is supposed to launch publicly this quarter and what would be a better time to launch Rocket Auto than on Thursday s earnings report A public launch of Rocket Auto coupled with a large financial partnership announcement this we know will happen and maybe even an increase in their buy back Can you imagine what would happen Jay Farner tried to warn the bears this is a stock you don t want to be short in His warnings was much warranted I do think Rocket will acquire Vroom why would they negotiate such a large stock deal Why wouldn t Rocket apply their 35 years of selling mortgages to the next most complicated transaction auto sales Regardless if they acquire Vroom or not it s clear Rocket will be a big player in this arena which will fit their lead generation and sales model perfectly Why is used car sales good for Rocket Because Data Data Data Rocket Plans to own 25 of the mortgage market and they will probably pull credit on an additional 25 who either may not qualify or may choose to go to another lender Rocket also pulls credit on clients who apply for personal loans via Rocket Loans Rocket can very easily have access to half of America s homeowners credit reports by 2030 The jackpot of consumer data What does a credit report tell you It tells you if a client has an auto loan or lease and when that lease or loan will be paid off This is extremely vital information that will allow Rocket to leverage their AI to cross sell across their platform Look at the biggest e commerce used car sales platform in America Carvana Their market cap is 50B Carvana s market Cap is 30 higher than ALL OF Rocket s 15 companies combined As I stated above Rocket s sales model can easily be applied to car sales If you read RKT DD part II link above then you know why Rocket would absolutely kill it in this arena given their strong culture centered around hard work and customer focus to the point of obsession Meanwhile their AI will analyze the millions of data points collected and will tell them where to focus their marketing who to contact when to follow up Executing these tasks may sound insignificant but when you have access to 25 of the world s credit reports this information will vastly improve their conversion rate Rocket is obsessed with improving their conversion rate which is why they invested 500M in tech last year their AI makes 1 million decisions per day and tells their highly ambitious army of sales people where to sell and how to sell in order to increase their conversions Not to mention Online sales of vehicles accounts for just 4 2 percent of total car sales We know millennials and gen z have been conditioned to want things delivered to their doorstep and they HATE being sold Can you think of a cheesier salesperson than a used car salesman at a dealership E commerce sales of care is the future This sector that has not properly used technology and there is enough market share for Rocket Auto to be a dominate player regardless of Carvana s presence Rocket Homes WhY BuY RkT WhEn YoU CaN InVeSt In A FiNtEcH CoMpAnY LiKe ZilLoW Dear smooth brain please download Rocket Homes on your phone and tell me the difference between Rocket Homes and Zillow I ll admit Rocket Homes probably won t be as big as Zillow and is currently only available in 21 states but I guarantee it will grow faster than them because Zillow has just Zillow Whereas Rocket owns the entire housing ecosystem and uses it to leverage relationships with realtors insurance agents brokers and lenders all on one platform Rocket Homes has already been used for the sale and purchase of over 750 000 homes I would love to see Zillow try and copy Rocket s flagship business the same way Rocket copied theirs Do you think Zillow could originate 250B in loan volume Maybe if you gave them a 20 year head start I also would like to see Zillow try to get into used car sales start and grow one of the largest title insurance businesses in the nation Amrock get into personal loans connect brokers lenders realtors and insurance agents on one app which can pull data from each streamlining the mortgage process Nexsys HOI Rocket TPO and expand internationally Lendesk Edison financial Not going to happen Yet Zillow is valued at 45B A whopping 12 percent higher than ALL OF ROCKET s 15 COMPANIES COMBINED Rocket s expansion internationally Rocket continues to show its unmatched ambition this time with its expansion into the Canadian mortgage Market which is valued at 800B We love our neighbors to the north but damnit is their technology lagging behind ours Some of these hockey stick wielding Canadian brokers are literally sifting through paper copied rate sheets in some areas of the country Rocket noticed this opportunity and launched a platform called Lendesk which ties the lender and borrower together in the archaic Canadian mortgage and allows brokers to match clients with an ideal loan within seconds Their market which is in a desperate need for an overhaul and this Rocket s Lendesk fits the Bill Unfortunately these dumbass mods won t let me post a YouTube video showing Lendesks technology in Canada To view this video you can refer to this same DD that I posted in r TeamRKT https www reddit com r TeamRKT Link below https www reddit com r TeamRKT comments lr2slx rkt dd part iii but rkt is just a mortgage company https www reddit com r TeamRKT comments lr2slx rkt dd part iii but rkt is just a mortgage company This international expansion along with Rocket s other ancillary businesses highlights the initiative Rocket is taking to further grow and diversify its businesses And they are just getting started Short Squeeze Originally RKT planned to go public with priced around 22 23 per share with 150mm shares but due to weak demand they cut the IPO price to 18 AND the public float size to only 100M shares Despite this smaller than expected float they still have short interest above 30 one of the highest shorted stocks on the market To combat this unnecessary shorting Rocket announced a 1B buyback currently their float is 2B First off who even announces a buyback when they ve only been public for 3 months This is unheard of Rocket s float is currently 2B so this buy back would cut their float IN HALF So if Rocket Auto a new financial partner and an increased buy back is announced on Thursday s earnings call then how the hell are these shorts 35 of the float going to cover Initially the short narrative was that the lock up expiration period would cause a RKT sell off like we saw with PLTR and FUBO But that didn t happen Gilbert owns over 75 percent of the shares and even he didn t sell In fact Gilbert even bought over 13M of additional stock at IPO in August that s how much he believes in this company Gilbert has a big ego so much that he even publicly slammed Lebron James after LeBron left the Cleveland Cavs which Gilbert owns Gilbert also owns Fat Head the company that sells life sized wall stickers of professional athletes After Lebron left Gilbert reduced the Price of LeBron s Fathead to Benedict Arnold s Birth Year Benedict Arnold is known as America s biggest trader See Gilbert LeBron Link Below https nesn com 2010 07 cavs owner dan gilbert changes price of lebron james fatheads to benedict arnolds birth year https nesn com 2010 07 cavs owner dan gilbert changes price of lebron james fatheads to benedict arnolds birth year This was petty of Dan but it shows he has a big ego that he wants to protect Just like Lebron these short sellers are messing with his ego and I m sure he s salivating at the thought of vengeance on this Thursday s call Thursday 2 25 after market close Fun fact even though Gilbert did this to LeBron and wrote a public letter to season ticket holders slamming James departure he was still able to get LeBron back on the Cavs a few years later and win an NBA championship Gilbert is a winner How else do you think he went from a pizza delivery boy to the fifteenth richest man in America See link below https www forbes com sites giacomotognini 2020 08 20 dan gilberts fortune soars to 496 billion making him the 15th richest person in america sh 1bbbac915000 https www forbes com sites giacomotognini 2020 08 20 dan gilberts fortune soars to 496 billion making him the 15th richest person in america sh 1bbbac915000 But why is Rocket stock still falling if they announced a 1B buyback If they truly believe in this company then why aren t they buying back shares at these these levels Answer because they likely can t buy back shares right now due to SEC regulations Allow me to explain According to the SEC a company is not allowed to buyback shares if it is holding material information that has yet to be made available to the public If a company does do this then they may be charged with a form of insider trading What is material information Material information is any information that hasn t been disclosed publicly and may impact the stock price once released What is Rocket s non public material information The announcement of Rocket s big new financial partner The public launch and plans of Rocket Auto This information is likely to be made public on Thursday s earnings call and may send shorts scrambling to cover with whatever little shares remain in the public float And to put fuel on the fire Rocket may also simultaneously initiate a buy back that is if there are any shares left for purchase Gilbert is the guy who publicly humiliated Lebron James for leaving the Cavs imagine what he will do shorts who are tainting the image of the company he poured his life into Say it with me now Rocket Bears are Fucked TDLR this doesn t contain even a fraction of the information in this DD part three or DD part one and two but this dude does a good job summarizing RKT s situation

ever made being in the last like 2 years it s all looking pretty inflationary When the rubber meets the road and the velocity of money actually starts in the real economy it s gonna look far worse I also believe that QE is trickle down economics by another name but this isn t a dead kennedysian punk rock manifesto That said inflation is a pressure on a number of asset classes one of which is bonds and their yields if the gov is selling bonds and the buyer believes the currency is being debased they are gonna want more yield Rates Rates r low as fuk They have been really low since 2008 and they got lower in the last year though they appear to be edging up Yes this is to keep the economy going with cheap money and it s MMT and Japan and ECB did it But there has been a great deal of criticism of it and I don t believe it s sustainable and this mixed with inflationary pressure also puts the dollar in a precarious spot where it s falling out of favor as being a primary international currency of choice at least there are rumors and likely pressures on JPow and Yellen about this Many people far smarter than I which isn t saying much think that the market is on a melt up and one way to perhaps contain this fire is to raise rates to get a little money out of the market in a delicate way They have been doing this gingerly and so far successfully as the market hasn t gone full panic despite what I believe to be a market in the final stages of a melt up due to the cheap money I think JPow et al realize that things are pretty fucking precarious and properly adjusting rates is playing with TNT Bond Bubble A bunch of smart people are saying there is bond bubble I agree But the point of this section is that I sorta doubt it s an explosive pop I have yet to find any historical precedent that is well researched of a government bond bubble pop not finding much on the one in the 40 s of US treasuries but it may have happened So basically it exists but it s not on it s own seemingly likely to be a case where you wake up and things are fucking flying Not like dot com 2008 beanie babies or grey market japanese used panties craze of 2005 Then again maybe there aren t as many speculators on bonds as there were in the other things Bonds aren t sexy Maybe the money in bonds isn t as stupid and doesn t panic and blow shit up the way the others do The concerns for my thesis Timing rates is over my pay grade I m not a bond trader I never was a bond trader and aside from econ in college and some study materials for the series 7 I know fuck all about bonds in a practical sense If the equity bubble maybe there is one maybe not pops first there may be a flight to safety in gov back securities which causes them to be bid up and thus not plummet if there is sufficient demand The Fed may go more ham with QE and buy more long dated stuff and also try to go full on yield curve control Folks have said there was a bond bubble since at least 2017 So maybe I m wrong Maybe QE and Modern Monetary Theory are right maybe there isn t a bubble and rates can stay low forever and I really am as handsome as my mom says Profit amp Fun So if I m right and please tell me if I m not cause I appreciate input from the autists there are different ways to trade this The ways that are resonating with me are TLT puts and TBT TMV calls TBT and TMNT TMV have pretty low internal expense ratios and aren t meant to degrade the same way more exotic stuff is so I don t think it s the same sort of retardation that comes with people looking backwards at a chart of VXX and thinking it ll go to 2million a share Plus with all 3 of these you can do options and as a degenerate gambler that s appealing to me I ve been in this trade for about 2 weeks now long dated puts and calls mostly LEAP calls on TBT at various strike prices under 30 and I have about 60k in it now so it s pretty yolo esque for a poor like me So far it s been pretty rad My contracts are up between 5 and 20 and have gone up during the last week of what s been red for the bulk of my portfolio Position is here Sorry no charts cause I m colorblind and I don t want to field questions about why the uptrend is purple and the down line is burnt sienna and it s not longer cause my ADHD is kicking in and wellbutrin that I m on isn t as effective as adderall I realized I left out something important for those even less familiar with bonds than myself If rates go up value goes down So effectively the bet is to short bonds cause rates are gonna go up amp x200B Not that I need footnotes but I ve been reading pretty heavily from Jeremey Grantham Michael Burry Cathie Wood Jeffrey Gundlach et al This is what I have divined from an array of inputs cause if I was that smart I d probably be in a better station than posting this shit on Reddit without 7 10 figures in my accounts

are our hero Has called the next crisis He posted a book on twitter that I will link here I have just finished reading the book The dying of money Here I will attempt to summarise why he says the end is nigh I read the book so you didn t have to amp x200B Unfortunately I need to first explain some simple economics but here goes Most of you already know many of this stuff you can skip a bit ahead This first bit is for all the new retards we have recruited amp x200B In order to stimulate the economy America and other governments by way of their Central banks print money They do this by buying their own governments bonds in the open market They sometimes as during the COVID crisis buy corporate debt too They actually literally buy this money with money they digitally print That money comes from nowhere They add a liability and an asset to their balance sheet and boom printed money Their intention is to stimulate the economy by reducing interest rates When you buy a bond you push it s price up which then decreases it s yield if that relationship confuses you here is an example A 1 year bond is trading in the market at 98 this bond has a par value of 100 so you can buy the bond at 98 wait a year and receive 100 A nice 2 98 2 yield Below fed buys bonds yields go lower amp x200B Yields fall as government buys bonds https preview redd it k5c2gmio6ej61 png width 554 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f2519e2a3c5964b329dda0de9e05d03316876656 If interest rates go down businesses borrow more money to invest and jobs are created because investments create jobs But if an economy is running at 2 interest rates then even investments yielding a meagre 2 5 would be invested in because they can earn the difference 0 5 Why doesn t the printing of money by way of decreasing interest rates cause inflation immediately Well actually it does It creates inflation immediately in stock prices The printed money doesn t go to your average citizen it goes to corporations who sell their debt to the Central Bank It goes to big investors who sell their government bonds back to the Central Bank because they can earn more in stocks this way They are clever they know a stock yielding even a stable 3 will earn them more than the current bond which only yields 2 amp x200B amp x200B Stonks go up when fed prints Relationship is dumb simple https preview redd it xvtnb39w6ej61 png width 553 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 093073729951c00917ffd9a974cb5974ba76c39b amp x200B START READING HERE SMART AUTISTS When does printing become a problem The central bank looks at food prices general household items petrol prices housing and other goods that the average you and me purchase almost every week Bundle these together and call them CPI Consumer price index inflation Inflation in certain goods Now let s imagine a scenario You have 100 people in an economy 2 people are stinking rich and the rest get by fine but don t have much extra to invest or save each month They use their savings to purchase mediocre goods a new bicycle or a new TV Why would they invest that extra 100 it s too little a sum to have any affect even in the long run on their lives Now we look at the rich they already have the TV the car a wife and a girlfriend and maybe a few houses Where does their extra savings go Straight into stocks And maybe a new car every so often Fine dining and other sorts of things which are not in the CPI consumer price index basket amp x200B WATCH THIS Mr Central banker comes along and prints an extra 1000 Give this money to the Rich man what will he do He already has the car he already has the houses He will invest it straight into the market Bam Stock market inflation stock market goes up This is what has been happening since 2008 you will see a graph further below that displays this process The extra 1000 does not affect the CPI basket The rich man is not going to suddenly eat twice as much or buy 10 more TV s The stimulus money from the Central bank inflates only the stock market Give this 1000 to the poor normal man what will he do He may treat his wife to dinner buy his kid a bicycle that he couldn t afford Fill up his truck Pay his rent It is not that he is wrong to do this this is most likely his best option A meagre 1000 in the stock market will have no effect on his life even in the long term The point here is that Central Bank Printing does cause inflation it causes inflation immediately in the stock market because that s where the money goes Only when that money spills into public hands Think stimulus checks does inflation in the CPI sense of the word unveil itself Inflation becomes a problem Inflation becomes a problem when it isn t accompanied by its good friend economic growth Inflation has an interesting effect of raising bond yields Investors don t want 2 bond yield if inflation is at 3 So they simple do this they don t buy bonds What happens when someone doesn t want to buy your house You lower the price No one is buying bonds Bond prices go lower and therefore yields rise Remember if no one buys the bond the prices go from 98 to 95 supply demand At the end of the bond s life you get 100 so the yield rises as the price falls The inflation problem occurs when the average man got his hands on some of that sweet government money The poor man was able to effect CPI because he will actually purchase goods in the CPI basket Give every poor man in America 1000 they will go out and buy from a limited supply of goods A limited supply of goods supply demand and prices rise Inflation CPI amp x200B What do we do There are basically only two outcomes to this scenario 1 If inflation in CPI caused by the average American s stimulus check opening of the economy increasing oil and commodity prices gathers momentum it will finally unleash the latent inflation potential of America Everyone who holds dollars or dollar denominated debt meaning every single country Will pay for America s inflationary sins Fortunately poorer countries who are indebted to America should actually benefit from this Under this scenario inflation will need to increase by this much look at red line in graph amp x200B amp x200B The red gap is the inflationary potential The inflation that has not yet been realised but it does exist and needs to be realised eventually https preview redd it zp2yb1r57ej61 png width 463 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3ab58d80429b169749c0d3b868007983fb5889f5 You can see that in 2008 the Central government began its shenanigans In a stable economy money supply should increase sort of in line with GDP As you can see above money supply has increased far more than that That gap indicated by the red line is inflationary potential It now basically just sits in stocks Under this scenario by my calculations money supply needs to come back down to real GDP The Central Bank won t do this They won t tighten That would hurt too much But the naturally forces of inflation will do it for them And prices in the economy will inflate to catch up with the money supply 2 Scenario 2 A highly probable outcome Japanification Japan has been doing QE for a much longer time than America The reason why they haven t blown up in an atomic bomb of inflation is because this money never reached the hands of the middle class or the poor So that inflation couldn t occur in CPI However inflation did occur everywhere where the rich were As it was them who had more access to this money America s Central Bank could by way of printing even more money buy more bonds and push down yields They could let inflation run for a little while and hope it doesn t gain momentum If inflation gains real momentum which it could because they are giving money to the middle and lower classes then they cannot follow Japans lead If inflation remains muted and low The real issues of wealth inequality will only persist and worsen amp x200B It is not to say that the managers of these governments are inherently sinister in their motives to conduct QE which disproportionately benefits the rich It may just be the only way they know And by human nature people would rather be instantly gratified leaving future generations to pay for inflationary sins amp x200B What happens in scenario 1 summary Inflation goes out of control CPI inflation stock inflation has already had its turn Yields rise Central Bank get s spooked and tries to raise rates a little Economy tanks due to raised rates 6 months later or maybe a year later and the currency has found equilibrium by depreciating around 70 relative to the price of real goods not relative to the price of other currencies Or the currency has found equilibrium because they removed that money from the system highly unlikely Stocks fall because yields rose And everyone has the next best opportunity to invest into the stock market amp x200B What happens in scenario 2 summary Inflation rises a bit due to stimulus checks Central bank remains unconvinced that inflation will gain momentum If inflation does not gain momentum the Central Bank will continue to print until they see GDP growth Stocks go up but until the wealth gap is too extreme and a revolution takes place This could take 10 years or 100 years amp x200B amp x200B Inflation only becomes a problem when the poor get to buy normal goods that exist in the CPI https preview redd it

This basically explains why losers lose and winners win The moves that some of you make almost feels natural expected by wallstreet Its as if they can predict your future moves But what if I told you you there was a solution to all of this Stay tuned tomorrow for the sequel my part 4 the prisoner of askforaplan Self sabotage Trading is a very hard game A trader who wants to be successful in the long run has to be very serious about what he does He cannot afford to be naive or to trade because of some hidden psychological agenda The markets are unforgiving and emotional trading always results in losses Freud believed that gambling was universally attractive because it was a substitute for masturbation We fail in our professional personal and business affairs not because of stupidity or incompetence but to fulfill an unconscious wish to fail It hurts to look within yourself for the cause of your failure We sabotage ourselves by acting like impulsive children rather than intelligent adults Trading is the most dangerous human endeavor short of war Buying at the high point of the day is like swinging your car door open into the traffic When your buy order reaches the floor traders rush to sell to you to rip your door off along with your arm Most people go through life making the same mistakes at sixty that they made at twenty Others structure their lives to succeed in one area while acting out internal conflicts in another Very few people grow out of their problems You need to be aware of your tendency to sabotage yourself Stop blaming your losses on bad luck or on others and take responsibility for the results Start keeping a diary a record of all your trades with reasons for entering and exiting them Look for repetitive patterns of success and failure Those who do not learn from the past are condemned to repeat it You need a psychological safety net the way mountain climbers need their survival gear Strict money management rules also pro vide a safety net Your feelings have an immediate impact on your account equity You may have a brilliant trading system but if you feel frightened arrogant or upset your account is sure to suffer When you recognize that a gambler s high or fear is clouding your mind stop trading Your success or failure as a trader depends on controlling your emotions Markets evoke powerful greed for more gains and a great fear of losing what we ve got Those feelings cloud our perceptions of opportunities and dangers Most amateurs feel like geniuses after a winning streak It is exciting to believe that you are so good you can bend your own rules and succeed That s when traders deviate from their rules and go into a self destruct mode Profits make traders feel powerful and give them an emotional high They try to get high again put on reckless trades and give back their profits They die as traders after hitting rock bottom and wash out of the markets The few survivors realize that the main trouble is not with their methods the trouble is with their thinking They can change and become successful traders You needs to change how you thinks and feels how you relates to yourselves and others Successful traders if they take several losses in a row they take that as a signal that something is wrong It is time to stop and rethink their analysis methods Losers feel the urge to trade just as alcoholics feel the urge to drink They make impulsive trades go on trading binges and try to trade their way out of a hole Like alcoholics washing glasses at a bar Soon you will see them sucking dick behind a shell gas station Most losers hide their losses from themselves and from everyone else They keep shuffling money keep poor records and throw away brokerage slips A loser is like an alcoholic who does not want to know how many ounces of liquor he drank A loser never knows why he loses If he knew he would have done something about it and become a winner He keeps trading in a fog You have to change how you think in order to stop losing and begin your recovery as a trader losers grow desperate and converts outright positions into spreads doubles up on losing positions reverses and trades in the opposite direction and so on He still loses We spend our lifetimes building up self esteem Most of us have a high opinion of ourselves It hurts a smart and successful person to hit rock bot tom Your first impulse may be to hide but remember you are not alone Almost every trader has been there Brokerage records indicate that 90 out of 100 people trading today will probably be gone from the markets a year from now They will hit rock bottom crumble and leave They will try to forget trading as they would a bad dream Read the books written by Dr Alexander Elder Edit1 for those of you who dont know

why I think GSAT is a big deal There are a lot of people who understand the company better than I do but I really think this is worth looking seriously at and its up a little bit today so here s my first stab at DD Be advised I m not a sat com expert nor is this investment advice and I really have no Idea what I m doing here Also I should say Price Targets for GSAT range wildly I ve seen targets over 200 per share floated around with some pretty impressive analysis behind it but more conservatively I m in line with suggestions it COULD be 30 50 if and when all goes well in a very optimal scenario and it seems there s a much broader consensus on a 7 to 10 target in the near term GSAT owns c band and s band spectrum which with the push to 5G and Internet of Things has suddenly become incredibly valuable Recent FCC auctions will attest to this For years GSAT was waiting for FCC authorization on that spectrum but by the time they got it they had issues with debt and investors were wary to jump in without a clear Monetization plan for their spectrum The heavy debt situation has since been resolved giving them enough of a cash runway to continue in for the next three years Their business model during most of the past decade involved satellite phones and gps tracking which with their aging satellites and limited market for that kind of stuff was never meant to do much more than keep the lights on while they waited for the value of their spectrum to appreciate Their share price languished under 1 for a long time until 2021 when a couple things started to shift They partnered with Nokia to set up a secure redundant 5G node for the port of Seattle with more similar collaborations likely down the line Then most recently QCOM announced that their x65 next generation snapdragon modem which is the most popular smartphone modem in the world will connect to the n53 band specifically GSAT owns this band of spectrum nobody else QCOM obviously did that for a reason but as of now there s no widespread usage of that spectrum as it s not really being used except by GSAT SPOT devices and phones which is to say hardly at all Exactly what that means for GSAT is unclear but what it does mean is that within a few years millions of devices around the world will have the ability to connect to their spectrum There s a lot of DD out there breaking down price targets but the truth is nobody knows and the CEO and other execs have shown an incredible amount of patience and personal investment in terms of allowing their spectrum assets to appreciate while putting their own money on the line to keep things afloat over the years Starlink AT amp T Verizon should all be interested in buying and have probably all made offers or overtures but GSAT has not bitten even when they needed the money Which also suggests that the company is not interested in a sale And indeed leasing the spectrum might be far more lucrative than an outright sale and better for shareholders I won t bother describing the different possible monetization strategies here as I ve linked to a report published by Nokia at the bottom of this post that does a much better job than I could GSATs spectrum is sometimes compared to a large swath of undeveloped beachfront property in the middle of South Beach completely clean and unsullied in the middle of an increasingly crowded and frenzied space They look like a penny stock at first glance but they are far from it and it may be the ultimate 5G play You might ask What about Musk s Starlink Aren t they going to eat GSAT s lunch EDIT This is better addressed in a comment by u squishjonesjr Starlink use Ku band for their user terminal links and Ka for the gateway links they wont need any spectrum in C band Also doubt they would purchase spectrum to ensure others cant use it their main focus is not going bankrupt Their initial constellation will cost 10B and could be much higher if more sats are needed filed for up to 15k sats Not to mention their gen 1 sats have a useful life of 5 years so they will have to replace those soon after service start u squishjonesjr Starlink probably doesn t need GSAT spectrum and for our purposes GSAT is not really in competition with Starlink as their current business model which will be affected by Starlink is not the source of the stocks theoretcal valuation but if someone DID want to compete with Starlink they would need to access GSAT assets Which is another reason why Starlink might need to get there first not because they need it but because they dont want anyone else to have it Starlink is a possible buyer for GSAT not for their satellites but for their spectrum The value of GSAT is NOT in its satellites or the ground units its in the spectrum DISH is another possible buyer for GSAT Some people point to debt issues with GSAT It s true the company has diluted its shares quite a bit to remain solvent over the years but they currently have enough cash on hand to give them a three year runway It would make ZERO sense for another offering to occur BEFORE a major monetization event for the spectrum and since this is 5G that monetization event is going to happen WELL before they run out of cash Another issue often raised The FCC can just seize spectrum and reallocate it if they want that s what happened to insert late 90 s early 2000 s Sat company here These other companies from what I understand had major issues with solvency and so they basically went to the FCC to see what kind of deal they could get if they surrendered it to be reallocated BTW I ve learned that the correct way to talk about spectrum is not as something that GSAT owns or holds but as something they currently control Seems Risky Betting on the value of Globalstar spectrum WAS a risky play but now that QCOM has legitimized the value of the n53 band albeit not explicitly or specifically in terms of eventual use case by including it in the next gen snapdragon s connectivity ability the risk associated with the play has diminished a great deal The bear case of the QCOM aspect of all this is that including n53 connectivity is more of a marketing trick than something they imagine will actually get used but given that n53 is extraordinarily underutilized at this point even that scenario implies that QCOM expects to see expanded usage of that band in the short term Also I thought it was interesting that Nokia would publish this on their website https www nokia com blog case globalstar 6 ways leverage spectrum asset https www nokia com blog case globalstar 6 ways leverage spectrum asset From Nokia Nokia customer Globalstar Inc a U S based provider of mobile satellite voice and data services is in the enviable position of having 2 4 GHz spectrum that works everywhere meaning it has been globally allocated 2 4 GHz spectrum is in the sweet spot from a physics perspective because it s good for both coverage and capacity Although it s not yet a 3GPP standardized spectrum band it has been approved by the Federal Communications Commission and recently in other countries It s remarkably clean meaning it s clear has no co channel interference and provides network benefits for both indoor and outdoor deployments Globalstar turned to Nokia to help determine the band characteristics for its available spectrum and identify potential application options Nokia s Network Planning and Optimization NPO team conducted a small cell network study of Globalstar s 2 4 GHz spectrum as compared to a similar HetNet network in 2 1 GHz The study proved the versatility of Globalstar s spectrum showing that operators with a small cell network could benefit from Globalstar s clean spectrum while those without small cell networks could benefit from its huge capacity In our study Globalstar s spectrum outperformed outdoor small cell deployments by 20 while requiring 33 less infrastructure For indoors in an urban office environment we were able to deploy approximately half the access points required since the band has no interference from macro towers operating in the same frequency The full report can be seen here The team went a step further to also provide six business model options for Globalstar to consider We were excited to work with Nokia s NPO experts to help determine how to best monetize and maximize the use cases of our spectrum asset so we can deliver the highest quality experience to the end users said Jay Monroe chairman and CEO of Globalstar 6 ways to monetize amp maximize the spectrum 1 Lease the spectrum to incumbent operators This provides extra capacity for operators and uses their own RAN equipment and services Operators can use clean spectrum without incumbrance and it supports standard capabilities like Carrier Aggregation roaming and redirection For Globalstar this is a simple revenue model without any operational burdens 2 Dedicated in building small cell spectrum The analysis clearly shows the difficulties presented by macro interference to small cell deployments Offering a dedicated clean spectrum band would dramatically improve the performance of these HetNets and significantly reduce the cost to deploy them Globalstar could lease the spectrum to one carrier nationwide or carriers in geographic regions that wanted to reduce the strain on their expensive macro tower infrastructure 3 Use the spectrum as a satellite service enhancement By deploying RANs in Globalstar s high use areas such as air terminals shipping ports military bases or cargo handling facilities Globalstar can both provide satellite offload and support high data rates and advanced applications Enhanced services are provided to customers where they normally congregate and for these customers there is a layer of satellite redundancy in the event of disruptions in terrestrial networks 4 Lease spectrum for private LTE systems to non carriers Cable companies are increasingly interested in pursuing wireless services themselves Globalstar s spectrum provides an opportunity to add a private LTE network on top of their dense cable plant Alternatively as the in building networks are further developed there may be an opportunity to include Globalstar s band as a private LTE service on top of neutral host models 5 Directly provide private services to enterprises By offering private LTE systems directly to enterprises Globalstar provides spectrum equipment and services to end user customers which provides direct control over the user experience and maximizes private LTE system revenue opportunities These deployments of Globalstar s spectrum could be done while several of these other options are pursued simultaneously 6 Mass market product enablement licensing Globalstar could license spectrum to ODM manufacturers for use in mass market This would include unrestricted use and products distributed globally This option could address the Internet of Things or Connected Car markets No matter what Globalstar decides to do Nokia will be there to partner with them in the U S and around the world We are also lending our support to the 3GPP standardization process and equipment manufacturing enablement which are critical for the spectrum s success

GAME DEVELOPER I make games for fun and do not actually work at SEARS Not financial advice I have been seeing posts about SEARS going public on March 10th and I am ecstatic because I truly believe that it will blow up I have been a part of the SEARS community for quite some time and know all the ins and outs of how it works Another person and I have developed 3 SEARS games that average a mediocre number of 500 players in total during good times of the day Let me tell you the games are absolute dog shit but people still play it and spend money on it It wasn t easy to make as scripting is quite hard and I m retarded but the games are so bad yet children still play it amp x200B won t be sharing what those games are for privacy reasons and don t know the extent of whether or not I can get in trouble amp x200B How much I made in about the span of a month during Christmas time CAD https preview redd it ovggqn966fj61 png width 750 amp format png amp auto webp amp s eedab7e5b3efb80c2346643124eae3245e4f97f9 amp x200B As you can see that is a respectable amount of money considering I split the profits 50 50 and haven t updated the game in literal months Kids spend stupid amounts of money on this platform You might be thinking that it isn t that impressive but oooh boy I m just getting started But first let me get into the details of how SEARS actually works because it doesn t seem like many people understand it amp x200B How SEARS works SEARS makes money from people spending money on their membership called Premium or from people buying their in game currency called Robux Using the Robux players can buy items from the catalogue whether it s shirts gear or hats accessories They can also buy in game powerups for different games Everything is community made from the hats and accessories to shirts and games SEARS used to be the only one able to make hats but recently has implemented a system where you can apply to be able to make hat accessory models SEARS has made a few games for sponsorships but they are usually worse than the player made ones Now for how people make money SEARS has a system called DevEx aka Developer Exchange where developers convert their Robux into actual real life currency The currency exchange rate is 0 0035 USD Robux There are some restrictions like not being able to exchange Robux that was bought with your own money or not being able to exchange Robux that was made from trading For more info visit https en help roblox com hc en us articles 203314100 Developer Exchange DevEx FAQs https en help roblox com hc en us articles 203314100 Developer Exchange DevEx FAQs Basically when someone purchases something you made you get Robux from it but SEARS takes a pre determined of the Robux spent and sends it into the void so that they don t have to pay you as much if you DevEx This number is usually 30 SEARS isn t just a game it s an entire fucking economy SEARS is interesting because unlike traditional online development you don t have to pay money to keep up servers You can make anything that you want granted that it s not against TOS for absolutely free Now for the juicy stuff This will not only dwarf my puny numbers but will also show how big and how much bigger SEARS is planning to be One thing that I have seen is people talking about how much top SEARS developers make and the numbers are usually around 40k a month While it depends on how top you are talking about let me just give you an example of how much SEARS developers make In 2019 a single SEARS developer made 50 million USD Not only that but a single game has hit 1 6 million concurrent players A single game I got all of this information from the 2020 SEARS Developer Conference https blog roblox com 2020 07

coming soon that will boost players is updates to the game development engine called Studio SEARS is constantly made fun of for having shitty games and granted that s not wrong but there are quite a few really good games out there that look pretty nice With the new updates coming games will look better than ever Here s a look at what the new terrain materials and textures will look like They don

aspirations for the company which is why I will be going balls deep into SEARS stock when it goes public Also I have no idea why everyone s calling it SEARS Edit I now know why people are calling it

emoji stonks F,This is not advice I have no idea what I m talking about I went to a D tier state school and got a C in accounting II Please do your own research and don t come knocking at my door when you don t make gamestop money on Ford Also this is my first DD after lurking for years so please be as mean as possible Edited for formatting So we all know that EVs are the future and that someday we are all going to be driven around in Teslas so you could dismiss the legacy automakers as boomer shit stuck in the past but I think that the market has over corrected for this and overlooked a couple things Ford has been stealthily morphing into a tech centric automaker Ford s fundamentals are still really solid Ford s new management team gets it I ll go into detail into each below Here are some ford financials from Yahoo finance to set up some context https finance yahoo com quote F key statistics p F Forward P E 10 53 P S 0 36 Mkt Cap 46B Factor 1 Ford understands where the auto market is going A couple years ago when Ford announced that they were going to stop producing sedans for the US market I thought they were smoking crack Sedans still represent a thicc market segment But nah they kept around the high margin trucks and suvs and let GM Honda Toyota have the dwindling US sedan market so that they could focus their resources on developing next gen products And some of those are finally here and they are legit actually pretty good The Mach E 42k 300mi range 3 5 second 0 60 Fast charging Not quite Tesla good yet but damn close This is a legit viable product and you don t get any of the Tesla customer service issues If you factor in the 7500 federal tax credit it s cheaper than a Model Y Electric F150 coming soon best selling truck in America getting an EV version It s going to be good too The legit info on this car is coming later this year most likely and it s going to be solid They ve already demoed it pulling a million pounds which is BS because it was on rails so doesn t count so we don t get a real tow cap number yet but we know it s yoked And it s going to look like a real truck so they can capture the whole toxic masculinity but my wife cares about climate change market They own part of Rivian Rivian gonna be dope af and if they can leverage Ford s manufacturing experience they could potentially skip a large part of the painful production ramp up that Tesla went through And Ford gets paid in the process and gets access to the tech Rivian develops Tesla s PE is like fucking 200 That s how wall street values tech companies and innovation companies Share price is gonna go ape once the analysts figure out that Ford is a tech company that is merely funded by a legacy automaker dinosaur Factor 2 Ford s leadership gets it Meet Jim Farley He s like Jim Hackett but palatable to the shareholders What does he care about Yeah autonomous tech and EVs Would you prefer he be focusing Ford s attention elsewhere Didn t think so https www cnbc com 2020 10 01 new ford ceo jim farley announces restructuring and executive shakeup html Bear Case Ford s Fundamentals Alone Under Price it They Make Cars People Actually Want Lord Elon told God Conduit Cathie Wood on her podcast it s on Youtube but I can t link it search for Elon Cathie Wood Podcast and it s at 3 30 that EVs sales will comprise 1 3 of global auto sales by 2023 2025 That s crazy growth given that EVs were about 2 of US sales last year I know not fair to compare US to world but it s not the main point just context If that growth rate holds we re looking at like 8 10 more years of ICE vehicle sales Which ICE vehicles do Americans like That s right fucking TRUCKS and SUVs the exact vehicles that are Ford s bread and butter The F 150 is the best selling vehicle in America and has been for years This vehicle segment is super margin the average sale price of an F150 is over 40k according to CarGurus https www cargurus com Cars price trends Ford F 150 d337 People pay stupid money for these things and Ford will be happy to accommodate them So let s assume that my thesis above is incorrect and Ford has no future in the EV space and will do nothing milk the dying ICE Truck Yeah market until the day they hit insolvency How could we value them then Fortunately such a car maker actually exists and it s called fucking Fiat Chrysler They Yolo d everything into the Murica Fuck Yeah market segment and will literally sell you a Hellcat powered anything only car they make that doesn t have a V8 option is the fucking Pacifica a minivan These guys are lunatics and pre Peurgot merger had absolutely no plan for adapting to the future of the auto market except for buying gas mileage credits from Tesla Let s compare their stats to Ford from above https finance yahoo com quote FCAU VI key statistics p FCAU VI Forward P E 5 78 P S 0 24 Mkt cap 42B So the market is literally pricing Ford right now quite similarly to Fiat Chrylser Ask yourself who s future strategy makes more sense If Ford fucked up literally everything going forward I think their valuation makes sense But if they have just a few product successes in the new automotive landscape they are going to stick around and there s your catalyst TLDR ford doesn t make cars they make rockets that go to the moon

on a stock every day for the next few days On today s episode GM tl dr at the bottom Why it ll this year and next year 1 Biden wants to make the entire US fleet EV by the end of his term You really think he s going to buy 70 000 cybertrucks for the fleet Can you imagine the outrage if federal cars are using fancy Teslas while the average American has to buy regular cars I think Biden will be more likely to buy GM s newer electric cars once they come out because they ll be much cheaper Biden also drives GMs cars adding to possible bias or favoritism there I don t think it s a coincidence that GM announced going fully electric while Biden pushed for a fully electric federal fleet Either Biden knew GM was going electric or GM knew Biden would make this big purchase order 2 Cap and trade Have you heard of it No You should learn about it or else you ll lose out on tendies Cap and trade is complicated so I m not gonna explain it here Go google it Point is companies who produce electric cars can receive a rebate because the car emits less CO2 compared to a gas car In fact Tesla would ve lost money in 2020 if it wasn t for California s cap and trade program https www cnn com 2021 01 31 investing tesla profitability index html https www cnn com 2021 01 31 investing tesla profitability index html Now that GM has access to this cap and trade market they ll be able to sell these to the remaining gas car companies This will also hurt Tesla because the more companies sell credits the cheaper they become Also you know who s likely to pass cap and trade The federal government Obama tried to pass cap and trade in 2009 https en wikipedia org wiki American Clean Energy and Security Act https en wikipedia org wiki American Clean Energy and Security Act but it was never brought to the senate With climate change being a more pressing issue and Biden s talk about solving climate change and green energy jobs he s for sure going to try to expand and pass cap and trade on the national level He s also publicly supported cap and trade https www washingtonpost com graphics politics policy 2020 climate change carbon tax https www washingtonpost com graphics politics policy 2020 climate change carbon tax From his campaign website And he will demand that Congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency that 1 establishes an enforcement mechanism to achieve the 2050 goal including a target no later than the end of his first term in 2025 to ensure we get to the finish line This seems to refer to cap and trade as it s the only real enforcement mechanism to achieve a targeted climate change goal With democrats controlling everything cap and trade is likely to pass this time Then again politicians lie all the time and Biden isn t much different However even if the feds don t step in multiple states have already passed cap and trade with many more to come 3 GMs cars are comparable to Tesla s cars The Model 3 isn t actually that good The Chevy Bolt has a range of 259 miles about 22 miles longer than Tesla Both cars cost about the same amount The newer Chevy Bolts also have fast charging so Tesla s starting to lose its moat here Guess Elon s plan to not patent anything really screwed him over 4 The PE on this is stupidly low Come on 12 13 It s practically begging to be bought at this price Compare this to Tesla s 1 230 If GM and Tesla both EV companies had the same valuation GM would be worth 5000 This is my price target lmao 5 The UK Norway and other countries are planning to ban vehicles Norway is the most aggressive at 2025 China is also considering it which would make EV companies like GM go absolutely parabolic GM has the Chevy Bolt meaning they already have a head start in terms of experience when it comes to producing EVs amp x200B amp x200B Why is the stock down There are a lot of things that make people scared of GM Here s why I think they re dumb 1 The chip shortage This is a concern for GM in the short run but they were still able to beat earnings compared to 2019 Currently they re projecting the earnings will be 1 2 billion lower next year due to the shortage I think that s a worst case scenario and the market is overreacting to the chip shortage The chip shortage is now getting the concern of Congress and Biden https www washingtonpost com technology 2021 02 23 biden semiconductor shortage meeting https www washingtonpost com technology 2021 02 23 biden semiconductor shortage meeting Given that Biden always talks about manufacturing funding the semiconductor shortage via loans or grants and boosting domestic production of semiconductors could serve an easy win He can claim this is coronavirus stimulus money to build manufacturing jobs or whatever GM gets its chips from Qualcomm which has a ton of facilities in the US and is based in San Diego This can serve as an easy political win for Biden 2 Charging stations This isn t going to be a concern for much longer Most people don t drive for long haul journeys so driving stations aren t really needed Think about it If you could fill up your car with gas at home would you ever go to a gas station Very rarely This is the point of EVs and it s why I think they ll be the future Also I hate to mention Biden again but he s planning to put 500 000 public charging stations in the US by 2030 This won t be a problem much longer https www bloomberg com news articles 2020 12 02 joe biden plan to fight climate change could sell 25 million electric cars https www bloomberg com news articles 2020 12 02 joe biden plan to fight climate change could sell 25 million electric cars 3 bEaR mArKEt Chill This shit happens every couple of months People panic and say the market is crashing It s not Even if it was GM would hardly be hit because its PE is so stupidly low IMO the only company that should tank a ton is Tesla People always bring up the bUfFeT inDicAtoR because they think Buffet is some kind of god He s not Sometimes Buffet is an idiot He doesn t understand the tech industry and I think the rise in stocks recently is tech related We re entering a new era of American capitalism where tech companies dominate 7 stock market growth is the norm With GDP rising 2 per year you should expect to see a high divergence in the long run The buffet indicator only measures GDP too which isn t remotely the same as stock prices Stocks get their values from earnings and also the assets the company owns GDP doesn t factor wealth into consideration at all One last point people think it s a buy and hold for 10 years but it s not I think GM will go to the moon 5000 quicker than you think Stocks move faster than reality and price in future expectations There are a lot of catalysts incoming charging stations no new gas cars chip production and cap and trade If any one of these things are announced that s GM to 100 amp x200B tl dr Buy GM Cap and trade EV ban and its undervalued price make it super attractive GM will hit 5000 Buy or cry Positions GM 1 21 22 60c I plan to roll over these options as they approach expiration

DR short term long term big A good way to look at it is to increase in value Tesla has to do everything right for years and still get lucky For the stock to go down they only have to fuck up once or maybe not even at all Before I start let me make it clear that while I do eat crayons for breakfast lunch and dinner I am by no means an expert and this is hardly a serious DD like some others I ve seen here before This is just my opinion and my take do what you will you beautiful retards Also I like Tesla and I respect them a lot I love that they made electric cars S3XY and I want one but God damn if they aren t insanely overvalued I m betting against the stock not the company Let s just start off with some easy facts you paste eaters can understand Tesla right now is more valuable than basically every major car manufacturer Lyft COMBINED I love their cars but dude holy FUCK You absolute apes drove this stock into the stratosphere and beyond So let s talk why this action today is expected natural and IMO only sealing Tesla s fate towards reality First Tesla was practically insolvent not that long ago Elon even admitted as much here https www cnbc com 2020 11 03 musk tesla was about a month from bankruptcy during model 3 ramp html While they have done extremely well since then and have insane amounts of cash coming on hand especially Q42020 where they skyrocketed in cash on hand up to 16 BILLION USD from 3B this worries me more than encourages me Why aren t they spending this cash on future R amp D efforts paying down debt making even more factories yes yes India I know but MORE charging stations battery tech or even give a bonus to all of their overworked laborers and employees that worked almost 60 hour weeks non stop despite Coronavirus and rampant wildfires last summer to hit barely their delivery targets etc Tesla already has mega churn because Elon the culture burns people out and a bonus would be super well received I m sure Nope they buy some digital currency you know the one Look say what you will Elon is a bit of a weirdo Love him but man if he isn t unusual for a Billionaire visionary and that move was definitely weird for a large ish corporation to do with so much money given they re so young relatively unproven compared to other auto makers at least in the eyes of the boomer clan and looking to aggressively ramp up production To me it shows they don t have significant ideas for rapid future growth that they can realistically hit with that cash so they d rather drive traffic to sales via well a meme That might be a genius move but it s definitely non standard and doesn t speak to confidence in new development coming easily This means at least to me with Tesla what you see is what you get They don t have any huge surprises coming or new products lurking that we haven t already heard about robotaxi lol 25k car etc They don t have a huge pipeline of new tech ready to roll out and they aren t aggressively rolling funding into even further development to not only stay ahead of the giants that are creeping up but to run past them and push farther ahead Ford BMW Mercedes Audi Porsche etc all have EVs on market this year and all have significantly more infrastructure and capital on hand to shift to meet the growing EV demand They re behind but not for long They may be slow giants but they didn t get there for free and they have been there that long for a reason Finally EV is the future for now but what if in five years it s hydrogen or fucking fusion or maybe even some bad stuff happens with EV and everyone wants ICE again Tesla is super exposed to one industry while the giants have their feet in both pools at once might make them slower but it s also less risk and they re not THAT slow seeing as they re already on the market It is legitimately retarded to count those auto makers out At that point just roll your 401k into Robinhood Second let s talk Tesla fundamentals ish I m not gonna dig into the numbers and financials because I am a moron and I don t know how What I am gonna talk about is the business compared to their peers Here is what Tesla currently sells and bulls say they are going to be insanely profitable from Cars duh Solar roof Solar wall Robotaxis eventually Insurance eventually Semis eventually People like to lump batteries in here as some sort of profit saving thing but it really might not be maybe maybe not time will tell and I ll talk about that in a second Cars duh Teslas are dope as hell They have had their issues in the past but they re sick and people want them Demand is there for sure and growing rapidly I won t deny BUT others are catching up just as fast as the market is shifting towards EV Meaning when the old crusty ass MFs who don t know What s an electricity decide they want an EV they will have SIGNIFICANTLY more choice as consumers than you or I today if we were to go car shopping This will undoubtedly pull away from Tesla sales You can assume that Tesla somehow magically doesn t lose any interest in a field with increasing competition but this just isn t reality People like new things and companies that make new good cars will see sales Tesla is that right now will they be that in the future I m not certain See production scaling concerns above To really assume they won t lose any consumer interest despite growing competition they d need to be pumping out multiple different models I m talking a non cyber Tesla truck some sort of hatchback sport crossover maybe even an adventure sport rig like an EV 4 Runner or the EV Hummer that s coming out Americans like big cars it s a fact Just because it s an EV and saving the planet doesn t mean consumers want to sacrifice this is why Tesla was and has been successful because they finally made an EV that wasn t fugly as shit and a laughing stock but if they don t continue to drive innovation into existing ICE sectors with EV tech they re going to get left behind Tesla is gonna want to capture this market share and they haven t even hinted at it so far I don t know specific numbers and I don t think anyone legitimately does so take everything you read with a grain of salt but Tesla isn t going to be leaps and bounds ahead of competitors in the future EV sphere unless they really buck up If anything by not doing these things now they re backing themselves into a corner and a specific look that might be hard to shake later Next solar things Solar wall and roof are dope but they re not cheap and pretty niche right now It requires living in an area with enough sunlight and being able to afford them in the first place There s also just not a ton of consumer demand for this right now We could see a huge consumer shift towards personal responsibility for green energy in which case this stuff may become ultra profitable but it s still a matter of scale I don t know their production numbers but with how little I ve heard about it I don t think they re huge and if demand spikes they won t be in a great place to capture it if they aren t scaling appropriately see cash concerns above Now let s talk Robotaxis and Insurance Insurance is a dud that s not big money Maybe I m not just a retard but also an idiot but I truly don t think Tesla offering insurance does ANYTHING positive for their bottom line The way I understand the proposition is that because they re so confident in their self driving tech they would become your insurance company insuring you if FSD made any mistakes This is a lot of liability forrrr nothing They can t really take payments for it unless it s well below what consumers pay now for insurance otherwise are they really so confident about their tech If that s the case insurers will drop rates and lay off employees close locations to meet those rates because a they like money and b it s even easier money than now if they re less likely to pay out At a certain point Tesla s insurance is more just a warranty than anything seriously profitable for Tesla They take on a lot of risk and can only really do this once a certain number of autonomous vehicles are on the road to ensure their liability isn t too high AND after regulatory bodies have been coerced into approving this otherwise they re taking on a lot of risk for basically no gain Robotaxis are equally dud ish Again maybe I m just a fucking mouth breathing smooth brained ape but people like people Even though people bitch about other people everyone bitched about being inside away from society during Rona and never seeing anyone Some people like those random interactions you get with a real person and some people just truly don t trust robots Both of these take away from potential customers market share Tesla is likely to see from Robotaxis Also old people and tech don t generally mix Getting better but still old people and robots likely won t be a hot seller Further regulation and the required insurance warranty coverage whatever for this whole operation won t be quick or cheap What happens when someone has a heart attack or passes out asleep or faints in your Robotaxi What happens if it does happen to get in an accident or if it gets a flat tire What happens if the address is wrong or someone needs to change where they re going What if they have a thick accent and the vehicle doesn t respond or what if they aren t a native speaker or are disabled mute deaf blind need assistance getting into trunk or into out of car How do these situations get handled Finally not everyone wants to have random people in their car especially without supervision What if someone trashes your car Or pisses shits pukes in there while they re drunk Sure Tesla or whoever might cover you but Robotaxis won t clean themselves Further what about charging The cars won t charge themselves after they re done with their shift so unless you re able to go out and plug it in what happens if charge is too low for you to then drive home Guess you gotta wait Not saying it s impossible just that there are a lot more factors that need to be addressed before this is a slam dunk And here s the kicker it s not even a super profitable industry Uber is operating at a loss and they re the defacto millennial ride calling service Lyft and Yellow Cab still exist among a host of other ride sharing services especially abroad in places like Asia Europe is much more walkable IMO so it s not as popular from what I ve seen but in major cities London sure it still is Overall Robotaxis aren t really gonna be the future unless a fuckload of good shit happens for Tesla and basically every boomer suddenly loves robots Plus if everyone has a Tesla who the fuck is riding in the Robotaxis Even if you assume somehow Tesla starts being like USPS or Amazon and delivering packages groceries becomes a god damn short bus there still will be competitors and it s still not as easy as saying but it s the fUtuRe Semis I don t know shit about shit here but I haven t heard much more than a peep about this so I m naively assuming it s not a huge corner of Tesla s business projections for the future Maybe Tesla becomes the Daimler of EV and sells only big ass EV Semis but I doubt it I don t see this being a huge money maker perhaps I m very wrong Lastly batteries lots of people like to say how Tesla s batteries are gonna make them tons of money and much better than their competitors blah blah but I don t really buy this Their tech may be really good now but other companies with a lot more money and history of development are coming HARD for the money in the EV sphere I don t want to assume that these companies will necessarily make their own battery tech but SOMEONE will People like money a lot If these companies don t figure out how to build their own batteries like Tesla someone will And here is where Tesla s battery strategy becomes not super useful Tesla paid a fuck load upfront in capital expenditure to finance and develop factories to make these batteries if another company starts making batteries that are even remotely comparable to Tesla s they will likely end up a lot cheaper eventually not immediately because they will begin producing en masse to support allllll the other EV makers standardizing in the process no less not just the batteries Tesla needs And if that never happens it means the EV makers made their own which means they are confident enough in their own cost performance etc and Tesla really isn t that far ahead I know Tesla has a big advantage here now but that doesn t mean people who worked on Tesla batteries won t go work elsewhere for more money and it doesn t mean these other companies won t hire young and hungry Masters and PhD grads to develop cutting edge battery tech straight off of their full ride to Yale In fact that tech is probably already being developed in Ivy League labs for fun by those exact types of people for their PhD and Professors using their grant and research money hell some boy scout in a garage in Iowa might be doing it right now Tesla may be a leader now counting on them to stay dominant and leaps and bounds ahead forever is not just foolish but stupid Everyone buying in and hoping for this stock to go to 1500 is either completely braindead irretrievably stupid or not paying any attention whatsoever They re assuming Tesla is operating in its own little quarantine zone where nobody ever competes with them and they re the golden child forever Look I like Tesla but no matter what endeavor they go after someone else is gonna go for it too Tesla may end up being better at it but that doesn t make them insanely profitable off the rip and it doesn t mean everyone will use Tesla s stuff Some people don t like the brand some people don t like Elon others may just like other stuff more Finally look at the anatomy of a bubble and compare it to Tesla s stock chart It s shockingly similar I know I know that s moronic but I m a moron and a so what can I say The other eerily similar chart and comparable situation is Radio Corporation of America circa 1930 Radio was hot new shit and everyone thought it was the FUCKIN FUTURE dude So shares skyrocketed and everyone hopped in but oopsie turns out radio wasn t the paradigm shifting thing everyone thought it would be and stock prices tanked This has happened with every bubble ever Everyone thinks they re invincible everyone thinks this time is different everyone thinks the institutions know their shit and are never wrong ever Cathie Wood hem hem but every single time they ve been proven wrong Fundamentals always matter and Tesla ain t there chief Finally Graham Dodd Buffet some of the most legendary investors investing advice people EVER whose advice has withstood many many decades and market conditions warn about buying at any price assuming the stock will continue to increase so no matter where you buy in you ll make money This sound familiar How about those ludicrous price targets of 1600 share Sound reasonable Unless Tesla fundamentally shifts the way we as a society think about and approach transportation as a whole and I don t just mean ICE to EV retards their valuation is completely temporary and entirely fucked There s a few catalysts that I can think of as well some bearish some bullish For some bullish ones UK announced Uber has to treat drivers like employees not contractors meaning their profits will be hurt This does mean good news for Robotaxis if and only if they can actually make them work profitably Further loos id don t think I can say this name here is going public and Rivian is slated to go public this year as well If these companies or NKLA or NIO or some other companies have significant and public blunders Tesla stands to gain However some bearish catalysts are that those other companies are coming and if they DONT fuck up they re just more competition in an increasingly crowded space More choices means less profits for Tesla Also in case you guys forgot Tesla is a pretty shitty company in terms of workers rights They don t offer 401ks and they have been staunchly anti union Further Elon basically forced people back to work during the pandemic and reopened the factories early despite governmental orders and fired employees for not coming back into the office after having stated publicly they could remain at home He might not have been directly involved in this but Tesla sure was While those have already eclipsed it isn t a promising outlook for the future and the breakneck speeds workers are being pushed to meet along with long hours to meet delivery targets are going to be very hard to maintain if they see worker fatigue and dropout I m not saying they re gonna miss targets but there is a chance that workers unionize or otherwise strike rebel and want more representation compensation work life balance This would reduce delivery targets and decrease profit margins Further with a democratic party leading all branches and pretty activist voices in some pretty powerful positions companies like Amazon and Tesla that don t treat workers well may see legal punitive backlash from the government if they don t change things themselves I for one would be popcorn meme watching AOC and Elon duke it out on twitter over something like this Also Tesla is opening a new factory in India and there are factories in China but these might not be as great as people think India is in a lot of turmoil right now with the farmers revolt and there are some serious issues with the government there along with China and the Uighurs I would be not too surprised to see some sort of governmental sanctions or tightened restrictions on trade until these countries resolve those issues which could spell bad news for Tesla These countries are great new markets but like the USA they also have their own car manufacturers and other EV players Tesla isn t going to have a monopoly anywhere so chill the fuck out So all of this paints my pretty grim picture for Tesla s stock price but here s where I do my retard math If you look at Yahoo finance for Tesla s book value you get like 20 share This takes into account all of Tesla s assets and liabilities Now Tesla could take on more liabilities debt in order to fund more R amp D and drop their book value by doing so but here s the thing they have like 16B cash on deck to do that and they haven t I don t see them taking out massive loans that haven t been normal business procedure for them in the coming year s So take this book value and assume they grow at a rate of 50 year over year for 5 years straight which would be fucking insane This gives you like 154 share Book value Now let s look at their peers and their sector EV as a whole is in a bubble IMO so I don t think it s really legitimate to compare to their EV peers EV is the tech bubble Tesla is the specific stock issue in question affected most heavily because of name brand recognition So compared to companies that have made cars longer than you or I have been alive Toyota VW BMW Honda Daimler Suzuki Ford GM the average price to book ratio of those companies is 1 16 Tesla s is 35 25 If you take the insane growth figure I listed before which represents 50 YoY TRUE growth in the company averaged out over the 5 years to reduce any weirdness with new debt reducing book value AND you add on a 125 INCREASE of the P B ratio so 225 raw compared to their peers this assumes they re 125 more pricey than their closest competitors after insane growth for the next five years meaning we re assuming basically fucking everything above goes right for Tesla and you price all of that in TODAY you get a value of 401 share Tesla is almost double that today In my opinion Tesla s true value lies around 100 share With an assumption of 20 YoY growth of book value 5 years in a row and a 50 increase of P B relative to peer average Tesla is the P B sector leader with this factor added on you get 75 share If you wanna be bullish and assume more goes right and things turn out better call it 100 or 150 This book value and its growth expectation wraps in things like profit margin and other fun little gotchas a lot of Tesla bulls like to point to saying how Tesla is supreme and much better than companies like Toyota which literally fucking created Lean Manufacturing it s called the Toyota way that transformed not just auto manufacturing but any industry that remotely has anything to do with manufacturing in general Put up against that Tesla may be a maverick but they have some big fucking shoes to fill and stiff competition Anything more than 200 share and I think you re truly ignoring fundamentals and living in fantasy land like every other bubble occupant in the history of the stock market and human history So where does that leave us today Well Michael Burry despite being pretty crazy is actually pretty brilliant and has been skeptical short on Tesla long before I decided to jack myself to the tits quantity wise not so much cost on cheap premie puts I don t think anyone can truly time a bubble and the actions that the Fed has been taking along with upcoming stimulus checks and tax returns could prolong any top well beyond its natural range I could get totally fucked because of this but whatever I didn t throw in more than I can afford to lose so whatever happens happens plus as a I d probably deserve it anyways The selloff that has happened over the past week I believe is the start of the blowoff phase We re on the way down now it s just a matter of how long it can hang on IMO The big dip yesterday was our local bottom until we ramp back up to the back to normal section If you re long Tesla personally I d sell there I do think short term there are some decent gains to be had if you buy now and hold for a week or two I m not an expert but I m guessing in about a week or two we re back up near 800 820 and that ll be about the peak After that I think the stock loses steam and drops off to its natural level wherever that ends up being between 90 and 1600 if you listen to analysts really insightful shit really narrows it down The bounce back today for me has more just confirmed the shape of the bubble and reactionary tendencies that people are pretty predisposed to and kind of just confirms that the movement is based more on sentiment and human psychology than true fundamentals I might be wrong about the timing but I m as close to certain as I ve ever been about a stock that this is going to go to sub 200 levels in the next year If I m right I m buying a Tesla Positions lots of 3 19 puts at different sub 300 strikes Planning on buying more cheap OTM short term puts every month until this stock goes down or I go bankrupt Sadly was a greedy fuck and didn t sell one 2 26 590p during the big dip yesterday Feel free to call me a in the comments

lithium battery You know that chargebale battery and the one and only reason why you have to charge your phone every 2 hours and your Tesla who doesn t have one these days after 400 500 km Let s not forget a battery s purpose is to stores energy The more energy you can store in a smaller battery the happier we humans are Energy happiness Finding a cost effective and efficient solid state battery for electric vehicles could prove equivalent to finding the golden fleece in Greek mythology According to the legend anyone who possessed the golden fleece would be considered a true ruler According to the present technology anyone who could develop a cost effective and efficient solid state battery would rule the EV world A few listed companies are working on revolutionary Solid State Batterys Instead of LI ion Solid State Batteries use solid electrodes and solid electrolytes For the ones who never heard about these use Opera or Google to DYOR Solid State Batteries promise already today Twice the energy 1 100th of the size 6x faster charsing 10X longer lifetime Non flammability This new piece of 21th century technology will definitely evolve coming years Elon Musk already called it the MOAB Now let s talk stocks A few companies are working on a Solid State Battery expecting to bring it to the market within a few years Today much of the development work on solid state batteries is performed with partnerships Among the players are conventional Li ion battery cell manufacturers i e Samsung SDI LG Chem A123 Systems battery separator technology solutions suppliers Asahi Kasei and materials suppliers Solvay Umicore etc QuantumScape Panasonic Samsung LG Ionic Materials BMW Solid Power Toyota Ilika According to Yole D veloppement s market forecast mass production of solid state batteries will begin by 2022 and represent less than 1 of Li ion battery demand by 2025 This might explain the relative low interest from investors today which might change when large solid state battery manufacturing capacities start to be built Samsung LG BMW etc are all searching for the Solid State battery for own use so that is not interesting for me to invest in they already reached their market share Today there are 2 stocks I want to discuss with you Quantumscape and Ilika You might have heard about QuantumScape before QS went to the moon 10 130 when Volkswagen announced it took an extra 20 stake in the battery manufacturing company crazy times on the stock market back in the days Now QS is stable between 40 50 Fair price for a company with no revenue but a huge potential in the EV market QS is already backed by 300 million worth of investment from Volkswagen Bill Gates and hedge fund billionaire George Soros Ilika is also a pioneer in solid state batteries trading around 3 4 Ilika has has two development programs Stereax miniature batterys for MedTech Goliath solid states for the EV and other battery powered transportation The scope of growth is huge in both industries Compared to QS and to see what s happening with their stocks lets only focus on the EV market Ilika aligned a road map where the plan to start production of the Solid State Battery in 2026 that s the same period as the planning of QS Ilika actually plans a pre pilot this year and a construction pilot in 2024 For more information DYOR So why is ILIKF trading 2 4 and QS 40 50 Founded by Stanford University scientists a decade ago with financial backing from Volkswagen AG QuantumScape became a public company in November after merging with Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp a special purpose acquisition company SPAC When the SPAC deal was announced in September the parties decided a 3 3 billion valuation was appropriate Following a blistering stock market run QuantumScape is now worth more than 10 times that initial value Those who bought shares in the Kensington SPAC in August have enjoyed a 1 060 return QuantumScape s prominent backers include venture capital firms Khosla Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Microsoft Inc cofounder Bill Gates hedge fund billionaire George Soros s Quantum Partners and investor Jeremy Grantham JB Straubel a former chief technology officer at Tesla is on the board These people know how to bring a company to the market and make it moon Looking at their financials and progress QS and Ilika do not differ that much They both have enough capital to fund the business processes for the next 5 7 years and both planning to bring their product to market in 2025 To understand the difference we have to look in the type of investors of both companies and their strategy for production The difference is QS plans to build a giga factory to manufacture their batteries which asks for a huge investment 0 5 billion 750 million per GWh That is the real reason why they are raising these amounts of capital Ilika has chosen a different route They will use the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre UKBIC as a first step before scaling up through an existing manufacturing company to get to the GWh UKBIC is a key part of the Faraday Battery Challenge FBC a Government programme to fast track the development of cost effective high performance durable safe low weight and recyclable batteries Therefor Ilika doesn t need the same capital investment to fund their growth So here is the point Solid State Battery technology is the future of battery Ilika is growing in multiple industries including the EV market Therefor I believe Ilike is a save and good investment for the long term What are your thoughts on this Is Ilika a good investment
