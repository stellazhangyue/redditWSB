207,ktjfsq,t2_oco7h7q,1610164910,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktjfsq/why_market_moveslong/,1,Why market moves long ,To understand how stocks move first you gotta understand the interaction between buyers and sellers Basically it s Econ 101 supply and demand Too much demand Buyers will have to raise their prices so that sellers sell Second the types of market participants Active and passive participants Passive participants are like buy buy sell buy sell buy sell buy buy buy sell buy sell sell buy This is almost completely automated and determined by the weighting of the stock versus the index or the methodology that it is following The bots of VOO for example doesn t give a damn if an accounting scandal has happened or if a new breakthrough has been reached Every day it will buy and sell stocks indiscriminately following the algos And increasingly newer assets under management are coming mostly under those passive investment vehicles such as passive ETFs passive mutual funds etc leading to them having a larger and larger share of the market I am coming to active participants later Thirdly you gotta understand hedging Which is basically an investment position to offset losses Example you sell a naked call You see the stock moving closer to the strike price You immediately buy shares to ensure that you don t take a loss Ok now why do individual stocks move They move based on events plain old news market related movements etc Now let s go back to active participants such as retail investors hedge funds fund managers etc Suppose there s a quarterly earnings report coming out for ASML Almost all active participants have somehow figured from various news reports that the earnings report will be good because of the huge demand for ASML s product As a result an active fund manager takes a big position on that stock The stock moves a bit Hedge funds and other firms also take their positions A retard post about the company s upcoming good earnings on the internet and all early retard investors quickly get in The stock moves up In the meantime the passive funds are adjusting their position in the stock realtime If it s going up They are buying more to adjust their position Now don t forget Those passive ETFs or funds have other semiconductor stocks in their ETFs and shits Which means even if only ASMLs quarterly earnings were supposed to be good other stocks of the same sector will benefit As there are tons of both active and passive algos that don t trade individual stocks but ETFs and similar stuff due to liquidity reasons This gets even better Suppose lots of retail investors are also buying call options of this stock If the underlying continues to go up the delta could keep on rising Suppose it went from 5 to 10 to 20 This would force the option sellers to keep on buying more and more shares and could lead to gamma explosion where the market makers create a violent feedback loop due to hedging It gets more fun than that Remember the various HFT firms and scalper bots Well they know it all too well that some firms are busy at hedging frenzy They also join in on the feeding frenzy that is this stock After said earnings release or most likely just before it most of the active participants like retail traders and hedge funds may well start taking profits And the stock generally runs up more than the expected in the first place This leads to the violent unwinding of the positions that we generally see after the earnings release Because everything happens in the exact reverse order I just described here That s why it s a terrible gamble to buy options in hope of a good earnings release or similar news It feels euphoric if you are on the right side of the tide and equally depressing if you are on the wrong side of the tide The same thing can happen in the opposite direction if a piece of bad news is expected or happens Here earnings release is just one of the events that I described It could be any event like index inclusion regulatory shifts stock splits analyst upgrade downgrades some fund manager or hedge funds buying the stock etc Also don t forget that all this is also affecting other stocks in the same sector region etc due to them being connected through passive investments and active participants exploiting the passive participants A very recent example of this happening would be the stock PLTR Remember they signed a contract with FDA for 44M but the stock moved almost 10B or more I haven t calculated or about 20 Two weeks ago maybe Citron declared short attack and a violent unwinding of positions happened and the stock went down about 15 20 after climbing 10 12 that day Or the day before that when it climbed 20 Now I have sold calls on PLTR yeah I like it that your 12 04 12 11 12 18 expired or will expire worthless This is not how all stocks move But a large portion of the stocks that are mentioned here in the sub move this way This is why it sometimes feels like to you folks as KINDA pump and dump But whether you retards accept it or not I know you guys are the cream of the crop While most of you act as if you know nothing I know very well most of you probably make money You guys are like people who watch tech reviews to buy a smartphone Ok I completely went out of topic Sorry This is not how all stocks move Some boomer stocks like MMM JBT etc may have low retail interest In those cases the stocks are almost absolutely up to the mercy of other active participants who or which may as well not care that much leaving those stocks to the hands of the algos of passive participants But in those whole processes there s almost no price discovery that s actually working Passive algos are buying and selling but mostly creating buying pressure completely arbitrarily HFT bots buying and selling because reasons The participants who are using traditional valuation metrics analyzing the good and bad of stocks are getting outnumbered by all the other participants and generally speaking the volume of their trades are also declining in the overall market Think of big participants like Berkshire which is undoubtedly the most powerful active participant in the market pension funds sovereign funds etc they barely buy or sell any stocks they have if they have entered on the right price Sure I am kinda underselling the influence of big institutional investors but it is not completely without any merit So you are saying there s no price discovery in the various stocks Absolutely not Even in the greatly flawed system I described being used by most market participants there s plenty of it happening by newsflashes sell side analyst recommendations retail fomoers etc Only the stocks that have heavy institutional ownerships with a healthy retail interest seems to me to be less volatile this is my intuition speaking really so this statement is probably false in the first place such as MSFT etc and they probably have better price discovery What about those stocks doubling the day they IPO The reason behind that is very simple Tons of retail investors place Market Orders This means they are ready to pay whatever the price this thing will go for In those scenarios investment banks can hardly control the price of the stock as there s just too much demand to satisfy In short it s a feeding frenzy And this is one of the things that s primarily driven by retail interest What about those SPACs and low float stocks Well this again needs no explaining Too low float too much interest Various whales also know this and use this for their benefit After the merger is complete or slightly before it retail investors and whales leave for the next thing in the line So the stock tanks and the stock price never recovers If the company that s being pumped is actually any good the stock would likely later get the attention it deserves after the sell off I hope all those points are good enough to explain most of the funky behaviour an individual stock would make I know my explanations are not exhaustive and there are many angles I haven t covered but it is what it is Now to the MORE IMPORTANT STUFF Individual stocks also move due to numerous macro reasons When the entire market is in a euphoric phase you can throw a dart and that stock would move up The opposite and the stock would go down Why and how does the market move Liquidity This is probably the most important thing that drives the market as a whole Excess liquidity that s circling around will inevitably try to enter into the economy in one way or another Either through purchasing more assets or any other way Now we all know it pretty well that this trend is being exaggerated by the low interest rate environment that s present in the current developed markets People are being forced to participate in the market in the hunt for return Also almost every investor from every country seems to be more interested to participate in the US stock market even more than their home markets And the recent trend of commission free brokerage services and easy flow of capital has helped to provide even more participation in the stock market than usual Options trading is also at historic highs and probably most of you buy call options and put options is probably mostly bought by institutional investors like it always were As a whole this frenzy can move the market very quickly Remember SoftBank bought billions in options on very concentrated tech names That along with retail call options purchasing mania lead the market to a euphoric state The S amp P 500 has become so heavily influenced by those tech names that if they move the entire market moves If they fall the entire market falls But we haven t probably addressed a big elephant in the room Volatility suppression Futures traders algos our central bank etc all are participating in the dangerous game of volatility suppression This all can unwind though And it can unwind fairly quickly If we take the case of February or March If you remember Mr Ackman was screaming fire fire fire he have had his intentions but the market was barely paying attention But with the lockdowns and everything suddenly everyone seems to have gotten caught with their pants down And you know how quick all the things were Active investors retail investors everyone suddenly flocked for put options VIX etc A Minsky moment has suddenly come Margin calls longs are burnt left and right market makers have completely turned their positions etc you know the usual deal but exactly in the opposite direction Suddenly gold treasuries cryptos etc whatever are being sold to cover their positions Institutional investors are suddenly visited by their risk managements and they suddenly become net sellers Passive investments vehicles also sell stocks that are being kicked heavily Literally everyone s a seller No one wants to buy And the situation doesn t change until the Fed comes in and says Brrrr Liquidity suddenly becomes available in the debt market Retail investors jump Buy the dip they said Money keeps flowing in from everywhere There are many other things that I probably needed to say to complete the story But it is what it is Also interest rate trumps over everything Every valuation metrics pricing schemes are dependent on it So that s super important Let s say suddenly interest rates rise the market will immediately collapse along with your meme stock Because of two main reasons Every company is loaded with debt and the risk free return has just increased resulting in more money chasing treasury bonds and other instruments These pieces of information any useful Yes and no As they say hindsight is always 20 20 Let me tell you my short story navigating the market this year February News of the virus and everything I see VIX S amp P bond market foreign markets etc and I keep sucking my thumb thinking nothing s going to happen Being burnt by two trades and market starting to freefall almost I realize my mistake and change my strategy Fed says Brrr I fail to change my strategy Something even worse could be coming Lol After almost a week passing I realise my f ing mistake Again At least I can say it s not just me The information is almost always there Problem is we not everyone of course some of you are much more flexible fail to act upon it Ok one more story about an individual stock Remember AAPL s third quarter earnings result I sold calls before earnings thinking the stock will go down after earnings report There was overwhelming evidence that this is not going to be true And I read almost all of it WFH and everything Yet my monkey brain somehow decided to trust the analyst estimates and the overall news cycle surrounding the economy AAPL then reported a literal blow away quarterly earnings report For me 2020 was a year of reckoning and I learned to remove my directional assumption from the market and to just go with the flow But I am pretty sure it wouldn t matter cause when it s time I just wouldn t remember I posted this one before but it got removed by votebots

But this is my reasoning for investing in cannabis stocks in general for 2021 I ve been a bull on cannabis since the democrats had a strong pro cannabis platform But what made me go balls deep into the market was that the UN changed its classification of cannabis Countries follow the UN closely for guidance on their own classification of controlled substances Congress has repeatedly cited https www brookings edu blog fixgov 2015 02 13 how to reschedule marijuana and why its unlikely anytime soon the UN s classification as one of the reasons for not changing it Several countries immediately changed their stance on cannabis in response to this including Israel which In November 2020 announced that it was moving forward with a plan to legalize recreational cannabis nationally The country is aiming to implement recreational legalization within nine months and even if there are delays that means mid to late 2021 This is my reason for investing in Canadian cannabis companies because they are already poised to expand internationally since its legal there nationwide THE SENATE IS NOW BLUE The Georgia runoffs were won by Democrats and they can now swing the vote left with VP Harris She

onwards definitely hasn t been priced in for all the future legislation because some of it will be completely new legislation that wasn t possible to consider before without a blue senate THIS HASN T

the senate went blue that was the gamble APHA was making and they won The sky is the limit now When they merge they will reduce expenses and be much more likely to post profitable quarters This is why mergers have so much hype the sum is gt than their parts because they can reduce operating expenses while maintaining revenue from the two companies Tilray CEO Brendan Kennedy I think medical cannabis will be legal at the federal level which means medical cannabis can cross state lines and be imported into the U S like we export cannabis from Canada and Portugal to about 15 countries now Kennedy said Anyone who thinks there s a state specific medical market is wrong As for the recreational market Kennedy says the state specific markets with interstate trade banned are not going to last long Kennedy believes that cannabis will be distributed like alcohol and tobacco within two years time That would require significant overhaul of US federal drug laws and would significantly disrupt all US cannabis companies existing business models Brendan Kennedy the cannabis billionaire will step down as Tilray s chairman and CEO Irwin D Simon Aphria s current chairman and CEO will take Kennedy s

affordability I can t deny Pax has quality products and is like the iPhone of vaporizers I like their products I like their branding There s lots of hype and loyalty especially with their Volcano desktop vaporizer Strong US brands The main reason they did poorly was bad timing They IPO d during the year that JUULs started being banned They re actually at all those levels again Theres a ton of upside potential Market cap is ridiculously low for some really renown brands all because of the JUUL flavor pod ban Everyone knows Pax Volcano and JUUL But no one knows Greenlane because of the bad timing of their IPO and the subsequent JUUL flavor ban It s crazy They ve already broke all time high for the year But I m holding until they break 1B market cap Recently became the exclusive distributor for the world s first gravity powered contactless water hookah https www globenewswire com news release 2020 11 18 2129049 0 en Greenlane Becomes Exclusive Distributor for World s First Gravity Powered Contactless Water Hookah html Overall i think too many people count it out just because of their IPO and subsequent decline in JUUL sales from the JUUL flavored pods ban They definitely have the potential because of their strong branding and quality products I m betting on them having more high quality products in the future with equally loyal customers Sundial Growers They must close above 1 per share for 10 consecutive sessions by June 26 2021 or it will be delisted from NASDAQ https finance yahoo com news sundial receives approval nasdaq listing 130000598 html People see this as a fear factor I see this as they will do anything necessary to reach 1 for a week so they won t be delisted IMHO reverse splitter probably isn t on the table since they could have done that in 2020 but instead applied for a 6 month extension after announcing alternative strategic investments We can already see this by their predatory loan SPAC spinoff Rumors of a merger with CGC also purchased a SPAC recently and entered an agreement with Zenabis immediately claiming they defaulted Turning that SPAC into predatory loan debt repurchasing company Imo if they want to complete a merger it would be easy to sell ownership through that SPAC to the buyer THEY RECENTLY WENT DEBT FREE https www prnewswire com news releases sundial announces completion of financial restructuring and debt free status 301196607 html by selling off unprofitable assets in the business This means we are much more likely to see earnings in future quarters and they are much more attractive for mergers Because they are indoor growers they are more likely to be bought up by a company in the consolidating Canadian cannabis market than fail all together The amount of space licensed to grow cannabis in Canada is now heavily skewed toward outdoor cultivation instead of indoor for the first time according to new data from Health Canada https www newsbreak com news 1501283915298 licensed outdoor cannabis canopy exceeds indoor for first time in canada A growing population of licenses for outdoor growers means that there aren t as many indoor licenses being given out If a company ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD wants to quickly expand into indoor growing OR into the west they would have to purchase an existing company that has the license to quickly do so This is WAY faster and a guaranteed way to obtain a license rather than applying for one and waiting x amount of months and be rejected for some requirement that wasn t met From my own experience outdoor cannabis is subpar quality to indoor grown cannabis So a growing market for outdoor cannabis doesn t necessarily mean its better it is likely just cheaper I would imagine a high quality craft cannabis company would want to purchase them or an existing outdoor growing company that wants to quickly expand to indoor grown cannabis With this being a Canadian company there s a chance a company in another country like Israel would be interested in purchasing it in the near future Planet 13 Holdings Biggest tourist trap in Las Vegas if you re a stoner casual smoker or just wanting to try it From my own experience I think they will continue to be successful If I went around the US trying other brands I d probably be more confident in putting 5 10 of my portfolio into those picks or choosing to not include them lol Like for example I used to have Curaleaf But there s tons of bad feedback on Curaleaf a friend has tried it said the nug is really subpar quality and if I tried their nug I d probably confirm that I wouldn t want to invest in them With Planet 13 i ve seen the ambience and tried the product myself It s definitely a lot of hype price wise but still quality This is my own bias showing but I still think they ve got solid fundamentals and excellent location strong US branding I m well aware of other good stocks like Greenthumb Cresco etc but these stocks haven t been swinging as hard in response to pro cannabis news E g TLRY swung more than 20 some days from pro cannabis news I will likely reduce my current positions shortly after inauguration after some news about the timeline for cannabis legislation and diversify my positions more between these other good picks 2021 is the year of cannabis boys

Here s my opinions make your own decisions So I ll start with the TL DR Pot stocks are gonna over the next 2 years and 2022 23 calls are future printers or as early as 90 days that even Elon himself will raise an eyebrow at Decriminalization is just a layer of icing on a beautiful cake of banking reform Also Biden speaks on the same day Aphria presents at JP Morgan conference big potential Grab your helmet and HOLD the fuck on Okay retards let s talk about weed First off some have mentioned this but nowhere near enough Since the Democrats took the senate the next HUGE catalyst for the marijuana industry is the banking bill this may cause bigger spikes in stocks than even legalization as that will get priced in over time as momentum builds towards full legalization Will stocks go up the day it is passed absolutely But will they be Powell level printers Probably not More like those busted Bitch McConnell ones Basically like Pfizer s lackluster performance after saving the world It was already priced in So I believe pot stocks will do the same over a period of time Meaning again in my opinion the biggest catalyst for Marijuana is the soonest change we can expect from our new government I really expect this to be as soon as February and as late as July of this year for the banking bill Calls out to 2023 are extremely cheap imagining the upside coming but calls in July might as well be BOGO Do your own research as far as what timeline you guess the Senate will take I ll tell you it was said that It will be addressed in the first session Also imagine basically any major company being forced to grow with no reasonable access to capital and no access to common tax write offs that every other company gets to use Can they find debt currently Sure But basically at rates that a subprime lender would get and then some Access to reasonable and competitive capital is gonna be a game changer and allow them to invest and expand into things that are working in preparation of national legalization Also depending on how it all shakes out it may allow companies like Canopy CGC to purchase Acreage A deal already made Or even better companies like Marlboro to purchase Cronos again already a deal Both deals are contingent on federal legalization though Also I really don t think it s a coincidence that Papa Biden is speaking at the JP Morgan conference on the same day as Aphria Thursday Biden speaks first Any kind of renewed commitment to the M O R E act or marijuana decriminalization from Biden would make stocks go on Also I expect Aphria s presentation to go well Why Well other than being retarded we have all been locked down for months You really think stoners stuck at home are smoking less No they are not They are smoking hella weed and playing hella video games Weed stocks and GME Gang are about to do some Ricky Bobby slingshot shit when Biden locks everyone down thanks to Covid 2 0 Though I have no positions in GME just to be clear I pray for the MOASS to be bestowed upon you by Lord Cohen but theres just no way marijuana stocks aren t 1 000 gains just waiting on Senate approval for fucking blastoff So within the next 2 years we can pretty confidently say we will have made huge strides for the marijuana industry under a vice president who was the senate sponsor for the MORE act and a president who wants to make himself appear to fight social injustice Those conversations are going to be hard to have without bringing up marijuana Also a slow path to legalization would be decimation for the chances of small companies to compete considering the infrastructure and experience more established companies will have Not many companies will be in a position to supply a meaningful amount to a national demand In summary for Marijuana moons Marijuana jumps again on news of senate vote for MORE act could jump also if Papa Don t touch me there Biden renews any marijuana commitments MOONS when MORE passes senate jumps on news of full legalization talks and finally baby moons again for legalization and starts a nice slow climb into the industry it is expected to be There s going to be a lot of scaling and growth for quite a while after legalization to meet supply Companies with experience doing this already are going to be in a much better position than newer companies just frantically trying to meet demand Which companies For me I personally like Canopy and Cronos Why Because I m betting on Corona Canopy to do well with a cannabis product in a party bar scene and Marlboro Cronos to do well targeting daily users Marijuana may have been legalized in multiple states but there s still barely any places for consumers to enjoy THC in a social setting regardless of what state you re in There s massive business to be made here once it is an option Alcohol wouldn t be where they are today without bars Regardless just pick one do what you can and I think there will be a pretty green number there very soon Good luck out there retards and don t get in Melvin s van He has the worst fucking candy I promise
