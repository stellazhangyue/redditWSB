Mentioned on Barrons as buy Michael Burry may own calls too ,I own COTY stock and calls and I think you should too Stock is a value play with many catalysts Target 10 to 30 depending in time horizon Here is why I bought 400 contracts of COTY Calls for Feb 19th 7 strike almost 5 of Open interest Price target is 10 post earnings next week A bit of background first so you can understand the reasoning why I am pretty much all in on calls Can post pic of my account below for proof Please do your own due diligence I have read all of the coty annual reports for the past few years transcripts interviews 8k filings i even walked to their headquarters in Amsterdam to see if it was open during the pandemic So when i make a bet I do a lot of research I used to work at a hedge fund and one of the reasons why I quit was because I realized I was helping rich get richer I then moved to Asia and lived there for over 8 years I learned a lot over there and one thing I saw was how asians love brands and can be addicted to them regardless of quality although that has changed a bit Makeup and skincare is popular everywhere and Asians are increasing their usage of perfume too they did not as much 10 to 15 years ago Coty is the number 1 company in the world when it comes to selling perfume or fragrances They own their own brands but also own licenses to a lot of other brands Covergirl Kylie cosmetics and Kylieskin KKW Kim kardashian Burberry license Gucci license Adidas license Wella 40 which includes OPI and a lot of stuff many women use at beauty salon and buy at Sally beauty supply Walgreens etc Over 60 brands which i actually think is too many which is exactly what the new ceo is going to fix Less brands but more revenues per brand There is a new ceo who was a major boss for L Oreal for 20 years and then started her own skincare brand and after 3 years basically was acquihired to join Coty This is the best decision ever made as the stock went from 30 to 3 on shitty management that did a lot of financial engineering and big deals that ended up costing shareholders a lot So here are the catalyst as to why the february numbers are going to be outstanding The company has added new distributors in europe in fact one of the largest that they did not have before 13 of their sales were online or direct that will be 20 or more this quarter which improves the top and bottom line Added new team for China which was badly needed In fact made a marketing deal with a top Chinese celeb and within a few hours sold out of the product they were promoting New products are being launched in skincare category Shitty brands are going to be sold which raises cash for the business More aggressive expansion of skincare products which is going to be a faster part of the business that WallStreet is not modeling I can show you why below Revenue breakdown by product as of the last quarter was the following 55 8 Fragrance 30 Color cosmetics 0 3 Hair 13 7 Skin and Beauty Geography 42 USA and Latin America 47 EMEA Europe 11 Asia Pacific If you compare to L Oreal which is 200 billion market cap vs 5 Billion for Coty 40 Skincare 21 Haircare 18 Makeup 11 Fragrances 11 Hygiene products Geography 42 Asia Pacific 24 North America 18 Western Europe 8 Latin America 6 Eastern Europe 3 Africa Middle East If you compare these businesses you can see how these are night and day Asia growth is anemic for Coty at 123 mm last quarter and will be the fastest segment of the business for the next 5 years I expect it can grow 30 or more a year and be larger than the Americas segment Thu is because there was little exposure given the lack of offerings in the Skincare Also beauty products are consumed more frequently than a fragrance A perfume can last someone a month or 6 months where as a skincare product can last 1 month or maybe 2 It consists of consistent purchases which brings consistent revenues and cash flow to the business something the business needs to improve upon Company has a lot of debt but have paid of 3 billion and will keep paying jt off given the higher profitability 2 5 billion was from sale of 60 of Wella and 1 was a direct investment from KKr via a convertible bond at 6 24 conversion price Stock is 65 owned by insiders and there js not a lot of shares out there to buy So although no squeeze there is definitely scarcity of shares Kylie cosmetics and kylieskin have been growing steadily since their international expansion Ranking as the 22 500 website in the world Both Kylie and Kim will help them grow the cosmetics fragrance and skincare via a DTC offering Those businesses by themselves are like MINI Coty s as they can sell a lot of stuff under their brand I think the comany will do 20 to 30 cents a share in earnings wallstreet estimates are 10 to 20 and are all stuck at 6 5 price targets except Citi which is at 10 she believes turn around is real this time Stock is still below pre covid price and can easily go to 10 to 15 on the turnaround taking shape Wallstreet is sleeping on this one I contacted one of the top retail stock analysts she is on cnbc a lot and her firm does not cover the stock due to lack of institutional interest Have LinkedIn messages to prove this but do not want to out her for business reasons This is where the community can come in and buy shares today at 6 90 or options and sell them to the institutions at 15 or higher when they realize what they missed I own the stock and the options The stock I purchased at 3 33 and still hold and the option I purchased months ago as I felt that WallStreet and main street would catch on to the story but Wells Fargo put out a piece that was quite negative they are in denial of the turnaround and has forced consolidation of the stock for months The reason why I picked the 7 strike js because at the time they were in the money and felt it was a safer bet than say 8 or 10 longer dated calls which started to become too expensive for the risk reward offered I own 400 contracts cost of 785 per contract with strike of 7 with February 19th as expiration UPDATE 1 29 2020 I have added to my stock position from 12 500 shares to 25 000 shares and added 100 more contracts for a total of 500 I feel confident they will do well short term and long term when you see the increased growth of online traffic for all their brands online ever since they started selling directly I have so much more info but I can post it in the comments Take care

DiamondHands and VintageTech Predictions for Tuesday, This post presents several market volumes for multiple stocks with daily price changes in an attempt to explain a possible method to identify future dips in share price Since the last time I automated a TON of the process I used in my last post to predict dips with market volume patterns https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments li5vch i think i found a way to predict dips with nasdaq to where now I can search across stocks WAY FASTER for market volumes starting to sync and rise up For those curious READ the old DD post and linked to a public version there for those wanting to recreate the figures NOTE Jan 26th data is shit for NASAQ BX it shows some stocks having MORE short volume then there was total volume and FINRA actually removed their 26th data and replaced it recently so that date in the plots should be ignored Understanding the Legend F is data from FINRA Daily Volume files NP is data from NASDAQ PSX market s daily volume files NB is data from NASDAQ BX market s daily volume files ShXVo l is the short exempt volume for the day from FINRA ShVol is the short volume for the day from the respective market MaxShXVol is the largest value short exempt daily volume from FINRA for all the data shown MaxSVol is the largest value from the short volume data from respective market TotVol is the day s total volume from the respective market DayChange is the day s closing price minus the opening price divided by the opening price PreOpenActivity is the previous day s close day s open previous day s close Figure 0 Plots for TSLA markets top and bottom show similar values that differ by normalization https preview redd it z2rixi5hyjh61 png width 772 amp format png amp auto webp amp s d45ef261fcc2a2593fd10a4e9bd3fb51bf5519f3 Overview of the Method Using TSLA Identify which days TSLA fell the most Jan 11th Jan 15th Jan 29th and Feb 10th TSLA fell 4 5 Look for patterns and trends in available data around those days NASDAQ BX BLUE and PSX RED short volumes go higher around those days Jan 8th Friday before Monday s Jan 11th dip showed blue and red syncing up and climbing Jan 14th showed similar behaviour but peaked much lower Jan 27th and 28th had red and blue both rising steadily before Jan 29th dip Feb9th going into Feb 10th has a HUGE sharp spike in both red and blue This one seemed VERY sudden and probably could not be used Generalize Findings Different market s short volumes sometime start to move in a similar way before significant dips in price Summary By watching for similar behavior across different markets a possible dip can sometimes be identified the previous trading day and possibly two days prior amp x200B Hopefully the above explained to you the general method that I used in the previous post to predict the drop in the one stock HOWEVER I have not tried this with any other stocks and I have not claimed that this will predict every dip Rather this only appears to predict significant dips in the price where significant is relative to the dataset So how does it work Usually the different markets appear to be independent of each other some high some low trending up or down doing their own thing MOST of the time From what I ve seen when the markets do appear to sync and act in a similar method regarding their short volumes rising together the share price dips The volumes across the three different markets are VERY DIFFERENT and unique for each stock I ve also only looked at data from NASDAQ based exchanges even though some stocks are listed on the NYSE some volume is still done via these markets amp x200B My thoughts to explain all this When different markets all start to think the price is TOO HIGH and start to short the stock this general consensus across the markets becomes a self fulfilling prophecy and the price dips amp x200B amp x200B So without further ado here are the plots that were asked for by popular demand 1

similar market volume behavior across two stocks The recent trend in different short volumes and similar behavior regarding their slope and large dips in price could be compared to either Jan 6th

comparable swings in volumes can t really say anything especially since the NOK has been flat for weeks even back in 2020 Prediction NOK and BB both just forget to set their morning alarms for Tuesday

the software realm such as streaming or telehealth but little did anybody expect consumer spending for what can best be described as luxury goods climb Among this rush of consumer spending we may have completely forgotten a very minor but substantial subcategory of goods which is healthcare that is a luxury what I mean here is health related goods which inherently tend to be high profit margin but also have the benefit of being largely unregulated and fully privatized I m referring specifically to the orthodontics industry which has seen an unprecedented change in usage The orthodontics industry has seen tremendous growth in general due to a change in living standards globally where before a generally cosmetic issue such as the straightness of teeth has now become a social norm This generally profitable industry has now become one of the largest adopters of 3D printing and modeling technology and as we ve seen this is actually a normal industry trend early or developing technologies are mostly implemented in high margin high growth industries that have a significant margin of safety The main company that s in this hyper specific industry I keep bringing up is Align Technologies ALGN this company is the maker of Invisalign and the popular iTero oral scanner Align dominates dental technology inside and outside of the doctor s offices Approximately 84 of Align s business still comes from Invisalign however and that s probably a good thing as Invisalign is their flagship product that has years of research behind it which makes it inherently a high margin good because each Invisalign update is just a minor successive improvement Basically the logic for the revenues follows the if it ain t broke don t fix it mentality and because Align has tied in orthodontists into their ecosystem they ve virtually tied in customers for multiple business lifetimes And despite these strong orthodontist contracts Invisalign is actually primarily sold through a salesforce directly to consumers This is primarily due to the fact that their customer base extends beyond just people who see an orthodontist which is a minority of the population in many places However Align has a potential market size that extends beyond just orthodontic patients because on top of approximately 60 of the world needing help with alignment there s a large market share still in traditional orthodontic gear that could easily be won over Of the 12 million annual orthodontic cases started we estimate that approximately 75 or 8 4 million could be treated using our Invisalign clear aligners In addition approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth A lot of these orthodontic procedures are seen as luxury goods in the developing world but as living standards and innovation expand we can expect dental alignment to be as common a luxury as makeup or other cosmetic goods Due to Align s clear product superiority we can expect a massive exodus from traditional braces towards invisible aligners and this estimate of the possible market share capture would be pretty fair to assume As of now only about of Align s customers are from Asian markets where a huge potential consumer population lies The orthodontics industry as a whole as varying amounts of estimated CAGRs from 8 13 depending on the source For any given industry above 10 CAGR is great For Align in the past quarter alone their revenues increased 28 and their revenue has increased by 22 from 2018 to 2019 A lot of this growth comes from simply having a better product than traditional braces as consumers prefer having a lighter easier to remove and better looking product In terms of their competitive advantage as a product Invisalign is basically unmatched There are new companies popping up in this segment but they re too small to take advantage of as they re not even public The best public comparison that s as hyper focused as ALGN is XRAY or Dentsply Sirona but they lack any competitive advantage whatsoever in terms of providing direct to consumer goods Dentsply is also not even profitable while Align enjoys a net profit margin of 68 this means after every good is sold every employee is paid and every interest payment is made Align will keep 68 of the money they made on selling their Invisalign and iTero products amp x200B On top of this we see revenue growth of over 25 year on year which is outstanding for such a product As more consumers strive towards wanting dental perfection as a norm convenience and technology will be 1 on the list for them Align provides this and they have managed to consumerize and technologize orthodontics This makes them the only eligible candidate within healthcare that has the growth prospect of any other consumer product such as Apple and the iPhone The moat of having orthodontist connections and a 20 year old product line demonstrates that the growth seen here will be sustainable for generations to come On top of this Align has seen zero issues in liquidity with a significant increase in Free Cash Flow in the past 4 years Align also has a spectacular 39 Return on Assets and 57 return on equity All of this spectacular profitability is accompanied by a relatively low valuation Considering it s a tech company with revenue growth matching that of many other growth stocks with inflated valuations the fact that it s profitable alone is a good reason to buy but a P E ratio of 27 also makes it quite tempting The stock price has grown over 120 in the past year which is an indicator that bullish sentiment is still overwhelmingly present On top of this ALGN has seen very low volatility in terms of price movement as well it has basically been a straight line of appreciation so those with a smaller appetite for risk would love to have this one in their portfolio Invisalign suggestion rates show us that the usage of Align s flagship product has yet to reach its full potential On top of this Invisalign is aggressively expanding overseas We continue to expand our Invisalign customer base through the training of new doctors In 2019 we trained 22 270 new Invisalign doctors of which 9 765 were trained in the Americas region and 12 505 in the International region And the cherry on top will be an administration change that will take the US out of a trade war with China On a year over year basis our International Invisalign volume increased 34 0 driven primarily by increased adoption as well as expansion of our customer base in both the EMEA and APAC regions However beginning in the second quarter of 2019 we experienced slower growth rates than prior periods in China primarily due to the US China trade war and resulting economic uncertainty which caused headwind for consumer demand especially for consumption of luxury goods and considered purchases As COVID eventually goes away and so do tariffs that already strong growth should see yet another boost Here s the final line We expect our utilization rates to gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology which continue to strengthen our doctors clinical confidence in the use of Invisalign clear aligners In addition since the teenage and younger market makes up 75 of the approximately 12 million total orthodontic case starts each year and as we continue to drive adoption of teenage and younger patients through sales and marketing programs we expect our utilization rates to improve Clear product advantage sustainable growth and a bargain industry with only overall growth in sight makes Align a worthy long term investment

and my positions aren t in options for this play but considering the massive inflow of new members I suppose that at least some of them are fundamental value investors who want sustainable growth and stocks not volatile derivatives I ll also err on the side of assuming all of you have savings investment accounts along with your gambling ones so this is for those of you have any semblance of risk averse ness In an era of convenience and at home service we ve seen many at home services thrive in the software realm such as streaming or telehealth but little did anybody expect consumer spending for what can best be described as luxury goods climb Among this rush of consumer spending we may have completely forgotten a very minor but substantial subcategory of goods which is healthcare that is a luxury what I mean here is health related goods which inherently tend to be high profit margin but also have the benefit of being largely unregulated and fully privatized I m referring specifically to the orthodontics industry which has seen an unprecedented change in usage The orthodontics industry has seen tremendous growth in general due to a change in living standards globally where before a generally cosmetic issue such as the straightness of teeth has now become a social norm This generally profitable industry has now become one of the largest adopters of 3D printing and modeling technology and as we ve seen this is actually a normal industry trend early or developing technologies are mostly implemented in high margin high growth industries that have a significant margin of safety The main company that s in this hyper specific industry I keep bringing up is Align Technologies ALGN this company is the maker of Invisalign and the popular iTero oral scanner Align dominates dental technology inside and outside of the doctor s offices Approximately 84 of Align s business still comes from Invisalign however and that s probably a good thing as Invisalign is their flagship product that has years of research behind it which makes it inherently a high margin good because each Invisalign update is just a minor successive improvement Basically the logic for the revenues follows the if it ain t broke don t fix it mentality and because Align has tied in orthodontists into their ecosystem they ve virtually tied in customers for multiple business lifetimes And despite these strong orthodontist contracts Invisalign is actually primarily sold through a salesforce directly to consumers This is primarily due to the fact that their customer base extends beyond just people who see an orthodontist which is a minority of the population in many places However Align has a potential market size that extends beyond just orthodontic patients because on top of approximately 60 of the world needing help with alignment there s a large market share still in traditional orthodontic gear that could easily be won over Of the 12 million annual orthodontic cases started we estimate that approximately 75 or 8 4 million could be treated using our Invisalign clear aligners In addition approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth A lot of these orthodontic procedures are seen as luxury goods in the developing world but as living standards and innovation expand we can expect dental alignment to be as common a luxury as makeup or other cosmetic goods Due to Align s clear product superiority we can expect a massive exodus from traditional braces towards invisible aligners and this estimate of the possible market share capture would be pretty fair to assume As of now only about of Align s customers are from Asian markets where a huge potential consumer population lies The orthodontics industry as a whole as varying amounts of estimated CAGRs from 8 13 depending on the source For any given industry above 10 CAGR is great For Align in the past quarter alone their revenues increased 28 and their revenue has increased by 22 from 2018 to 2019 A lot of this growth comes from simply having a better product than traditional braces as consumers prefer having a lighter easier to remove and better looking product In terms of their competitive advantage as a product Invisalign is basically unmatched There are new companies popping up in this segment but they re too small to take advantage of as they re not even public The best public comparison that s as hyper focused as ALGN is XRAY or Dentsply Sirona but they lack any competitive advantage whatsoever in terms of providing direct to consumer goods Dentsply is also not even profitable while Align enjoys a net profit margin of 68 this means after every good is sold every employee is paid and every interest payment is made Align will keep 68 of the money they made on selling their Invisalign and iTero products On top of this we see revenue growth of over 25 year on year which is outstanding for such a product As more consumers strive towards wanting dental perfection as a norm convenience and technology will be 1 on the list for them Align provides this and they have managed to consumerize and technologize orthodontics This makes them the only eligible candidate within healthcare that has the growth prospect of any other consumer product such as Apple and the iPhone The moat of having orthodontist connections and a 20 year old product line demonstrates that the growth seen here will be sustainable for generations to come On top of this Align has seen zero issues in liquidity with a significant increase in Free Cash Flow in the past 4 years Align also has a spectacular 39 Return on Assets and 57 return on equity All of this spectacular profitability is accompanied by a relatively low valuation Considering it s a tech company with revenue growth matching that of many other growth stocks with inflated valuations the fact that it s profitable alone is a good reason to buy but a P E ratio of 27 also makes it quite tempting The stock price has grown over 120 in the past year which is an indicator that bullish sentiment is still overwhelmingly present On top of this ALGN has seen very low volatility in terms of price movement as well it has basically been a straight line of appreciation so those with a smaller appetite for risk would love to have this one in their portfolio Invisalign suggestion rates show us that the usage of Align s flagship product has yet to reach its full potential On top of this Invisalign is aggressively expanding overseas We continue to expand our Invisalign customer base through the training of new doctors In 2019 we trained 22 270 new Invisalign doctors of which 9 765 were trained in the Americas region and 12 505 in the International region And the cherry on top will be an administration change that will take the US out of a trade war with China On a year over year basis our International Invisalign volume increased 34 0 driven primarily by increased adoption as well as expansion of our customer base in both the EMEA and APAC regions However beginning in the second quarter of 2019 we experienced slower growth rates than prior periods in China primarily due to the US China trade war and resulting economic uncertainty which caused headwind for consumer demand especially for consumption of luxury goods and considered purchases As COVID eventually goes away and so do tariffs that already strong growth should see yet another boost Here s the final line We expect our utilization rates to gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology which continue to strengthen our doctors clinical confidence in the use of Invisalign clear aligners In addition since the teenage and younger market makes up 75 of the approximately 12 million total orthodontic case starts each year and as we continue to drive adoption of teenage and younger patients through sales and marketing programs we expect our utilization rates to improve Clear product advantage sustainable growth and a bargain industry with only overall growth in sight makes Align a worthy long term investment

nscc Here s a good explanation of what they do https corporatefinanceinstitute com resources knowledge trading investing depository trust and clearing corporation dtcc https corporatefinanceinstitute com resources knowledge trading investing depository trust and clearing corporation dtcc In a document on the US Treasury s website it states the DTTC s shareholders are many banks DTCC is a holding company of DTC FICC and NSCC which are independent legal subsidiaries There is a single governance structure for the three clearing agencies DTCC governance arrangements are available publicly and updated on a yearly basis last update October 2009 DTCC common shareholders include approximately 362 banks brokerdealers mutual funds and other companies in the financial services industry participating in one or more of DTCC s clearing agency subsidiaries including NSCC See https www treasury gov resource center international standards codes Documents FSAP DAR Settlements NSCC Final 5 2011 2010 pdf https www treasury gov resource center international standards codes Documents FSAP DAR Settlements NSCC Final 5 2011 2010 pdf Let s get this straight the shareholders of DTTC are the banks They govern a 63 trillion company by which its subsidiary inadvertently halted meme stock trading on To be clear I don t know who these banks are Can t find them That seems interesting One internet article claims DTCC s user owners include Citigroup BNP Paribas JP Morgan State Street UBS Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley Virtu Barclays Mellon Bank of America See https netinterest substack com p wtf is dtcc the story of clearing https netinterest substack com p wtf is dtcc the story of clearing I couldn t verify this Better yet read this email by Murray Pozmanter the Managing Director Head of Clearing Agency Services and Global Operations at DTCC He first states that DTCC is the DTCC is the parent company and operator of the U S cash market securities CCPs National Securities Clearing Corporation NSCC Yes the NSSC that runs Robinhood s clearing work Second he states that The DTCC common shareholders include hundreds of banks broker dealers and other companies in the financial services industry that are participants of one or more of DTCC s SIFMU subsidiaries and the DTCC board is currently composed of 19 participant and non participant directors Importantly our ownership structure also ensures that we direct our primary focus toward addressing industry needs and preserving market stability which is especially critical during times of crisis See https www fsb org wp content uploads DTCC 4 pdf https www fsb org wp content uploads DTCC 4 pdf It just gets worse Back in the late 2000 s DTTC was sued for facilitating naked short selling See https www wsj com articles SB118359867562957720 https www wsj com articles SB118359867562957720 Does this uh sound familiar DTTC vigorously defended themselves during the lawsuit arguing they had no role in the naked short selling issue There appears to be an archived article stating DTTC s response to the accusation As DTCC has explained short selling and naked short selling are trading strategies These trading activities are regulated and policed by the marketplaces exchanges the self regulatory organizations and the SEC DTCC is involved in post trade processing which occurs after a trade is completed DTCC has no regulatory authority over trading activity or to release information related to trading activity In fact as we told the WSJ reporters we have no power to force the closing of an open fail no matter what the cause and we do not have the authority to force a buy in So let s also get this straight back in 2007 they claimed to have no authority in pre trading Only post So what the hell happened this month with NSSC and Robinhood then Congress Are you listening Why this matters Recently Robinhood s CEO Vlad spoke with Elon Musk on Clubhouse an app where Musk interviews guests It gets interesting when Musk questions Vlad about the decisions of the NSSC the DTTC subsidiary to post 3 billion of capital at 3 a m in the morning during the meme stock trading frenzy I ll put down the most relevant parts of the conversation here 8 55 Musk Who controls those organizations those clearing houses 9 02 Vlad Awkward pause Um you know it s a consortium It s not quite a government agency You know I don t really know the details of all that 9 15 Musk OK 9 16 Vlad But you know and to be fair we were we were uh I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets Like these are events with these meme stocks and there was a lot of activity so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it s not entirely unreasonable Now square this with Vlad s earlier comments during the interview 4 02 Vlad The request was around 3 billion dollars Um which is an order of magnitude of what it typically is Right so um 4 17 Musk This seems like this sounds like an unprecedented increase in the demand for capital What formula did they use to calculate that 4 25 Vlad Well um yeah just to give context Robinhood up until that point has raised uh you know a little bit around 2 billion in total venture capital up until now So it s a big number Like 2 billion dollars is a large number right So um basically the and you know and I the details are we don t have the full details it s a little bit of an opaque formula but there s a component called the VAR of it which is Value at Risk and um that s based on some fairly quantitative things although it s not fully transparent but it s not kind of publicly shared So uh there are ways to reverse engineer it but it s not kind of publicly shared And then there s a special component that s discretionary and that kind of acts like a multiplier And um basically 5 24 Musk Discretionary like meaning it is just their opinion 5 29 Vlad Yeah there uh it s a little bit I mean I m sure there s something definitely more than just their opinion The full interview is available on YouTube Search Elon Musk Grills Robinhood CEO Vlad Full Interview on Clubhouse Can t post the link Breakdown Vlad is asked by this consortium to post 3 billion 150 of Robinhood s entire venture capital amount at three in the morning or presumably trading will not be cleared However Vlad doesn t really know the details of this consortium but decides it s a good idea to deposit over a billion dollars in capital anyway Moreover this so called consortium apparently by contract can demand whatever they want to I guess every reasonable CEO posts over a billion dollars when asked by a group of people he doesn t really know too much about Further this discretionary posting requirement is completely absent in Robinhood s explanation to clients How do clearinghouses determine how much is required It s pretty technical but the process basically works as follows clearinghouses look at a firm s customer holdings as a portfolio They use a volatility multiplier looking at specific stocks to quantify their risk See https blog robinhood com news 2021 1 29 what happened this week https blog robinhood com news 2021 1 29 what happened this week I mean man is it really technical if the capital requirement can also be an opinion That was conveniently left out The Rub What is Big Money It s 63 fucking trillion dollars

looking into these types of companies Checkpoint is first a Security company with a productline of firewalls and other network related software hardware configurations such as IDS IPS Gateways and

located in Israel but traded on Nasdaq Disclaimer I bought 26 shares for an avarage price of 120 48 on friday Financials Checkpoint is running as a profitable business trading at P E of 20 26 and EPS at 5 96 Checkpoint has had YoY growth in revenue for the past 3 years not looking further back no large outstanding debt to be paid and a free cashflow that covers just about a years worth of expeses

degenerates that have recently joined whilst the markets are closed today for the break I ve been seeing a lot of loss porn lately generally from shares thanks to a certain gaming company but also with people losing on FDs and I feel compelled to at least put this out there to whoever s willing to listen Obligatory this is not financial advice and has been written for informative education purposes amp x200B 1 What are LEAPS LEAPS are basically standard Call or Put options with long term expiries by the books anything beyond 3 months may be considered LEAPS but for me I ll usualy look into 9 months deep in the money options when looking at LEAPS amp x200B 2 How can I make some tendies with LEAPS The key benefits to options let s take long call options as the example is that they magnify your potential gains through the magic of leverage But with these benefits comes some complexities when buying and selling options such as Black Scholes options pricing the Greeks and the risks that come with the leverage Given the recent fat gains from some users here you may feel compelled to jump in and do the same yourself either by yoloing into a share or even worse yoloing into weekly options The latter being the reason why WSB being as infamous as it is The issue with the two methods above for the ones who like making money is that 1 Buying shares is expensive and may not give you the fat upside you are chasing or 2 FDs give you that potential upside but 99 of the time you lose everything you put in as you options dies from theta decay time value of an option I believe LEAPS gives a great middle groud for you bulls out there it gives you near 1 1 exposure to the underlying asset minimised outlay and a longer time horizon for both capital gains tax benefits and protection against short term volatility where you usually get screwed on FDs amp x200B Take AMD as an example solid stock with good financial and future prospects We like the stonk Consider a scenario where you have 10 000 to invest or gamble depends who you talk to I want to walk you through each scenario and possible outcomes of the trade amp x200B Scenario 1 Buy FD 106 Call Feb26 21 expiry 40 per contract x 250 contracts ALL IN Options have two things that make up there value instrinsic and extrinsic value Since at the time of writing the market price is 93 5 this option is well out of the money and has zero intrinsic value All you re paying for is the extrinsic value of option which is the time value and implied volatility IV of the option defined as Theta and Vega in the greeks If the price doesn t hit your 106 strike by expiry you lose your premium of 40 0 4 x 100 shares In the outside chance that it does pump to at or above your strike depending on how fast it rises your option will build more extrinsic value thanks to Vega but also the intrinsic value will rise as you are in the money To simplify the outcomes let s say you hold to expiry because you ain t no paper handed bitch one of two things can happen a Expire OTM or ATM Goodbye 10 000 That s it you gambled and you lost it GG b Sell ITM Welcome to tendy town let s just you sell ITM the day of expiry when the market price if 108 2 on your strike since you bought 250 contract your total gain is 250 x 100 shares x 2 profit 50 000 profit As you can see even with this example of a modest 2 ITM you can make 5x you initial investment But the liklihood is so very low hence the cheap buy in amp x200B Scenario 2 Buy LEAPS 50 Call Jun17 22 expiry 4800 per contract x 2 contracts Since the LEAPS are more expensive you can only afford 2x contracts which equates to 200 shares of expsosure instead of 25 000 So under the same scenario 1 where the price moves to 108 in a week your gain will be 12 per share since you actually bought so deep in the money instead of the OTM where delta is tiny So if you sold your option here you would make a tidy 200x 13 2600 from the same price movement If the price movement was down where your FD expires OTM the LEAP will be fine as you have plenty of time to recovery from the movement Fast forward towards expiry if AMD moves up so does your option value at the rate of Delta if it moves down then the maximum risk is the premium you paid at 9600 where the share price drops to your strike or below In the worst case if AMD tanks and goes to 20 you could opt to buy in at that price 200 shares x 20 4000 leaving your total cost base at 13 600 So even if you convert to a long term play tou can come out with a lower overall cost base for the same exposure amp x200B Scenario 3 Buy Shares 200 shares 93 5 This isn t an exact comparison between scenario 1 and 2 as the initial investment is 18 700 vs the 10k of the options But it exhibits the point that between the extremes of FD s and LEAPS in the call option world the initial equity required to open a position that is on par with the LEAPS and nowhere near the FD s is enormous In this scenario the payout outcome is pretty much inline with buying leaps with the leaps paying out slightly less since in the option price you are paying for a small amount of extrinsic value to have the option given by the option contract amp x200B In summary FD s are basically gambles on very short term volatility please understand this The loss porn is great but I don t want to see people lose their livelihoods LEAPS are a great combo for both long term and short term plays with lower cost based vs shares for the same exposure Processing img vfbp2ymdomh61 Processing img paaljwxnkmh61

30a ET 2 15 2021 Dow Jones GameStop Investors Who Bet Big and Lost Big Mentioned GME By Rachel Louise Ensign Salvador Vergara was so enthusiastic about GameStop Corp in late January that he took out a 20 000 personal loan and used it to purchase shares Then the buzzy stock plunged nearly 80 GameStop s volatile ride is hitting the portfolios of individual investors like Mr Vergara who purchased the stock in a social media fueled frenzy These casual traders say GameStop was their YOLO or you only live once trade They bought around its late January peak betting it would continue its astronomical climb While some cashed out before it crashed others who hung onto their shares are in the red Mr Vergara a 25 year old security guard in Virginia started investing four years ago after deciding he wanted to retire young To save money he drives a 1998 Honda Civic eats a lot of rice and lives with his dad He stashed his savings mostly in diversified index funds which are now valued at about 50 000 Then Mr Vergara a longtime reader of the WallStreetBets page on Reddit saw others posting about buying GameStop shares and the stock s colossal rise He didn t want to touch his index fund investments so instead he got a personal loan with an 11 19 interest rate from a credit union and used it to fund most of his GameStop purchase He bought shares at 234 each GameStop shares started the year around 19 zoomed to nearly 350 and almost hit 500 in intraday trading in late January and then began to spiral back to earth The shares closed Friday at 52 40 down 85 from the peak close I thought it could go up to 1 000 I really believed in that hype which was an awful thing to do Mr Vergara said He plans to hold on to the shares because he believes in the company s turnaround he said and use his paycheck to cover the monthly payments on the personal loan Once the pandemic is over he hopes to move back to his native Philippines live off savings and start a charity The GameStop loss set those plans back about six months he said Free trading and simple to use apps have made it much easier for regular investors to pour money into stocks like GameStop In a world without international travel live entertainment and other usual pastimes brokerage apps such as Robinhood Markets Inc are drawing hordes of new users looking for both a diversion and a jackpot Before the pandemic Patrick Wesolowski checked his portfolio once a week Then the clients of his Chicago area dog walking business stopped taking vacations and started working from home crimping his income and leaving him with lots of free time With business sluggish the 31 year old started spending more time researching stocks to include in his 15 000 portfolio He lurked on WallStreetBets reading about other investors wild bets but not posting much himself It s like reading Florida Man news headlines with a Wall Street twist he said In recent months Mr Wesolowski found himself picking up his smartphone to check his Fidelity Investments brokerage account balance more often He followed the frenzy around GameStop and when shares were approaching 300 decided to put in 3 000 Afterward he checked his portfolio on his phone every 10 minutes At first watching the stock drop made him feel queasy but then he got used to it If I lose it I lose it I m OK It s like going to Vegas Mr Wesolowski said If he still had that money he said he might have put it toward a personal splurge like a vacation For many GameStop represented more than just an investment When Tony Moy bought about 1 200 of the shares two at 379 and two more a few days later at 228 I knew it was intrinsically the wrong move he said Mr Moy wasn t surprised when the stock quickly lost much of its value A casual reader of WallStreetBets he was mostly excited about the push to stick hedge funds with losses Some hedge funds that shorted the stock betting the price would fall suffered big losses though others managed to make money during the turmoil The trade was an outlet for Mr Moy s frustrations after an abysmal year a virtual protest of sorts he said In 2020 after the pandemic shut down large gatherings the Chicago based artist lost most of his income from selling his work at comic conventions He also came down with a bad case of Covid 19 that left him coughing for months He said his more successful investing endeavors have helped him get by financially One of Mr Moy s most recent works of art is inspired by diamond hands a phrase used on Reddit to describe hanging onto your position no matter what He is keeping his GameStop shares as a memento It s going to be a little reminder to me he said of how 2020 was the year when hedge funds had a great year and everyone else was struggling Write to Rachel Louise Ensign at rachel ensign wsj com END Dow Jones Newswires February 15 2021 05 30 ET 10 30 GMT Copyright c 2021 Dow Jones amp Company Inc

guide on how to get the easiest tendies in your life with RAVI indicator with all the steps and requirements for 99 secure 2 YOLOs I will test this myself tomorrow and upload full results Requierements 1 Volatile stocks only No you can t trade NIO or PLTR with this shit forget about it 2 Respectable volume If a stock looks like it had less attention than your dad at his graduation prom don t use this indicator The bigger the volume the better 3 Consistent volume RAVI breaks if it sees a huge long term volume spike and needs to be ignored for some time further detail below amp x200B https preview redd it orohgybernh61 png width 565 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b7bda1bb383b3446c8e4bd7955c70a01a799f7c3 A Stock can be volatile today and barren tomorrow Always check for news How to entry Once you turn on RAVI pay attention to the white lines there is literally nothing else but white lines Once one of the white lines becomes red you go long Once one of the white lines becomes green you go short Sometimes there will be multiple colored lines in a row Don t be scared this is normal and because of that there are two ways to decide on the size of the trade If you are a sane person invest 25 of your account on the first colored line If there is another colored line before you profit double your investment If after that there is a third colored line double it again investing a 100 of your account This isn t Matringale betting strategy if there are two colored lines it doesn t mean that your first trade failed It just means that doubling on the second line increases your profit and sometimes avoids breaking even If you are retarded YOLO on the first candle It is slightly less safe but you will on average have greater profits It depends on your risk management to either choose the careful approach or go full retard Both work well however A compromise strategy is to invest 50 on first and the other 50 on second candle usually the most profitable and safe amp x200B Entry strategy example illustrated https preview redd it 5k8xjs8jrnh61 png width 603 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 4ee563778b2b6a8ec009538d6ac3542da7531841 If you see a stock with little to no volume have huge volume on the next day opening or in the middle of the day you must ignore RAVI for about 40 50 minutes or else you will inevitably lose money RAVI takes volume into account for calculations and massive volume spikes makes it go autistic and recommend losing trades Same goes the other way a stock with huge volume yesterday and tiny volume today isn t a good option for trading RAVI If RAVI fires too often Sometimes RAVI will give signals way too often If there is good volume and volatility most of these signals will still be correct but you have a rare chance of small money loss amp x200B As you can see in an overall uptrend RAVI still nails the majority of the trades for 2 5 amp 37 profit but there are a few mistakes with minor 1 1 5 amp 37 losses and one case of breaking even https preview redd it vn8256cqrnh61 png width 1038 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e866ada3a728e8fbeffb277e801d19c26861c3cc How to exit Usually exit strategies are what breaks otherwise great indicators but not in the case of this one Since RAVI is so accurate and safe holding trades is actually a good idea Once you go in wait for a 2 3 profit and then EXIT This is the safest way of getting consistent profits If there is a huge 5 move happening within 1 single candle hold and exit once the candle finishes If the trade is being negative for more than 10 candles exit for a loss It is rare as you can see but it still happens The losses are however greatly compensated by an overwhelming majority of good trades that pay off the losing ones I will test this method myself on Tuesday I am very confident in my calculations but this is WSB and I have unironic untreated ADHD Yes the method works on paper but I want to test it myself tomorrow before any of you autists launch yourself in and lose money DON T try it yourself until I do As I already said I will post results with both numbers and a video Also 1 This might look similar to RSI since they both take volume into account but they are different RSI has a much lower accuracy and is often silent while RAVI suggests a succesful trade 2 There are multiple versions of RAVI most of them suck dick I personally use the one on etoro To access it create a free empty account then go to watchlists click on a chart icon under any ticker a chart will open Switch to 1 minute chart click on the crayon symbol not the pencil go to Studies II gt RAVI gt Don t touch anything click create You can trade on your own broker while looking at an etoro chart Some people also suggested that Yahoo Finance has it but I m too lazy to check 3 All of the advice and general method is created from data based on many different tickers that meet the criteria not just 1 or 2

comedian George Carlin s take on germs stonks in America amp x200B They can fuck with you anytime they want As long as you put up with it which means of course anytime they want because that s what Americans do now They re always willing to trade away a little of their freedom in exchange for the feeling the illusion of security What we have now is a completely neurotic population obsessed with security and safety and crime and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene and stonks There s another thing stonks Where did this sudden fear of stonks comes from in this country Have you noticed this The media constantly running stories about all the latest stonks Tesla Hertz AMC Gamestop And Americans they panic easily so now everybody is running around buying this and selling that and cutting their gains short and repeatedly listening to the news to avoid all contact with stonks It s ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous lengths In prisons before they give you a lethal injection they ask if you want to sell your GME That s true Well they don t want you to lose any more money And you can see their point Wouldn t want some guy to go to hell and be poor Would take a lot of the sportsmanship out of the whole execution Fear of stonks why these fucking pussies You can t even find a decent YOLO anymore They FUD the shit out of everything now and everybody s afraid of paper hands Hey where s your sense of adventure Take a fucking chance will you You know how many people lose all their tendies in this country from stock market losses every year 9 000 that s all It s a minor risk Take a fucking chance bunch of goddamn pussies Besides what do you think you have diamond hands for They re for holding stonks But they need practice They need stonks to practice on So listen if you ignore all the stonks around you and live a completely sterile life then when the FUD comes after whatever you re holding you won t be prepared And never mind ordinary FUD What are you going to do when some super virus FUD comes along that turns your portfolio into liquid shit I ll tell you what you re going to do you re going to cave and you re going to sell at a loss And you re going to deserve it because you re fucking weak and you got fucking weak paper hands Alright let me tell you a true story about the stock market okay When I was a little boy in New York City we gambled everything we had on pennystonks that were going bankrupt Okay We spun the roulette wheel and put it all on 21 you know just because And at that time the big fear was a market crash Thousands of kids lost their tendies to market crashes But you know something In my neighborhood no one ever lost anything to a market crash NO ONE EVER You know why because we YOLOED ON PENNYSTONKS It strengthened our diamond hands the market never had a prayer We were tempered in raw FUD So personally I never take any special precautions against stonks I don t shy away from people who spread fear and uncertainty I don t listen to anything on TV I don t listen to any financial advisors I don t take advice from billionaries And if one of my stonks drops 50 I double down and buy more of it Even if the company is just a sidewalk cafe in Calcutta The poor section On New Year s morning during a soccer riot And you know something In spite of all that so called risky behavior I never have losses I don t get them I don t get paper hands I don t get FOMO I don t get stressed I don t buy into FUD You know why Because I got good strong diamond hands and they get a lot of practice My diamond hands are equipped with the market equivalent of SEC company updates google trend indicators and HQ sentiment analysis And we have recently acquired positive EMA daily supertrend VWAP and MACD So when my BUY buttons are on patrol reconnoitering the market seeking out bankrupt companies and other undesirables if they see any ANY suspicious looking stonks of any kind they don t fuck around They whip out the DD they buy the motherfucker and deposit the unlucky stonk directly into my portfolio Into my portfolio There s no nonsense There s no Miranda warning There s none of that three strikes and you re out bullshit First offense BAM into the portfolio ya go Oh and speaking of my portfolio I want you to know I don t automatically downsize a stock once its taking up a large of my portfolio Okay Can you deal with that Sometimes I do Sometimes I don t You know when I sell my stonks When I have to buy other stonks That s the only time And you know how often that happens Tops TOPS two maybe three times a week TOPS Maybe a little more frequently before the holidays you know what I mean And I ll tell you something else my paper handed friends You don t always need to trade every day Did you know that It s overkill Unless you work at a firm or have 10 monitors at your disposal or for some reason come in intimate contact with huge amounts of FUD and FOMO every day you don t always need to trade I appreciate it thank you

so far 1 A tribute to George Carlin s thoughts on germs stonks in America amp x200B They can fuck with you anytime they want As long as you put up with it which means of course anytime they want because that s what Americans do now They re always willing to trade away a little of their freedom in exchange for the feeling the illusion of security What we have now is a completely neurotic population obsessed with security and safety and crime and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene and stonks There s another thing stonks amp x200B Where did this sudden fear of stonks comes from in this country Have you noticed this The media constantly running stories about all the latest stonks Tesla Hertz AMC Gamestop And Americans they panic easily so now everybody is running around buying this and selling that and cutting their gains short and repeatedly listening to the news to avoid all contact with stonks It s ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous lengths In prisons before they give you a lethal injection they ask if you want to sell your GME That s true Well they don t want you to lose any more money And you can see their point Wouldn t want some guy to go to hell and be poor Would take a lot of the sportsmanship out of the whole execution Fear of stonks why these fucking pussies You can t even find a decent YOLO anymore They FUD the shit out of everything now and everybody s afraid of losing Hey where s your sense of adventure Take a fucking chance will you You know how many people kill themselves in this country from stock market losses every year 9 000 that s all It s a minor risk Take a fucking chance bunch of goddamn pussies Besides what do you think you have diamond hands for They re for holding stonks But they need practice They need stonks to practice on So listen if you ignore all the stonks around you and live a completely sterile life then when the FUD comes after whatever you re holding you won t be prepared And never mind ordinary FUD What are you going to do when some super virus FUD comes along that turns your portfolio into liquid shit I ll tell you what you re going to do you re going to have paper hands and you re going to sell at a loss And you re going to deserve it because you re fucking weak and you got a fucking weak paper hands Alright let me tell you a true story about the stock market okay When I was a little boy in New York City we gambled everything we had on pennystocks that were going bankrupt Okay We spun the roulette wheel and put it all on 21 you know just because And at that time the big fear was a market crash Thousands of kids lost their lives to market crashes But you know something In my neighborhood no one ever lost anything to a market crash NO ONE EVER You know why because we YOLOED ON PENNYSTOCKS It strengthened our diamond hands the market never had a prayer We were tempered in raw FUD So personally I never take any special precautions against stonks I don t shy away from people who spread fear and uncertainty I don t listen to anything on TV I don t listen to friends or family I don t take advice from billionaries And if one of my stonks drops 50 I double down and buy more of it Even if the company is a sidewalk cafe in Calcutta The poor section On New Year s morning during a soccer riot amp x200B And you know something In spite of all that so called risky behavior I never have losses I don t get them I don t get paper hands I don t get FOMO I don t get stressed I don t buy into FUD You know why Because I got good strong diamond hands and they get a lot of practice My diamond hands are equipped with SEC company updates google trend indicators and HQ sentiment analysis And we have recently acquired positive EMA daily supertrend VWAP and MACD So when my BUY buttons are on patrol reconnoitering the market seeking out bankrupt companies and other undesirables if they see any ANY suspicious looking stonks of any kind they don t fuck around They whip out the DD they buy the motherfucker and deposit the unlucky stonk directly into my portfolio Into my portfolio There s no nonsense There s no Miranda warning There s none of that three strikes and you re out bullshit First offense BAM into the portfolio ya go Oh and speaking of my portfolio I want you to know I don t automatically downsize a stock once its taking up a large of my portfolio Okay Can you deal with that Sometimes I do Sometimes I don t You know when sell my stonks When I have to buy other stonks That s the only time And you know how often that happens Tops TOPS two maybe three times a week TOPS Maybe a little more frequently before the holidays you know what I mean And I ll tell you something else my paper handed friends You don t always need to trade every day Did you know that It s overkill

Documents FSAP DAR Settlements NSCC Final 5 2011 2010 pdf https www treasury gov resource center international standards codes Documents FSAP DAR Settlements NSCC Final 5 2011 2010 pdf Let s get this straight the shareholders of DTCC are the banks They govern a 63 trillion company by which its subsidiary inadvertently halted meme stock trading on How is this not a conflict of interest to the integrity of the free markets To be clear I don t know who these banks are Can t find them That seems interesting One internet article claims DTCC s user owners include Citigroup BNP Paribas JP Morgan State Street UBS Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley Virtu Barclays Mellon Bank of America See https netinterest substack com p wtf is dtcc the story of clearing https netinterest substack com p wtf is dtcc the story of clearing I couldn t verify this Better yet read this email by Murray Pozmanter the Managing Director Head of Clearing Agency Services and Global Operations at DTCC He first states that DTCC is the parent company and operator of the U S cash market securities CCPs National Securities Clearing Corporation NSCC Yes the NSSC that runs Robinhood s clearing work Second he states that The DTCC common shareholders include hundreds of banks broker dealers and other companies in the financial services industry that are participants of one or more of DTCC s SIFMU subsidiaries and the DTCC board is currently composed of 19 participant and non participant directors Importantly our ownership structure also ensures that we direct our primary focus toward addressing industry needs and preserving market stability which is especially critical during times of crisis See https www fsb org wp content uploads DTCC 4 pdf https www fsb org wp content uploads DTCC 4 pdf It just gets worse Back in the late 2000 s DTCC was sued for facilitating naked short selling See https www wsj com articles SB118359867562957720 https www wsj com articles SB118359867562957720 Does this uh sound familiar DTCC vigorously defended themselves during the lawsuit arguing they had no role in the naked short selling issue There appears to be an archived article stating DTCC s response to the accusation back in 2007 As DTCC has explained short selling and naked short selling are trading strategies These trading activities are regulated and policed by the marketplaces exchanges the self regulatory organizations and the SEC DTCC is involved in post trade processing which occurs after a trade is completed DTCC has no regulatory authority over trading activity or to release information related to trading activity In fact as we told the WSJ reporters we have no power to force the closing of an open fail no matter what the cause and we do not have the authority to force a buy in They also stated that Freedom to trade is a cornerstone of our equity markets and a fundamental principle in the regulatory schemes that govern the markets The SEC has flatly rejected the argument that there are such things as phantom shares or credits being created in the market See https web archive org web 20090302054831 http www dtcc com news press releases 2007 wsj response php lpos 3 amp lid 3 https web archive org web 20090302054831 http www dtcc com news press releases 2007 wsj response php lpos 3 amp lid 3 The SEC also notes that the DTCC has a surprising amount of power to halt trading on a security for operational transfer issues of a stock or fraud called chills or freezes See https www sec gov oiea investor alerts bulletins ib dtcfreezes html https www sec gov oiea investor alerts bulletins ib dtcfreezes html But does this include jacking up capital requirements for overly shorted stocks without any public notice and explanation behind the billion dollar deposit Let s also get this straight back in 2007 they claimed to have no authority in pre trading Only post So what the hell happened this month with NSSC and Robinhood then Congress are you listening Why this matters Recently Robinhood s CEO Vlad spoke with Elon Musk on Clubhouse an app where Musk interviews guests It gets interesting when Musk questions Vlad about the decisions of the NSSC the DTCC subsidiary to post 3 billion of capital at 3 a m in the morning during the meme stock trading frenzy I ll put down the most relevant parts of the conversation here 8 55 Musk Who controls those organizations those clearing houses 9 02 Vlad Awkward pause Um you know it s a consortium It s not quite a government agency You know I don t really know the details of all that 9 15 Musk OK 9 16 Vlad But you know and to be fair we were we were uh I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets Like these are events with these meme stocks and there was a lot of activity so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it s not entirely unreasonable Now square this with Vlad s earlier comments during the interview 4 02 Vlad The request was around 3 billion dollars Um which is an order of magnitude of what it typically is Right so um 4 17 Musk This seems like this sounds like an unprecedented increase in the demand for capital What formula did they use to calculate that 4 25 Vlad Well um yeah just to give context Robinhood up until that point has raised uh you know a little bit around 2 billion in total venture capital up until now So it s a big number Like 2 billion dollars is a large number right So um basically the and you know and I the details are we don t have the full details it s a little bit of an opaque formula but there s a component called the VAR of it which is Value at Risk and um that s based on some fairly quantitative things although it s not fully transparent but it s not kind of publicly shared So uh there are ways to reverse engineer it but it s not kind of publicly shared And then there s a special component that s discretionary and that kind of acts like a multiplier And um basically 5 24 Musk Discretionary like meaning it is just their opinion 5 29 Vlad Yeah there uh it s a little bit I mean I m sure there s something definitely more than just their opinion The full interview is available on YouTube Search Elon Musk Grills Robinhood CEO Vlad Full Interview on Clubhouse Can t post the link Breakdown Vlad is asked by this consortium to post 3 billion 150 of Robinhood s entire venture capital amount at three in the morning or presumably trading will not be cleared However Vlad doesn t really know the details of this consortium but decides it s a good idea to deposit over a billion dollars in capital anyway Moreover this so called consortium apparently by contract can demand whatever they want to I guess every reasonable CEO posts over a billion dollars when asked by a group of people he doesn t really know too much about Further this discretionary posting requirement is completely absent in Robinhood s explanation to clients How do clearinghouses determine how much is required It s pretty technical but the process basically works as follows clearinghouses look at a firm s customer holdings as a portfolio They use a volatility multiplier looking at specific stocks to quantify their risk See https blog robinhood com news 2021 1 29 what happened this week https blog robinhood com news 2021 1 29 what happened this week I mean man is it really technical if the capital requirement can also be an opinion that is discretionary That was conveniently left out TLDR The Rub What is Big Money It s 63 fucking trillion dollars The point here is not to peddle some unsupported conspiracy The point is to expose an apparent conflict of interest and demand those in charge of our markets to reestablish public confidence or introduce more regulations Edit Some of you smooth brained folks actually think I m saying this company is valued at 63T READ the post Oh wait I was getting insane unnecessary trash talk on WSB

away at how much Palantir s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG MSFT and CRM Apollo is absolutely incredible and it s going where no clouds have gone before from Humvees to nuclear submarines Lastly it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best of class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir Bottom line I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day You ve come a long way baby https preview redd it fuvi00aejph61 jpg width 1182 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080 TL DR 2 IBM just surrendered to PLTR In the words of POTUS this is a Big Fucking Deal To put it politely IBM and Palantir don t have a very good past relationship So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp First they ignore you Then they laugh at you Then they fight you Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades TL DR 3 Regardless of how good or bad the 2020 earnings are tomorrow I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual 250B market cap for Palantir BP renewing their enterprise deal Rio Tinto and PG amp E signing a new enterprise deals AT amp T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills and 2 500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world etc IE the tea leaves I m reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond It s also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world If they re in I m in TL DR

bullshiters on WSB these days I ll self dox myself I m Jason Payne I joined Palantir in early 2007 when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams and left in 2015 to become the CEO of Ada Diamonds https www adadiamonds com hence my username I joined Reddit to do an official AMA on laboratory grown diamonds https www reddit com r IAmA comments 8pb8d5 i grow diamonds i make custom jewelry with these a few years ago that hit the front page stuck around and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community Thus I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee You may think that I m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD I m not Turns out I have a DD writing fetish Don t kink shame Here s a couple of my prior DDs https medium com Jason Payne on De Beers Tiffany amp Co and the FTC Positions or ban At the current PLTR share price I hold a Keyser S ze position I

9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07 Four things stood out to me Superior Design Language to CRM MSFT and GOOG Palantir has a completely different front end user experience UX than my time at Palantir that I saw for the first time on Demo Day I find it practical beautiful and efficient The design language is called Blueprint Javascript and it s built on React a modern web development platform that Facebook built Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS meaning that anyone can use it https blueprintjs com https blueprintjs com Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data dense interfaces for desktop applications Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce s Lightning the flat UX of Google and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded Getting that balance right is really difficult Deep Investment in Deployability Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software No one buys the backend system so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software Salesforce still hasn t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1 0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system Google s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools Gmail Calendar AdWords etc The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40 75 faster than Salesforce Migration from Find the Terrorist to Cheat Code for War When I was at Palantir the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions Another Redditor described Gotham as cheat code for war and I think that is spot on That s why Palantir has won so many different logistics mission planning command and control etc military contracts recently including the Space Force DoD IL 6 SaaS Approval Palantir moving to IL 6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own but I ll keep it short It s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval https preview

of Demo Day I d give the presenters a C at best I found it rushed confusing and difficult to follow I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content and I ve given 500 Palantir demos in my lifetime My constructive criticism Slow down 15 20 Err on the side of a simpler more approachable lexicon For the love of God stop reading from scripts Use bullet points Handoffs were way to abrupt Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals I m not alone in my take on Demo Day Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation gt I don t know if it is just me but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn t really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way gt gt It lacked charisma and charm and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students gt gt I was watching the demo day presentation and left feeling underwhelmed It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry but from someone outside of it it all sounded greek to me gt gt I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir so here s a direct message to those behind Demo Day if everyone told you that you killed it you really need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power 2 Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me At Palantir we build Iron Man suits not robots No Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits AFAIK Palantir builds cerebral cyborgs not physical cyborgs Palantir s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve cerebral tasks not physical tasks amp x200B Iron Man Cerebral Edition https preview redd it 77xps5ipjph61 jpg width 1000 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s eb3acbee813e27ca69f7b94c9158fba44c6e142a If you have not watched Demo Day yet or you rewatch it listen for how many times they say the words decision and decision makers Why a diamond fisted Iron Man suit Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents 3 The True ROI of Palantir Palantir is really expensive No question about it But you know what s more expensive than Palantir Bad Decisions Being wrong is really really expensive See the Airbus 380 Microsoft s market share of cell phones the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant shorting GME in early January and BMW Mercedes Lexus s dismissal of TSLA The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization For example Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33 There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350 and the Foundry powered decisions led to a 33 improvement in production Palantir doesn t make that claim Airbus makes that claim That s absolutely bonkers and that s why this is no surprise amp x200B Processing img ns8wcvvsjph61 The BP renewal and the new deals PG amp E Rio Tinto Fiat etc prove u petroduct is right If you have complex logistics you should have Foundry Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6 9 How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4 20 how much will their bottom line grow by 2025 Below are a few excerpts from United s Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations however if each of these models decisions are incrementally improved even a little bit the value to United is fucking deep The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry https www linkedin com pulse how data science optimizing united airlines pandemic tom romanowski https www linkedin com pulse how data science optimizing united airlines pandemic tom romanowski gt minor edits for brevity gt gt The return to service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity internal amp external to ensure they re airworthy when we need them Since we don t know when air travel demand will recover the models need to account for slow recoveries fast recoveries and everything in between gt gt Our optimization models consider when big events airframe checks engine overhauls and landing gear overhauls will be due along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them The models also incorporate other factors parts availability and cost available technician hours at each maintenance station ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers aircraft specific mechanical reliability and on time performance and even the quality of the in flight products seats Wi Fi entertainment power outlets gt gt The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program minimizes operating costs and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft the lowest cost aircraft or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event amp x200B 4 Muthafuckin Clouds in Nuclear Submarines Toward the end of the Apollo demo one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines IL 6 Clouds In Nuclear Submarines As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world I can t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server amp x200B Processing img mvmtqwdvjph61 5 Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable overvalued services company that should have the same P E as Accenture Booz BAE etc The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can t scale In my mind the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument When I was at Palantir it was a bitch to build and manage deployments From what I saw on Demo Day Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce Lightning Apex SOQL and Visualforce Eventually Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP Salesforce Microsoft etc but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere Eventually Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments But in the meantime Palantir s Forward Deployed Engineers FDEs will continue to directly manage deployments Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs I no longer worry about the scalability of that team Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir PG amp E ConEd and Entergy Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG amp E 1 year in ConEd and none in Entergy PG amp E improves decision making by 10 and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization ConEd improves decision making by 2 and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result They do not renew Assuming 500k year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir we re talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal To put it another way when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years the FDE overhead is spooky But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long operating system for XXXXXX deals the FDE overhead is not significant Also to be honest there are very few people with TS SCI security clearances that even know what React is much less how to write code against it so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time 6 Should you YOLO on PLTR I m not going to give anyone financial advice but I do want to point out a few things PLTR is not a meme stock Palantir is not a small cap that can move bigly because a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest most important organizations in the world Many of the larger institutional investors still don t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued They may be right A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR CathThey may be right So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up down or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes Regardless of the ticker if you YOLO please YOLO responsibly my friends and for the love of god take some off the table if when you re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like a lot 7 My Appreciation for the Palantir Team I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades what you have built is incredible Thank you As an American thank you As a stockholder thank you Enjoy your tendies you ve earned them my friends 8 How I Play My Lockup Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow I m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares as I think Palantir is in a class of it s own lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position regardless of a good bad or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG like is growth coming over the next 10 years Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years Also with the shares finally unlocked I can borrow against them for the first time I ve already responsibly taken enough off the table pre IPO so I m not in any rush to sell My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of 100B with a ladder up to 250B So I m skeptical that I ll sell any more than 5 of my remaining shares this week That s my 0 02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news So long and thanks for all the tendies See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang

is my first DD It is long but I hope you will enjoy it Read this all or you will die I wanted to do an in depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions an EV company specializing in last mile delivery and work vans ELMS will be the first and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market coming as early as Q3 with no other Class 1 EV as competition They are also bringing a Class 2 EV truck to market next year A key factor in allowing ELMS to be first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the old Hummer plant in Indiana Additionally they have the luxury of working with an already successful EV company allowing for instant transposition of truck plans ready for production ELMS has intrigued me from the get go being an EV company yet it has received little to no attention which is reflected in the current stock price There has been little to no movement on the stock other than some sideways and downwards action which is atypical behavior for most EV companies So what gives After doing some digging it appears that the main concern holding back most investors back from committing to this great company is their connection and relations to CHINA which comes by way of a company in particular called Sokon Automotive This concern is not unwarranted as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the market lately As investors especially when dealing with new companies we want maximum transparency which seems almost impossible any time we re dealing with a Chinese company However as my research has shown the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about In fact it is quite the opposite something that will help propel them forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully developed truck plans and numerous industry connections I The Team First let s take a look at who is behind the team As we have come to know a company is only as good as the team behind it The team behind ELMS is an All Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of experience and accomplishments After looking into each of the team members some interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst different auto EV companies including a connection to Tesla These connections made some of the pieces start to fall into place In particular I wanted to figure out more so their connection to the Chinese players Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about After digging deeper my questions were answered The Allstars The Allstars James Jim Taylor 35 years experience CEO and Founder of ELMS former executive at Karma Former CEO of Workhorse he pivoted the company s focus from the electrification of cars and SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks Former CEO of SF Motors now known as Seres owned by Sokon the company they are working with Worked at General Motors serving as President of Cadillac and CEO of Hummer Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac which contributed to the revival of the brand This guy is the powerhouse behind ELMS James knows what it takes to build a company and what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of EVs He probably has some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to EVs having worked on both Karma with Henrik Fisker of FSR and Workhorse which we all know His innovation and experience on developing different types of EVs will allow for future design and build improvements Jim also Canadian is known as The Great One when it comes to the EV world He is also known as Jim The EV Man Taylor because like the show Home Improvement he is always building and innovating in the garage Jason Luo 25 years experience Executive Chairman and Co Founder of ELMS Former CEO of Key Safety Systems Ford China and Accuride Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems now Joyson Safety Systems one of the largest automotive safety companies in the world Oversaw the company s acquisition of Takata Corporation for 1 6 billion Jason currently serves on the board of directors of Accuride Elo Touch Solutions ATCDrivetrain and Sybridge Technologies He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more importantly with large companies In addition he has been through a few different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit He knows what it takes to come out on top Shauna McIntyre 20 years CEO Sense Photonics Inc LiDAR and Former program lead Google automotive services Alphabet Inc She previously led Google s automotive services program during which time she released Google products including Google Maps into automakers new vehicle models Since 2019 she has served on the Board of Directors of Lithia Motors the world s 3rd largest auto dealer One interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co founder of a group called The North American Council for Freight Efficiency NACFE They focus specifically on turning the transportation industry into a more economical and EV friendly space One video I found on their group website was called High Potential Regions for Electric Truck Deployments It talked about geographical areas they want to focus on and develop one of them being the Great Lakes Guess where the new ELMS factory will be Right around the Great Lakes This group puts out monthly newsletters and events so she can use this board as a means to spread the word throughout the industry Interestingly enough this group just started running an EV truck demo for data collection and analytics and two of the companies already involved are Lightning E motors and Workhorse Richard Peretz 40 years Former CFO United Parcel Service UPS during which time he opened UPS operations in China Richard also helped expand the company s international footprint in many European and Asian countries You can bet that this will help ELMS get some international connections Hes overseen numerous acquisitions as well as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS s IPO in 1999 at the time the largest in U S history He is no stranger to understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one Brian Krzanich 25 years CEO CDK Global one of the biggest technologies for dealerships and Former CEO Intel Corporation Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving company Mobileye This guy is a pimp daddy He was forced to resign from Intel because he got caught having a relationship with an employee You could say she really turned his software into hardware Brian currently serves on the boards of amsAG and Footprint US sustainable technology He previously served on the Boards of Deere amp Company and Semiconductor Industry Association as well as serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone Advisory Committee He is the go to guy for the chips and computers for the vehicles This will help with any autonomous driving they have planned as well as their on board ELMS AIR system more on this later Neil Goldberg 45 yrs Director of Forum Chairman and CEO Raymour amp Flannigan Furniture and Holdings Many years of retailing merchandising and general management experience David Boris 30 years Co CEO and CFO Forum Merger III Corporation Has been involved in approximately 20 merger transactions as a board member underwriter and M amp A advisor Director of Tattooed Chef Inc which completed its merger with Forum Merger II Corporation in October 2020 TTCF has done suprisingly well despite it being one company that I was not fond of due to my nutrition background I think the food itself is over priced crap but it has held steady in price ever since merger completion This bodes well for ELMS The Players Other Members of the Team Jerry Hu 25 years COO Safety expert global operation leadership and Asia head for Key Safety Systems commercial leadership and other management at Accuride and Volkswagen Justin Prann 15 years CCO National VP of Sales and Service for Mahindra Automotive North America in the running for the USPS contract senior positions within BMW North America Kev Adjemian 20 years CTO Global Head of Battery Cells at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems including OTA at Karma Fuel cell battery and electric powertrain R amp D leadership at Nissan Albert Li 20 years CFO of EV startup Byton led by Carsten Breitfeld the now ceo of Farraday Future and Ford China senior positions at Bombardier in charge of aerospace operations in China Benjamin Wu 15 years GC Chief Legal Officer and Administration head for Meridian with extensive experience in M amp A and international corporate transactions for both private and public companies So as we can see this team is ridiculously good and has excellent connections that run deep not only in the US but in China and other places around the world The fact that the Chinese companies that are connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS tell me that there is a legitimacy to their business dealings This team covers many bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev world These players have tons of experience have held top level positions at top tier companies and have the knowledge and know how in many different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall II What Does ELMS Do Now that we know who ELMS is lets take a look at what exactly they do ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial delivery industry Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV companies include First and Only Class 1 The fact that they are a first mover is absolutely HUGE for establishing themselves and cashing in on the opportunity of being alone in the field Factory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production Cars ready by Q3 of this year Most EV companies aren t on the road until 2022 and later Lowest total cost of ownership in Class 1 Already proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China Here is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors Note this is from December so it may have changed some since Only Class 1 no other competition The ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its gasoline counterparts 32 500 7500 credit 25k but has 35 more cargo space at 170 cubic ft and a cheaper total cost of ownership by 35 50 compared to a class 2 The cost per year comes to around 1550 for ELMS Urban Delivery vs 4000 for a regular gas Class 1 It becomes even cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per cubic ft that it provides The 2022 Class 2 3 model will have 218ft It appears that they have plans to make different variations of their Class 1 and Class 3 being able to turn them into Class 2s as well based off individual needs They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles and be capable of a full recharge in as little as two hours These types of vans are used in many capacities of our society For example delivery and ecommerce Amazon Fedex DHL communications Verizon Comcast small businesses local flower shop food trucks and utility and local municipality vehicles There is no lack of demand for these types of vehicles A cool feature that will probably be a huge sales point for ELMS that I think has been overlooked is that they will be upfitting the vans themselves Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a specialist to be equipped to meet the specific needs of that business This includes things like installing custom drawers and cabinets shelving lighting power supplies etc The typical upfitting process involves a 3rd party vendor or sometimes numerous different ones and takes on avg 130 140 days from order to delivery The ELMS custom upfitting process allows for 25 reduction time from order to delivery One warranty single point of contact for customer Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5 ELMS are also currently in talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS Adrian Steel and Auto Truck Group I have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet Custom Upfitting for any business needs Takes out the need for 3rd party Next the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS AIR an over the air programming system I have not been able to find much information about any specifics except for some clues in their investor presentation They will use these over the air data systems in partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many benefits to their customers Some areas that will be serviced include Productivity accurate arrival and departure times true trip miles Optimization increase energy efficiency record powertrain diagnostics vehicle maintenance Compliance electronic driver logs tax reporting vehicle inspection reports Expandability system integration hardware add ons amp software add ins Some of the obvious benefits of a type of system like we see in Tesla for example are the ability for the software updates to happen frequently and easily along with data constantly being in communication with the main servers The more data that is able to be collected the better optimized these services and vehicles can be The experience and knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will be valuable in this aspect What we will end up seeing with a system like this is more and more areas of value for the companies buying it For example there will be savings from being able to easily collect accurate tax data and driving logs from the drivers Time will also be saved with something such as the automated updates and knowing exactly when a van will need to be serviced or inspected As time goes on and more data becomes collected the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be more valuable for both the company and their customers III Sales and Financials The ELMS team has 250 million in trust and 155M PIPE in connection with the merger ELMS will have a 1 4billion enterprise value at closing The ELMS team is expected to have 379 million of cash to fund operations and growth They have said that no additional capital requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash flow With their 379 million cash minus 150mill in debt that gives us 229 million in net cash to work with There are a total of 142 500 000 shares Current market cap at the share price of 12 gives us 1 71 billion ELMS currently has 30 000 pre orders for its delivery van representing a revenue of 1billion They expect another 30 000 to 60 000 orders by the middle of 2021 Some of the companies they are in talks with or have preorders from already include Penske Cox Siemens cant make that up Merchants Enterprise IVS and others These contracts will work directly with companies such as Ikea Best Buy Walmart Fedex Ryder and more The experience and connections of the team will no doubt lead to more contracts in the future The ELMS business plan includes a conservative volume ramp with approximately 4 000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth quarter of 2021 accelerating to approximately 19 000 deliveries in 2022 and approximately 35 000 deliveries in 2023 Our team collectively has decades of experience launching vehicles for global OEMs and so while the facility has an annual production capacity of 100 000 units we are deliberately conservative in our initial volumes so that we can be laser focused on quality and as a new brand establishing an excellent reputation with our customers I have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30 000 preorders being contingent upon satisfaction of customer requirements As you will see shortly this is a successful and more than satisfactory vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its Chinese sales all year I have zero doubt that this team will give the customers everything they want and then some If anything I would expect the ELMS vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart Companies ELMS is in talks with or has pre orders from Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick THEORY 1 ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg Before his run for president last year good ole Petey boy was the mayor of South Bend Indiana He has been known to have very mixed results there in terms of popularity but he did put an emphasis on creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area Guess where the new ELMS factory is located Yup literally right next to South Bend in the bordering town of Mishikawa Could it be possible that ELMS will have first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV delivery or services or maybe additional funding credits Quite possibly We all know of Biden s plan to electrify the US and now Mayor Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas And as a matter of fact Pete Buttigieg actually held a campaign rally at the ELMS Hummer factory last year This means ELMS are 100 on his radar THEORY 2 This picture right here was mentioned in the investor presentation when they were giving examples of how their trucks will be used for municipalities At first glance I thought nothing of it and said hey just some random counties they have worked with The Michigan and Indiana seals make sense since that s where they are located And the California ones also since that s where most of the former employees and Seres motors was headquartered But then I noticed the top left seal from Fairfax Virginia This just so happens to be right next to my hometown so I am very familiar with this area Why does the Fairfax VA seal appear alongside those of Michigan Indiana and California A side note about Fairfax County it is very wealthy and very liberal Turns out they have quite a few Green Initiatives in action Last year they stated that One hundred percent of eligible county vehicles scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021 shall be replaced with electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed can be supported in fiscal year 2021 Just a few weeks ago another article stated Fairfax County Public Schools is getting its first electric school bus today as part of a statewide initiative led by Dominion Energy Interesting It seems quite obvious Fairfax County is gearing up for wide scale EV adoption and wants to do implement it as soon as possible Maryland and D C rank 8th and 9th for highest rate of EV adoption while Virginia ranks 23rd You can be damn sure they will be looking to improve on that number Peculiar section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County VA in the top left Could these be potential county contracts they are working on Speaking of government contracts ELMS has ALREADY received funding from the state of Indiana In late December the Indiana Economic Development Corporation IEDC which leads the state s economic development efforts offered ELMS a series of conditional tax credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs in its factory The IEDC offered up to 10 million in conditional tax credits and up to 200 000 in conditional training grants based on the company s job creation plans The IEDC also offered up to 2 8 million in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment HBI tax credit program based on the company s planned capital investment in Indiana This may not be that much money wise but it is an excellent start to pave the way for future endeavors Another huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the typical startup cost for EV production The typical cost for entry into the N A market is around 1 6 billion With the help of the already successful Sokon which provided about 570 million of investments already ELMS only needs to contribute around 160 million This gives them much more wiggle room to grow and try new things If we compare ELMS money situation versus other EV competitors Rivian s becoming the poster child smoking through 2 billion 3 billion Taylor said If you think 200 million to 300 million for product engineering ours is 80 million That s really just airbags seat belts and adapting to U S safety requirements Tooling is already in place because SERES spent 20 million for the canceled SUV plans Earlier post Hummer occupants also left some usable equipment behind Coming off the existing platform is worth hundreds of millions Taylor said Supplier tooling alone would normally be a couple hundred million Well that s a bargain The institutional ownership of ELMS has been climbing recently There has been multiple funds purchasing within the last week Alpine Global Management bought 2 135 286 shares valued around 25 6million equaling 8 3 of ELMS One of the biggest purchases so far BNP Paribas Asset Management UK 1 665 354 shares 20million Phoenix Holdings Ltd 1 103 741 shares 12million Bank of America 70k shares 1mill Toronto Dominion Bank 15k shares 203k STA Wealth Management 13k shares 176k UBS Group Increased holdings by 90 to 14 418 shares 200k We also have in the past month Polar Asset Management Partners Inc bought a stake worth 10 935 000 P Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth 5 964 000 Gabelli amp Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth 1 772 000 Jefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth 1 305 000 I have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find for total institutional ownership is around 25 30 I would imagine this will get larger once there is an official merger date As investors we would like to see alternative revenue streams to help the company grow ELMS has plans for a few different ways to increase their business One of the main ways is that they will produce their vans for the entire North American market CA and Mexico Europe and China Just from the Chinese sales alone ELMS is estimating a potential upside of 300 million The other major way ELMS will increase revenue is through the monitization of their ELMS AIR data They will gather and mine all the data and services from their vehicles and then use this to provide valuable information that other companies will want to buy They will also use this data to optimize and reduce fleet insurance costs This data has an estimated upside of around 50 100 million in increased revenue As volume and sales also increase they will introduce passenger van models as well as rental or subscription based services Some key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation No additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches Projected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022 Estimated 83 000 Units by 2025 representing 5 of U S Market Revenue projected to reach 3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at 791 Million by end of 2025 IV The Indiana Factory Former Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana Another MASSIVE way that ELMS will save a boatload of cash and speed up the production of their van is through the former Hummer plant that they will be taking over in Mishawaka Indiana This plant was originally used for GM and Hummer and then once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor and his former company Seres This plant has the capacity to assemble 100 000 vehicles annually something that ELMS will most likely need to do by next year The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive Director Bill Schalliol says ELMS has worked out a deal with the United Autoworkers Union which has represented workers at this plant in recent years ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers increasing staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of smaller vans Within four years the company could have 960 employees if it produces a second assembly line manufacturing larger sized delivery vans The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been retrofitted already for electric vehicle production and has a strong supply chain and experienced workforce available Seres had already put 130 million into building this plant for EV use How nice of them Another bonus that will help with the quality and speed of production workers who are already familiar with the plant and assembly line The land itself is not fully used yet either and can be used as a future site for in house manufacturing of parts In addition to this plant as of January a new global headquarters with 31 000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees has been built in Troy Michigan The global headquarters strategically positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners and provides access to one of the world s best automotive talent pools The state of the art facility includes an over 15 000 square feet prototype lab where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and electric motor prototypes as well as complete pre production vehicle builds ELMS also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center where it can work with customers to understand their vehicle specifications and analytics needs as well as conduct test drives In addition to facilitating our growth the design of our new global headquarters will allow for collaboration across all aspects of our engineering from vehicle design prototyping and software development and customer engagement enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers the most efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use cases said James Taylor ELMS plans to open additional offices in California and other locations in proximity to major EV talent and development hubs ELMS plans to build around 4 100 vans by the end of 2021 more than double output to 9 100 vehicles in 2022 when the second vehicle is added and grow to 83 000 for both by 2025 The vehicle and plant are said to be 90 Ready for U S Production Did you read that 90 READY What other EV early starter is at this level Very few if any at all V Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection Ok sounds good you say But what s the deal with this Chinese company that we ve never heard of Sokon sokon my what Sokon deez nuts Yes officially called Dongfeng Sokon known internationally as DFSK They have been around since 2003 and are well established in the Chinese auto world They are one of the top 3 manufacturers actually Sokon has a proven product and demand They have over 200 000 gas models plus 30 000 EVs sold in Asia That equates to over 1 million miles driven a day just off their EVs alone On top of that they were the TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020 in all of China Again Sokon is no no name company It has a large customer base for their EV fleet and these are some legitimate companies that even me and you can recognize This includes ecommerce delivery for JD com and Ali Baba postal service for the China Post utilities for the state grid and shuttles for the Hong Kong International Airport Ok so I guess this isn t some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware company So how are they involved with ELMS This takes us back to Seres formally known as SF Motors the company our very own Jim the EV Man Taylor was CEO of in 2019 Seres was created in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon An interesting side note one of the early members of Seres was the cofounder and former CEO of Tesla Martin Eberhard Guess where Martin worked before this A little company called Atieva now known as Lucid Motors One thing I want to talk about briefly as well is something I have seen mentioned regarding bad reviews from employees online about Seres Glassdoor I believe This has been cited as a reason for concern and uncertainty in regards to how the leadership behind ELMS will function As shown earlier the team and leaders we have here will be the least of our worries when it comes to whipping a formidable team and workforce together Jim only started working around May and Seres had already been bleeding cash and laying off workers The combination of increasing tensions with China and the hardships of trying into expand in multiple countries at once caused the eventual dissolution of Seres in the US I have wondered also if most of these reviews were due to turmoil going on between specific people in the company such as Martin Eberhard and other CEOs He did get into it with meme lord Elon and that ended up leading to his ousting at Tesla At Seres he also ended up leaving them in less than a year and he took people along with him to another EV startup Doesn t sound like much of a team player Seres ended up ceasing their US operations but has continued to survive overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market They will be producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year It doesn t look too bad to be honest kind of like a Porsche Cayenne Now that we know who Sokon is and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity what can they do for ELMS Well they will get many benefits from this partnership They get the existing EV product portfolio of Sokon greatly decreasing the time and R D needed to get off the ground As mentioned before there is already a demand and proven product with these models No guess work needed On top of that they get the customer field experience and warranty data from the millions of miles already driven in these cars This will give ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many aspects of their automated systems and ELMS AIR The high volume of existing supplier based contracts will be used to their advantage as well There will be absolutely no lack of connections or reach that this allstar team won t be able to tap into And then of course the amount of money saved from the Mishawaka plant and already invested Sokon development is well over half a billion dollars Nice VI Is This A Chinese Company The last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS is the important question of Is this a Chinese company or not The short and easy answer is NO ELMS is an Independent U S Entity They will provide Made In USA EVs Sokon will provide the body production parts for ELMS and CATL Tesla supplier will provide the batteries They will use domestic supply for the EV powertrain The inverter and the chassis skateboard design for the batteries will be sourced in the U S Unfortunately ELMS cannot go fully domestic yet but is hoping to transition as much as possible in the future Right now they are also focused on making sure they can get an attractive and affordable price point to its customers Hey made in America Made in Mishawaka Half of it s American he said Our engineers are here The software guys The homologation is all based in Auburn Hills Michigan We plan to source the majority of our EV systems and componentry here in the U S You ll be going into the FedExes Walmarts all these guys I d say there s a low chance to sell them a Chinese truck Taylor said But after we re finished it should be looked at as just a few parts from China If we move all the way into vertical integration we re like everybody else I m not sure we can hang onto that price point So as we can see there is some strategy here at play in order to secure some of these early and first mover advantage contracts VII Technical Analysis Had to delete this because reached max character limit Pretty much nothing overly bearish or bullish ELMS broke below resistance the past 2 days of the 55 EMA so this week we will look for it to rise above it and turn it from resistance back into support VIII Conclusion If you made it this far congratulations This was a journey to China and back I hope from reading this you like me have become much more confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing new company called Electric Last Mile Solutions I came into this looking to alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and seemingly void or negative energy surrounding this company I came out the other end a changed man They say money doesn t grow on trees but they missed one The ELMS tree And it has acorns for all of us Come watch this tree grow with me friend The ELMS tree Disclosure 10 000 warrants 850 commons Disclaimer I am not a financial adviser this is not financial advice Do your own dd Note Options just came out last week Will be accumulating March 12 5C and 15C and June 20C TLDR 1st and only Class 1 EV in the US with no competition Has an amazing team and management Has an EV kitted factory ready for production by Q3 of this year in Indiana Has 30 000 preorders already and expects 30 60k more by next year NOT a Chinese company will just be using Sokon s already successful model and improving on it ONLY CLASS 1 EV

is my first DD It is long but I hope you will enjoy it Read this all or you will die I wanted to do an in depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions an EV company specializing in last mile delivery and work vans ELMS will be the first and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market coming as early as Q3 with no other Class 1 EV as competition They are also bringing a Class 2 EV truck to market next year A key factor in allowing ELMS to be first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the old Hummer plant in Indiana Additionally they have the luxury of working with an already successful EV company allowing for instant transposition of truck plans ready for production ELMS has intrigued me from the get go being an EV company yet it has received little to no attention which is reflected in the current stock price There has been little to no movement on the stock other than some sideways and downwards action which is atypical behavior for most EV companies So what gives After doing some digging it appears that the main concern holding back most investors back from committing to this great company is their connection and relations to CHINA which comes by way of a company in particular called Sokon Automotive This concern is not unwarranted as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the market lately As investors especially when dealing with new companies we want maximum transparency which seems almost impossible any time we re dealing with a Chinese company However as my research has shown the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about In fact it is quite the opposite something that will help propel them forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully developed truck plans and numerous industry connections I The Team First let s take a look at who is behind the team As we have come to know a company is only as good as the team behind it The team behind ELMS is an All Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of experience and accomplishments After looking into each of the team members some interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst different auto EV companies including a connection to Tesla These connections made some of the pieces start to fall into place In particular I wanted to figure out more so their connection to the Chinese players Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about After digging deeper my questions were answered amp x200B The Allstars https preview redd it

products including Google Maps into automakers new vehicle models Since 2019 she has served on the Board of Directors of Lithia Motors the world s 3rd largest auto dealer One interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co founder of a group called The North American Council for Freight Efficiency NACFE They focus specifically on turning the transportation industry into a more economical and EV friendly space One video I found on their group website was called High Potential Regions for Electric Truck Deployments It talked about geographical areas they want to focus on and develop one of them being the Great Lakes Guess where the new ELMS factory will be Right around the Great Lakes This group puts out monthly newsletters and events so she can use this board as a means to spread the word throughout the industry Interestingly enough this group just started running an EV truck demo for data collection and analytics and two of the companies already involved are Lightning E motors and Workhorse Richard Peretz 40 years Former CFO United Parcel Service UPS during which time he opened UPS operations in China Richard also helped expand the company s international footprint in many European and Asian countries You can bet that this will help ELMS get some international connections Hes overseen numerous acquisitions as well as being a leading member of the team that

companies that are connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS tell me that there is a legitimacy to their business dealings This team covers many bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev world These players have tons of experience have held top level positions at top tier companies and have the knowledge and know how in many different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall II What Does ELMS Do Now that we know who ELMS is lets take a look at what exactly they do ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial delivery industry Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV companies include First and Only Class 1 The fact that they are a first mover is absolutely HUGE for establishing themselves and cashing in on the opportunity of being alone in the field Factory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production Cars ready by Q3 of this year Most EV companies aren t on the road until 2022 and later Lowest total cost of ownership in Class 1 Already proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China Here is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors Note this is from December so it may have changed some since amp x200B Only Class 1 no other competition https preview redd it rkcwj2napph61 png width 1719 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 85d0d49117764f39296c81d7c2c7a53928565fc5 The ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its gasoline counterparts 32 500 7500 credit 25k but has 35 more cargo space at 170 cubic ft and a cheaper total cost of ownership by 35 50 compared to a class 2 The cost per year comes to around 1550 for ELMS Urban Delivery vs 4000 for a regular gas Class 1 It becomes even cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per cubic ft that it provides The 2022 Class 2 3 model will have 218ft It appears that they have plans to make different variations of their Class 1 and Class 3 being able to turn them into Class 2s as well based off individual needs They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles and be capable of a full recharge in as little as two hours These types of vans are used in many capacities of our society For example delivery and ecommerce Amazon Fedex DHL communications Verizon Comcast small businesses local flower shop food trucks and utility and local municipality vehicles There is no lack of demand for these types of vehicles A cool feature that will probably be a huge sales point for ELMS that I think has been overlooked is that they will be upfitting the vans themselves Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a specialist to be equipped to meet the specific needs of that business This includes things like installing custom drawers and cabinets shelving lighting power supplies etc The typical upfitting process involves a 3rd party vendor or sometimes numerous different ones and takes on avg 130 140 days from order to delivery The ELMS custom upfitting process allows for 25 reduction time from order to delivery One warranty single point of contact for customer Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5 ELMS are also currently in talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS Adrian Steel and Auto Truck Group I have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet amp x200B Custom Upfitting for any business needs Takes out the need for 3rd party https preview redd it m4grfq9bpph61 png width 1716 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 77f85a1b04e12db2c92c25425567d2052f4dae97 Next the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS AIR an over the air programming system I have not been able to find much information about any specifics except for some clues in their investor presentation They will use these over the air data systems in partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many benefits to their customers Some areas that will be serviced include Productivity accurate arrival and departure times true trip miles Optimization increase energy efficiency record powertrain diagnostics vehicle maintenance Compliance electronic driver logs tax reporting vehicle inspection reports Expandability system integration hardware add ons amp software add ins Some of the obvious benefits of a type of system like we see in Tesla for example are the ability for the software updates to happen frequently and easily along with data constantly being in communication with the main servers The more data that is able to be collected the better optimized these services and vehicles can be The experience and knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will be valuable in this aspect What we will end up seeing with a system like this is more and more areas of value for the companies buying it For example there will be savings from being able to easily collect accurate tax data and driving logs from the drivers Time will also be saved with something such as the automated updates and knowing exactly when a van will need to be serviced or inspected As time goes on and more data becomes collected the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be more valuable for both the company and their customers III Sales and Financials The ELMS team has 250 million in trust and 155M PIPE in connection with the merger ELMS will have a 1 4billion enterprise value at closing The ELMS team is expected to have 379 million of cash to fund operations and growth They have said that no additional capital requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash flow With their 379 million cash minus 150mill in debt that gives us 229 million in net cash to work with There are a total of 142 500 000 shares Current market cap at the share price of 12 gives us 1 71 billion ELMS currently has 30 000 pre orders for its delivery van representing a revenue of 1billion They expect another 30 000 to 60 000 orders by the middle of 2021 Some of the companies they are in talks with or have preorders from already include Penske Cox Siemens cant make that up Merchants Enterprise IVS and others These contracts will work directly with companies such as Ikea Best Buy Walmart Fedex Ryder and more The experience and connections of the team will no doubt lead to more contracts in the future The ELMS business plan includes a conservative volume ramp with approximately 4 000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth quarter of 2021 accelerating to approximately 19 000 deliveries in 2022 and approximately 35 000 deliveries in 2023 Our team collectively has decades of experience launching vehicles for global OEMs and so while the facility has an annual production capacity of 100 000 units we are deliberately conservative in our initial volumes so that we can be laser focused on quality and as a new brand establishing an excellent reputation with our customers I have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30 000 preorders being contingent upon satisfaction of customer requirements As you will see shortly this is a successful and more than satisfactory vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its Chinese sales all year I have zero doubt that this team will give the customers everything they want and then some If anything I would expect the ELMS vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart amp x200B Companies ELMS is in talks with or has pre orders from https preview redd it 6niamm8cpph61 png width 1724 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 31829ca0dab1801b3b92033ced5fb13596095a9e Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick THEORY 1 ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg Before his run for president last year good ole Petey boy was the mayor of South Bend Indiana He has been known to have very mixed results there in terms of popularity but he did put an emphasis on creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area Guess where the new ELMS factory is located Yup literally right next to South Bend in the bordering town of Mishikawa Could it be possible that ELMS will have first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV delivery or services or maybe additional funding credits Quite possibly We all know of Biden s plan to electrify the US and now Mayor Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas And as a matter of fact Pete Buttigieg actually held a campaign rally at the ELMS Hummer factory last year This means ELMS are 100 on his radar THEORY 2 This picture right here was mentioned in the investor presentation when they were giving examples of how their trucks will be used for municipalities At first glance I thought nothing of it and said hey just some random counties they have worked with The Michigan and Indiana seals make sense since that s where they are located And the California ones also since that s where most of the former employees and Seres motors was headquartered But then I noticed the top left seal from Fairfax Virginia This just so happens to be right next to my hometown so I am very familiar with this area Why does the Fairfax VA seal appear alongside those of Michigan Indiana and California A side note about Fairfax County it is very wealthy and very liberal Turns out they have quite a few Green Initiatives in action Last year they stated that One hundred percent of eligible county vehicles scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021 shall be replaced with electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed can be supported in fiscal year 2021 Just a few weeks ago another article stated Fairfax County Public Schools is getting its first electric school bus today as part of a statewide initiative led by Dominion Energy Interesting It seems quite obvious Fairfax County is gearing up for wide scale EV adoption and wants to do implement it as soon as possible Maryland and D C rank 8th and 9th for highest rate of EV adoption while Virginia ranks 23rd You can be damn sure they will be looking to improve on that number amp x200B Peculiar section of their investors presentation which shows Fairfax County VA in the top left Could these be potential county contracts they are working on https preview redd it o34xxz0dpph61 png width 610 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 4c87eb08d3ef475c853527e9fb240fd67547a4c8 Speaking of government contracts ELMS has ALREADY received funding from the state of Indiana In late December the Indiana Economic Development Corporation IEDC which leads the state s economic development efforts offered ELMS a series of conditional tax credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs in its factory The IEDC offered up to 10 million in conditional tax credits and up to 200 000 in conditional training grants based on the company s job creation plans The IEDC also offered up to 2 8 million in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment HBI tax credit program based on the company s planned capital investment in Indiana This may not be that much money wise but it is an excellent start to pave the way for future endeavors Another huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the typical startup cost for EV production The typical cost for entry into the N A market is around 1 6 billion With the help of the already successful Sokon which provided about 570 million of investments already ELMS only needs to contribute around 160 million This gives them much more wiggle room to grow and try new things If we compare ELMS money situation versus other EV competitors Rivian s becoming the poster child smoking through 2 billion 3 billion Taylor said If you think 200 million to 300 million for product engineering ours is 80 million That s really just airbags seat belts and adapting to U S safety requirements Tooling is already in place because SERES spent 20 million for the canceled SUV plans Earlier post Hummer occupants also left some usable equipment behind Coming off the existing platform is worth hundreds of millions Taylor said Supplier tooling alone would normally be a couple hundred million Well that s a bargain The institutional ownership of ELMS has been climbing recently There has been multiple funds purchasing within the last week Alpine Global Management bought 2 135 286 shares valued around 25 6million equaling 8 3 of ELMS One of the biggest purchases so far BNP Paribas Asset Management UK 1 665 354 shares 20million Phoenix Holdings Ltd 1 103 741 shares 12million Bank of America 70k shares 1mill Toronto Dominion Bank 15k shares 203k STA Wealth Management 13k shares 176k UBS Group Increased holdings by 90 to 14 418 shares 200k We also have in the past month Polar Asset Management Partners Inc bought a stake worth 10 935 000 P Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth 5 964 000 Gabelli amp Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth 1 772 000 Jefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth 1 305 000 I have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find for total institutional ownership is around 25 30 I would imagine this will get larger once there is an official merger date As investors we would like to see alternative revenue streams to help the company grow ELMS has plans for a few different ways to increase their business One of the main ways is that they will produce their vans for the entire North American market CA and Mexico Europe and China Just from the Chinese sales alone ELMS is estimating a potential upside of 300 million The other major way ELMS will increase revenue is through the monitization of their ELMS AIR data They will gather and mine all the data and services from their vehicles and then use this to provide valuable information that other companies will want to buy They will also use this data to optimize and reduce fleet insurance costs This data has an estimated upside of around 50 100 million in increased revenue As volume and sales also increase they will introduce passenger van models as well as rental or subscription based services Some key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation No additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches Projected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022 Estimated 83 000 Units by 2025 representing 5 of U S Market Revenue projected to reach 3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at 791 Million by end of 2025 IV The Indiana Factory amp x200B Former Hummer plant that is EV kitted and ready for production in Indiana https preview redd it a37ay5nepph61 png width 1097 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 10c852006122b925ef4433e9f5cc61dc8b6630f7 Another MASSIVE way that ELMS will save a boatload of cash and speed up the production of their van is through the former Hummer plant that they will be taking over in Mishawaka Indiana This plant was originally used for GM and Hummer and then once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor and his former company Seres This plant has the capacity to assemble 100 000 vehicles annually something that ELMS will most likely need to do by next year The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive Director Bill Schalliol says ELMS has worked out a deal with the United Autoworkers Union which has represented workers at this plant in recent years ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers increasing staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of smaller vans Within four years the company could have 960 employees if it produces a second assembly line manufacturing larger sized delivery vans The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been retrofitted already for electric vehicle production and has a strong supply chain and experienced workforce available Seres had already put 130 million into building this plant for EV use How nice of them Another bonus that will help with the quality and speed of production workers who are already familiar with the plant and assembly line The land itself is not fully used yet either and can be used as a future site for in house manufacturing of parts In addition to this plant as of January a new global headquarters with 31 000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees has been built in Troy Michigan The global headquarters strategically positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners and provides access to one of the world s best automotive talent pools The state of the art facility includes an over 15 000 square feet prototype lab where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and electric motor prototypes as well as complete pre production vehicle builds ELMS also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center where it can work with customers to understand their vehicle specifications and analytics needs as well as conduct test drives In addition to facilitating our growth the design of our new global headquarters will allow for collaboration across all aspects of our engineering from vehicle design prototyping and software development and customer engagement enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers the most efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use cases said James Taylor ELMS plans to open additional offices in California and other locations in proximity to major EV talent and development hubs ELMS plans to build around 4 100 vans by the end of 2021 more than double output to 9 100 vehicles in 2022 when the second vehicle is added and grow to 83 000 for both by 2025 The vehicle and plant are said to be 90 Ready for U S Production Did you read that 90 READY What other EV early starter is at this level Very few if any at all V Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection Ok sounds good you say But what s the deal with this Chinese company that we ve never heard of Sokon sokon my what Sokon deez nuts Yes officially called Dongfeng Sokon known internationally as DFSK They have been around since 2003 and are well established in the Chinese auto world They are one of the top 3 manufacturers actually Sokon has a proven product and demand They have over 200 000 gas models plus 30 000 EVs sold in Asia That equates to over 1 million miles driven a day just off their EVs alone On top of that they were the TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020 in all of China Again Sokon is no no name company It has a large customer base for their EV fleet and these are some legitimate companies that even me and you can recognize This includes ecommerce delivery for JD com and Ali Baba postal service for the China Post utilities for the state grid and shuttles for the Hong Kong International Airport Ok so I guess this isn t some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware company So how are they involved with ELMS This takes us back to Seres formally known as SF Motors the company our very own Jim the EV Man Taylor was CEO of in 2019 Seres was created in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon An interesting side note one of the early members of Seres was the cofounder and former CEO of Tesla Martin Eberhard Guess where Martin worked before this A little company called Atieva now known as Lucid Motors One thing I want to talk about briefly as well is something I have seen mentioned regarding bad reviews from employees online about Seres Glassdoor I believe This has been cited as a reason for concern and uncertainty in regards to how the leadership behind ELMS will function As shown earlier the team and leaders we have here will be the least of our worries when it comes to whipping a formidable team and workforce together Jim only started working around May and Seres had already been bleeding cash and laying off workers The combination of increasing tensions with China and the hardships of trying into expand in multiple countries at once caused the eventual dissolution of Seres in the US I have wondered also if most of these reviews were due to turmoil going on between specific people in the company such as Martin Eberhard and other CEOs He did get into it with meme lord Elon and that ended up leading to his ousting at Tesla At Seres he also ended up leaving them in less than a year and he took people along with him to another EV startup Doesn t sound like much of a team player Seres ended up ceasing their US operations but has continued to survive overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market They will be producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year It doesn t look too bad to be honest kind of like a Porsche Cayenne Now that we know who Sokon is and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity what can they do for ELMS Well they will get many benefits from this partnership They get the existing EV product portfolio of Sokon greatly decreasing the time and R D needed to get off the ground As mentioned before there is already a demand and proven product with these models No guess work needed On top of that they get the customer field experience and warranty data from the millions of miles already driven in these cars This will give ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many aspects of their automated systems and ELMS AIR The high volume of existing supplier based contracts will be used to their advantage as well There will be absolutely no lack of connections or reach that this allstar team won t be able to tap into And then of course the amount of money saved from the Mishawaka plant and already invested Sokon development is well over half a billion dollars Nice VI Is This A Chinese Company The last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS is the important question of Is this a Chinese company or not The short and easy answer is NO ELMS is an Independent U S Entity They will provide Made In USA EVs Sokon will provide the body production parts for ELMS and CATL Tesla supplier will provide the batteries They will use domestic supply for the EV powertrain The inverter and the chassis skateboard design for the batteries will be sourced in the U S Unfortunately ELMS cannot go fully domestic yet but is hoping to transition as much as possible in the future Right now they are also focused on making sure they can get an attractive and affordable price point to its customers Hey made in America Made in Mishawaka Half of it s American he said Our engineers are here The software guys The homologation is all based in Auburn Hills Michigan We plan to source the majority of our EV systems and componentry here in the U S You ll be going into the FedExes Walmarts all these guys I d say there s a low chance to sell them a Chinese truck Taylor said But after we re finished it should be looked at as just a few parts from China If we move all the way into vertical integration we re like everybody else I m not sure we can hang onto that price point So as we can see there is some strategy here at play in order to secure some of these early and first mover advantage contracts VII Technical Analysis Had to delete this because reached max character limit Pretty much nothing overly bearish or bullish ELMS broke below resistance the past 2 days of the 55 EMA so this week we will look for it to rise above it and turn it from resistance back into support amp

into this looking to alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and seemingly void or negative energy surrounding this company I came out the other end a changed man They say money doesn t grow

allow them to become the Amazon of financial services , Disclaimer this is a 20 minute read I ve seen a lot of posts on Rocket but no posts focused on their culture A lot of posts explain what they re doing but this one will explain how they re doing it In RKT DD Part One I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap Refer to RKT DD Part 1 Below https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lfsacx but analysts say rkt isnt a buy no shit https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lfsacx but analysts say rkt isnt a buy no shit In RKT DD part II I will discuss the single reason I have such an oversized position in RKT The single reason my bullishness and conviction has not wavered since IPO is because of Rocket s company culture which I was lucky to witness firsthand while working at Rocket from 2013 to 2015 Based on my experience Rocket s culture is the reason no insider selling took place following their lock up expiration period on Feb 2 Rocket employees especially their executives don t view Rocket as just a company They view Rocket almost as a religion which shapes their belief system and influences how they work and live In a 2017 Harvard Business Review article the author discusses how effective cultures oftentimes require shocking rules in order to produce shocking results The first two companies he discusses are none other than AMZN and RKT After living Rocket s culture and researching Amazon s it is astonishing how similar both cultures are Article Link Below https hbr org 2019 12 to build a strong culture create rules that are unique to your company https hbr org 2019 12 to build a strong culture create rules that are unique to your company Both AMZN and RKT are not defined by what they do but rather who they are Amazon s culture is what allows them to be in various industries all while maintaining their identity Culture is the glue that unifies every part of Amazon s diverse business together Culture is the same unifying factor that allows Rocket Founder Dan Gilbert to own and operate over 100 companies 15 of which are under RKT amp x200B Introduction to RKT s ISMs and ISMs Day Rocket s culture is based around 20 ISMs aka philosophies which serve as guiding principles I will admit that these principles are obvious and many companies likely have similar ones But companies values are meaningless unless they are embedded into the company s day to day norms Gilbert indoctrinates new hires by devoting 8 hours every three weeks to host ISMs day ISMs day is a seminar dedicated to understanding the deeper meaning of the core values of Rocket Gilbert spends the entire day explaining how these values allowed him to transform himself from a pizza delivery boy to the owner of an empire with a net worth of 50B They even hand out an ISMs books which are essentially corporate bibles I kid you not if you make a mistake at work some directors will make you read out of the ISMs book as if you were repenting for your Anti ISM sins As a former United States Army captain I can tell you that Rocket s first 4 months of indoctrination was almost as effective as the Army s 11 week Basic Combat Training course held at Ft Benning GA Dan Gilbert understands psych 101 and how to effectively use it to produce his army of soldiers amp x200B Every Client Every Time No Exception No Excuses Like AMZN standards are very high at RKT especially when it comes to customer service If it is discovered that an employee failed to reply to a customer s email or phone call on the same day then they will receive a no return call complaint NRCC No matter if you ve been with the company for 15 years or 15 days if you get three NRCCs then you are automatically fired on the spot no exceptions no excuses My most memorable moment of every client every time no exception no excuses was when I failed to call back a customer who did not qualify for a mortgage The denied customer called the hotline in search of his banker me Three hours after he was routed to my phone I got an email from former Rocket Companies CEO Bill Emerson inquiring on the incident he even CC d Dan Gilbert That s right boys and girls I was on the same email chain as Uncle Dan himself getting bitched at by the former CEO of RKT The former CEO would run circles around Jay Farner The former CEO didn t go through the president of mortgage banking who would then go through the regional vice president who would then go through my director and then to me he cut out all the bureaucratic layers to discover why I failed on one of their guiding principles Rocket HATES red tape bureaucratic layers it is not in line with their culture and they prefer a flat hierarchy The RKT CEO even had a 5 minute call with my director as a follow up CEO Bill Emerson dropped everything he was doing because nothing was more important than one of Rocket s guiding principles every client every time no exceptions no excuses amp x200B It s Not About Who Is Right But What Is Right All individuals within Rocket Companies are held to the same standards defined by the company s ISMs It doesn t matter if you are a lowly janitor or a Regional Vice President with a corner office view Dan Gilbert formed a flat hierarchy reflected in another ISM It s not who is right but what is right I have witnessed a Regional Vice President of Mortgage Banking get double demoted to a banker solely because he started to arrive 20 minutes late to work every other day for a few weeks in a row Those 20 minutes are a big deal because at Rocket Every Second Counts another ISM During my first ISMs day Gilbert and former CEO Bill Emerson further proved they were a flat hierarchy when they gave their personal cell phones to the audience of hundreds of newly hired employees Dan did this to drive home the importance of customer service within Rocket s culture if you guys ever get too busy to return a customer s phone call let either of us know and we will call them for you said Gilbert Of course no one was stupid enough to do this but we knew it was meant to drive home their message on customer focus I witnessed many employees let go for little things like this It served as a reminder that either you lived the ISMs or you left the company Leadership understood toxic attitudes were contagious so they would quickly remove the cancer before it could spread to other teammates If you quit the company and tried to give them your two weeks they would decline and then show you the door I am talking The Office Michael Scott to Toby style exit amp x200B Ignore the Noise ISMs exerted such a strong force on me that even my parents and friends accused Rocket of being a cult but instead of listening to them I would Ignore the noise which is an ISM that means ignore the naysayers and never let them stop you from success There will always be noise in our lives but the truly successful are able to ignore it and complete the task ahead I was legitimately offended when people accused Rocket of being a cult They didn t understand that hard work and hustle was required for the finer things in life Rocket made us proud of the work ethic it instilled so we took it personal when an outsider insulted the empire Dan had built The same empire that is now single handedly saving the City of Detroit We didn t understand why people would bad mouth a company who gave young non college educated kids the chance to make 20 000 a month in exchange for hard work RKT strategically empowered those who were never empowered in exchange for their utmost loyalty and devotion to the company more on that later I also remember when ignore the noise was used against me I complained to a co worker about working another Saturday and instead of agreeing with me he looked at me with an almost robot like stare and said ignore the noise man Rocket had programmed him he wanted no part in speaking ill toward the company that shaped his belief system amp x200B We Are The They Rocket was able to create a culture so strong that the employees within Rocket looked at the company as an extension of themselves Any negative remark against the company was a negative remark against the individual employee which is why I took it personal when people accused Rocket of being a cult We are the they was an effective ISM designed to unify the individuals within Rocket as one We are the they means that there is no they The they is all of us We Are The They One team United All in the mission together amp x200B Action oriented ISMs i e Innovation is rewarded but execution is worshipped we ll figure it out Every Second Counts Rocket s ISMs are a roadmap designed to destroy the conventional bureaucratic BS that is so common in legacy companies like General Motors or IBM Don t you hate when you have hour long meeting at work and by the end no decision was ever made Rocket loves ideas Employees can even email Dan Gilbert directly flat hierarchy when you have an idea But Rocket places more emphasis on action out lined in ISMs above At Rocket they realize you cannot cross every t and dot every I before launching a new innovative idea If you did progress would never be made they emphasized that employees figure it out by doing and trusting the idea and refining along the way A crucial step in acquiring and growing separate businesses and ideas It s not just the customer facing bankers that carry the ethos Every Single Person in the company responds with a sense of urgency Now you naysayers might be asking how do I know if Rocket s culture still is this way and that it extends to every part of the company I left Rocket in 2015 and I am now a supplier for them I deal with their facility management department and they are just as on the ball as their customer facing bank force They respond to my emails the quickest out of any of my 400 customers It is apparent that their culture runs deep and extends throughout the entire company not just their sales team What happens if you are not on the ball Simple you are fired This company is on the lunatic fringe of perfection The same amount of perfection that Amazon demands which is outlined in one of Amazon s 14 leadership principles Insist on the Highest Standards amp x200B Who Does Rocket Hire and why Rocket hires anyone and everyone Gilbert also strategically hires underdogs He doesn t care if you have a college degree high school degree or neither he hires almost anyone to see if they fit into the culture he created If not they are fired at a moment s notice His way of hiring non college educated kids who somewhat embody Detroit is genius The non college educated young 20 year old s are given a second chance a chance to make easily over 6 figures Keep in mind that these are kids who worked jobs such as bartenders or waitresses before Rocket took a chance on them Non college educated employees typically promote faster than the college educated ones Why Because these employees understand that no other company will compensate them the way Rocket does Rocket empowers those who have never been empowered in exchange for their full devotion to the company and its philosophies They are the ambassadors of Dan s ISMs amp x200B How have these ISMs changed me and Detroit These ISMs not only transformed me into a more effective employee but equally they transformed me into a very entitled customer when I was outside of work Whenever I got bad service I would become irritated Rocket had programmed me on how service was supposed to be and that anything short of perfection was unacceptable I didn t realize how truly special and impactful Rocket s culture was until I left and worked for another fortune 500 company Its true leaders either create a culture or the culture will create itself Rocket also used the location of its headquarters as a symbol of hard work and resiliency In 2010 at the height of the recession Detroit s unemployment was 3x the national average Nothing was in downtown Detroit at the time Detroit went from the richest city in the world in the 1950s to the symbol of tragedy at the beginning of the 21st century When companies were leaving Detroit during the height of the recession Dan Gilbert was going against the traffic and moving his entire team from Livonia Michigan to the heart of downtown Detroit I can t explain to you the difference Dan Gilbert has made in downtown Detroit Everyone laughed at Dan s decision to move Rocket Companies to downtown Detroit but Dan followed two ISMs Yes before no and you have to believe it to see it They doubted Dan s ability to revitalize downtown Detroit just as they doubted his ability to issue mortgage loans virtually on the internet in the 1990s just as they doubted his idea to perform the mortgage process on only an app with no loan officer in 2015 The same way they doubted Gilbert could win an NBA championship with one of the worst sports teams in the league do you notice a trend The same way they doubt Dan Gilbert will be able to f ck the shorts who are driving down his stock They re also now laughing at Dan s vision to turn Detroit into the fintech hub of the world But Dan follows you have to believe it to see it to the T And his bold actions inspire his army of soldiers who wear the Rocket badge around their neck Following the 2010 move Detroit has become Rocket s symbol it has totally transformed the company and its employees to have an underdog mentality with the hunger to prove itself The character of the city its grit resilience and fortitude gave the company mythology for the brand and its founder This has been a part of the storytelling mechanism by which Rocket evangelizes itself to the market both locally and beyond and it s quite powerful https preview redd it x9ggu2ubcih61 png width 734 amp format

Why is Rocket s Culture important Rocket is more than a company it is a belief system that unites 20 000 employees to a common goal This belief system allows for many strangers to cooperate effectively just as the belief system of religion connects millions across the globe Culture isn t about what gets done but how it gets done Rocket s belief system can apply to any industry not just mortgages That s why Gilbert pounds into his employee s heads it s not what we do it s who we are that defines us It s why Gilbert went public he wants to compete with silicon valley and incentivize software programmers to join his religion by offering stock options He wants to use RKT stock as currency to acquire other fintech companies and have them adopt his unifying culture which has brought him to where he is today It s why he owns all the historic buildings in the heart of downtown Detroit Yes there s a part of this that is about community and altruism but it is also about business It would be much harder for RKT to capitalize on it s business plan to create the Amazon of financial services if their companies were spread out across different suburbs By owning the majority of Downtown Detroit which he does Rocket is able to capitalize on talent and the millennial trend to work in urban cores all while creating a synergistic energy among Rocket s multiple companies which will further revitalize Detroit in the process I see why those looking from the outside in think that Rocket is just a mortgage company and compare them to United Wholesale Mortgage Company UWMC But those that work there understand mortgages are just the start of Rocket s empire Trust me but as Dan Gilbert would say you have to believe it to see it Gilbert s empire is just getting started

investment decisions based on the whatever I post online or say Firstly I want to thank everyone who commented constructively yesterday on my initial AMC DD https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments ljz99b amc blockbuster dd A lot of good input and questions I thought it d be best to try and summarize address a lot of the concerns raised in a second DD where I can get more into the details in advance of the market opening tomorrow This sequel DD is split in Fundamentals and Mementals A tl dr is at the top of each section At the bottom you ll find my thoughts on catalysts and forward momentum drivers You don t have to agree that s just how I see things I m not trying to convince anyone My position is 15 000 shares at about 2 40 price For those who wonder why I didn t sell at the squeeze I bought the shares before the stock started mooning and had sold covered calls It was too expensive to get out of them so I was rolling them up Unfortunately for me the squeeze subsided before I could extract myself from the calls so I m still in and at a substantial unrealized profit as well My horizon is up to the end of 2021 the latest so I m only assessing the potential for the share price to go up until then I m not in it for years I ll probably sell some CSPs in the meantime and if it stabilizes higher by June or earlier I ll sell some CCs for income I ll preface this DD by saying that in 2020 and it looks like in 2021 as well fundamentals don t mean much one way or another in my opinion It s pure moment trading in the market from what I gather and everything is overvalued Every fucking thing is overvalued so saying that a company s fundamentals aren t that great means shit when you got stocks with bn market caps which have never turned a profit have no product and won t sell anything for years to come Investors are looking for what s least overvalued or what may benefit from momentum over the next few weeks months and jump on it as soon as possible Today 2 15 the markets were closed in N America but Europe was open and anything related to post Covid normalcy skyrocketed All leisure travel stocks mooned even though noone is travelling yet I do really expect something like this will be happening in the american stock market very soon if not immediately as well People will try to position themselves for the post covid times as sentiment shifts to positive I expect big rotations out of tech stocks and likewise into leisure travel socializing and back to business stocks I do think AMC is one of the beneficiaries irrespective of fundamentals or not Finally all my figures are taken from the company s own annual report unless stated otherwise amp x200B Fundamentals tl dr if AMC does not change strategy it will stagnate and it s share price will not move much I think 5 is the bottom anyways so getting in at this price point is fairly low risk Should the price drop more after buying in you can make up the difference with CCs over a few months Should it stay where it s at again selling CCs is a nice way to make money But don t sell CCs just yet because when it rallies you ll be trapped Wait until it s price stabilizes Onto the details Let s get something out of the way really quickly AMC reaching meme status did not do anything for its solvency Nothing nada 0 AMC had managed to raised capital through debt and equity BEFORE it became a meme so shut up with that bullshit and google the timelines Their CEO had announced that bankruptcy is off the table way before the stock took off amp x200B Some share prices for

forever low As you see the AMC share price has fluctuated wildly despite being diluted in the past and despite revenues and profits not growing much Therefore anyone who says this will go to 1 because of debt or dilution is talking out of their ass and is too ashamed to say they are a bear The price has gone up and down despite being diluted and borrowing increasing and it will go up and down again The question is what will drive it either way amp x200B Shares dilution from 2020 onwards Feb 21st 2020 52 5m Class A and 51 7m Class B Jan 2021 287m Class A and 51 8m Class B Jan 2021 44 4m shares added due to convertible bonds sold as shares 2 15 21 estimated shares outstanding are 287m 51 8m 44 4m 383 2m my estimate could be wrong Note there is a difference between shares outstanding and float Float is what is available to buy in the market which is of interest when you start thinking about short interest amp x200B According to the following sites https finviz com quote ashx t AMC

That has nothing to do with my thesis On 2 25 the Q4 ER is taking place so we ll have a definitive answer on shares outstanding Tickets sales customers 2019 356m consumers 2019 NYC LA and Chicago

9bcac6e37fa3fa23c30d671ac3a42c8ddb859237 It appears that there are y o y fluctuations on attendance Adjusting the 2010 box office revenue for inflation https www usinflationcalculator com https www usinflationcalculator com would result in 2019 sales of 12 5bn when real sales were 11 4bn Therefore when adjusted for inflation the box office sales are not keeping up However it s worth noting that neither the ticket price nor the indoor screens have increased by inflation and looking at the figures AMC is making more money per screen I believe the reason why box office sales haven t kept up to inflation is because the strategy for theatres has been stale I also want to believe that COVID has been a wake up call for the theatre industry to diversity and execute on more bold strategies which combined with cost cutting measures should pay off going forward Competition 2019 annual report the 3 largest exhibitors are AMC Regal now bought out and turned private and Cinemark which account for 60 of box office revenues Back in 2000 they accounted for 35 of revenues so there is substantial consolidation happening Non theatrical competition is of course the streaming services cable tv pay per view etc In reality it s only streaming services as pay per view and cable tv is dead as a dodo Current 2021 peers are IMAX Regal and Cinemark Ops 2019 annual report 1 004 theatres 636 in US and 11 041 screens 8 094 in US The rest are in Europe and Saudi Arabia Market leader in USA and Europe 26 of their revenue comes from int l market Europe is reopening fast and the UK GBP biggest int l market for AMC is increasing in value which in combo with a weak US dollar will bolster revenue figures A lot of people commented on AMC not making money and that it s doomed etc Looking at their financials amp x200B https preview redd it 4am3oenr0qh61 png width 1236 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e It seems to me that the biggest bummers with regard to their operating income have been rent and Opex Rent expenses went up purely due to accounting standards but the end result is that it made their EBITDA look worse Should accounting treatment rules had not changed their 2019 EBITDA would have been very close to 2018 Note in one of my responses to a comment in my previous DD I erroneously suggested that s what I thought that the capex servicing and SG amp A were what was dragging them down but that seems to remain stable year on year which are of course dragging them down but are not what causes fluctuations in their yearly profitability Now we know that AMC has done a lot of work to keep rent costs down and has done massive strides to reduce OPEX Hence why I strongly think the profitability margins will improve going forward all else remaining equal Just look at the int l markets where OPEX was the reverse 4 3 down y o y and how it made all the difference in their bottom line Add to that the fact they have gotten rid of a lot of underperforming screens OPEX should go further down as everyone gets vaccinated and any additional spending on COVID sanitizing is no longer necessary Capex Between 2015 2019 AMC has built 37 new theatres with 310 new screens and bought out 700 theatres and 6 500 screens They have doubled their capacity in 5 years That s a lot of CAPEX spending and obviously a lot of borrowing to deliver that Capital spending was 0 5bn in 2019 0 6bn in 2018 and 0 6bn in 2017 This is resulting to about 300m cash outflows to serve that capex per year from 2020 and onwards It appears that capital spending has stopped so at least no more new servicing costs Debt 2019 4 8bn 2020 9 30 5 82bn but we know that in 2021 about 600m was converted to shares so debt should be about 5 2bn currently Again if I ve missed any bonds let me know Comparables Price to Book ttm and 5yr avrg AMC 0 26 1 16 MSGE 0 85 0 63 CNK 2 41 3 12 IMAX 3 34 3 54 AMC has the lowest valued share price amongst its competitors therefore appears the cheapest across the peers It also trades far lower compares to its 5yr average compared to its peers Should the tide change it should see its price equalize to the others then there is a great upside You may say that AMC has a lot of debt etc well the rest are not in a much better position with CNK being screwed with Regal for instance amp x200B Mementals tl dr A lot of positive catalysts await and every single piece of news will boost the price Aside a resurge of COVID there is nothing stopping people returning to the theatres and a slew of blockbusters will be coming out soon to entice them A change of strategy should also help add some growth to the revenue which will only boost prices further If we were to ignore fundamentals like the rest of the market does then we need to look at AMCs potential for popping squeezing or rallying I ll start by saying I don t think a short squeeze is in the books I just doubt it There s a lot of confusion around its short interest and float What I do know is that the float has increased a lot compared to early 2020 but it appears that short interest has increased as well I don t think that shorts have covered to a large extent since mid Jan and I can see through checking the IBKR availability of shares to borrow that shorts are hitting it every day It s worth noting that its share price is now 100 higher than were it was when they were shorting it so who knows but I don t count on it What I m thinking is catalysts that will push the price upwards I do expect that people are just gagging to go back to the cinema That s not going to change once things reopen Things that I expect will make the price rally COVID vaccine roll out proceeds well and movie studios decide to finally start releasing movies That should happen once capacity restrictions are lifted at movie theatres There will be a big marketing push around this in the news NYC and LA announcing the reopening of theatres at full capacity This will happen and will happen soon It will lift the price by a lot as those two are the price revenue makers for AMC Partnership with a major streaming service Netflix Amazon or Disney or even bought up by a major movie studio The synergies are insane and the worst case scenario for those giants balance sheets is negligible Streaming service subscription numbers are stagnating and streaming giants are forced to increase prices hi Netflix to make up for growth Expanding through an acquisition of AMC makes sense to reach out and grow further It ll be like Amazon buying up Walmart Low chance but even chatter about it will push the price up fast Summer and Xmas are the prime seasons where studios release movies This summer should be huge in terms of releases and times well with the reopening of theatres This is guaranteed Wanda converted their shares and is no longer the controlling shareholder This allows substantial more maneouvering ability to the executive team to do things differently COVID restrictions lifted sooner than expected This will allow AMC to use the cash pile it has squirreled for a tough 2021 in repaying debt faster reducing interest expenses and improving its net income Any announcement around retiring debt will push the price up More strategic changes towards PVOD eSPORTS booking theatres to people through apps etc to utilize all the spare seating capacity Even at peak revenue AMC is only using 17 of its seats so it s got a lot of idle capacity it can make money off with 0 additional costs AMC should pivot to additional offerings on top of movie releases to capture more footfall in its screens I do believe that COVID was a wake up call that will push them to more innovative ways of generating revenue As people return to theatres they will realize a lot of locals have shut down There will be consolidation due to natural causes Fewer screens but the same number of movie goers That s a benefit for AMC With sentiment improving around the economy reopening a lot of these stocks that were hit hard by Covid will get extreme tailwinds that will make them rally Look at what happened when the Pfizer vaccine was announced with the massive rotation out of tech stocks I expect similar moves sooner rather than later Biden is doing a decent job with vaccine roll out I believe that 5 is the new bottom of the share and I think we will be seeing a lot of weekly pops with small pullbacks basically higher highs and higher lows going forward If you actively manage your position you may be able to exit at the high points and reenter at the pullbacks for additional profit amp x200B I don t see any negatives aside from COVID resurging for some reason I do believe that the very worst is past for the theatre business amp x200B Finally let me address some common comments I got Netflix why would I go to the movies You ve had netflix for years yet you and everyone else still goes to the movies The movies are not gonna die anytime soon Worst case they won t grow and stagnate but they are here for years to come amp x200B The studios will just offer their movies to streaming and not to theatres Absolute bullshit Theatres are doing the opposite pulling out catalogs from netflix They are in a conundrum as they don t really know what to do They don t want their movies streaming because it s far FAAAAAR less revenue for them through 3rd parties but at the same time cannot create their own platforms to stream The latter is just stupid The CAPEX required to build your own platform is high and the benefit is trivial since they can play movies in theatres and keep the majority of the ticket price Besides streaming movies only works for low budget films Any blockbuster requires the cinematic experience Very few people have top model TVs at home with surround sound and even if they do 4K streamed over the internet results to sub par quality It just does not compare to the cinema quality The only realistic alternative to cinema for home entertainment is having a top of the line tv sound bluray But that s not streaming is it If streaming was to kill off theatres then VHS DVD and Bluray would have done so before Studios would have released straight to DVD why didn t they It never happened and for good reason People go to the movies because of a The cinematic experience b they combine it with a night out c it s a way of socializing and much more That won t go away Btw Disney despite having a streaming platform decided to go ahead with theatrical releases of all its movies in 2021 and won t offer them on streaming at the same time Get it now Another reason why that won t work Look at Disney they offered Mulan through their own platform so what best example to examine They did not offer it as part of the subscription so forget about paying your monthly neftlix and having new movies for free They instead priced it at about 2x movie tickets Even if they are to continue that with their next releases it s not really that much more affordable compared to going to the movies is it So don t expect Universal or 20th Century offering you all their new movies for 10 month Ain t gonna happen amp x200B Theatres have been open since August but noone is going Noone is going not only because of COVID concerns but there are no movies to see You need studios to release their movies for people to return I don t expect them to do so until restrictions are lifted and everyone can safely return to the theatres amp x200B So what else besides James Bond is coming in 2021 why would I go to the cinema for just 1 movie You are an idiot Here is a list of upcoming blockbuster releases https qz com 1948011 the 2021 movie calendar previews hollywoods new normal https qz com 1948011 the 2021 movie calendar previews hollywoods new normal Look at summer time onwards there is a hot movie almost every week Most of the movies in the first half will likely be released in the second half after all making it a bonanza of new films coming out in summer onwards amp x200B Theatres are dead in the long term aren t they We are all dead in the long term I don t care Let s focus in the next six months ok My investment horizon for AMC is up to the end of 2021 the latest In a best case scenario I expect the recovery to be fully priced in by summer time when I will exit or just start selling CCs again I may exit renter several times to what I think may be short term peaks and troughs I m not Buffett so I m not buying for life I m in this for the rally to normalcy amp x200B I may edit this post at

allow them to become the Amazon of financial services , Disclaimer this is a 20 minute read I ve seen a lot of posts on Rocket but no posts focused on their culture A lot of posts explain what they re doing but this one will explain how they re doing it In RKT DD Part One I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap Refer to RKT DD Part 1 Below https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lfsacx but analysts say rkt isnt a buy no shit https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lfsacx but analysts say rkt isnt a buy no shit In RKT DD part II I will discuss the single reason I have such an oversized position in RKT The single reason my bullishness and conviction has not wavered since IPO is because of Rocket s company culture which I was lucky to witness firsthand while working at Rocket from 2013 to 2015 Based on my experience Rocket s culture is the reason no insider selling took place following their lock up expiration period on Feb 2 Rocket employees especially their executives don t view Rocket as just a company They view Rocket almost as a religion which shapes their belief system and influences how they work and live In a 2017 Harvard Business Review article the author discusses how effective cultures oftentimes require shocking rules in order to produce shocking results The first two companies he discusses are none other than AMZN and RKT After living Rocket s culture and researching Amazon s it is astonishing how similar both cultures are Article Link Below https hbr org 2019 12 to build a strong culture create rules that are unique to your company https hbr org 2019 12 to build a strong culture create rules that are unique to your company Both AMZN and RKT are not defined by what they do but rather who they are Amazon s culture is what allows them to be in various industries all while maintaining their identity Culture is the glue that unifies every part of Amazon s diverse business together Culture is the same unifying factor that allows Rocket Founder Dan Gilbert to own and operate over 100 companies 15 of which are under RKT amp x200B Introduction to RKT s ISMs and ISMs Day Rocket s culture is based around 20 ISMs aka philosophies which serve as guiding principles I will admit that these principles are obvious and many companies likely have similar ones But companies values are meaningless unless they are embedded into the company s day to day norms Gilbert indoctrinates new hires by devoting 8 hours every three weeks to host ISMs day ISMs day is a seminar dedicated to understanding the deeper meaning of the core values of Rocket Gilbert spends the entire day explaining how these values allowed him to transform himself from a pizza delivery boy to the owner of an empire with a net worth of 50B They even hand out an ISMs books which are essentially corporate bibles I kid you not if you make a mistake at work some directors will make you read out of the ISMs book as if you were repenting for your Anti ISM sins As a former United States Army captain I can tell you that Rocket s first 4 months of indoctrination was almost as effective as the Army s 11 week Basic Combat Training course held at Ft Benning GA Dan Gilbert understands psych 101 and how to effectively use it to produce his army of soldiers amp x200B Every Client Every Time No Exception No Excuses Like AMZN standards are very high at RKT especially when it comes to customer service If it is discovered that an employee failed to reply to a customer s email or phone call on the same day then they will receive a no return call complaint NRCC No matter if you ve been with the company for 15 years or 15 days if you get three NRCCs then you are automatically fired on the spot no exceptions no excuses My most memorable moment of every client every time no exception no excuses was when I failed to call back a customer who did not qualify for a mortgage The denied customer called the hotline in search of his banker me Three hours after he was routed to my phone I got an email from former Rocket Companies CEO Bill Emerson inquiring on the incident he even CC d Dan Gilbert That s right boys and girls I was on the same email chain as Uncle Dan himself getting bitched at by the former CEO of RKT The former CEO would run circles around Jay Farner The former CEO didn t go through the president of mortgage banking who would then go through the regional vice president who would then go through my director and then to me he cut out all the bureaucratic layers to discover why I failed on one of their guiding principles Rocket HATES red tape bureaucratic layers it is not in line with their culture and they prefer a flat hierarchy The RKT CEO even had a 5 minute call with my director as a follow up CEO Bill Emerson dropped everything he was doing because nothing was more important than one of Rocket s guiding principles every client every time no exceptions no excuses It s Not About Who Is Right But What Is Right All individuals within Rocket Companies are held to the same standards defined by the company s ISMs It doesn t matter if you are a lowly janitor or a Regional Vice President with a corner office view Dan Gilbert formed a flat hierarchy reflected in another ISM It s not who is right but what is right I have witnessed a Regional Vice President of Mortgage Banking get double demoted to a banker solely because he started to arrive 20 minutes late to work every other day for a few weeks in a row Those 20 minutes are a big deal because at Rocket Every Second Counts another ISM During my first ISMs day Gilbert and former CEO Bill Emerson further proved they were a flat hierarchy when they gave their personal cell phones to the audience of hundreds of newly hired employees Dan did this to drive home the importance of customer service within Rocket s culture if you guys ever get too busy to return a customer s phone call let either of us know and we will call them for you said Gilbert Of course no one was stupid enough to do this but we knew it was meant to drive home their message on customer focus I witnessed many employees let go for little things like this It served as a reminder that either you lived the ISMs or you left the company Leadership understood toxic attitudes were contagious so they would quickly remove the cancer before it could spread to other teammates If you quit the company and tried to give them your two weeks they would decline and then show you the door I am talking The Office Michael Scott to Toby style exit amp x200B Ignore the Noise ISMs exerted such a strong force on me that even my parents and friends accused Rocket of being a cult but instead of listening to them I would Ignore the noise which is an ISM that means ignore the naysayers and never let them stop you from success There will always be noise in our lives but the truly successful are able to ignore it and complete the task ahead I was legitimately offended when people accused Rocket of being a cult They didn t understand that hard work and hustle was required for the finer things in life Rocket made us proud of the work ethic it instilled so we took it personal when an outsider insulted the empire Dan had built The same empire that is now single handedly saving the City of Detroit We didn t understand why people would bad mouth a company who gave young non college educated kids the chance to make 20 000 a month in exchange for hard work RKT strategically empowered those who were never empowered in exchange for their utmost loyalty and devotion to the company more on that later I also remember when ignore the noise was used against me I complained to a co worker about working another Saturday and instead of agreeing with me he looked at me with an almost robot like stare and said ignore the noise man Rocket had programmed him he wanted no part in speaking ill toward the company that shaped his belief system amp x200B We Are The They Rocket was able to create a culture so strong that the employees within Rocket looked at the company as an extension of themselves Any negative remark against the company was a negative remark against the individual employee which is why I took it personal when people accused Rocket of being a cult We are the they was an effective ISM designed to unify the individuals within Rocket as one We are the they means that there is no they The they is all of us We Are The They One team United All in the mission together amp x200B Action oriented ISMs i e Innovation is rewarded but execution is worshipped we ll figure it out Every Second Counts Rocket s ISMs are a roadmap designed to destroy the conventional bureaucratic BS that is so common in legacy companies like General Motors or IBM Don t you hate when you have hour long meeting at work and by the end no decision was ever made Rocket loves ideas Employees can even email Dan Gilbert directly flat hierarchy when you have an idea But Rocket places more emphasis on action out lined in ISMs above At Rocket they realize you cannot cross every t and dot every I before launching a new innovative idea If you did progress would never be made they emphasized that employees figure it out by doing and trusting the idea and refining along the way A crucial step in acquiring and growing separate businesses and ideas It s not just the customer facing bankers that carry the ethos Every Single Person in the company responds with a sense of urgency Now you naysayers might be asking how do I know if Rocket s culture still is this way and that it extends to every part of the company I left Rocket in 2015 and I am now a supplier for them I deal with their facility management department and they are just as on the ball as their customer facing bank force They respond to my emails the quickest out of any of my 400 customers It is apparent that their culture runs deep and extends throughout the entire company not just their sales team What happens if you are not on the ball Simple you are fired This company is on the lunatic fringe of perfection The same amount of perfection that Amazon demands which is outlined in one of Amazon s 14 leadership principles Insist on the Highest Standards Who Does Rocket Hire and why Rocket hires anyone and everyone Gilbert also strategically hires underdogs He doesn t care if you have a college degree high school degree or neither he hires almost anyone to see if they fit into the culture he created If not they are fired at a moment s notice His way of hiring non college educated kids who somewhat embody Detroit is genius The non college educated young 20 year old s are given a second chance a chance to make easily over 6 figures Keep in mind that these are kids who worked jobs such as bartenders or waitresses before Rocket took a chance on them Non college educated employees typically promote faster than the college educated ones Why Because these employees understand that no other company will compensate them the way Rocket does Rocket empowers those who have never been empowered in exchange for their full devotion to the company and its philosophies They are the ambassadors of Dan s ISMs amp x200B How have these ISMs changed me and Detroit These ISMs not only transformed me into a more effective employee but equally they transformed me into a very entitled customer when I was outside of work Whenever I got bad service I would become irritated Rocket had programmed me on how service was supposed to be and that anything short of perfection was unacceptable I didn t realize how truly special and impactful Rocket s culture was until I left and worked for another fortune 500 company Its true leaders either create a culture or the culture will create itself Rocket also used the location of its headquarters as a symbol of hard work and resiliency In 2010 at the height of the recession Detroit s unemployment was 3x the national average Nothing was in downtown Detroit at the time Detroit went from the richest city in the world in the 1950s to the symbol of tragedy at the beginning of the 21st century When companies were leaving Detroit during the height of the recession Dan Gilbert was going against the traffic and moving his entire team from Livonia Michigan to the heart of downtown Detroit I can t explain to you the difference Dan Gilbert has made in downtown Detroit Everyone laughed at Dan s decision to move Rocket Companies to downtown Detroit but Dan followed two ISMs Yes before no and you have to believe it to see it They doubted Dan s ability to revitalize downtown Detroit just as they doubted his ability to issue mortgage loans virtually on the internet in the 1990s just as they doubted his idea to perform the mortgage process on only an app with no loan officer in 2015 The same way they doubted Gilbert could win an NBA championship with one of the worst sports teams in the league do you notice a trend The same way they doubt Dan Gilbert will be able to f ck the shorts who are driving down his stock They re also now laughing at Dan s vision to turn Detroit into the fintech hub of the world But Dan follows you have to believe it to see it to the T And his bold actions inspire his army of soldiers who wear the Rocket badge around their neck Following the 2010 move Detroit has become Rocket s symbol it has totally transformed the company and its employees to have an underdog mentality with the hunger to prove itself The character of the city its grit resilience and fortitude gave the company mythology for the brand and its founder This has been a part of the storytelling mechanism by which Rocket evangelizes itself to the market both locally and beyond and it s quite powerful https preview redd it x9ggu2ubcih61 png width 734 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

Rocket is more than a company it is a belief system that unites 20 000 employees to a common goal This belief system allows for many strangers to cooperate effectively just as the belief system of religion connects millions across the globe Culture isn t about what gets done but how it gets done Rocket s belief system can apply to any industry not just mortgages That s why Gilbert pounds into his employee s heads it s not what we do it s who we are that defines us It s why Gilbert went public he wants to compete with silicon valley and incentivize software programmers to join his religion by offering stock options He wants to use RKT stock as currency to acquire other fintech companies and have them adopt his unifying culture which has brought him to where he is today It s why he owns all the historic buildings in the heart of downtown Detroit Yes there s a part of this that is about community and altruism but it is also about business It would be much harder for RKT to capitalize on it s business plan to create the Amazon of financial services if their companies were spread out across different suburbs By owning the majority of Downtown Detroit which he does Rocket is able to capitalize on talent and the millennial trend to work in urban cores all while creating a synergistic energy among Rocket s multiple companies which will further revitalize Detroit in the process I see why those looking from the outside in think that Rocket is just a mortgage company But those that work there understand mortgages are just the start of Rocket s empire Trust me but as Dan Gilbert would say you have to believe it to see it Gilbert s empire is just getting started amp x200B amp x200B To view all of Rocket s 20 ISMs please refer to the link below https www myrocketcareer com

Researchers Needed Now I think I know What Happened EVERYONE READ THIS Do not tell anyone on this thread to buy sell or hold Do not ask anyone if you should buy sell or hold If you do you may be getting unwanted attention from the SEC for trying to manipulate the price of a stock We are not here to try to manipulate the price of GME we are here to try to determine if there is still a possibility that another squeeze is coming and what the facts are surrounding that possibility The SEC may be out for blood on this one so don t give them anything that they can say Esp on a thread that I started Read the following in full 7 Will close out purchases required by Regulation SHO drive up a security s price Close out purchases of stock will not necessarily drive up prices of such stocks One of the primary purposes of Regulation SHO is to clean up open fail positions but not to cause short squeezes The term short squeeze refers to the pressure on short sellers to cover their positions as a result of sharp price increases or difficulty in borrowing the security the sellers are short The rush by short sellers to cover produces additional upward pressure on the price of the stock which then can cause an even greater squeeze Although some short squeezes may occur naturally in the market a scheme to manipulate the price or availability of stock in order to cause a short squeeze is illegal Read this article it s short https www marketwatch com story is gamestop stock being manipulated by social media users or is it free speech legal experts weigh in 11611636278 https www marketwatch com story is gamestop stock being manipulated by social media users or is it free speech legal experts weigh in 11611636278 Any false information I have stated in any and all posts on this subject were mistakes due to the fact that I am a total amateur at trading stocks I m doing the best I can as are most of the people here We are learning all of this on the fly So guys and gals please word your posts carefully Update 2 coming later today Monday Feb 15th UPDATE 1 Wow You guys are awesome So much great information Thanks for posting links to where you got info from it saves us all a lot of time I ve got tons of stuff to research now and lots of good leads to follow thanks to you guys As of right now we have clarified a number of facts about the current situation We have also discovered a few new mysteries to unravel There appear to be several unrelated stocks that showed the exact same spike as GME at the exact same time We expected the ETF s to do that but these are not ETF s with GME in them They seem to have nothing to do with GME at all In addition we have a debate going on over a few key points 1 Can Hedgefunds act as AP s for ETF s I don t know I know banks can 2 Can an ETF get short squoze We know they can just issue more shares and liquidate but is there any way it could happen Also on this point it isn t the fund itself or it s AP s that have to deliver It s whoever is late on delivering the shorts to their customer Meaning in many cases a hedgefund So issuing more shares might dilute the price as a squeeze is happening but why would the ETF give a shit They didn t short the stock some hedgefund did 3 Some are saying that the shorts being covered could have been faked This is a very interesting idea Shorting the ETF s and then gong long on the rest of the equities in the fund to nullify the effect of the short on those while keeping the effect of the target stock being shorted How could this satisfy the fail to delivers for the target stock I don t totally understand this theory yet but it s late and I have to sleep I ll post another update tomorrow Lastly READ THIS IF NOTHING ELSE THIS IS JUST A THEORY AT THIS POINT SOME STUFF I SAY MAY OR WILL BE SLIGHTLY WRONG UNTIL THE DETAILS ARE FIGURED OUT DO NOT MAKE A MOVE IN THE MARKET YET BASED ON THIS THEORY I d feel bad if you lost money before we had a solid thing figured out completely BE NICE TO EACH OTHER WE ARE ALL JUST TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT TOGETHER Original Post I m gonna make this quick If you don t know what I m talking about please research it and then reread this post Okay we know GME came off the Threshold list on Feb 3rd That means they covered almost all of their FTD s fail to deliver Many of these they bought from us on the open market at high prices however many people have speculated that it doesn t seem to be enough We know they stopped many of us from buying and that appears that it may have been collusion to make sure there were enough shares available so that Melvin and friends could buy them to deliver to those they already sold shares they didn t have to But was that even enough They were on the threshold list for 39 days straight and they covered it all in just a few days Maybe But what if it wasn t enough Where did they get the rest of the shares they needed Remember if they don t deliver in 13 days after the 3 day settlement period is up then they lose the right to short sell forever That is why they had to buy at the higher prices and that is the main reason along with the hype that the stock price spiked Now we are all hoping that there will be another spike which would only be true if the short sellers were back in the same situation they were before Many of us speculate that somehow they found a way to just kick the can down the road meaning they put off the squeeze to a future date But the DD on this is lacking Also we have noticed that the price chart for AMC looks identical to the chart for GME other than the price No ne can figure out why other than to speculate that it s just because many people who buy sell GME are also buying and selling AMC at the same time This may or may not be true or may be partially true We don t know for sure Now if they did kick the can down the road somehow then where did they get the shares to cover Enter ETF s There are several ETF s that have GME as part of their portfolio I have only looked at one I need you guys to check out the other ones because I am short on time I checked out a fund whose ticker is XRT Their chart looks exactly like the GME and AMC chart And GME is one of their main stocks that make up part of their fund Coincidence Now there is a thing called an AP which means an Authorized Participant https www investopedia com terms a authorizedparticipant asp https www investopedia com terms a authorizedparticipant asp A ETF s AP is allowed to buy the underlying stocks that make up the ETF and then create new shares of that ETF but they are also allowed to take existing shares of the ETF and liquidate them back into their original stocks Read this https jacobslevycenter wharton upenn edu wp content uploads 2018 08 ETF Short Interest and Failures to Deliver pdf https jacobslevycenter wharton upenn edu wp content uploads 2018 08 ETF Short Interest and Failures to Deliver pdf Now XRT went ON the threshold list on January edit 29th and has remained there to this very day That is the same day that the hedgefunds supposedly covered most of their short positions and the GME spike started to drop as well as about the same time the brokers stopped letting us buy We need to know what happened to the XRT outstanding shares between five days before the 26 27 of January and up to today We also need to know if the short volume increased during that time and any other relevant information that might show whether or not the Hedgefunds used the ETF s to get the shares they needed to cover their FTD s If so they borrowed them from the FTD s which explains why XRT is now on the threshold list right about when GME came off of it For context there are thousands of stocks yet only about 20 are ever on the threshold list at any given day What are the odds considering the relationship between XRT and GME that one would go ON the list right bou tthe same time the other came OFF the list My theory is that the HF s used the ETF s that had shares of GME to cover their failed short positions so that GME would come off the threshold list This would make us all think that the opportunity is over however the ETF s involved are now in the exact same position that GME was in just before the spike They just moved the crisis from one place to another Please post any and only legit research on this and provide links I will do the same as I continue to research this issue Thanks Also I am not a professional when it comes to stocks I am a rank amateur who is just trying to figure this all out I am not advocating any action on the part of anyone else when it comes to buying selling or holding stocks You are responsible for your own actions in the stock market Tl dr seriously copy and read all Of this info Mods

written for AT amp T at the 30C and 30 5C strikes dated for 03 05 https imgur com vZLHCJ6 These contracts started popping up at the start of the month and then exploded February 10th and 11th What makes these calls so odd is the nature of AT amp T It s a boomer dividend stock It experiences little to no volatility It s a behemoth with an insanely large market cap T is extremely resilient to big moves so why are so many options contracts so far OTM in relation to T being gobbled up Someone with a deep pockets and potentially a crystal ball is betting insane amounts of money on T to go above 30 5 a roughly 6 increase at the time of writing within the next three weeks amp nbsp I had a few theories as to what may be going on but was ultimately unsure of what to make of these unusual flows so I decided to keep it at the back of my mind and start to look for answers amp nbsp Catalyst 1 AST SpaceMobile To those who don t know SpaceMobile is the first and only space based cellular broadband network able to be accessible by standard smartphones SpaceMobile will effectively be able to provide both 4G and 5G connectivity to your phone ANYWHERE on the planet AT amp T has been in talks with AST about using their satellite network to provide 5G to their users which I think is pretty nifty Nothing has been confirmed yet however an FCC filing over the summer hinted at a commercial agreement AST says that they plan on providing North American coverage for AT amp T as early as Phase 2 of their satellite launch Overall I think this is a pretty awesome deal as the technology ensures that all AT amp T cellular dead zones in North America would be effectively eliminated making AT amp T more attractive than it s competitors in the consumer cell phone market Could this warrant a jump in price Absolutely amp nbsp Catalyst 2 5G Airwave Auction Every time someone accesses the internet through their smartphone their wireless carrier transmits that data through the airwaves on frequencies that only it has the license to use Currently there is an active auction Auction 107 for air wave licenses within the 5G spectrum band that has netted a record grand total of 81 billion dollars from various big players in the industry such as Verizon AT amp T T Mobile etc Bidding concluded on Friday January 15th with winning bidders having the opportunity to further bid for frequency specific licenses in the assignment phase which began on Monday February 8 2021 The larger the portion of 5G spectrum a company acquires the better situated they ll be when 5G becomes the new normal standard among consumers The performance jump from 5G is going to be so dramatic that if carriers are not in that game they re going to get left behind On January 31st it was revealed that once the assignment phase is completed in the coming weeks the winners will be announced Coincidentally this lines up right before the expiration of these options leading me to believe the call buyer s could be betting that AT amp T won a large slice of the spectrum easily warranting the needed 6 jump amp nbsp Catalyst 3 PLTR Partnership Here is where things start to get a little spicy It is rumored that PLTR and AT amp T have signed a partnership agreement As asinine as it sounds these claims are easily backed up PLTR and AT amp T seem to have been in talks about collaborating for a bit as leaked by an employee on LinkedIn https i redd it of9onix9izg61 png The employee alludes to the fact that he was a key person in getting PLTR approved by the AT amp T chief data office with the timing and duration of his position reinforcing the fact that the contract is still fairly new Furthermore there have been a large magnitude of job postings from AT amp T in Texas that had PLTR as a high preferred necessary qualification This brings us to out next lead amp nbsp Luxoft a large Digital Strategy Consulting firm has a newly posted Data Analyst role in Plano Texas Some key takeaways from the posting https www dice com jobs detail data analyst luxoft usa inc plano tx 75023 newageny 6846840 amp nbsp Our client is looking to Luxoft for help to scale the deployment timeline of a network ticketing and orchestration system into five new centers This person would analyze Network operations center data via PowerBI and on the Palantir platform Under Mandatory skills there s Worked in Palantir or other big data analytics platforms Under Nice to have skills there s Experience in telecommunication industry amp nbsp So we know that Luxoft wants someone with PLTR experience to scale and deploy some form of network into five new centres in Plano Texas If we go to the Plano Economic Development website we find an incredibly important article https www planotexas org 269 ATT launches new innovation center in Pl The key takeaway from it is that amp nbsp AT amp T announced plans to open new innovation centers in Atlanta and Plano Texas to open in coming months giving it a total of five such centers worldwide amp nbsp As a result we can conclude that the undisclosed Luxoft client is AT amp T and that the new system they are looking to deploy across five new centers are the new AT amp T innovation centers the first of which is the one located in Plano Texas where all of the hiring is taking place To top it all off there was a recently posted position at AT amp T looking for people for their Professional Advanced Analytics Operations Transformation program located in Plano Texas https www att jobs job plano professional advanced analytics operations transformation 117 18772894 amp nbsp Given Palantir s meme power and excitement for the future a partnership could provide very beneficial to both companies resulting in a swift upward trajectory to AT amp Ts underlying price as well amp nbsp Bearish Counterpoints AT amp T is under a mountain of debt The most of any publicly traded company and they re losing subscribers from DirectTV and cable faster than they projected further adding to this issue At the same time for them to keep up with 5G they re to pay additional billions in a spectrum auction and then need to pay many billions more to roll out 5G From a financial standpoint this is a massive red flag but with interest rates still at 0 it is unlikely do be an immediate issue especially with the shorter dated March contracts Another thing to consider is that AT amp T is a behemoth of a company PLTR Partnering with T may very well be akin to a fly landing on an aircraft carrier Although its everyone s favorite meme stock with a promising future the partnership may ultimately end up being negligible in the movement of AT amp T s stock price The same could be said for any of the above catalysts so please proceed with caution amp nbsp Conclusion With such a large number of potential catalysts combined with the extremely cheap price of the contracts 10 a pop at the time of writing I feel like this offer is a little too good to pass up Best case scenario you hit a multi bagger Worst case scenario you don t buy Wendy s for lunch on Wednesday and vow never to touch boomer stocks I hope you all enjoyed this comprehensive DD on the unusual options flow of AT amp T If you would like to follow me for future DD you can either DM me or find my socials linked below in the comments or on my profile amp nbsp TLDR AT amp T has been experiencing some insanely large magnitudes of unusual options flow Whales are gobbling up T 2021 03 05 C 30 and 30 5 like candy This is likely due to them having insider information regarding one of the potential catalysts AT amp T either partnered with AST SpaceMobile to eliminate cellular dead zones in their network won the bidding war and managed to gain a favorable monopoly on the 5G airwave infrastructure or partnered with none other than PLTR for an upcoming super project amp nbsp TLDR of TLDR Buy T 2021 03 05 C 30 OR 30 5 amp nbsp Sources https www lightreading com ossbss
