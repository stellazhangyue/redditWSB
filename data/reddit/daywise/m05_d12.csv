dive DD so please let me know your thoughts in the comments All constructive criticism potential holes in my analysis and or feedback welcomed About Company EZCORP Inc provides pawn loans in the United States and Latin America It operates its business through following segments U S Pawn Latin America Pawn Lana and Other International The U S Pawn includes its EZPAWN Value Pawn amp Jewelry and other branded pawn operations in United States The Latin America Pawn consist of Empeno Facil amp other branded pawn operations in Mexico and GuatePrenda amp MaxiEfectivo pawn operations in Guatemala El Salvador Honduras and Peru The Lana segment is customer centric web based engagement platform The Other International segment involves consumer finance activities in Canada The company was founded in 1989 and is headquartered in Rollingwood TX The listed name for EZPW is EZCORP Inc Class A Non Voting Common Stock Financial Overview EZPW is a low risk undervalue stock with high upside potential It has a market cap of 373M which seem low compared to numbers on listed on their 2020 Income Statement Balance Sheet For 2020 they had a Yearly Sales Revenue of 822M Gross Income of 418M and Total Equity of 649M all of which is larger than their current market cap They have low short term debt 49 74M which can easily be cover by the 312M in cash they are sitting on For long term dept they have 404M but feel comfortable that as their cash on hand will be able to cover nearly half of that which is make it much more manageable now that we are recovering from covid This was already a undervalue play before the pandemic but covid dragged it even farther leaving a lot of margin for safety to enter now The stock price bad mostly been trending down the past 5 years which I felt was an over reaction due to growth estimates at the time To support that both their Sales Revenue and Total Equity were increasing year over year for the past 5 years during that same time and felt it would have continued into 2020 had it not been for covid o Financials https www marketwatch com investing stock ezpw financials https www marketwatch com investing stock ezpw financials Why I think they can Bounce back now Job Report The past jobs report which completely missed expectations actual is a benefit to EZPW Stimulus checks hurt EZPW recovering sooner because people didn t need to pawn their stuff with the money received from government stimulus With the job report being so low it supports the notion that they are no longer working as they are keeping Americans from going back to work Just recently companies like Chipotle and Sheetz announced wage increases to retain and attract addition employees as they were having hard time filling their job openings Demand for these jobs are filled by lower wage class citizens which are the core customers for pawn shops Once stimulus checks run out this demographic will start pawning their stuff again o Job Report Miss https www bloomberg

png amp auto webp amp s 4e7407233a635eefa7c0d458019e4bd74aa41f36 Pawn Fees Bound to Bounce back The main money maker for Pawn shops is the fees EZPW collects on service charges and loans given This is literally the pawn business Both their pawn service charges PSC and pawn loans outstanding PLO have been hurt severely due to stimulus check covid However these are expected to bounce back when things return to normal which will start happening soon Covid has forced them to learn how to better manage inventory and become more efficient in limiting their operating expenses So if both PSC and PLO just get back to their normal levels it will bring in more profit due to budget improvements TA As stated already this stock was trending down for most of the last 5 years before covid However since the end of January their lows have continued to increase giving me reason to believe it has already reached it s bottom The stock is almost back to it s 52 week high from this year but still has plenty of gap to fill from years prior So although it has started to have a good run the last week I still think there is plenty more room to continue and actually see them getting back to their 52

we ignore them This is nothing too crazy but I feel like it s couldn t hurt to remind traders and discuss how our minds can sometimes lead us into danger despite warnings amp x200B The Psychology of Warnings https www visualexpert com Resources psychwarnings html gt Warning signs and labels are everywhere Many factors are conspiring to fill the world with more injunctions against our desired behavior Daily life is increasing in complexity while technology continually invents more powerful machines drugs and chemicals Moreover the cost of injury and insurance as well as accompanying litigation is spiraling upward rapidly As a result failures of warning compliance cause costly social and economic impact gt gt Unfortunately warnings often fail to change people s behavior Either the warning goes unnoticed or as increasingly happens the warning is seen but ignored gt gt gt gt Factors Affecting Compliance gt gt 1 Cost of Compliance gt gt Many studies have found that warning signs are more likely to be ineffective if the cost of compliance is high Reducing compliance costs is a very effective way to increase safety but it is necessary to understand where the viewer s costs arise Recall that the viewer has a goal in mind when using a device or navigating an environment The costs relate to the ability to achieve the goal as quickly and as easily as possible gt gt Yachts and tendies NOW amp x200B gt 2 Danger Perception gt gt Viewer history with the product or environment strongly affects danger perception The greater the experience with no negative outcome the lower the level of perceived danger This is the cry wolf or familiarization effect where people quit paying attention to uninformative input The effect can be both specific to a particular product a single drug or can generalize to all similar products same type of drugs or to the warnings source those government do gooders are at it again or The company is just covering itself gt gt One of the ironies of warnings is that the more experienced and skilled the viewer the stronger the familiarization effect and the more likely that the warning will be ignored gt gt Stonks go up Printers go brrr In Powell we trust amp x200B gt Warning Appearance gt gt Marshall McLuhan s famous aphorism the medium is the message applies to warning labels The physical appearance of the warning may inadvertently communicate hazard severity Most people have unconsciously learned the general rule that signs and signals grow in size and vividness with their importance presumably so that they will be more readily seen Viewers will then likely interpret warnings that are small faint or located peripherally as signaling lower risk gt gt We want Michael Burry s tendies but we don t actually want to be anything like Michael Burry amp x200B gt 3 Decision Making gt gt Risk Taking gt gt When the viewer ignores a warning it could be because s he viewed the cost of compliance as very high or because s he underestimated the danger However studies show that some people engage in risky actions across a wide variety of circumstances They likely have a high tolerance for risk rather than a tendency to underestimate danger in specific circumstances Moreover these risk takers were less likely to comply with warnings In fact the prospect of danger may decrease their compliance because the viewer s goal might involve courting danger gt gt GUH amp x200B gt Social Factors gt gt We live in a social context so other people affect individual notions of norms standards and acceptable behavior It is not surprising that degree of viewer behavior may be affected by whether other people are complying with the warning gt gt Bears are amp x200B amp x200B Warnings and Warning Labels https www

article https www gmo com americas research library waiting for the last dance by Jeremy Grantham https en wikipedia org wiki Jeremy Grantham Made 265 mil on MVIS lol so he s only sorta amp x200B gt All bubbles end with near universal acceptance that the current one will not end yet because Because in 1929 the economy had clicked into a permanently high plateau because Greenspan s Fed in 2000 was predicting an enduring improvement in productivity and was pledging its loyalty or moral hazard to the stock market because Bernanke believed in 2006 that U S house prices merely reflect a strong U S economy as he perpetuated the moral hazard if you win you re on your own but if you lose you can count on our support Yellen and now Powell maintained this approach All three of Powell s predecessors claimed that the asset prices they helped inflate in turn aided the economy through the wealth effect Which effect we all admit is real But all three avoided claiming credit for the ensuing market breaks that inevitably followed the equity bust of 2000 and the housing bust of 2008 each replete with the accompanying anti wealth effect that came when we least needed it exaggerating the already guaranteed weakness in the economy This game surely is the ultimate deal with the devil gt gt Now once again the high prices this time will hold because interest rates will be kept around nil forever in the ultimate statement of moral hazard the asymmetrical market risk we have come to know and depend on The mantra of late 2020 was that engineered low rates can prevent a decline in asset prices Forever But of course it was a fallacy in 2000 and it is a fallacy now In the end moral hazard did not stop the Tech bubble decline with the NASDAQ falling 82 Yes 82 Nor in 2008 did it stop U S housing prices declining all the way back to trend and below which in turn guaranteed first a shocking loss of over eight trillion dollars of perceived value in housing second an ensuing weakness in the economy and third a broad rise in risk premia and a broad decline in global asset prices see Exhibit 1 All the promises were in the end worth nothing except for one the Fed did what it could to pick up the pieces and help the markets get into stride for the next round of enhanced prices and ensuing decline And here we are again waiting for the last dance and eventually for the music to stop gt gt gt gt Either way the market is now checking off all the touchy feely characteristics of a major bubble The most impressive features are the intensity and enthusiasm of bulls the breadth of coverage of stocks and the market and above all the rising hostility toward bears In 1929 to be a bear was to risk physical attack and guarantee character assassination For us 1999 was the only experience we have had of clients reacting as if we were deliberately and maliciously depriving them of gains In comparison 2008 was nothing But in the last few months the hostile tone has been rapidly ratcheting up The irony for bears though is that it s exactly what we want to hear It s a classic precursor of the ultimate break together with stocks rising not for their fundamentals but simply because they are rising gt gt gt gt So here we are again I expect once again for my bubble call to meet my modest definition of success at some future date whenever that may be it will have paid for you to have ducked from midsummer of 2020 But few professional or individual investors will have been able to have ducked The combination of timing uncertainty and rapidly accelerating regret on the part of clients means that the career and business risk of fighting the bubble is too great for large commercial enterprises They can never put their full weight behind bearish advice even if the P E goes to 65x as it did in Japan The nearest any of these giant institutions have ever come to offering fully bearish advice in a bubble was UBS in 1999 whose position was nearly identical to ours at GMO That is to say somewhere between brave and foolhardy Luckily for us though they changed their tack and converted to a fully invested growth stock recommendation at UBS Brinson and its subsidiary Phillips amp Drew in February 2000 just before the market peak This took out the 800 pound gorilla that would otherwise have taken most of the rewards for stubborn contrariness So don t wait for the Goldmans and Morgan Stanleys to become bearish it can never happen For them it is a horribly non commercial bet Perhaps it is for anyone Profitable and risk reducing for the clients yes but commercially impractical for advisors Their best policy is clear and simple always be extremely bullish It is good for business and intellectually undemanding It is appealing to most investors who much prefer optimism to realistic appraisal as witnessed so vividly with COVID And when it all ends you will as a persistent bull have overwhelming company This is why you have always had bullish advice in a bubble and always will amp x200B Of course the million tendie question is when My advice Just keep hedging amp x200B positions UVXY 5c 5 14 SRTY 12c 8 20 SDOW 9c 9 17 SQQQ 15c 9 15

7afc8e3edf0a48c85262da037855af686ad455dc If we look at the peak volume on Jan 22 to now we notice a constant decrease besides the run up on Feb 25 Now most have tied a negative connotation towards that stating GME is over people lost interest and the squeeze has squoze However if we apply the OBV indicator we realize that no one lost interest and no one is selling https preview redd it

format png amp auto webp amp s 04b2ffd6451c894095937748a70223766453e587 Further analysis of this low volume we are currently experiencing and based off of the history of this stock we saw a strong volume upward movement in Jan when we should have saw the squeeze until our friends at RH ruined it but did they really ruin it or just set us up for even greater heights lol oh the irony Anyway ever since then we saw dips price increases but for the most part we saw a whole lot of sideways movement As time passes these fake overhanging supplies should be fading due to diamond hands and more importantly the accumulation of even MORE AND even more importantly they are counting our votes as we speak Ok I am calm Side note I have a friend named Margin and they were asking for their number TLDR All speculation but in my opinion the naked short selling of hedge funds have created an overhanging supply acting as a security block of synthetic shares that is constantly pushing the price down and causing resistance However with the low volume in place and a constant increase in OBV no one is selling and with shares drying up there will no longer be a synthetic block inhibiting us from reaching the moon References https finance zacks com light volume affect stock market 1152 html https finance zacks com light volume affect stock market 1152 html https financial dictionary

impaler and old Thomas Petterfy stopped my flawless dip buy of my favorite stock 100 a share on Jan 28th As I sat there enraged on the toilet slamming my phone screen with my thumbs I was struck with a thought how do I know that my shares are mine These shares are actually owned by my broker and only in my shady ass broker s books does it say I am the owner is there a way for me to own my shares without having to worry about a broker as a middleman who does that why do they do that what are the pros and cons And so today rather than do my work I finally decided to find out So I called fidelity and the customer service rep trotted to the back office to ask his smart accounting nerds because he didn t have a fucking clue either Turns out becoming a registered share holder is done through what s called a transfer agent and these agents are selected by the issuing company The transfer agent and the registrar the DTC handle the registration of shares in the direct registration system DRS which is some sort of electronic book keeping system meant to keep track of who owns what shares He was kind enough to give me the name and phone number of GME s transfer agent computershare 800 522 6645 I then had a web chat with a saucy looking customer rep named Donna A who told me exactly how I can transfer my shares from my brokerage account to establish an account with computershare The broker will need to submit a request for a DTC W T https z1 le liveperson net a 54722259 W T Transmission Computershare cannot initiate this transfer If the broker is unfamiliar with the DTC Transmission process they should contact their back office for assistance or contact their representative at DTC The broker will initiate the request through their back office using the following shareholder information 1 The complete name of the Transfer Agent Computershare Investor Services 2 Tax ID Number TIN 3 The exact registration complete name and address on the Computershare account If the shareholder does not have an existing Computershare account provide the exact registration as it appears on the brokerage account 4 Exact number of shares to be transferred whole shares only 5 The full CUSIP number of the stock holding company Note If the registration address and SSN match the shares will go into the existing account if anything is off it will open a new account by existing account she s referring to an existing account with computershare which I opened this morning by buying a single share through the directstock purchase program this is the second way in which you can acquire shares in your name buy them through your account with computershare now this process seems less desirable to me Since buying a share was the only way I could figure out how to open an account through their website which their phone system directed me to do I entered my personal info tax information and a checking account and routing number and then selected how much money I wanted to invest I picked 150 for about one share I was notified that my purchase will be bought on the market 5 days from now at whatever price it is and settled in my account 2 days after well jesus that s slow Donna says they will buy whatever amount of shares they can get for the dollar amount I selected including partial shares It should be noted here that to sell the shares through the transfer agent computershare is also an arduously slow process you can submit a sell order that gets issued to the market on a predetermined schedule say 5 days from the day you initiate it I can also transfer them out to one of my brokerage accounts to sell them Fidelity warned me that this could take days to transfer because it requires the request and coordination of individuals in the two back offices to effectuate similar to when I transferred my shares from one brokerage to another it took 48 hours or so I warned them that I might be retarded enough to casually ignore such a warning and if I ever needed to sell which was highly unlikely well then those buyers won t mind waiting a couple of days for my shares to clear so you may be asking why would someone do this why would they abandon their broker and restrict their ability to quickly buy and sell their shares There s a few decent articles if you search Direct registration system thebalance dot com in google but essentially it was created for investors who want counter party risk against your stockbroker going bankrupt your claim is with the issuing company not the brokerage so you don t have to deal with SIPC or the hassle of getting your account back afterwards removing the middleman from delivering annual reports 10k filings proxy statements voting info etc since your name and address are recorded directly these materials are mailed or emailed to you promptly as the shareholder of records inability for brokers to lend your shares for dividend stocks if your shares are lent for shorting the dividend can become an unqualified payment in lieu of dividends increasing your tax burden The brokers don t have your shares can t use them for collateral can t do shit with them because they are yours I have not investigated yet but computershare has countries outside the US Australia Canada Hong Kong Ireland New Zealand South Africa United Kingdom listed implying that if I ever move to one of those countries I could buy shares in my name and get access to direct voting and dividends and all the other joys of being a real shareholder TLDR I was curious how to own my shares directly not through some shell corporation owned by a bulgarian vampire so I found out and decided to share with the few of you retards who can actually read

fact checked One is that people are claiming there are 500 claims to every physical ounce of silver How can people KNOW this I know Chris Marcus has asked dozens of people and this is around the number most say The second number I use is 10 1 which I am using as a fractional reserve ratio Those in the PM unallocated industry what reserve ratio do you use The setup here is this Fire and brimstone may be coming Let s quickly review where we are For each ounce of silver it is said there are 500 owners Much much more on this below as this is the focus of this article Overview I have been maintaining where I think we are with the Silver Squeeze metrics here To ME it appears we are at the bottom of the 8th inning with 2 outs if we are using a baseball analogy I called this downturn

upcoming delivery month may be the top of the 9th and it s possible it s game over after this I don t know But the metrics I ve been tracking continue to get more and more bleak for those betting against silver SLV losing interest PSLV gaining steam Seems people aren t trusting this as a vehicle and interest is waning And PSLV has gained 70 m ounces In my February article that got me semi famous for 8 minutes I said that in order for ANY squeeze to work PSLV would need to add 50m oz by end of March They told me to hold their beer My crystal ball was merely delayed by the 10yr move up but on cue the CPI numbers came in to lower real rates I had mentioned they can change the rules or something like the 10yr can move up but this would be met with yield curve control Actually yield curve management is actively being done with 120b of bonds being bought monthly and I read somewhere one month it was 180b And this three week stretch may have more sales upcoming bought by the fed Unallocated games seem to be folding John Adams is on a quest to burn it all down no matter who gets scorched in the process I most definitely applaud the passion but I ll leave it there He feels he has helped move many tons of silver from unallocated to either allocated or physical In a tight market to move 14 tons as of like 2 weeks ago is a lot to move from paper to real Bob Coleman discussing tightness He had been more of a prudent hawk which was absolutely needed to keep everyone grounded and pragmatic However recently he had discussed how premiums were up on wholesalers I didn t hear in that video if he mentioned a premium on 1 000 oz bars or just wholesaling for things like Eagles but he seemed to indicate there was more tightness than he had seen previously Bob is an industry insider who does this for a living so it adds a lot of credence to when idiots like me say there s a squeeze happening Comex down 34m oz since I ve been tracking on 22 Feb Others report it a little higher but they may be going back to 2 Feb This is something of interest David Morgan has said in an interview recently that he had once seen the registered at 35m oz However I think this was far before the COMEX became a legit delivery mechanism I m seeing 119m in registered today but you have to understand This is silver for sale that they actually don t want to hand over Morgan has also called this show room floor silver You see it every month where the silver is there but they seem to make deliveries by going into the spot market So you may have 65m in deliveries for May but only 20m might leave Some of this can stay in registered and just change owners Others may move to eligible Eligible does NOT mean for sale but it COULD come up for sale Just about every analyst you see is talking about some flavor of Armageddon coming Whether it is a David Hunter 80 bust that rips your face off or a Michael Oliver arm wrestle you down over a year mostly all debates I m seeing now is what level of shit storm we are facing and when and if we have a deflationary or inflationary blow up I need you to ask yourselves this question If you had millions of dollars or perhaps billions are you waiting for the dollar to die or have you amassed a fortress of precious metals artwork diamonds years of food and an armory that would make Seal team 6 jealous I think this system is intact until all of these guys are prepared and the hatch is buttoned down So I ask you this if you know this is coming and I know this is coming don t you think all of these rich guys have been making a run on the bank prior to the media broadcasting it Basel 3 coming up at end of June and supposedly this will take gold to 2500 per Andrew Maguire Basel 3 talks about the whole balance sheet so it seems silver would be included in this He talks about 40 45 silver as part of this I don t know if this will happen how he says it will play out but assume for one moment this is true This means the deadline is 2 months from now And there are now 172 000 contracts of open interest on the COMEX That s 860m oz or over one year of mine supply is supposedly for sale Yeah So something tells me this OI is going to have to come back down to earth with Basel 3 Bank run What does that mean Here s where bankers and any PM guys can help out We have a fractional reserve system with cash right Let s say there s 10 000 customers of a local bank and each one deposited 1 000 There s 10m in the bank right No Maybe at any given time they have like 50g in the vaults If you want to take out more sizable amounts you have to call ahead first to order the money And then if it s too much you have to fill out forms and tell them what YOU want to do with YOUR cash Personally someday I d love to be in this situation and write about the most obscene thing I can think of to mess with everyone Like it s any of their business OK Maybe I won t write something obscene down So maybe I won t pull a Scrooge McDuck with it I can think of about a dozen things that would crack me up to write that I can t even think of writing here Craig Hemke made some funny comments on this topic I cannot repeat here So we have now understood that if all 10 000 people went to the bank only the first 50 people could get their 1 000 out before the bank was out of cash And they d have to order more cash from another bank In the case of cash that might be a few hours or a day With silver it could be weeks or months if not longer How does this work with unallocated silver and gold I saw postsomething a few weeks ago which said on the Perth Mint website circa 2011 that their unallocated silver was like buying water or something like that Where it was in the pipeline While you might sip from a fountain it takes water up from in front of you but there s more fed into the pipes at the back end It then has to traverse the pipeline to get to the fountain and that can take time So imagine for a moment 10 000 people all thought they owned 1 000 ounces of silver Or 10m oz Imagine the same situation maybe they only have 50 000 on hand and as people take that they bring in more to replace What seems to have happened is the 50 000 oz disappeared quickly and a lot of people then were told it would be months until they could make the donuts John Adams has been working to get those unallocated people to allocated Or perhaps trying to take what s in the vaults It s ALSO possible unconfirmed that the Perth Mint has been helping the COMEX with meeting their delivery needs at the expense of their unallocated customers by delaying them to shuffle metal to the COMEX This is something I heard Bix talk about but again I m NOT in the industry and CANNOT confirm this But this all brings up something cooking in my head and this is what happens in the near future Krakatoa Now I ask you this If each ounce of physical silver has 500 owners what is that doing when the physical silver in the unallocated AND the 34m oz on the COMEX disappear into thin air Seriously What happens 14 tons of unallocated silver is half a million ounces Just at Perth Mint 2 weeks ago What if the last month John has been successful in making 5 million ounces 10x that 14 tons move from unallocated to allocated or be taken into physical custody What if the harassment of Peter Schiff on every single tweet he makes has spooked a lot of his investors out of unallocated If you take this 5 million and add it to the 34 million I saw that came off of the COMEX you are looking at roughly 40m ounces Others had 37m since Feb 2nd so 40m is a nice round number to compromise This 40 million ounces WAS ACTUALLY 20 BILLION OUNCES in the system that people own on paper and have no base silver that it was fractional against 40m oz x 500 owners per ounce 20B oz What this REALLY did was weaken the fractional reserve system FAR more than I could have thought Meaning the owners of 20 BILLION OUNCES in the system now are re hypothecated to OTHER physical silver Remember when Jeff Currie talked about a 25 billion ounce silver market I wrote about that as well but is it possible he s talking about the paper silver as well as the physical investment silver Very likely If true and accurate this means that the 500 1 is FAR smaller than this number So could that now mean that each ounce has 600 owners 700 1000 200 No one knows But this MIGHT add another wrinkle to the whole silver squeeze calculus The thinking here is that NO ONE has any idea how many of these items are out there that are derivatives of silver No one knows Options on this House funds on that Futures over there Re hypothecation Leasing out leased silver to someone who leased it to you who then leased it out somewhere else who then sells it 50x over on unallocated Some of those unallocated owners create derivative products of that which they think THEY own You get the idea The problem is if the silver that is ACTUALLY in the vault leaves that stresses the market exponentially not in a linear fashion I m not sure people put that graph in their head yet It s a parabola up And now 40m oz in the last month that this Ponzi scheme was founded on goes missing To me this seems to be putting even more risks on banks Please someone explain to me like I m a 5 year old what I m missing It stands to reason that if every analyst on YouTube THINKS there will be a FIAT CURRENCY crisis AND we are ALL seeing inflation AND silver is an excellent hedge against inflation WHILE we are seeing massive inflation sorry transitory AND we have a pro green government in the USA that wants solar panels and electric cars and wants to print money for free Can someone please explain to me how a bank can offer a product where they have this level of risk of default There s one of three explanations here IF pressed for silver If they don t have the silver they will pull a Perth mint and give you a timeline of weeks months or years out their product is then ordering it from the mine to deliver at some point This would not default on the product but in a timely fashion IF this is as screwed as this sounds and everyone went for their silver you might legitimately have delays of 40 years If they don t have the silver they may pay you back they money you paid them The problem is I cannot see a possibility they can pay you back market rates as probably with turnover most of the paper silver they sold over the years were are far lower prices they are now IF this is a 500 1 scheme and only 5 show up for their silver this means they are 25 1 oversold If this number was applied to the entire system you are looking at overnight price rises well into the 100s or many up limit days in a row if people still believed the COMEX at that point The bank will suffer losses on these of hundreds of billions if not trillions This cannot be bailed out as too big to fail as some of these losses might eclipse a good portion of our entire country s GDP for a year It is said that the derivative system is over a quadrillion dollars As in 1 000 trillion USA GDP I think is like 19 trillion This essentially would leave any holder broke and without the money they put in The moment this is realized by those holding these accounts the moment this bank run starts And I think this is why they are doing everything they can to manage the price of silver If this gets loose there s nothing that can save these banks So my thinking here is this All of us are focused on the COMEX deliveries But I think we need to understand that when silver leaves the system this IS the bank run happening by the rich behind closed doors taking it out now before anyone realizes what the actual F is going on While we are grabbing retail awesome the big dogs are grabbing millions a day And this is why stage 4 of the silver squeeze has begun If we are seeing half a million ounces leaving the COMEX daily this to me is THE sign we have been waiting for There is no failure on delivery with the COMEX they will just eventually settle for cash The 800 million ounces that are in the futures are interesting and all but IF the rumors are true that there are 500 claims on every ounce in the system then what the hell REAL damage is 40m ounces coming out in the last 8 weeks Those 40m ounces that just left the building are thus tied to 20 billion ounces that banks sold people in products that sometime soon are about to come looking for their silver And it s possible John Adams reporting is the tip of the iceberg There is a day coming where one of the below may happen in the next month A major news outlet covers this probably because some high profile people went to get their silver and were denied This would cause them to go to a lawyer and potentially threaten press conferences IF and I mean IF this situation IS this bad then this run going on right now is about to piss off the wrong person somewhere with the right news connections A major manufacturer will be delaying production At first it might be blamed on the supply chain New COVID shut downs happening worldwide COULD make attempts to mask this issue by providing the supply chain cover needed This despite the vaccine pretty much available to most people in the world as we speak Price shoots up over 30 in the month May With Basel 3 requirements coming the price gouge that I predicted would happen April There are many cover stories they use to knock things down every month but if this is indeed a 500 1 ratio I can see why they would do this Now no friend to the silver community Jeff Christian said many years ago silver was at 200 1 I believe Someone correct me on that if I m wrong Even at 200 1 the 40m oz that were just sold off affected the holdings of 8 billion ounces of paper products people think they own as real silver So the main event is the COMEX where we wait for shorts to cover and see the pressure that the beginning of month buying puts on it month after month But is the REAL event what happens after this See I have a hard time believing this 500 1 number My friend mother worked as one of 8 compliance officers out of a major bank in NYC There s no way in hell a compliance officer would allow THAT MUCH RISK NO WAY So I cannot believe this number I can t Let s just say it is 10 1 a VERY VERY conservative number apparently But perhaps in line with fractional reserve ratios That 40m just pulled off thus took the metal supporting 400m oz of paper products With perhaps 60m coming off in the next 30 days this then means that s another 600m oz of paper products with no metals to back them This then exposes major banks to 1b short on paper derivatives into a rising price during a potential currency crisis coming amongst rampant inflation Risk departments Do I have your attention now Good If you have never seen the movie Margin Call I would suggest you add it to your weekend viewing pleasure Because I think 10 1 is a stupid ridiculously low number I just made up to scare the hell out of you and the problem could be 50 times worse than that Or 100 It s time to get your bosses on the phone And if you are a manufacturer who needs silver to make your products Now might be a really good time to get a year s worth into your possession ASAP because this isn t looking so good for you soon I need someone in banking to refute this 500 1 Or even 100 1 Please help me understand Jeff Currie s 25b oz number Please explain to me how every industry insider talks 500 1 paper to physical ownership Boom It already happened I just don t think many heard it yet Think of the idea of the sun exploding It s 92 million miles away and if it exploded it would take 8 minutes for that light to get here I believe this has been broken for a year and all of the rich people are taking their bricks of silver and gold and putting them in their bunkers before they pull the plug That exec who just left with the golden parachute is off to an island somewhere for you to deal with the mess It exploded the light just hasn t reached your eyes yet Now we wait Thanks renaissancemen for addenduq

6 12 months as the market begins to price the risk of a stagflationary post COVID recovery I don t have a formal price target but one could expect the price of gold to possibly rise 50 100 from here under this scenario 2700 3600 Positioning consensus investor commentary and sentiment indicators all suggest very few market participants are betting on this outcome despite the fact that we are starting to see real signs of this thesis play out That limits the downside and makes this bet asymmetric Expect incremental catalysts over the next few months as the macro data confirm the thesis amp x200B I recommend positioning either through physical gold ETFs or through gold miner stocks GOLD NEM which offer a leveraged return on the hard commodity amp x200B The Setup At the moment rates markets and gold prices are priced for post COVID reflation and a traditional Fed normalization cycle In other words they are taking what the Fed says at face value current inflationary pressures are transitory GDP and employment will recover together in the traditional sense closing the output gap allowing the Fed to gradually hike rates towards the terminal rate over the next few years I do not subscribe to this scenario I believe the Fed will be faced with a dilemma that they haven t been faced with since the 1970s inflation is rising as a result of artificially stimulated demand and excess savings in conjunction with supply bottlenecks while frictions in the labor market are leading to a very slow or nonexistent recovery When faced with this dilemma I believe the Fed will cave to political pressure and choose to postpone rate hikes until employment recovers In doing so the price of money will collapse inducing a selloff of the dollar and surge in demand for gold amp x200B OIS futures are pricing in 1 rate hike by 4Q22 and 4 hikes by 4Q23 while 5y5y treasury forwards are at the Fed s terminal rate of 2 5 amp x200B https preview redd it dcivo5z48ry61 png width 726 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 7010f46ec2806fa23cf27f5319a42f580660664f amp x200B So How Does This All Work Part I The Labor Market The labor market will be slow to recover Because of this the supply side of the economy will not be able to meet its demand which has more or less already returned to pre COVID levels Hence all the news we ve seen recently about production and labor shortages This type of supply demand mismatch has and will continue to generate inflationary pressures So why will the labor market be slow to recover First because unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus have replaced the incomes of the labor supply in most cases granting them incomes beyond what they normally would have made in the labor market I have included an infographic from CNBC demonstrating such an issue with the first stimulus package in 2020 Amazingly despite widely distributed vaccines and progress on reopening the Biden administration passed an additional 1 9trn stimulus package CARES Act that more or less sustained these income benefits Many of these additional unemployment benefits won t expire until end of September 2021 delaying the time at which people will start thinking about working

Many of the pre pandemic jobs will never come back There is likely a significant amount of skills mismatch in the labor market today which will require a lot of time for people to re train and or find work in new industries Traditionally this type of labor slack would be deflationary unemployed people aren t making money so they can t contribute to economic growth but I will explain why this may not be the case this time in the next section amp x200B Part II Demand From Excess Savings and Government Spending So if the labor market is weak why should demand run strong In large part because US consumers have a massive war chest to deploy and spend after receiving so many fiscal transfers during the pandemic These savings through February 2020 are large enough to replace 12 of annual consumer spending Note that this does NOT include the CARES act which allocated another 610bn for consumers These factors have pushed consumption back to pre COVID levels despite unemployment still elevated I would expect this dynamic to continue for many more months as people draw down from savings to spend on pent up demand Second is that the economy is not entirely run by the private sector There is another agent the government that generates demand And boy Biden really wants to spend His infrastructure plan is estimated to be worth 2 3trn and his American Families Plan at an estimated 1 8trn This is absolutely unprecedented to be spending that much money at a time when the economy is already running hot The CBO estimates that the fiscal deficit may reach a whopping 3 4trn in 2021 which is 300bn HIGHER than it was in 2020 That s almost 30 of GDP between 2020 2021 amp x200B https preview redd it 6ss7hawj9ry61 png width 1028 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

result of undermining the credibility of the dollar as a reserve currency Budget deficit of 15 GDP in 2021 Trade deficit of 10 GDP Negative real rates with rising inflation weak potential growth an overvalued stock market a reckless monetary fiscal policy combination amp x200B When people distrust the dollar they flee We ve already seen that in the form of massive inflow into digital currencies Some worry that digital currencies will replace gold But these are a risk assets while gold is a safe haven They go up when people feel good and gold goes up when people feel bad In this type of stagflationary environment I would expect these flows to redirect into gold amp x200B https preview redd it hvlfg25abry61 png width 701 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 82a2944c773fb03a93890dde2cfdbdad04de4be7 amp x200B Where is the Opportunity Buy gold and buy the gold miners The chart below shows that all of the pandemic induced flows into gold funds has since been taken out as a result of renewed confidence in the economic recovery an expectation that the Fed will normalize interest rates and that while dollar weakness may be in the cards down the road we don t

6 12 months as the market begins to price the risk of a stagflationary post COVID recovery I don t have a formal price target but one could expect the price of gold to possibly rise 50 100 from here under this scenario 2700 3600 Positioning consensus investor commentary and sentiment indicators all suggest very few market participants are betting on this outcome despite the fact that we are starting to see real signs of this thesis play out That limits the downside and makes this bet asymmetric Expect incremental catalysts over the next few months as the macro data confirm the thesis I recommend positioning either through physical gold ETFs or through gold miner stocks GOLD NEM which offer a leveraged return on the hard commodity The Setup At the moment rates markets and gold prices are priced for post COVID reflation and a traditional Fed normalization cycle In other words they are taking what the Fed says at face value current inflationary pressures are transitory GDP and employment will recover together in the traditional sense closing the output gap allowing the Fed to gradually hike rates towards the terminal rate over the next few years I do not subscribe to this scenario I believe the Fed will be faced with a dilemma that they haven t been faced with since the 1970s inflation is rising as a result of artificially stimulated demand and excess savings in conjunction with supply bottlenecks while frictions in the labor market are leading to a very slow or nonexistent recovery When faced with this dilemma I believe the Fed will cave to political pressure and choose to postpone rate hikes until employment recovers In doing so the price of money will collapse inducing a selloff of the dollar and surge in demand for gold swap markets are pricing in 1 rate hike by 4Q22 and 4 hikes by 4Q23 while 5y5y treasury forwards are at the Fed s terminal rate of 2 5 https preview redd it glwn94yldry61 png width 726 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3822ea196156fb9e4fd4d2add0780b0d0eabfe9d So How Does This All Work Part I The Labor Market The labor market will be slow to recover Because of this the supply side of the economy will not be able to meet its demand which has more or less already returned to pre COVID levels Hence all the news we ve seen recently about production and labor shortages This type of supply demand mismatch has and will continue to generate inflationary pressures So why will the labor market be slow to recover First because unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus have replaced the incomes of the labor supply in most cases granting them incomes beyond what they normally would have made in the labor market I have included an infographic from CNBC demonstrating such an issue with the first stimulus package in 2020 Amazingly despite widely distributed vaccines and progress on reopening the Biden administration passed an additional 1 9trn stimulus package CARES Act that more or less sustained these income benefits Many of these additional unemployment benefits won t expire until end of September 2021 delaying the time at which people will start thinking about working again https preview redd it ffkmflfndry61 png width 765 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e5ffd10757120e97eaa3e4db6492294b99bb6fd7 Second the pandemic has transformed the economy for better or worse Many of the pre pandemic jobs will never come back There is likely a significant amount of skills mismatch in the labor market today which will require a lot of time for people to re train and or find work in new industries Traditionally this type of labor slack would be deflationary unemployed people aren t making money so they can t contribute to economic growth but I will explain why this may not be the case this time in the next section Part II Demand From Excess Savings and Government Spending So if the labor market is weak why should demand run strong In large part because US consumers have a massive war chest to deploy and spend after receiving so many fiscal transfers during the pandemic These savings through February 2020 are large enough to replace 12 of annual consumer spending Note that this does NOT include the CARES act which allocated another 610bn for consumers These factors have pushed consumption back to pre COVID levels despite unemployment still elevated I would expect this dynamic to continue for many more months as people draw down from savings to spend on pent up demand Second is that the economy is not entirely run by the private sector There is another agent the government that generates demand And boy Biden really wants to spend His infrastructure plan is estimated to be worth 2 3trn and his American Families Plan at an estimated 1 8trn This is absolutely unprecedented to be spending that much money at a time when the economy is already running hot The CBO estimates that the fiscal deficit may reach a whopping 3 4trn in 2021 which is 300bn HIGHER than it was in 2020 That s almost 30 of GDP between 2020 2021 https preview redd it hm6fghpodry61 png width 1028 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e4b3a0db36c3bd3532b37c3b84d748c67dc8c40b https preview redd it

Budget deficit of 15 GDP in 2021 Trade deficit of 10 GDP Negative real rates with rising inflation weak potential growth an overvalued stock market a reckless monetary fiscal policy combination When people distrust the dollar they flee We ve already seen that in the form of massive inflow into digital currencies Some worry that digital currencies will replace gold But these are a risk assets while gold is a safe haven They go up when people feel good and gold goes up when people feel bad In this type of stagflationary environment I would expect these flows to redirect into gold amp x200B
