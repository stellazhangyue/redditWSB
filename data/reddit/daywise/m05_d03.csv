100 Cloud Based SaaS Platform And The Future Of Supply Chain Management With the Global Pandemic putting unprecedented strain on the national and global supply chain and recent events such as the Suez

supply chains noting that the US need for secure diverse dependable goods in notable sectors such as pharmaceuticals semis EV batteries and rare earth minerals This is where E2Open ETWO comes into

its current valuation ETWO is trading at an estimated EV Rev multiple of 7 compared to an average of 11 7 among it s peers It also boasts an EV EBITDA of 21 3 compared to 29 2 and 59 1 from it s two closest competitors Descartes and Kinaxis One of the most important value factors for SaaS platforms is in the recurring cash flow In ETWO s case this comes from it s subscription sales which provides some much valued predictability in these uncertain times This is another strength that ETWO possesses as the company boasts an extremely low churn rate which is a an indicator of a massive moat which can allow ETWO to retain profits from its competitors This only further demonstrates that the company is due for strong future growth Below are some visuals which exemplify the value of ETWO amp x200B

you ll do things differently Warren Buffett Although it is a relatively new and low profile company for now it seems Wall Street is already taking notice Loop Capital just recently rated it a BUY Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin also initiated coverage on ETWO and gave it a BUY rating as well His words on the company E2Open is a provider of supply chain management solutions to the enterprise While the Supply Chain Management space is relatively mature E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products organically and through M amp A which cover all functional areas of supply chain management and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain With an improving cross sell motion providing a 1bn expansion opportunity within its customer base today we see long term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30 EBITDA margins through FY24 With shares trading at 6 1x 18 9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8 9x 22 2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels One Final and Intriguing Note A few popular and reputable websites that display a company s short interest state that ETWO has a whopping percentage of it s float shorted 48 on finviz at the time of this post Short Interest https finviz com screener ashx v 152 amp f sh opt option sh short high amp o shortinterestshare amp t ETWO https finviz com screener ashx v 152 amp f sh opt option sh short high amp o shortinterestshare amp t ETWO I am not sure what to think about this as I also see that the put call ratio for ETWO is a miniscule 0 02 on Barchart Maybe someone can comment on this and maybe shed some light Put Call Ratio https www barchart com stocks quotes ETWO put call ratios https www barchart com stocks quotes ETWO put call ratios Anyone interested in some further reading on the company should check out this solid write up on ETWO as it makes some great points that I missed in mine https www reddit com r trakstocks comments kzmar3 pcpl cc neuberger principal holdings https www reddit com r trakstocks comments kzmar3 pcpl cc neuberger principal holdings TL DR The cheaply valued ETWO and it s value proposition it s allstar customer base Google Microsoft Nvidia Intel Facebook etc as well as it s unique competitive advantage through their award winning software offers its clients as well as its shareholders and potential shareholders a bargain that is hard to resist The growth potential is massive the fundamentals are strong and I believe we are looking at in ETWO the future of the supply chain management industry Disclosure This is by no means financial advice I just like the stock I also must disclose that I have both shares and December

that doesn t matter for most of you since Wendy s never closes and you need to work overtime to keep losing it on Robinhood with stupid FD s Reading this won t take long and you can go back to using your lunch breaks to give discounted blowjobs next to the dumpster to support your grind I am here to talk about my two favorite plays at the moment which you ve either forgotten since reading it in the post title or you re just too retarded to know the tickers It s fucking Academy Sports and Clean energy If you just spat out your fresh semen and crayon lunch then pop an Adderall and try to decipher the symbols on your screen that make up the English alphabet If you need help download a synthetic voice text to speech program and have it read to you If that still doesn t work you are actually retarded and should go seek immediate help Clip your helmets chin strap and text your wife s boyfriend to come pick her up this time so you don t get distracted by the moaning and macaroni noises in the bedroom First one Academy Sports Most of you unwashed neckbeards probably haven t stepped foot in an Academy Sports store because it promotes doing things outdoors You d just waltz around feeling guilty for gaining another 40 pounds during Covid and purchase a DD sports bra for your girlfriend even though the cute cashier knows you reek of desperation she can even smell it with her mask on It s okay because your card is going to be declined and you ll shamefully walk out while the repulsed cashier attempts to scrub your Cheeto dust and dandruff from the nooks and crannies of the card reader Academy Sports is an American sporting goods store chain We are all well aware of the effects that Covid had on retail during 2020 and know it s been a total shit show Academy reported earnings https investors academy com news releases news release details academy sports outdoors announces record sales and earnings on March 30th and somehow these motherfuckers blew the roof off Fourth Quarter and Full Year Comparable Sales Increased 16 1 Fourth Quarter Gross Margin Rate Expanded 420 basis points over Q4 2019 Full Year Net Income Increased 157 2 over 2019 to 308 8 million How did they do it I have no fucking clue Their e commerce sales increased by a cool and modest 60 7 Where the fuck did this demand come from Looks like you guys were sitting around in your moldy basements jerking off to some other retard s gain porn while too ashamed to post your loss porn and Academy Sports was out there busting loads on faces and you just wait on your knees and take them to the forehead eyes wide open Makes no sense you sick fucks act like getting sperm in your eyes is something you can add to a resume since you watched a lot of kids Anyways here s an excerpt https www fool com earnings call transcripts 2021 03 30 academy sports and outdoors inc aso q4 2020 earnin While many of our categories benefited from the COVID 19 crisis several of our key businesses such as licensed apparel team sports equipment apparel and footwear and back to school were adversely impacted and should return to normal this year In addition to each of these businesses driving sales growth they are all margin rate accretive and should drive a return to a more traditional mix of sales Fourth we will improve our management of several seasonal categories where there are not worldwide inventory shortages but where our initial inventory buy in 2020 was not enough to meet the strong demand This year we have modified our planning and allocation on products like grills and water sports to support additional sales compared to their normal trend line As we begin 2021 we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong results because of our incredible team the continued development of our key initiatives and the stronger deeper relationships we have built with our customers The company is providing the following estimate for fiscal 2021 Comparable sales are forecast to range from up 2 to down 2 This is an 18 to 14 increase on a two year stacked basis Okay great so people bought a lot of workout equipment Who cares What you semen suckers fail to understand is that some guys were able to find a woman that is attracted to them in a way that they will ACTUALLY have sex with them and sometimes that results in kids Those kids have been at home all fucking year and their parents want them out of the house so they can fuck on the kitchen table again Ding ding those rusty gears in your seemingly empty head are starting to grind Yes wow vaccines are starting to become mainstream and everybody is pent up at home with their crotch goblins Enter every single recreational sport available Beyond boosts in kids sports equipment that we will probably see this part of my DD is literally just my personal social media feed where everybody on Facebook and Instagram is doing anything in their power to get the kids out of the house and bragging about it we are obviously going into outdoor season That means camping vacations swimming and other things people with active and healthy lifestyles do Academy Sports has it all Tents grills coolers clothing swimsuits fishing gear canoes sleeping bags Do me a favor walk into an Academy Sports store and look at the demand for yourself I obviously expect that Academy Sports will continue to exceed expectations and I am not the only one Show me another stock with a 100 buy rating https www marketbeat com stocks NASDAQ ASO price target and if you re too lazy type in ASO on Robinhood and look for yourself Now I m going to get into the most interesting part ASO has a 100 buy rating from 8 different analysts blew away earnings during a pandemic and has amazing financials and a healthy balance sheet It s kind of weird that it is 9th on the most shorted stock list https www marketwatch com tools screener short interest when every other company on that list looks like it could use some adrenaline shots or life support ASO was previously the most shorted stock on the market a few weeks ago If I had a guess it looks like shorters realized they shorted a company that didn t deserve to be and they want to cover before wallstreetbets gets a sniff of it Oops it s too late now Dick s Sporting Goods is trading at a PE ratio of 14 and has a short interest of 16 https fintel io ss us dks Academy Sports is sitting at an SI of 33 62 and a PE ratio of 8 Seems a little bit fishy to me and smells like a ripe vagina is wafting the room What could these large funds know that we don t Hmmm let s try nothing and the fact that they were hoping to capitalize on another seemingly Covid ravaged retailer Does this remind you of anything else I am not going to sell this to you as a short squeeze because those only happen when you have a very tight float on a company where buyers start jumping in droves while short sellers are already underwater in their positions Also interesting because at the end of March it went from around 24 50 to around 32 00 and the price hasn t gone below 28 39 Also of note the average 10 day trading volume for ASO is 1 584M The entire float is 40 436 703 https www marketwatch com tools screener short interest shares with 33 62 of the float shorted leaves you 13 594 583 shares short That gives you 9 days to cover with average volume if they did nothing but buy and were the only ones doing so Do what you will with that information or go do the math yourself To me it looks like some retards with a lot of capital put themselves in another bad situation Most recent rating from a JP Morgan analyst moves it from 32 to 35 If you re comparing companies in the same sector who would you prefer to make your long AND short bets on Operating income of Academy Sports at 129M in 2019 222M in 2020 and 424M in 2021 with a smaller PE ratio or Dick s with 445M in 2019 409M in 2020 or 741M in 2021 and a PE ratio twice that of the former I already know you little asshats get mad when you see a DD on a stock only after it s up 150 for the week but this is one of those times when this post was made while the stock is down 3 for the week and up 10 for the month I do also want to give some credit to u XionTG for the predictions below that he made a month ago They turned out to be spot on even though he got a lot of flack in the comments Predictions

tight or your heads might explode and your balls could drop amp x200B Next one CLNE Clean Energy Clean Energy is changing the way the world fuels its vehicles Reducing pollution from the transportation industry is an important goal for our nation and we at Clean Energy know just how realistic and attainable that goal is with natural gas fuel Moving forward in our thinking as well as in our vehicles means a safer healthier planet for all of us This change is happening Natural gas is abundant and economically viable and is increasingly being adopted as transportation fuel by countries around the world Hmmm I can t even begin to imagine what type of political administration or historical time notably marked by unprecedented climate change when a company providing an alternative to diesel especially one that is clean and readily available could POSSIBLY flourish I was a truck driver for some time and pumped over 500 dollars of fuel into my semi each day Looking over the finances fuel prices accounted for 20 more than the cost of the 2 drivers to work over the road on a weekly basis Fuel is generally the highest percentage of operating costs in the freight transportation business We are set to enter into a period of economic recovery and anyone with half a brain synapse knows freight transportation is at the heart of industry Not that this is entirely related but Amazon just posted a round of earnings that once again exceeded expectations Amazon s sales increased by a modest 44 fucking percent Why does it matter Shut the fuck up and keep reading Clean Energy signed an agreement https www marketwatch com story clean energy fuels stock soars after supply equity investment agreements with amazon 2021 04 19 with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon renewable natural gas as 27 of its existing fueling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations Yeah you read that correctly Amazon sales blow the fuck up and they have found a place that they can cut operating costs and it just so happens to be through a partnership with the only other company that has the infrastructure to support them in this endeavor It goes without saying that the current administration is going to be pushing for renewable and clean energy harder than your wife threw you out of the house when her boyfriend showed up with a bottle of lube and his extra thick cock ring Also noteworthy https www cleanenergyfuels com release archive ups makes largest purchase of renewable natural gas ever in the u s UPS Makes Largest Purchase of Renewable Natural Gas Ever in the U S Seven Year 170 Million Gallon Equivalents Purchase from Clean Energy Fuels Corp Will Reduce GHG Emissions by More than 1 Million Metric Tons Go look at their press releases https investors

stock to be honest I love the company and what it does Reducing emissions in one of the industries with an oversized carbon footprint is a home run for me Just as Tesla and electric vehicles are the future alternative fuels will fill the gaps where batteries cannot support I don t really care what you spray paint huffing STD riddled idiots do but in my opinion both of these companies look like they have more potential than the current share price is demonstrating CLNE is up 5 for the week and down 22 for the month For those that figured out MVIS CLOV and all the other bullshit the time to buy into something isn t after it s up 120 in two days and Cramer mentions it Find assets at a less retarded entry point Good luck and go back to whatever smooth brained moron shit you were doing

that doesn t matter for most of you since Wendy s never closes and you need to work overtime to keep losing it on Robinhood with stupid FD s Reading this won t take long and you can go back to using your lunch breaks to give discounted blowjobs next to the dumpster to support your grind I am here to talk about my two favorite plays at the moment which you ve either forgotten since reading it in the post title or you re just too retarded to know the tickers It s fucking Academy Sports and Clean energy If you just spat out your fresh semen and crayon lunch then pop an Adderall and try to decipher the symbols on your screen that make up the English alphabet If you need help download a synthetic voice text to speech program and have it read to you If that still doesn t work you are actually retarded and should go seek immediate help Clip your helmets chin strap and text your wife s boyfriend to come pick her up this time so you don t get distracted by the moaning and macaroni noises in the bedroom First one Academy Sports Most of you unwashed neckbeards probably haven t stepped foot in an Academy Sports store because it promotes doing things outdoors You d just waltz around feeling guilty for gaining another 40 pounds during Covid and purchase a DD sports bra for your girlfriend even though the cute cashier knows you reek of desperation she can even smell it with her mask on It s okay because your card is going to be declined and you ll shamefully walk out while the repulsed cashier attempts to scrub your Cheeto dust and dandruff from the nooks and crannies of the card reader Academy Sports is an American sporting goods store chain We are all well aware of the effects that Covid had on retail during 2020 and know it s been a total shit show Academy reported earnings https investors academy com news releases news release details academy sports outdoors announces record sales and earnings on March 30th and somehow these motherfuckers blew the roof off Fourth Quarter and Full Year Comparable Sales Increased 16 1 Fourth Quarter Gross Margin Rate Expanded 420 basis points over Q4 2019 Full Year Net Income Increased 157 2 over 2019 to 308 8 million How did they do it I have no fucking clue Their e commerce sales increased by a cool and modest 60 7 Where the fuck did this demand come from Looks like you guys were sitting around in your moldy basements jerking off to some other retard s gain porn while too ashamed to post your loss porn and Academy Sports was out there busting loads on faces and you just wait on your knees and take them to the forehead eyes wide open Makes no sense you sick fucks act like getting sperm in your eyes is something you can add to a resume since you watched a lot of kids Anyways here s an excerpt https www fool com earnings call transcripts 2021 03 30 academy sports and outdoors inc aso q4 2020 earnin While many of our categories benefited from the COVID 19 crisis several of our key businesses such as licensed apparel team sports equipment apparel and footwear and back to school were adversely impacted and should return to normal this year In addition to each of these businesses driving sales growth they are all margin rate accretive and should drive a return to a more traditional mix of sales Fourth we will improve our management of several seasonal categories where there are not worldwide inventory shortages but where our initial inventory buy in 2020 was not enough to meet the strong demand This year we have modified our planning and allocation on products like grills and water sports to support additional sales compared to their normal trend line As we begin 2021 we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong results because of our incredible team the continued development of our key initiatives and the stronger deeper relationships we have built with our customers The company is providing the following estimate for fiscal 2021 Comparable sales are forecast to range from up 2 to down 2 This is an 18 to 14 increase on a two year stacked basis Okay great so people bought a lot of workout equipment Who cares What you semen suckers fail to understand is that some guys were able to find a woman that is attracted to them in a way that they will ACTUALLY have sex with them and sometimes that results in kids Those kids have been at home all fucking year and their parents want them out of the house so they can fuck on the kitchen table again Ding ding those rusty gears in your seemingly empty head are starting to grind Yes wow vaccines are starting to become mainstream and everybody is pent up at home with their crotch goblins Enter every single recreational sport available Beyond boosts in kids sports equipment that we will probably see this part of my DD is literally just my personal social media feed where everybody on Facebook and Instagram is doing anything in their power to get the kids out of the house and bragging about it we are obviously going into outdoor season That means camping vacations swimming and other things people with active and healthy lifestyles do Academy Sports has it all Tents grills coolers clothing swimsuits fishing gear canoes sleeping bags Do me a favor walk into an Academy Sports store and look at the demand for yourself I obviously expect that Academy Sports will continue to exceed expectations and I am not the only one Show me another stock with a 100 buy rating https www marketbeat com stocks NASDAQ ASO price target and if you re too lazy type in ASO on Robinhood and look for yourself Now I m going to get into the most interesting part ASO has a 100 buy rating from 8 different analysts blew away earnings during a pandemic and has amazing financials and a healthy balance sheet It s kind of weird that it is 9th on the most shorted stock list https www marketwatch com tools screener short interest when every other company on that list looks like it could use some adrenaline shots or life support ASO was previously the most shorted stock on the market a few weeks ago If I had a guess it looks like shorters realized they shorted a company that didn t deserve to be and they want to cover before wallstreetbets gets a sniff of it Oops it s too late now Dick s Sporting Goods is trading at a PE ratio of 14 and has a short interest of 16 https fintel io ss us dks Academy Sports is sitting at an SI of 33 62 and a PE ratio of 8 Seems a little bit fishy to me and smells like a ripe vagina is wafting the room What could these large funds know that we don t Hmmm let s try nothing and the fact that they were hoping to capitalize on another seemingly Covid ravaged retailer Does this remind you of anything else I am not going to sell this to you as a short squeeze because those only happen when you have a very tight float on a company where buyers start jumping in droves while short sellers are already underwater in their positions Also interesting because at the end of March it went from around 24 50 to around 32 00 and the price hasn t gone below 28 39 Also of note the average 10 day trading volume for ASO is 1 584M The entire float is 40 436 703 https www marketwatch com tools screener short interest shares with 33 62 of the float shorted leaves you 13 594 583 shares short That gives you 9 days to cover with average volume if they did nothing but buy and were the only ones doing so Do what you will with that information or go do the math yourself To me it looks like some retards with a lot of capital put themselves in another bad situation Most recent rating from a JP Morgan analyst moves it from 32 to 35 If you re comparing companies in the same sector who would you prefer to make your long AND short bets on Operating income of Academy Sports at 129M in 2019 222M in 2020 and 424M in 2021 with a smaller PE ratio or Dick s with 445M in 2019 409M in 2020 or 741M in 2021 and a PE ratio twice that of the former I already know you little asshats get mad when you see a DD on a stock only after it s up 150 for the week but this is one of those times when this post was made while the stock is down 3 for the week and up 10 for

Reducing pollution from the transportation industry is an important goal for our nation and we at Clean Energy know just how realistic and attainable that goal is with natural gas fuel Moving forward in our thinking as well as in our vehicles means a safer healthier planet for all of us This change is happening Natural gas is abundant and economically viable and is increasingly being adopted as transportation fuel by countries around the world Hmmm I can t even begin to imagine what type of political administration or historical time notably marked by unprecedented climate change when a company providing an alternative to diesel especially one that is clean and readily available could POSSIBLY flourish I was a truck driver for some time and pumped over 500 dollars of fuel into my semi each day Looking over the finances fuel prices accounted for 20 more than the cost of the 2 drivers to work over the road on a weekly basis Fuel is generally the highest percentage of operating costs in the freight transportation business We are set to enter into a period of economic recovery and anyone with half a brain synapse knows freight transportation is at the heart of industry Not that this is entirely related but Amazon just posted a round of earnings that once again exceeded expectations Amazon s sales increased by a modest 44 fucking percent Why does it matter Shut the fuck up and keep reading Clean Energy signed an agreement https www marketwatch com story clean energy fuels stock soars after supply equity investment agreements with amazon 2021 04 19 with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon renewable natural gas as 27 of its existing fueling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations Yeah you read that correctly Amazon sales blow the fuck up and they have found a place that they can cut operating costs and it just so happens to be through a partnership with the only other company that has the infrastructure to support them in this endeavor It goes without saying that the current administration is going to be pushing for renewable and clean energy harder than your wife threw you out of the house when her boyfriend showed up with a bottle of lube

about Nikola s worth Let s try to clear things up To get into the EV stocks best thing is to understand a bit about EV s What s the difference between electric vehicles powered electric vehicles and plug in vehicles Also what is the difference between hydrogen vehicles and electric vehicles So here is a simple explanation Electric power electric and plug in are all the same They run on electricity use a lithium battery and need to be re charged by plugging them into a socket The hydrogen vehicles are also electric But instead of a lithium battery they have a hydrogen tank that produces the electricity So they are similar to regular vehicles in that when needed you fill up the tank just instead of gas you fill it up with hydrogen Pros of hydrogen vehicles It takes five minutes to fill up the tank There isn t a range problem with them In theory you can drive them very long distances as long as you have a hydrogen station along the way As opposed to lithium batteries You can drive a Tesla about 200 miles before you need to recharge it Yep Tesla will tell you it s 400 miles but practically it s 200 400 would be if you are driving alone no passengers in a straight line with nothing stopping you all the way like a traffic light or slowing you down like slopes curves bad weather This is a HUGE difference Think about it 200 miles is a 3 hour drive at 70 miles per hour If you have a 4 hour drive you will need to recharge the battery for AT LEAST one hour and probably way more Your 4 hour drive just turned into a 7 8 or more hours And that is IF you have where to charge along the way A hydrogen car you just need to refill the tank and be on your way That sounds awesome Where is the catch Well there are about 40000 electric charging stations in the USA That is a solid number when compared to a bit over 100 000 regular gas stations So if you own an electric car you have a decent chance of charging it Although it might take you 4 8 hours don t forget Meanwhile there are like wait for it 45 hydrogen stations in all of the USA So basically if you have a hydrogen car you don t it s really experimental at this point you don t have where to fill up your tank The other problem with hydrogen vehicles to produce the hydrogen you need power It doesn t just exist So you need to manufacture it so to speak Nowadays that costs too much That is ONE reason Elon Musk says hydrogen cars are stupid He is only right as long as making hydrogen remains expensive But electric cars also have some important issues You see creating electricity has a price That price depends on how you create that energy Some electricity is super cheap like that created using the sun the wind or even nuclear energy Others are expensive Some countries have lots of electricity others don t Some can create clean electricity Others need to pollute the air in order to make electricity So 1st problem electricity If all cars would be electric cars it would be a HUGE problem to provide electricity from a plug to all of them In most countries or states that wouldn t work at all 2nd huge issue with all electric cars where to charge them If you live in a house have a garage no problems You come home plug it in go to sleep in the morning the car is charged But if you live in an apartment building if you park your car in the street if you are too busy cause when you get back from work you son wife etc take the car to do shopping night studies night job whatever when and where are you going to charge the car Bottom line the biggest problem with electric CARS is that if everyone will have them it will eat up too much electricity there will be nowhere to charge them and even worse no time to charge them Not everyone can have an electric car gas cars aren t disappearing that quickly Too many private electric cars are going to become a huge headache But trucks on the other hand let s think about it Everyone wants to make electric trucks or large vans why Well it s a smaller more manageable fleet They are parked at designated spots or parking lots easier to charge in that sense the gas money you save by turning a truck electric as opposed to a car is much larger and the truck brings in revenue so that even if it s expensive companies can offset that cost So now we understand 1 Electric cars are awesome cause they are friendly to the environment easy to maintain and as soon as the lithium batteries become less expensive they will technology is making them cheaper by the day you will be able to afford one 2 Electric cars aren t THAT awesome because it takes time and lots of electricity to charge them Good luck doing a movie about a road trip using an electric car You ll have plenty of shots of people waiting at a charging station and making small talk 3 Hydrogen cars can solve the charging issue except that there are no hydrogen fill up stations almost and hydrogen is expensive as a solution right now 4 The private electric car market is huge and awesome just not as huge and as awesome as Elon Musk wants you to think it is 5 Trucks are actually a better market for electric vehicles in the mid term current long term outlook Whoever makes a good electric truck van is going to be in an excellent position 6 Equally whoever develops hydrogen fueled cars best will have an upper hand Which brings us to Nikola And what it has or doesn t have One could argue that Nikola is just a bunch of ideas And nothing else But that isn t accurate They actually have several patents to their name Some of them are more related to visuals What the truck would LOOK like But others are about real technology This is a big deal in a field that is all about new technology If you own some of the concepts of how to transform that idea into a product if you own that patent then that can be worth a lot of money Nikola is suing Tesla for using some of its patents the ones related to how the truck looks not how it runs Though the lawsuit has been ongoing for years and might keep going for a few more years down the road it seems very probable that Tesla will need to pay Nikola a sizeable payday So Nikola has some value because of its patents it s a real player in this new technology The 2nd thing we know for sure is Nikola is building a factory and that factory is in fact being built and it will start producing something pretty soon We need to understand what that something is Nikola is aiming at building an electric truck So is Tesla Also Ford Daimler Volvo this is a market where many big names want to make a splash And then there is Rivian They have a 100 00 truck order from Amazon And their IPO is coming out this year So now that we are EV experts what is Nikola worth No one has a reasonable practical EV truck maybe except BYD But I don t trust Chinese companies because they do not operate with transparency they re fishy to me Whomever gets a good EV truck on the road is bound to see a pretty nice spike in stock value Rivian is planning on an IPO setting its initial value at 50 billion Mind you this is a company that has a 100 000 truck order for a truck that doesn t exist yet Its development is advanced and they are hoping to deliver the truck to the market in the next few months But 50 billion considering this number can easily go to 70 as soon as the IPO is launched is a lot of money Nikola s current value is at 4 5 billion They are building a factory they have hired many many professionals they have patents that show they understand the technology very well they have experience building the prototypes through which they got the patents They are potentially a very very cheap stock Just news of the factory actually working and any kind of initial pre order doubles the price of this stock Hold it for 2 3 years the chances for a tenfold valuation is reasonable As far as Nikola s hydrogen trucks I wouldn t bet on it They need to set up the infrastructure to have hydrogen stations for filling up the tank at a national level That is just billions of dollars in costs They need to create the technology that lowers the cost of providing the hydrogen That still doesn t exist at a satisfying level I wouldn t build on that as an investor If they do somehow get that going their value increases through the roof But if they start focusing on it too much they could waste lots of money like they have done before Bottom line NKLA isn t as dead as people think IMO It has value it has a real plan it s focusing on the right market the trucks and it will be worth way more It isn t going up anytime soon But it s a good time to get in I m not an advisor I do not own NKLA stocks right now but plan on owning a position at some point in 2021 I just thought people would benefit from understanding this EV thing better

maintain a 10 stake in the new company which Apollo plans to call Yahoo Apollo releases earnings on Monday May 3rd Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020 s COVID shutdowns and the undoubtedly correlated increase in demand for consumer electronics Cisco one of the world s largest chip manufacturers is struggling to keep up with demand Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a 4 5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a 20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation and estimates it could take another six months for the company to resume normal operation Around 85 of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers Wayne Griffiths head of VW s Spanish brand spoke on the issue stating that the company will need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100 000 vehicles GM reports earnings on Wednesday and markets will be curious to see if the chip shortage has affected them Despite supply chain concerns CNBC s Jim Cramer was optimistic in his recent review of the company saying If you want to bet on electric vehicles with much less risk I say buy some Ford or General Motors these are huge established companies with improving balance sheets and real earnings earnings that happen to be skyrocketing right now The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders in April to address the issue During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants citing 75 of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia Meanwhile Taiwan based chip manufacturing giant TSMC announced a plan worth 100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support citing a fear that if the Taiwan based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple who reported earnings of 1 40 per share on Wednesday April 28th exceeding analyst estimates of 0 98 after a strong Q2 for sales The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple s first product showcase of the year Wednesday April 21st and the company s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it s iMessage app with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook WhatsApp and Snapchat Microsoft reported earnings of 1 95 per share Tuesday April 27th beating analyst estimates of 1 78 by a small margin Microsoft who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud services Microsoft s cloud based service hub Azure posted 2020 growth of 43 The company expects to post great earnings

of this analysis are as follows The management has changed the business model of GoPro into a more DTC business GoPro s subscription side of their business had 55 QoQ and 145 YoY growth rates GoPro has plans to increase their gross margins becasue of their DTC model The 3 main industries GoPro Operates within are growing relatively quickly consumer electronics photographic equipment and action camera s GoPro s main competition is DJI Akaso and Garmin especially in the action camera market Investment Plan Buy between 10 14 and hold long term until it reaches fair value Sell if the stock falls below 10 49 Look for re entry at 8 80 9 20 if stock falls below 10 49 and you sell Stocks Fair Value Using a DCF as seen in the analysis below GoPro has an estimated share value of 39 12 this implies a potential upside of 248 35 If you follow my advice above there is only a 6 59 downside risk before selling and re entry this makes the risk to reward of my trading strategy very favourable Analysis Company Overview GoPro manufactures and sells cameras drones and other filming photography accessories Their main products consist of the HERO7 HERO8 and HERO 9 cameras and a MAX 360 degree waterproof camera The HERO 9 camera is the best selling camera in the US digital market GoPro also offers cloud based storage solutions that enables customers to access edit and share the content they film on any of GoPro s cameras GoPro also offers camera protection plans GoPro Care and video editing applications Quik GoPro markets and sell their products through retailors distributors as well as through their own e commerce store GoPro was founded in 2002 and went public in 2014 and since its IPO has fallen by over 31 GoPro has a TTM revenue of 891 9M a TTM EBITDA of 22 6M and a market cap of 1 719B Since their EBITDA is negative and their PE is N A putting a value on this company is difficult Recently GoPro has reconstructed their business model and it has costed them time and money to undergo this GoPro has taken on a more direct to consumer DTC approach in their business model this has led them to scale back on spending sales and marketing expenditures and office space Furthermore the board of directors volunteered to forego their compensation in order to make this transition This is important because it signals to us that they are confident that the changes being made will benefit GoPro in the future Investment Information Company and Financial Information GoPro has 3 2B video views on YouTube and has a total following of 44M across all social platforms This exposure can be leveraged to market their products and gain product awareness at a significant discount Furthermore they have been a leader in the US camera market for nearly a decade and have the necessary experience in order to succeed with the new changes being made GoPro s active paying GoPro subscribers are up 52 QoQ and 145 YOY This is one of their newer sources of income and to see this early growth is a sign of good things to come for GoPro as a company GoPro has ambitious plans for 2021 these plans include monetizing their app and driving their subscription business model increase the DTC component of their business and grow their gross margins from 36 to 38 40 GoPro has 771 000 subscribers to their subscription service charging an annual fee of 49 99 This amounts to their subscription service bringing in 38 54M last year Furthermore GoPro plans to launch their Quik Subscription service which includes a fraction of the features available in their main subscription package GoPro s forecasts that their adjusted EBITDA will be 68M at FYE 2020 This results in a 24 57x EBITDA multiple this can help us to value GoPro in the later stages of this report Industry Information GoPro resides in the Consumer Electronics Market which is valued at 1T and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of over 7 between 2020 2026 By 2026 incorporating current industry trends the consumer electronics market is estimated to be valued at 1 5T with 70 of the market being from audio and visual segments both of which are segments of GoPro s business Another industry that GoPro operates in is the Photographic equipment and supplies industry which is valued at 22B and is expected to grow at a 5 78 CAGR for the next 6 years This industry is dominated by the likes of Canon Nikon Panasonic Fujifilm and Samsung however the market is shifting to Online retail quickly giving GoPro an advantage over some of the other manufacturers in this industry Lastly GoPro operates in the Action Camera Market is valued at 3 5B and is expected to grow at a 14 CAGR until 2026 By this time the industry is expected to be valued at 5 5B By averaging the CAGR of the industries that GoPro Operates within we can find a CAGR for the next 5 years in our Discounted Cash Flow DCF model to determine the fair value share price Competition DJI specializes is a market leader for drone and action cameras Recently they have launched their very first action camera the Osmo Action which is supposed to compete with GoPro s HERO7 The Osmo Action has a front facing screen and has a higher bitrate than the HERO7 Akaso produces action cameras similar to the current models that GoPro manufactures Recently they have launched their EK7000 Camera that is a popular and more affordable alternative to buying a GoPro The EK7000 does not include video stabilization and voice control like GoPro however it comes in at a cheaper price point and captures some of the action camera market from GoPro Garmin is an American technology company that creates products for aviation automotive marine outdoor and sport activities Garmin s VIRB Ultra 30 Action Camera is similar to many GoPro models shooting video in up to 4K with similar size and weight to that of GoPro The Garmin VIRB Ultra 30 includes a built in GPS accelerometer gyroscope and altimeter which may be attractive for some consumers Investment Plan and Valuation Since GoPro has a negative value for their EBITDA we cannot use EBITDA multiples to value this company Instead we must use a DCF model to determine the fair value per share Using a DCF yields an estimated per share value of 39 12 The only way that I can see this price coming to fruition would be if they can successfully implement the changes that they are currently working on and if GoPro s management can continue to look for ways to be a leader and make the first moves in their respective industries With that being said the most important thing to look for in GoPro to determine if they can pull this off would be their management and their experience By looking at their current management and their backgrounds it is evident that they have replaced and added on a lot of new management in the past couple of years and these new additions and replacements have a surplus of applicable experience This new and experienced management has already challenged the business model and are making key changes that will help to turn a new chapter at GoPro I believe that this management is well suited to lead GoPro into a better future For the aforementioned reasons I have decided to recommend buying GoPro If you can buy the shares in the 10 14 range you will be taking on minimal risk and having the optimal chance for a large return If you buy at current prices 11 23 I recommend holding unless the stock falls below 10 49 if this happened I would sell and look for a re entry at 8 80 9 20 then hold long term Original post can be found

designed to trigger broad immune responses via intestinal delivery These vaccines have the potential to be more protective than injectable vaccines by activating both systemic and mucosal immunity preventing infection at points of contact like the nose lungs and mouth By contrast injectable vaccines only activate systemic immunity and thus do not provide the same protection The technology that lies at the heart of VAAST is the adenovirus type 5 virus Ad5 delivery platform Ad5 is engineered to be non infectious and is used as a carrier for the components of the vaccine the gene coding for the antigen and the adjuvant The antigen is a part of the target virus known to stimulate a protective immune response whereas the TLR3 adjuvant is a molecule that acts to boost the immune response Vaxart has completed 13 clinical trials for 7 different viruses and is the only producer of oral vaccines with a platform backed by clinical data against a respiratory pathogen The results of Vaxart s Phase II trial of their oral flu vaccine VXA A1 1 was funded by the U S Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority BARDA This clinical trial compared Vaxart s oral flu vaccine candidate to

vaccines one first needs to understand the two primary arms of the immune system and how they function The immune system fights infections using T cells and B cells B cells produce various antibodies including IgA and IgG IgA antibodies are primarily produced in places such as the GI tract and the respiratory tract where respiratory viruses like seasonal influenza and SARS CoV 2 first invade IgG antibodies are produced in the blood Traditional injectable vaccines work by inducing a strong IgG response in the blood whereas oral vaccines induce a strong IgA response in the GI and respiratory tracts while inducing some IgG responses in the blood as well Tolerability An additional aspect VAAST improves upon with respect to injectable vaccines is tolerability The potential to experience side effects as well as an aversion to needles because of the associated pain and lasting tenderness can act as hurdles to vaccinating a global population The clinical results comparing a placebo Fluzone

lungs Vaxart developed their oral solution to Covid 19 VXA CoV2 1 using VAAST When the vaccine encounters the immune cells of the lining of the small intestine they are stimulated to produce an immune response against SARS CoV 2 the virus that causes the Covid 19 disease Preclinical trials studying VXA CoV2 1 in hamsters showed significant antibody responses against SARS CoV 2 and prevented symptoms normally seen in infection subjects such as lung damage inflammation and lung weight gain compared to unvaccinated subjects On February 3rd 2021 Vaxart announced preliminary data from its Phase I study in humans to assess safety Results showed that VXA CoV2 1 was generally well tolerated No severe adverse side effects were reported and adverse events were generally mild and gastrointestinal in nature Including this study a total of 495 subjects have now been dosed with the VXA CoV2 1 platform with no serious adverse events reported Preliminary Phase I efficacy data NCT04563702 https clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT04563702 showed strong immune responses stimulated by B cells and T cells The data also revealed that VXA CoV2 1 resulted in a significant T cell response to both the S Spike and N Nucleocapsid proteins This multi pronged immune response has the potential to provide a more durable variant resistant protection against SARS CoV 2 Phase I efficacy data additionally showed IgA antibodies present in blood and nasal swab samples Because mucosal IgA can be more potent than serum IgG in neutralizing SARS CoV 2 it s possible that the infection could be prevented by even small quantities of IgA in the nose or mouth Cross variant Protection Against COVID 19 One of the most challenging difficulties of solving the Covid 19 problem is the rapid emergence of new variants especially those with the ability to infect those who survived the original illness with another round of moderate infection These include the B 1 351 variant originating in South Africa the B 1 1 7 variant originating in England and the newly discovered B 1 1 28 1 lineage P1 which has widely infected the population of Manaus despite the fact that the city had already experienced widespread infection in May These new mutations are starting to accumulate in the S1 RBD domain a subunit of the popularly targeted S protein where neutralizing antibodies generated by current vaccines bind Vaxart s pill vaccine VXA CoV2 1 is among the first Covid 19 vaccine candidates to contain genes for both S and N proteins The S or Spike protein acts as a bridge between the virus and the host s cells that causes infection and the N protein serves as the command center of the SARS CoV 2 virus itself that both controls the shape and structure of the virus and determines how it replicates By targeting both proteins VXA CoV2 1 is doubling down on targeting the virus key building blocks Additionally the N protein is more conserved between emerging variants of the virus its shape is 90 similar to other coronavirus N proteins vs 76 for the S protein and can provide a long term target for trying to broaden the responses against all variants Vaxart is also advancing S only second generation vaccine candidates targeted specifically against new variants in which the S protein has mutated These second generation candidates are designed to complement the potent T cell inducer VXA CoV2 1 and generate strong mucosal and serum antibody responses Vaxart has previously shown that a bivalent oral vaccine using its platform can induce immune responses without interference As previously mentioned the highlight of Vaxart s vaccine is its generation of robust T cell responses post immunization Vaxart s vaccine induces a CD8 and CD4 T cell response stronger than any currently approved candidate on the market This is important not only because T cells are a strong protector against severe infection but are also generally cross protective among different variants holding a broader antigenic repertoire than antibody responses Clarifying the Science Multiple pieces of scientific literature have been published in the past year about the role of antibodies versus T cell response in protective immunity against SARS CoV 2 In Vaccine Marc Hellerstein a professor at UC Berkeley points out that antibodies are not the primary protective response to infection by coronaviruses A strong antibody response correlates with more severe clinical disease in Covid 19 while a strong T cell response is correlated with less severe disease And antibodies have been short lived compared to virus reactive T cells in recovered SARS patients Hellerstein said Additionally T cell responses to SARs CoV 1 SARS a close relative of SARs CoV 2 have been found to last for 17 years after infection and could potentially be protective against SARs CoV 2 demonstrating the potential of a robust T cell response to provide durable immunity to a broad range of coronaviruses Vaxart believes their VXA CoV2 1 vaccine will be able to provide similarly broad protection Although many vaccine developers have focused on antibody production as the primary means to provide protection there has been little focus on the role of T cells resulting in a critical blind spot in this area VXA CoV2 1 responds to this by marrying the B and T cell response to boost immunity and potentially provide durable efficacy Convenience Not only does VXA CoV2 1 demonstrate important immunological advantages over other vaccines an oral Covid 19 vaccine provides key advantages in the area of convenience We ll start with the obvious oral administration is quick and painless and provides an alternative for the estimated 20 30 of the population who have an aversion to needles Preparation and administration of injections also require vast resources and can unnecessarily occupy the valuable time of essential healthcare workers who are in short supply VXA CoV2 1 and pill vaccines more broadly are stable at room temperature This is highly advantageous in regards to the logistics of storage and distribution which in turn is less taxing on healthcare systems amp local

doses a day in the United States and other countries are thrown out or rushed to the nearest available recipient at large vaccination sites such as sports stadiums and large open venues with limited access to refrigeration In countries with more rudimentary healthcare and infrastructure systems difficulty supplying injectable vaccines only increases Instead governments could be mailing every citizen a vaccine pill for Covid 19 and other viruses to address future outbreaks Currently it takes on average of 6 months to conduct a mass vaccination campaign with injectables This could be shortened to as little as a few weeks with a pill Financials Accounting for previously reported statistics Vaxart has a cash and cash equivalent balance of between approximately 180 7 and 192 7 million With an average historical cash burn of 3 million per month and 184 2 million in additional funds available via the October 2020 ATM offering Vaxart has a healthy cash runway and ability to raise additional funds if needed without registering additional shares While the company saw increased liabilities in 2020 this was primarily due to an increase in development costs and administrative costs associated with nearly quadrupling the size of their staff and increased legal and consulting fees related to the company s new focus on the fight against Covid 19 An important factor to consider that sets Vaxart apart in the biotech sector is that has no debt on its balance sheet This indicates that the company has been operating purely on its equity investment and has no debt burden

collaboration agreement or due to the company s focus on the Covid 19 vaccine Universal Flu antigen in collaboration with Janssen Vaccines amp Prevention B V with an option to negotiate an exclusive license Partnerships Vaxart s primary collaborative partner is Janssen Vaccines amp Prevention B V the medical research and product development arm of Johnson amp Johnson Their collaborative efforts are focused on influenza and Vaxart entered into a research collaboration agreement to evaluate the VAAST proprietary oral vaccine platform for the Janssen universal influenza vaccine program The study was recently completed and Vaxart has delivered the final report Janssen has a three month window ending May 2021 to negotiate an exclusive license to the technology encompassing the Janssen antigens In November 2020 Vaxart also confirmed an expanded collaboration with Kindred Biosciences for the manufacturing of the Covid 19 oral vaccine and a master services agreement with Attwill Vascular Technologies LP for processing lyophilizing and tableting compounds for the oral Covid 19 vaccine Competition Given the difficulties involved in storing and distributing most Covid 19 vaccines Vaxart is not the only vaccine producer interested in the prospect of an oral alternative Competing vaccine developers of note include Oramed Pharmaceuticals and Symvivo Corporation Oramed Pharmaceuticals is a joint venture between Oravax Medical and Premas Biotech By leveraging Oramed s proprietary oral delivery technology and Premas Biotech s vaccine technology Oramed intends to develop and commercialize their own oral Covid 19 vaccine Initial clinical trials are slated for Q2 of 2021 Symvivo Corporation is a private company backed by Merck with a Covid 19 vaccine currently in Phase 1 trials Their candidate makes use of their proprietary BacTRL Spike infectious disease platform Both competing vaccines are in early stages of clinical trials and Vaxart has a clearly defined lead in comparison A couple other names that are occasionally mentioned in the oral Covid 19 space are Ridgeback Pharmaceuticals backed by Merck and Pfizer Both are developing oral Covid 19 therapies Neither are direct competitors to Vaxart s VXA CoV2 1 vaccine as these antiviral treatments are focused on treating patients who already have already been infected with Covid 19 Investment Thesis Much noise has been made in the investment community about the recent Phase I trial results for Vaxart s Covid 19 vaccine showing low neutralizing antibody responses The press compared these results to the current wave of first generation vaccines Our fundamental thesis anticipates that these results have been broadly misunderstood and even misrepresented The metrics governing success in Vaxart s vaccine cannot be directly compared to its current peers Although neutralizing antibodies are necessary overall the amount we see produced in the current crop of injectable vaccines is unnecessary for Vaxart s oral vaccine As mentioned above Vaxart s oral flu vaccine candidate was more effective with less than one tenth of the neutralizing antibodies as Fluzone The case is likely the same for their Covid 19 vaccine If Vaxart succeeds in developing their oral Covid 19 vaccine either as a primary second generation vaccine or as a booster for those already vaccinated or exposed to the virus the total addressable market is considerable both in the United States and worldwide As it stands the ability to cope with current and future pandemics is greatly limited by the ability to store transport and distribute vaccines effectively Vaxart with their proprietary platform VAAST is a notable innovator in this space As a first mover and industry leader Vaxart could potentially become a principal source of the global vaccine supply Taking into account their proprietary technology cash flow total addressable market for their products and lastly historical price action we rate Vaxart as a speculative BUY and set a 2021 preliminary price target of 22 Risks We have identified some risk factors that could stand in the way of our investment thesis There does exist the possibility that Vaxart s VXA CoV2 1 vaccine does not achieve statistically significant enough protection to warrant FDA approval While always a risk with discovery and development stage biotech companies the risk here is slightly more pronounced Although Vaxart s Covid 19 vaccine does not require a strong neutralizing antibody response it still needs some response and their Phase I trial had instances of a total lack of neutralizing antibody response with certain dosing regimens Should Vaxart be unable to find a proper dosing regimen that generates sufficient antibody responses Vaxart s development schedule could stall dealing a major blow to the company That being said based on the data available there is a significant possibility that even with a total lack of IgG antibody response Vaxart s vaccine could be used as a prophylaxis providing short term immunity against Covid 19 that could last up to a month at a time Even this indication would likely allow them to recover a significant portion of their R amp D investment in the vaccine The second major risk factor is that Vaxart s current oral vaccine arrives too late to become a major player in this space As it stands their Covid 19 vaccine trial is entering its second phase in Q2 2021 An optimistic estimate would place the likelihood of a potential approval somewhere in Q4 2021 a time by which we hope to have a significant portion of the world vaccinated against Covid 19 However with vaccine skepticism at an all time high and SARS CoV 2 s ability to easily jump hosts and mutate many experts believe that Covid 19 will become an endemic disease that stays circulating among the populace for an extended period Achieving herd immunity may be a years long initiative Vaxart directly addressed this particular concern in their most recent investor presentation Because VAAST vaccines are likely to be well tolerated as a supplement to the current wave of vaccines they consider their role in this pandemic to develop vaccines that will serve as a yearly booster to the others and with multiple versions produced as a way to react quickly to new variants resistant to the current wave of vaccines Vaxart s executives have mentioned that getting approved as a booster is far less time intensive and expensive and they already have plans in place to do just that with their next wave of studies being planned at a variety of locations worldwide to test against several prominent regional variants Final Thoughts Keeping all of the aforementioned risks in mind while a total failure of their Covid 19 vaccine candidate would be a major setback it would not spell the end for Vaxart as a company or even the end for Vaxart s ability to reach its full potential in the long term Their norovirus and seasonal flu vaccine candidates already show promising results Success in either of these ventures would translate to success of Vaxart as a company Sanofi s Fluzone generates an average 1 billion per quarter and a norovirus vaccine is estimated to have a 15 20 billion total addressable market globally 10 billion of which is driven by United States government policy Either of these revenue pipelines could justify a multi billion dollar market capitalization for Vaxart Looking ahead we anticipate current developments as merely the beginning of the company s story Similarly to how Moderna s RNA vaccine became a vehicle to catalyze the success of the company s RNA technology we project Vaxart s Covid 19 vaccine as a vehicle to jumpstart the success of VAAST oral vaccine platform At that juncture funding for their broader pipeline and licensing interest in the VAAST platform would make Vaxart a revolutionary player in the vaccine space and likely lead to a valuation that eclipses our

analysis are as follows The management has changed the business model of GoPro into a more DTC business GoPro s subscription side of their business had 55 QoQ and 145 YoY growth rates GoPro has plans to increase their gross margins becasue of their DTC model The 3 main industries GoPro Operates within are growing relatively quickly consumer electronics photographic equipment and action camera s GoPro s main competition is DJI Akaso and Garmin especially in the action camera market Investment Plan Buy between 10 14 and hold long term until it reaches fair value Sell if the stock falls below 10 49 Look for re entry at 8 80 9 20 if stock falls below 10 49 and you sell Stocks Fair Value Using a DCF as seen in the analysis below GoPro has an estimated share value of 39 12 this implies a potential upside of 248 35 If you follow my advice above there is only a 6 59 downside risk before selling and re entry this makes the risk to reward of my trading strategy very favourable Analysis Company Overview GoPro manufactures and sells cameras drones and other filming photography accessories Their main products consist of the HERO7 HERO8 and HERO 9 cameras and a MAX 360 degree waterproof camera The HERO 9 camera is the best selling camera in the US digital market GoPro also offers cloud based storage solutions that enables customers to access edit and share the content they film on any of GoPro s cameras GoPro also offers camera protection plans GoPro Care and video editing applications Quik GoPro markets and sell their products through retailors distributors as well as through their own e commerce store GoPro was founded in 2002 and went public in 2014 and since its IPO has fallen by over 31 GoPro has a TTM revenue of 891 9M a TTM EBITDA of 22 6M and a market cap of 1 719B Since their EBITDA is negative and their PE is N A putting a value on this company is difficult Recently GoPro has reconstructed their business model and it has costed them time and money to undergo this GoPro has taken on a more direct to consumer DTC approach in their business model this has led them to scale back on spending sales and marketing expenditures and office space Furthermore the board of directors volunteered to forego their compensation in order to make this transition This is important because it signals to us that they are confident that the changes being made will benefit GoPro in the future Investment Information Company and Financial Information GoPro has 3 2B video views on YouTube and has a total following of 44M across all social platforms This exposure can be leveraged to market their products and gain product awareness at a significant discount Furthermore they have been a leader in the US camera market for nearly a decade and have the necessary experience in order to succeed with the new changes being made GoPro s active paying GoPro subscribers are up 52 QoQ and 145 YOY This is one of their newer sources of income and to see this early growth is a sign of good things to come for GoPro as a company GoPro has ambitious plans for 2021 these plans include monetizing their app and driving their subscription business model increase the DTC component of their business and grow their gross margins from 36 to 38 40 GoPro has 771 000 subscribers to their subscription service charging an annual fee of 49 99 This amounts to their subscription service bringing in 38 54M last year Furthermore GoPro plans to launch their Quik Subscription service which includes a fraction of the features available in their main subscription package GoPro s forecasts that their adjusted EBITDA will be 68M at FYE 2020 This results in a 24 57x EBITDA multiple this can help us to value GoPro in the later stages of this report Industry Information GoPro resides in the Consumer Electronics Market which is valued at 1T and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of over 7 between 2020 2026 By 2026 incorporating current industry trends the consumer electronics market is estimated to be valued at 1 5T with 70 of the market being from audio and visual segments both of which are segments of GoPro s business Another industry that GoPro operates in is the Photographic equipment and supplies industry which is valued at 22B and is expected to grow at a 5 78 CAGR for the next 6 years This industry is dominated by the likes of Canon Nikon Panasonic Fujifilm and Samsung however the market is shifting to Online retail quickly giving GoPro an advantage over some of the other manufacturers in this industry Lastly GoPro operates in the Action Camera Market is valued at 3 5B and is expected to grow at a 14 CAGR until 2026 By this time the industry is expected to be valued at 5 5B By averaging the CAGR of the industries that GoPro Operates within we can find a CAGR for the next 5 years in our Discounted Cash Flow DCF model to determine the fair value share price Competition DJI specializes is a market leader for drone and action cameras Recently they have launched their very first action camera the Osmo Action which is supposed to compete with GoPro s HERO7 The Osmo Action has a front facing screen and has a higher bitrate than the HERO7 Akaso produces action cameras similar to the current models that GoPro manufactures Recently they have launched their EK7000 Camera that is a popular and more affordable alternative to buying a GoPro The EK7000 does not include video stabilization and voice control like GoPro however it comes in at a cheaper price point and captures some of the action camera market from GoPro Garmin is an American technology company that creates products for aviation automotive marine outdoor and sport activities Garmin s VIRB Ultra 30 Action Camera is similar to many GoPro models shooting video in up to 4K with similar size and weight to that of GoPro The Garmin VIRB Ultra 30 includes a built in GPS accelerometer gyroscope and altimeter which may be attractive for some consumers Investment Plan and Valuation Since GoPro has a negative value for their EBITDA we cannot use EBITDA multiples to value this company Instead we must use a DCF model to determine the fair value per share Using a DCF yields an estimated per share value of 39 12 The only way that I can see this price coming to fruition would be if they can successfully implement the changes that they are currently working on and if GoPro s management can continue to look for ways to be a leader and make the first moves in their respective industries With that being said the most important thing to look for in GoPro to determine if they can pull this off would be their management and their experience By looking at their current management and their backgrounds it is evident that they have replaced and added on a lot of new management in the past couple of years and these new additions and replacements have a surplus of applicable experience This new and experienced management has already challenged the business model and are making key changes that will help to turn a new chapter at GoPro I believe that this management is well suited to lead GoPro into a better future For the aforementioned reasons I have decided to recommend buying GoPro If you can buy the shares in the 10 14 range you will be taking on minimal risk and having the optimal chance for a large return If you buy at current prices 11 23 I recommend holding unless the stock falls below 10 49 if this happened I would sell and look for a re entry at 8 80 9 20 then hold long term Original post can be found

and should go seek immediate help Clip your helmets chin strap and text your wife s boyfriend to come pick her up this time so you don t get distracted by the moaning and macaroni noises in the bedroom First one Academy Sports Most of you unwashed neckbeards probably haven t stepped foot in an Academy Sports store because it promotes doing things outdoors You d just waltz around feeling guilty for gaining another 40 pounds during Covid and purchase a DD sports bra for your girlfriend even though the cute cashier knows you reek of desperation she can even smell it with her mask on It s okay because your card is going to be declined and you ll shamefully walk out while the repulsed cashier attempts to scrub your Cheeto dust and dandruff from the nooks and crannies of the card reader Academy Sports is an American sporting goods store chain We are all well aware of the effects that Covid had on retail during 2020 and know it s been a total shit show Academy reported earnings on March 30th and somehow these motherfuckers blew the roof off Fourth Quarter and Full Year Comparable Sales Increased 16 1 Fourth Quarter Gross Margin Rate Expanded 420 basis points over Q4 2019 Full Year Net Income Increased 157 2 over 2019 to 308 8 million How did they do it I have no fucking clue Their e commerce sales increased by a cool and modest 60 7 Where the fuck did this demand come from Looks like you guys were sitting around in your moldy basements jerking off to some other retard s gain porn while too ashamed to post your loss porn and Academy Sports was out there busting loads on faces and you just wait on your knees and take them to the forehead eyes wide open Makes no sense you sick fucks act like getting sperm in your eyes is something you can add to a resume since you watched a lot of kids Anyways here s an excerpt While many of our categories benefited from the COVID 19 crisis several of our key businesses such as licensed apparel team sports equipment apparel and footwear and back to school were adversely impacted and should return to normal this year In addition to each of these businesses driving sales growth they are all margin rate accretive and should drive a return to a more traditional mix of sales Fourth we will improve our management of several seasonal categories where there are not worldwide inventory shortages but where our initial inventory buy in 2020 was not enough to meet the strong demand This year we have modified our planning and allocation on products like grills and water sports to support additional sales compared to their normal trend line As we begin 2021 we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong results because of our incredible team the continued development of our key initiatives and the stronger deeper relationships we have built with our customers The company is providing the following estimate for fiscal 2021 Comparable sales are forecast to range from up 2 to down 2 This is an 18 to 14 increase on a two year stacked basis Okay great so people bought a lot of workout equipment Who cares What you semen suckers fail to understand is that some guys were able to find a woman that is attracted to them in a way that they will ACTUALLY have sex with them and sometimes that results in kids Those kids have been at home all fucking year and their parents want them out of the house so they can fuck on the kitchen table again Ding ding those rusty gears in your seemingly empty head are starting to grind Yes wow vaccines are starting to become mainstream and everybody is pent up at home with their crotch goblins Enter every single recreational sport available Beyond boosts in kids sports equipment that we will probably see this part of my DD is literally just my personal social media feed where everybody on Facebook and Instagram is doing anything in their power to get the kids out of the house and bragging about it we are obviously going into outdoor season That means camping vacations swimming and other things people with active and healthy lifestyles do Academy Sports has it all Tents grills coolers clothing swimsuits fishing gear canoes sleeping bags Do me a favor walk into an Academy Sports store and look at the demand for yourself I obviously expect that Academy Sports will continue to exceed expectations and I am not the only one Show me another stock with a 100 buy rating and if you re too lazy type in ASO on Robinhood and look for yourself Now I m going to get into the most interesting part ASO has a 100 buy rating from 8 different analysts blew away earnings during a pandemic and has amazing financials and a healthy balance sheet It s kind of weird that it is 9th on the most shorted stock list when every other company on that list looks like it could use some adrenaline shots or life support ASO was previously the most shorted stock on the market a few weeks ago If I had a guess it looks like shorters realized they shorted a company that didn t deserve to be and they want to cover before wallstreetbets gets a sniff of it Oops it s too late now Dick s Sporting Goods is trading at a PE ratio of 14 and has a short interest of 16 Academy Sports is sitting at an SI of 33 62 and a PE ratio of 8 Seems a little bit fishy to me and smells like a ripe vagina is wafting the room What could these large funds know that we don t Hmmm let s try nothing and the fact that they were hoping to capitalize on another seemingly Covid ravaged retailer Does this remind you of anything else I am not going to sell this to you as a short squeeze because those only happen when you have a very tight float on a company where buyers start jumping in droves while short sellers are already underwater in their positions Also interesting because at the end of March it went from around 24 50 to around 32 00 and the price hasn t gone below 28 39 Also of note the average 10 day trading volume for ASO is 1 584M The entire float is 40 436 703 shares with 33 62 of the float shorted leaves you 13 594 583 shares short That gives you 9 days to cover with average volume if they did nothing but buy and were the only ones doing so Do what you will with that information or go do the math yourself To me it looks like some retards with a lot of capital put themselves in another bad situation Most recent rating from a JP Morgan analyst moves it from 32 to 35 If you re comparing companies in the same sector who would you prefer to make your long AND short bets on Operating income of Academy Sports at 129M in 2019 222M in 2020 and 424M in 2021 with a smaller PE ratio or Dick s with 445M in 2019 409M in 2020 or 741M in 2021 and a PE ratio twice that of the former I already know you little asshats get mad when you see a DD on a stock only after it s up 150 for the week but this is one of those times when this post was made while the stock is down 3 for the week and up 10 for the month I do also want to give some credit to u XionTG for the predictions below that he made a month ago They turned out to be spot on even though he got a lot of flack in the comments Predictions My Target Prices First short term target price 30 by 5 1 Second short term target price 60 by 7 1 You can see his original DD here but I will warn you degenerate retards that this DD is from the r investing crowd so don t pucker your asshole up too tight or your heads might explode and your balls could drop Next one CLNE Clean Energy Clean Energy is changing the way the world fuels its vehicles Reducing pollution from the transportation industry is an important goal for our nation and we at Clean Energy know just how realistic and attainable that goal is with natural gas fuel Moving forward in our thinking as well as in our vehicles means a safer healthier planet for all of us This change is happening Natural gas is abundant and economically viable and is increasingly being adopted as transportation fuel by countries around the world Hmmm I can t even begin to imagine what type of political administration or historical time notably marked by unprecedented climate change when a company providing an alternative to diesel especially one that is clean and readily available could POSSIBLY flourish I was a truck driver for some time and pumped over 500 dollars of fuel into my semi each day Looking over the finances fuel prices accounted for 20 more than the cost of the 2 drivers to work over the road on a weekly basis Fuel is generally the highest percentage of operating costs in the freight transportation business We are set to enter into a period of economic recovery and anyone with half a brain synapse knows freight transportation is at the heart of industry Not that this is entirely related but Amazon just posted a round of earnings that once again exceeded expectations Amazon s sales increased by a modest 44 fucking percent Why does it matter Shut the fuck up and keep reading Clean Energy signed an agreement with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon renewable natural gas as 27 of its existing fueling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations Yeah you read that correctly Amazon sales blow the fuck up and they have found a place that they can cut operating costs and it just so happens to be through a partnership with the only other company that has the infrastructure to support them in this endeavor It goes without saying that the current administration is going to be pushing for renewable and clean energy harder than your wife threw you out of the house when her boyfriend showed up with a bottle of lube and his extra thick cock ring Also noteworthy UPS Makes Largest Purchase of Renewable Natural Gas Ever in the U S Seven Year 170 Million Gallon Equivalents Purchase from Clean Energy Fuels Corp Will Reduce GHG Emissions by More than 1 Million Metric Tons Go look at their press releases if you want to see their other partnerships I have attached another DD done by u twenty98 about CLNE that was well done We also know that u NrdRage made a very good DD as well so go read it because I m not going to retype it and in any way attempt to take credit for their work I am not sitting here saying I love the stock to be honest I love the company and what it does Reducing emissions in one of the industries with an oversized carbon footprint is a home run for me Just as Tesla and electric vehicles are the future alternative fuels will fill the gaps where batteries cannot support I don t really care what you spray paint huffing STD riddled idiots do but in my opinion both of these companies look like they have more potential than the current share price is demonstrating CLNE is up 5 for the week and down 22 for the month For those that figured out MVIS CLOV and all the other bullshit the time to buy into something isn t after it s up 120 in two days and Cramer mentions it Find assets at a less retarded entry point Good luck and go back to whatever smooth brained moron shit you were doing before seeing this That s the end of the post and that s all I got for you Now you can return to the act of holding your wife s hair while she goes down on your neighbor

on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona but this news is more bearish than bullish to me Investing in Intel now is nonsensical once you consider the full situation I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play I ve more or less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now As of late many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its 20B manufacturing facility FAB production project As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born again Intel bull I must objectively call Intel s announcement as another bearish catalyst In light of this news I am happy to double down Today I will explain my viewpoint The Fab Ahab Ahab was the seventh king of Israel He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities Many consider Ahab to be Israel s worst king Intel shares many similarities with Ahab The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP but this made Intel a bit too complacent Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward In its comfort Intel has lost its partnership with Apple AAPL who has successfully developed M1 a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm and has even been overtaken by AMD which long sat in Intel s giant shadow Intel s story to me looks like a downfall story in the making Intel finally sees the need to fight back and the two fabs in Arizona due 2024 at the cost of 20B is the latest strategy However it is a risky strategy Adding fabs to the business is not just a one time cost of the 20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs something more like 20B per year which over the coming decade would be more than Intel s total current equity Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings Typically the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys Hail Mary I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings Intel could have become the go to chip manufacturer in the US but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company NYSE TSM and Samsung OTC SSNLF have grown over the past decade At roughly the same time as Intel s announcement to build fabs in Arizona TSMC henceforth TSM announced its own fab construction in Arizona Clearly there is a rush to build fabs in the US and the reason too is clear China The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside That is Intel s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum instead of the decision being a business focused decision it is a situation focused decision a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders Intel s Fab Focus In Question Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China s shadow grows over Taiwan Intel might be playing the Tesla TSLA game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business gaining a novel edge over AMD In any case I don t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense If Intel is really going all in on fabs we will need many years before we see a significant payoff Investing in INTC now during a time of nose bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer this is essentially a white flag Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing Overall I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news The fabs and other aspects I ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish

Therapy Drug AGTC 501 for X LinkedRetinitis Pigmentosa Show Clinically Meaningful Improvement in Macular Sensitivity Results Subretinal administration of AGTC 501 was well tolerated across a wide dose range The majority of adverse events were mild moderate in severity consistent with the subretinal injection and vitrectomy procedures and or concomitant prophylactic steroid regimen used to mitigate inflammation Among the 21 centrally dosed participants 18 had evaluable microperimetry data of which there were 8 responders classified as a 7 decibel improvement in at least 5 loci within the central 36 loci macular area p 0 05 Eleven of the 20 participants with evaluable BCVA data demonstrated improvement of 5 letters in the treated eyes compared to the fellow eyes p 0 001 Among peripherally treated patients BCVA remained stable Conclusions Robust safety and efficacy signals in the study eyes of participants who underwent subretinal administration of AGTC 501 were observed through month 6 There was clinically meaningful improvement in macular sensitivity and statistically significant improvement in BCVA for the study eyes vs untreated fellow eyes Follow up is ongoing through 5 years to assess long term safety and durability of response gt gt CONTROL ID 3544279 SUBMITTER NAME ONLY Robert MacLaren More closely associated with Biogen but co authors do work with AGTC TITLE Visual

Improvements in low luminance visual acuity LLVA assessed by a gain of 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ETDRS letters were observed in treated eyes in XIRIUS as early as Month 1 and through 12months of follow up Month 12 proportion of participants with gain of 15 ETDRS letters treated eyes 3 11 27 untreated eyes 0 11 0 one participant was missing a baseline LLVA assessment score Most adverse events were mild and resolved and no dose limiting toxicities occurred at any dose Inflammation mostly observed at the higher doses was successfully treated with oral corticosteroids Conclusions Treatment with BIIB112 was well tolerated and in cohorts 3 6 led to early and durable improvements in 2 measures of visual function Achromatopsia CONTROL ID 3547050 SUBMITTER NAME ONLY Mark Pennesi TITLE Twelve month Findings from Two Phase 1 2 Clinical Studies of Subretinal Gene Therapy Drugs for Achromatopsia Results Both drugs were well tolerated across all dose ranges Most AEs were mild moderate No SAE was drug related and 2 participants had SAEs related to raised IOP due to concomitant steroids AEs due to ocular inflammation were controlled after modification of the steroid regimen Immunological response to AAV and genesCNGA3 or CNGB3 were not indicative of a safety concern Among the 24 treated participants 4 had a 5 letterimprovement on BCVA at month 12 Five participants had a 1 log10 lux or more improvement for light sensitivity threshold on OPA analysis PROs showed patient improvement in outdoor light sensitivity severity of worst light sensitivity and headache There were small changes for most assessments at month 12 compared to baseline Conclusions Safety results suggest AGTC 401 and AGTC 402 are safe and well tolerated in ACHM patients There were no indications of significant immunological responses to the vector or capsid Data across both studies show encouraging signs of biologic activity Additional patients will be enrolled in both studies

concept results for oto 825 gene therapy at asgct annual meeting https www otcdynamics com agtc otonomy and agtc to present preclinical proof of concept results for oto 825 gene therapy at asgct annual meeting PT What the professionals are saying AGTC is ranked a 8 Buy Now rating depends on which website you look at but I have yet to see anywhere that isn t Buy Now and very recently have been reevaluated as 14 and 24 buy ratings and previous PTs have been as high as 35 Conclusion I ve been watching BTX skyrocket the last month which is another gene therapy company with groundbreaking research BTX has jumped from 4 to 70 in just one month and is currently still trending up Expecting AGTC to do anything like that is completely unrealistic but this example shows that the hype for gene therapy is out there AGTC is releasing some pretty convincing stuff and wanted to share with other investors AGTC has been a strong buy out candidate from notable institutions like Sanofi and results like these coming out this week could set AGTC to pop at any day and at the very least is a great long term hold for your portfolio It has been flying under the radar for months now but once news starts getting out you all will be wishing you could get in at the current price range

corn futures preferred although any ETF with exposure to cash corn would be best I m sorry if you can t trade futures The next contract in September would not be preferred since that s the start of the harvest which usually runs into November If you have been watching the news expensive agriculture has been nothing new in the past month That shouldn t be too worrying since the May Corn which set a high at 7 40 bsh was due to lack of old stored stock because no one planted that much or thought to store that much during the recession This is kinda like the opposite of the negative oil prices last year when there was 0 demand and full storage because right not there is quite brisk demand not from food but ethanol producers and almost all empty grain stores July corn should also face the exact same problem possibly worse as fertilizer prices are climbing and a few other factors detailed below Ethanol Demand Who uses the most corn Nope not farmers for feed or your fat wife but ethanol producers What happens to all that ethanol Except for some good ol states like Oklahoma which sells mostly 100 pure American anticommunist gasoline the ethanol is used for fuel A quick google search

for a company to do a DD on this week for this Discord I initially was struggling to land on a company There are just so many dividend growth companies on my watchlist that I didn t know where to start Initially I was wanting to do a write up on HanesBrands ticker HBI due to everyone needing underwear and socks but then I realized I hadn t put on underwear since I got home from work on Friday so I just couldn t bring myself to break that streak to product test this company as thoroughly as I would have liked However this did lead me to throwing away some older underwear from the back of my drawer and having to race out to get them in the bin before the truck picked up this morning Funnily enough it was this little act that led me down the rabbit hole of America s first largest and objectively best waste management company WM This write up will attempt to go over some of the reasons I view WM as a prime choice for any dividend growth investor who is seeking to add to their industrial holdings by buying a company worth holding for 20 years including some basic financial information how WM can grow into the future as well as some potential problems with the stock that I see Finally I am not a financial advisor and this is written purely for the purpose of sharing some publicly available stock info in the form of a poorly written weed induced WM DD I hope you enjoy The aptly named Waste Management ticker symbol WM is an industrial sector powerhouse with first mover advantage specializing in the waste management sub sector that has been slowly and steadily raising its dividend over the last 18 years Waste Management operates primarily with four different revenue streams consisting of waste collection landfill operations waste transportation and finally recycling It is with these four primary sources of revenue that allow WM to boast a current dividend yield of 1 68 with a yearly dividend of 2 30 paid out quarterly in March June September and December This dividend represents a payout ratio of only 53 which is not very high at all and is actually very sustainable In fact it has a dividend safety score of 98 from simplysafedividends com and is over where management is aiming for their dividend to be between 40 50 according to their 2020 Investors day presentation In addition to being very sustainable a payout ratio of 53 also leaves room for growth and WM has been doing just that While it s 4 year average dividend yield is just slightly higher at 1 98 compared to todays at 1 68 the amount that yield represents has been growing at an average rate of 41 46 over the last 5 years 28 24 over the last 3 years and even in the shitstorm that was 2020 WM raised its dividend by 6 34 just showing that this company not only cares about it s dividend growth but that it can easily afford to raise its dividend as one important thing to note is that during the last 18 years since 2004 of consistent dividend increases the payout ratio has more or less remained unchanged maintaining managements preferred 40 50 payout ratio with occasional outbreaks such as where we are currently due to a contagious outbreak that rocked the entire world Finally Waste Management has a Current Price of 138 an analyst price range of 125 160 and an average analyst price target of 144 showing some room for this stock to still raise or fall to a better entry point if it does fall to test the lower analysts prediction Moving on from the dividend and surface level stock price breakdowns WM has a current P E ratio of 37 7 and I know this might seem very high it actually isn t when you compare it to other waste management companies For instance WM s next three largest competitors are Republic Services with a P E of 35 2 Clean Harbor with a P E of 36 7 and Waste Connections which has a huge P E of 141 13 this is the only one of the three that I went and checked multiple sites and yes it really is that big As you can see a P E ratio in the low to mid 30 s basically comes with the territory of being in the waste management sub sector Just as the P E ratio comes with the sub sector growth in the form of acquisitions will almost always bring some additional debt as its 1 and this is the next aspect of WM s balance sheet that I want to touch on In 2019 Waste Management achieved a major milestone for any company it officially made enough to fully pay down it s yearly short term debt and pay off future long term debt an achievement it had not completed since at least 2016 and possibly before but this is the furthest back I could find regarding short term debt payments Regardless this is still an important feat as it shows that WM is making enough money to support not only a growing dividend but also additional amounts of debt to fund new acquisitions now and in the future Now how can I make the claim that they can afford to take even more debt on Well in 2020 yeah the shitiest of shity years for businesses WM paid off all their short term debt and an additional 7 8 Billion in long term debt as well just showing the strength of it s balance sheet and how the acquisitions it s made are paying off in time Finally the last bit of financial digging I did resulted in me coming across something that did cause me to pause and I feel that any decent DD should include some potential negatives to put the positives into a better more complete light The elephant in the room in regards to Waste Management is it s unusually high P B ratio of 7 7ish While this ratio is generally not as important in the industrial waste management compared to say the financial sector it is still important to compare it to its peers The same three competitors mentioned above all have lower P B ratios than WM Ultimately this just means it is slightly overpriced compared to its book value this can be explained away simply by the fact that in 2019 seeing that it could pay off all it s short term debt Waste Management added a large amount of debt to its balance sheet so that it could buy new acquisitions one such acquisition was Advanced Disposal for 4 6 Billion This higher P B ratio also explains Morningstars 2 star rating However my response to this information is just this If you plan to buy and hold a stock for 20 years isn t it better to open your position early accrue dividends and price appreciation while buying dips than to just wait for its P B ratio to dip down to a level you re more comfortable with Especially considering that there is a very good chance that as the debt goes down as the acquisitions begin paying for themselves so too will the P B ratio fall Moving on from financials and more towards hard assets Waste Managements true strength starts to take form as it truly lives up to what one imagines from a company with first mover advantage in its respective sub sector The company services over 20 million residential and 2 million commercial customers in 48 US States Canada DC and Puerto Rico WM has a total of 293 active landfills with an average remaining lifespan of 22 years per landfill They also have 346 waste transfer consolidation stations 146 recycling centers making it the largest recycling network in the nation 16 waste to energy facilities that burn up to 23 000 pounds of trash to generate up to 670 MW hour of electrical steam energy enough to power 660 000 homes Waste Management also boasts 4 new Renewable Natural Gas RNG facilities that have already created more than 16 million gallons of RNG since coming online This is enough RNG to power 1 3 of their 26 000 strong fleet and sell the remaining to local energy companies that then use the RNG to power roughly 460 000 homes Finally every other landfill that WM owns and operates that isn t a special waste to energy or RNG facility also has some more basic ways to capture the methane that comes naturally with decomposing trash and sells that to local gas to energy companies that use the supplied methane to help power an additional 180 000 homes per year bringing the total number of homes powered by trash to a whopping 1 3 million and WM only plans to raise that number to over 2 million in the coming years The last aspect of Waste Management that I want to discuss is their future growth prospects and why I am bullish on them as a company overall despite the higher than average P B ratio the company currently has Everyone creates waste and we all need that waste taken away somewhere so that we can live the normal lives we have become accustomed to In addition to being the largest the first and objectively the best waste management company WM is also investing heavily into renewable energy by harnessing the naturally occurring methane and other RNG s that are simply by products of their primary business In addition to selling the naturally produced energy that they found themselves having on their hands WM has also found a way to make money off of full and capped landfills by taking advantage of existing power lines that run to and from local electrical infrastructure turning them into solar farms and boosting the local power supply Waste Management is also currently undergoing a change in it s payment model a shift away from a flat rate bundled model that didn t take into account the costs of processing and holding the waste WM picks up and is changing to a fee for service model which will take into account everything from pick up to transport to recycling to even the costs it takes to turn that waste into energy This move will essentially turn every action WM takes into a way to make money By providing such an essential service that no one is exempt from needing WM has positioned itself amazingly to continue being the industry leader in waste management for decades to come And that is no understatement Waste Management has proven to be a very sticky company with a customer typically being a customer for 10 years The final aspect of WM s growth potential I want to dig up hits closer to home for me and those in Texas than others and that is Waste Management basically has a monopoly in Texas Yes there are competitors here but between being headquartered in Houston which is the 4th largest city in the nation and rapidly growing and having cornered the market in the new silicon valley cities of San Antonio and Austin WM can rest easily knowing they have future customers for years to come Overall I am extremely bullish on Waste Management and see this as an investment to hold for the 25 to 30 years I have left until retirement and honestly with WM I might get to retirement early and while investing in trash might not be a dirty job as someone who grew up watch Mike Rowe I think it s only fitting that I make my portfolio get a little dirty to make money
