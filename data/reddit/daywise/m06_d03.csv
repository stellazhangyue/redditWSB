Impact of Coronavirus Vaccination Program and Future Contribution of Other Vaccines One significant contributor to Rite Aid s financial improvement on the current fiscal year results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government s Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID 19 Vaccination The US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to 40 from 28 for a single dose At the rate of vaccination projected it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six 6 million doses of COVID 19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year alone Using the government reimbursement rates the six 6 million doses will likely generate 230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately 2 per share in net profits While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid s fiscal first half the COVID 19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue profit stream for Rite Aid as the annual flu vaccine is today The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view Furthermore customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID 19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen 19 other vaccines including flu pneumonia chicken pox HPV hepatitis A amp B and meningitis among others As a result vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story Finally with the rapid development of mRNA vaccine technology to address the COVID 19 pandemic we can expect to see new vaccines hit the market to prevent a variety of different types of cancers and other life threatenting chronic diseases Such vaccines would be added to the list administered by pharmacists at local retail stores such as Rite Aid increasing the revenue and profit potential of such establishments Potential for RAD to Be Acquired While Amazon is often mentioned as a suitor for Rite Aid I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy prescription drug segment and the category is a strategic growth target for the company However Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space they have to increase their size and scale If Walmart let s Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy it s game over WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost improving profitability All the goods sold in the front end of the 2 500 Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores Once again when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand Based on the above 2 points Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market thereby enhaning those gains even further If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately 25 30 billion in revenue they were earning about 4 6 billion per year Therefore considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2 3 year payback on the investment Conclusion Potential for Share Price to Soar Higher this Summer Rite Aid is due to report its Q1 earnings for the current fiscal year on June 24 2021 The stock is likely to rally back to its 2021 high of 32 48 as that date approaches Also as meme stocks continue to soar higher Rite Aid is likely to benefit from such market activity as well With only 55 million shares outstanding RAD could easily see an exponential run higher should retail investors once again take an interest in this former WSB favorite

know by now the hedgies are desperate to hold on to those freshly brr tendies Reverse repos through the roof coin dumps the signs are there They have proven at this point they are willing to do anything Potential DD here never done this before please criticize TLDR Hedgies are thirsty as fuck for that oh so moist liquidation They are going to pay Mayweather to take a dive against Jake Paul to kick the can down the road further If we all tweet Mayweather his ego will overcome and Hedgies are fuk d I m going to quote this article a few times https realmoney thestreet com articles 05 04 2015 floyd mayweathers investing lessons https realmoney thestreet com articles 05 04 2015 floyd mayweathers investing lessons and this one https www fool com investing general 2014 12 21 floyd mayweathers 3 biggest money mistakes aspx https www fool com investing general 2014 12 21 floyd mayweathers 3 biggest money mistakes aspx Look don t decapitate me it will make sense later The Setup Floyd Mayweather has a perfect 50 0 professional boxing record tallying up 27 knockouts thus far One could say this mother fucker has some diamond hands Jake Paul is a a youtuber turned amateur boxer with a 3 0 amateur record and no professional matches might all be staged to begin with He got knockouts in all 3 Mayweather is not a bomb throwing knockout artist but he is one of the best defensive fighters I have ever seen It is very difficult to beat a guy you simply cannot hit He looks for openings made by the other guy s mistakes and snaps out the fast jab piling up points on his way to victory He is a vicious counter puncher and wins by reacting to what the other guy does and not trying to just force his way inside in hopes of a knockout blow He shows up to fight all 12 rounds and is not worrying about getting the job done quickly realmoney thestreet com https realmoney thestreet com Again diamond hands Floyd is the obvious pick to beat Jake the inexperienced amateur Floyd should pick him apart according to that guy Relevant quote for good measure Too many people come to the markets looking to throw on a flurry of trades and win by knockout right away They have about as much chance of that as they do of knocking out Floyd Mayweather in the first round realmoney thestreet com The hedgies are going to bet that Jake Paul wins the fight by knock out in X round The ole classic hero fighter takes a fall for a huge sum of money tactic We ve all seen the movies but we all know how they end too The conflict The hero decides to fight for what is right and wins the match after they are nearly defeated If it s not for what s right it may be Mayweather s ego that takes over in this particular scenario In 2011 it was widely reported http bleacherreport com articles 723068 floyd mayweather jr declines 65 million offer from singapore to face pacquiao Mayweather turned down a 65 million paycheck he would have received if he fought Manny Pacquiao fool com The quote above is from an article from none other than our friends at The Motley Fool Essentially the entire article is taunting Mayweather for mistakes he s made with his money particularly insulting the flashy lifestyle he prides himself on so much But the aforementioned quote insults Mayweather s very craft and is calling him a bitch in white collar speak My theory is that if we all tweet at Mayweather his ego will go through the roof Not only will he knock Jake Paul out he will bet on himself to do so too If we take action now https twitter com FloydMayweather https twitter com FloydMayweather If Mayweather puts one and two together in regards to who is offering him this bet and why He should be able to understand that he can invest in GME to counter their dive play they are trying to use him for Mayweather may score two knockouts in one fight In short for everyday individuals like you and I the stock market is where financial futures are secured so don t hesitate to get into the ring fool com They are literally taunting us apes while foreshadowing about their short positions at the same time Conclusion Floyd Mayweather was offered a massive amount of money to throw the fight against Jake Paul Hedgies are betting on Jake and hoping to kick the GME can down the road and build more short ladders Floyd has a massive ego Hedgies insult Floyd Floyd loves money We rage Floyd Floyd buys GME Floyd knocks out Jake Paul Hedgies have no money r fuk d I know we say no dates around here but the day after the fight is wen moon There will be no resistance and GME buying pressure will push hedgies into a margin call Thank you for coming to my TED Talk Footnote Here are some example tweets Aggressive ego shot FloydMayweather you better not lose to no youtubing bitch boy The Numbers FloydMayweather 50 1 would be a damn shame but the greatest tragedy would be who did it JakePaul Prediction FloydMayweather greatest boxer of all time ruins entire career for youtuber

know by now the hedgies are desperate to hold on to those freshly brr tendies Reverse repos through the roof coin dumps the signs are there They have proven at this point they are willing to do anything Potential DD here never done this before please criticize TLDR Hedgies are thirsty as fuck for that oh so moist liquidation They are going to pay Mayweather to take a dive against Logan Paul to kick the can down the road further If we all tweet Mayweather his ego will overcome and Hedgies are fuk d I m going to quote this article a few times https realmoney thestreet com articles 05 04 2015 floyd mayweathers investing lessons https realmoney thestreet com articles 05 04 2015 floyd mayweathers investing lessons and this one https www fool com investing general 2014 12 21 floyd mayweathers 3 biggest money mistakes aspx https www fool com investing general 2014 12 21 floyd mayweathers 3 biggest money mistakes aspx Look don t decapitate me it will make sense later The Setup Floyd Mayweather has a perfect 50 0 professional boxing record tallying up 27 knockouts thus far One could say this mother fucker has some diamond hands Logan Paul is a a youtuber turned amateur boxer with a 3 0 amateur record and no professional matches might all be staged to begin with He got knockouts in all 3 Mayweather is not a bomb throwing knockout artist but he is one of the best defensive fighters I have ever seen It is very difficult to beat a guy you simply cannot hit He looks for openings made by the other guy s mistakes and snaps out the fast jab piling up points on his way to victory He is a vicious counter puncher and wins by reacting to what the other guy does and not trying to just force his way inside in hopes of a knockout blow He shows up to fight all 12 rounds and is not worrying about getting the job done quickly realmoney thestreet com https realmoney thestreet com Again diamond hands Floyd is the obvious pick to beat Logan the inexperienced amateur Floyd should pick him apart according to that guy Relevant quote for good measure Too many people come to the markets looking to throw on a flurry of trades and win by knockout right away They have about as much chance of that as they do of knocking out Floyd Mayweather in the first round realmoney thestreet com The hedgies are going to bet that Logan Paul wins the fight by knock out in X round The ole classic hero fighter takes a fall for a huge sum of money tactic We ve all seen the movies but we all know how they end too The conflict The hero decides to fight for what is right and wins the match after they are nearly defeated If it s not for what s right it may be Mayweather s ego that takes over in this particular scenario In 2011 it was widely reported http bleacherreport com articles 723068 floyd mayweather jr declines 65 million offer from singapore to face pacquiao Mayweather turned down a 65 million paycheck he would have received if he fought Manny Pacquiao fool com The quote above is from an article from none other than our friends at The Motley Fool Essentially the entire article is taunting Mayweather for mistakes he s made with his money particularly insulting the flashy lifestyle he prides himself on so much But the aforementioned quote insults Mayweather s very craft and is calling him a bitch in white collar speak My theory is that if we all tweet at Mayweather his ego will go through the roof Not only will he knock Logan Paul out he will bet on himself to do so too If we take action now https twitter com FloydMayweather https twitter com FloydMayweather If Mayweather puts one and two together in regards to who is offering him this bet and why He should be able to understand that he can invest in GME to counter their dive play they are trying to use him for Mayweather may score two knockouts in one fight In short for everyday individuals like you and I the stock market is where financial futures are secured so don t hesitate to get into the ring fool com They are literally taunting us apes while foreshadowing about their short positions at the same time Conclusion Floyd Mayweather was offered a massive amount of money to throw the fight against Logan Paul Hedgies are betting on Logan and hoping to kick the GME can down the road and build more short ladders Floyd has a massive ego Hedgies insult Floyd Floyd loves money We rage Floyd Floyd buys GME Floyd knocks out Logan Paul Hedgies have no money r fuk d I know we say no dates around here but the day after the fight is wen moon There will be no resistance and GME buying pressure will push hedgies into a margin call Thank you for coming to my TED Talk Footnote Here are some example tweets Aggressive ego shot FloydMayweather you better not lose to no youtubing bitch boy The Numbers FloydMayweather 50 1 would be a damn shame but the greatest tragedy would be who did it LoganPaul Prediction FloydMayweather greatest boxer of all time ruins entire career for youtuber check

correlation I m sure some other apes around here saw In the beginning of the AMC amp BB rallies they were partially correlating to eachother This is about to change due to the timing of which the shorts cover in this case it was AMC that had some shorts covering today Shorts will have to buy back the shares that they borrowed These short sellers that borrow shares from brokers do not have to liquidate like in Perpetual futures though they are still required to return the shares to the broker this is part psychological and part finance Covering in short spurts brings about great price movement and this could be what is occuring in BB amp AMC But the truth is especially with the Reddit Army a bunch of working class citizens trying to becoming financially independent and a lambo or two extravaganza These are hedge funds that have billions of dollars at their disposal but when one large short position like GME in that fund is in deep shit they do whatever they can do get the fuck out of it but slowly Then they wait to short it again Let s keep them waiting awhile Overall it is A never ending cycle of greedy conniving fund managers running companies like GME AMC and BB into the ground so they can buy another NBA team with the profits That s over when we stick together Back to the point of course the shorts have not all covered yet AMC amp BB running to 100 and 45 respectively is definitely on track given the volume and the short interest But there is one key difference We will most likely be seeing a lot of covering early as in today my friends AMC has seen some shorts covering yesterday given the emotional green candles at ridiculous prices They started this game To all hedge funds attempting to go to war with us you will lose on individual stocks ETFs SLV GLD Go ahead with that garbage Not interested One more message This is not done yet Today is one of those day comrades we may see a pullback into close on BB but BB has a 99 chance of heading past

required to return the shares to the broker this is part psychological and part finance Covering in short spurts brings about great price movement and this could be what is occuring in BB amp AMC But the truth is especially with the Reddit Army a bunch of working class citizens trying to becoming financially independent and a lambo or two extravaganza These are hedge funds that have billions of dollars at their disposal but when one large short position like GME in that fund is in deep shit they do whatever they can do get the fuck out of it but slowly Then they wait to short it again Let s keep them waiting awhile Overall it is A never ending cycle of greedy conniving fund managers running companies like GME AMC and BB into the ground so they can buy another NBA team with the profits That s over when we stick together Back to the point of course the shorts have not all covered yet AMC amp BB running to 100 and 45 respectively is definitely on track given the volume and the short interest But there is one key difference We will most likely be seeing a lot of covering early as in today my friends AMC has seen some shorts covering yesterday given the emotional green candles at ridiculous prices They started this game To all hedge funds attempting to go to war with us you will lose on individual stocks ETFs SLV GLD Go ahead with that garbage Not interested One more message This is not done yet Today is one of those day comrades we may see a pullback into close on BB but BB has a 99 chance of heading past 24 AMC the sky is the limit When will we sell When GME BB AMC are on a Falcoln Rocket to the moon We as a fellow community must bring back the boys who have been holding BB since 25 GME since 300 WE KNOW YOU ARE THERE THANK YOU FOR DOING YOUR DUTY NO APE GETS LEFT BEHIND Good luck ladies amp gents we re going to see some serious shit today Oh and don t forget SNDL they been here from the start Positions 10x 1C SNDL 06 04 15x 12C BB 6 18 25x 13C BB 6 18 Mods

announced a new stock sale to take advantage of the extraordinary retail interest that has driven the movie theater chain s equity up by 2 850 this year AMC s AMC lawyers are apparently as surprised as anyone so much so that the company added a fresh risk factor to its 11 million share sale which basically boils down to this warning Prepare to lose everything if you buy the stock The following is the full extraordinary warning bolded and italicized text reproduced as in AMC prospectus The market prices and trading volume of our shares of Class A common stock have recently experienced and may continue to experience extreme volatility which could cause purchasers of our Class A common stock to incur substantial losses The market prices and trading volume of our shares of Class A common stock have recently experienced and may continue to experience extreme volatility which could cause purchasers of our Class A common stock to incur substantial losses For example during 2021 to date the market price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated from an intra day low of 1 91 per share on January 5 2021 to an intra day high on the NYSE of 72 62 on June 2 2021 and the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE on June 2 2021 was 62 55 per share During 2021 to date daily trading volume ranged from approximately 23 598 228 to 1 253 253 550 shares Within the last seven business days the market price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated from an intra day low of 12 18 on May 24 2021 to an intra day high of 72 62 on June 2 2021 and we have made no disclosure regarding a change to our underlying business during that period other than with respect to an additional financing We believe that the recent volatility and our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business or macro or industry fundamentals and we do not know how long these dynamics will last Under the circumstances we caution you against investing in our Class A common stock unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment Extreme fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common stock have been accompanied by reports of strong and atypical retail investor interest including on social media and online forums The market volatility and trading patterns we have experienced create several risks for investors including the following the market price of our Class A common stock has experienced and may continue to experience rapid and substantial increases or decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects or macro or industry fundamentals and substantial increases may be significantly inconsistent with the risks and uncertainties that we continue to face factors in the public trading market for our Class A common stock include the sentiment of retail investors including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites and online forums the direct access by retail investors to broadly available trading platforms the amount and status of short interest in our securities access to margin debt trading in options and other derivatives on our Class A common stock and any related hedging and other trading factors our market capitalization as implied by various trading prices currently reflects valuations that diverge significantly from those seen prior to recent volatility and that are significantly higher than our market capitalization immediately prior to the COVID 19 pandemic and to the extent these valuations reflect trading dynamics unrelated to our financial performance or prospects purchasers of our Class A common stock could incur substantial losses if there are declines in market prices driven by a return to earlier valuations to the extent volatility in our Class A common stock is caused as has widely been reported by a short squeeze in which coordinated trading activity causes a spike in the market price of our Class A common stock as traders with a short position make market purchases to avoid or to mitigate potential losses investors purchase at inflated prices unrelated to our financial performance or prospects and may thereafter suffer substantial losses as prices decline once the level of short covering purchases has abated and if the market price of our Class A common stock declines you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price at which you acquired them We cannot assure you that the equity issuance of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future in which case you could incur substantial losses We may continue to incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that may not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or developments by or affecting us Accordingly the market price of our shares of Class A common stock may fluctuate dramatically and may decline rapidly regardless of any developments in our business

that this dumpster fire of a sub doesn t even deserve You re making money right now on GME AMC BB or whatever Allow me to introduce you to a company with boomer level fundamentals that took a haircut during the pandemic and is set to fucking explode The company name is Tellurian ticker is TELL MY KNOWLEDGE AND BACKGROUND Even though I have a double digit IQ I am in charge of keeping energy producers from blowing up spilling fuck loads of oil catching shit on fire and or keeping seafood fresh and hydrocarbon free I ve been in the business for many moons I have dealt with MANY companies I ve seen MANY business types I have seen transitions in business models as producers have dealt with energy price crashes I work directly with company executives all the way down to operators and hands I like talking to everyone and absorbing as much knowledge as I can even though I m mentally retarded Even though you morons can t read have your wife s gf s boyfriend read this to you and DRILL it in your fucking smooth brain LIQUID NATURAL GAS LNG DEMAND IS RISING AND WILL CONTINUE TO RISE FOR THE NEXT DECADE dEcAde is a period of ten years for you single digit IQ fucks AND BEYOND LNG will be the transition fuel between dirtier energy sources and green energy This transition is coming sooner than we think Are you following What s this LNG you might ask You need to liquefy gas basically concentrating it so that it becomes economical to ship overseas Overseas markets for LNG is massive and growing Seriously look it up EU China and others are increasingly relying on the stuff It s much more expensive for them to produce than the US When a producer the company that puts together millions of dollars to drill a well drills for oil if your drill and zone prediction a zone is the area that a geologist paid for by the producer finds to contain oil is correct 99 of the time three products will flow to the earth s surface in your process These three are water oil and NATURAL GAS Producers will separate oil and water dispose of this waste water into a disposal well thousands and thousands of feet deep Producers will then sell the oil What happens to the gas Well if the producer is lucky there will be a pipeline within a mile or two of their well They will have to pay WAY over 200K to 500K just welding a mile of gas pipeline to tie into this sales line then pay 100 to 250K for a LACT unit This is why oilfield welders have fewer IQs than I do but make 150 hr depending upon pipeline wall thickness dependent upon flowing pressures and how safe the producer wants to be if not bound by DOT regulations If these costs aren t too high and the well is producing as much product as expected then great they sell gas However if they re producing less oil than predicted or they re producing thousand of barrels of water per day their disposal costs will be so high they can t afford to build the pipeline they will just burn the stuff Seriously I can not tell you HOW MUCH GAS IS JUST BURNED The VAST majority of producers just flare the gas Just the flare vessel is like 30K Imaging paying 30K to burn LNG that s worth 100s of thousands of dollars I worked in the Permian basin in West Texas Anyone here with this experience can vouch for me At night in the Permian the sky is literally lit up with these flares It s like you re a goddamn ant on a fucking birthday cake that s for both for your great great great mothers and her boyfriend s birthday basically a shit load of candles It s an amazing sight wWhY dO tHeY DoO WasTE gAAS You re in the middle of fucking NOWHERE You d have to run hundreds of miles of pipeline to sell the gas This would cost more than drilling the well No company in their right mind would do this The only options is to flare it This one company I was working for was burning over 100K worth of natural gas per MONTH PER WELL they had FIVE wells The US just burns the crap we can produce it so cheap it just makes more sense to burn it rather than bothering to sell it Gas is a nuisance to us Other countries would die for it There is actually new technologies that converts LNG into GASOLINE for cars If you re a stupid brain dead fuck who doesn t believe me fucking Google it So what about this TeLlUriAn coMpaNIee Charif Souki started Tellurian If you don t know who he is he is a LNG god He was a banker on Wall St highest paid CEO years ago pioneered the LNG industry He and his team are impeccable If you want to build a LNG empire you hire Souki if you want to know the future of hydrocarbon energy you hire Souki if you want a new boyfriend for your wife you hire Souki He built Cheniere Enerny about 2 hours from my house a company with 10billion in revenue and is trading 80 share He left the company because the LNG business model is requiring a change It will need to be produced at less cost current business models aren t sustainable Cheniere Energy is over 20 BILLION dollars in debt Yes 20 BILLIOOONNNNNNNN Guess how much debt Tellurian has ZERO NONE 0 00 This is UNHEARD of in a new company in this industry Tellurian just signed a 10 BILLION dollar purchase agreement from ONE company TELL is currently talking deals with at least 4 other companies This 10 billion dollar deal is a 10 year agreement This is 1 billion per year Their current market cap is just over 1 billion Do you realize yet how undervalued this company is It s mind blowing They begin their Driftwood facility construction in Louisiana this summer This will be the terminal to export LNG 32 billion dollar project Do you know whats even better They wont completely rely on third party producers selling them gas to liquefy BECAUSE THEY DRILL AND PRODUCE THEIR OWN GAS They started drilling again after a brief pause due to

million shares in April and are just filing them today Don t listen to all this FUD circulating They are trying to get us to sell off Hold Hold And buy the dips my fellow Apes Remember why we are here Welcome to all the newbie Apes joining the movement i will try my best to simplify what is going on and catch you up since many are asking Feel free to scroll past if you are a veteran A long long time ago The evil citadel empire and hedge fund cronies led by darth Kenneth Griffin tried to short AMC stock to bankrupt the company and take profits These are the same groups that caused the housing crisis of 2008 that were bailed out with our tax dollars The best explanation of shorting is when someone borrows a 10 video game from a friend stock banana and sells it to a video game store for 10 thinking that in a few weeks the price will likely depreciate to 5 which at that point they will buy back pocket the 5 difference and return the video game to their friend In this case a bunch of apes decided that this AMC video game has nostalgic value and decided to buy all the video games from every store in the world and love it so much they will Hold on for Dear Life HODL unless the person is willing to pay a ridiculous amount for it say 100k or more Obviously that seems crazy so the borrower says no way at first assuming it will eventually go down in price again later At this point the original owner says i want my video game back The borrower of the AMC video game realizes he will never be able to pay 100K or more for the video game or he will lose all his money tendies so he tries several different ways of solving his problem One way is he borrows the video game from another another kid in class who loans it to him for a very low variable 2 7 APR interest rate He gives the borrowed share back to the original friend and everything looks good to the original friend Problem now is he owes the lender the video game which he now doesn t have The lender realizes he likes making money every day and decides to up the interest rate variably all the way up to 247 apr interest In the meantime the borrower tries several ways to make it look like people are selling the video game so that he can trick other apes into selling their copies One big trick is that he makes a bunch of bootleg copies that he sells back and forth between friends at lower and lower prices to make it seem like the value of the game is dropping short ladder attacks But apes are not as stupid as they seem Instead they act even dumber and buy even more copies of the video game because they think its a great value The video games work and play fine but they all have a a unique serial code that is only redeemable to one person the original owner So now a bunch of apes own all the video games 450ish million plus however many bootleg versions are floating around maybe a billion or more The original borrower was hoping surely these apes will eventually sell their games if we keep making it look like there are more and more games being sold off So they keep doubling down on their convictions and we just keep buying more keeping the price of the game relatively low Except now they are paying crazy high interest on several millions of copies How many copies No one knows for sure yet But silverback Adam Aron creator of AMC video game decides things have gotten out of control He cleverly devises a plan to create a video game update so that everyone has to register their copies online also known as the vote update At this point the number of fake video games will be released revealing some naughty people have been bootlegging his game The Feds and SEC don t like it when people make illegal bootlegs So once they are done taking their sweet time building their case and catching them red handed The hedgies faking shares and manipulating the market with bad rumors will inevitably be called by Principal Margin who will take all of their money and start giving it back to the original video game owners as well as the bootlegs The hedgies will be sent to detention for several years where they will have to be very careful not to drop the soap in front of the class bully Once all the parents catch wind of the scandal at school they all demand their children are compensated for the video game at the price they determined because its not even possible to give them all their original video game Because the teachers Brokers were supposed to monitor the students failed allowing this to happen they will have to help pay for the video games If the teachers don t have enough to pay the principals banks have to help pay because they ensured the students the teachers were doing their jobs If the principals don t have enough to cover the superintendents insurance companies and DTCC have to help pay This goes on all the way up to the federal level until apes get all the Tendies that their video Games are worth which is enough money to send you up to the moon As far as Robinhood they were accused of being complicit in assisting Hedgefunds by selling off

is all that just about every long haired guitar playing boyfriend my wife brings home has talked about so if the kids are into it these days who is in the right place to capitalize on that change Lets take a look at some of the top sectors that are in the running Solar A million players in the game and the price on installation right now buyers don t see payout for over a decade It is priced over the head of most retail buyers the government subsidies are expiring by the day and most politicians aren t gonna be holding office in the same city by then so they hardly give a shit and neither do the old boomers voting for them Also highly dependent on battery tech which is a whole other hurdle and energy density is terrible read not ideal for moving things ie cars trucks Wait for change up Wind Huge windmills are great but those things are isolated to the middle of know where and can t get anywhere near the big cities that actually consume any sizable amount of power and are dependent on a stable power grid and if its too windy they have to shut them down anyways because of how fragile they can be Same battery issue as Solar Pass Hydro Similar problem to wind except even worse because if there isn t a bunch of flowing water near you shit out of luck Only so many places hydro is even worth setting up and most have been tapped into for decades Same battery issue as Solar and wind Hard Pass Have I been edging you along enough Natural gas I know what you are thinking BuT tHeRe iS cArBoN iN tHaT 1 11 And congrats retard you must have paid a little bit of attention in Chem 100 and weren t entirely distracted by Stacy s knockers from across the room Other massive benefit is energy density meaning it has high viability to heavy shipping unlike the electrical energy forms mentioned previously Here s what is great natural gas and be produced carbon neutral Better yet it can be produced from literal garbage Better yet there is a company doing this already Better yet they have been doing it and they are doing it at a profit Not a government subsidized profit like every solar company or like TLSA but this company actually makes money CLNE Clean energy fuels corp is currently sitting around a 3 5B Market cap and trading between 8 10 a share and the options premiums trail off hard and fasts ATM options AFTER EARNINGS are going for near 1 50 a contract and earnings are not until September Last Earnings Report summary They beat earnings raised forward guidance and increased their profit margin The other great thing they have going for them natural gas infrastructure is already in place and so they are already compatible with any location that has the infrastructure in place and they can turn their dump into a power source while also remaining carbon neutral today not 20 years from now It is a unique company in a unique space that has an established track record for success and plenty of room for growth Technical s It has been in a descending channel since February and has met up with the 200 day SMA Red Line and bounced off of it With that there has been a similar crossing of the MACD and steady rise in the RSI in addition to some serious price consolidation Daily price candles make Peter Dinklage look like a monster Nothing too fancy here to be honest mostly just price consolidation leaving the options dirt cheap and the underlying ready to explode with a few positive trending signals EDIT It has exploded since this draft so the options are no longer dirt cheap LEAPS 6mo 1 year or shares are probably the way to play this If you re bold and the ape brigade piles on Jun 18 exp has a shot up to low teen strikes https preview redd it t7m80boer2371 png width 602 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f6e08390c55098a80f826d09701c920963878a51 Who else is buying If you aren t already checking Whale Wisdom and open insider to spot large buys or insider buys you probably should be since I know your wife isn t distracting you It s not as fast as a Bloomberg Terminal but it can put you ahead of most the retail schmucks out there like you that wait for DD from someone else who is nice enough to share it with you Sadly Open insider doesn t give much to work with but based on share totals most everyone in the company is Jacked to the tits on shares so I am not too surprised to see them unload since its climb the last year either to get some play money to diversify or to prove to their wives that she doesn t need a boyfriend anymore Whale wisdom is showing nothing but buying for the last quarter And ferocious buying at that 24 increase in the number of funds holding 20 increase in 13F ownership to 38 of the float 50 increase in new positions 50 increase in growing positions 70

up near a 12B market cap which considering addressable market with large shipping vehicles seems well attainable Plus most things are trading miles above what they should be anyways so a 25

dive into complicated shit because you guys will start staring at the screen and just go look for a post with a rocket and moon emoji So many retards are making more than their IQ it makes me happy as well to know that there are always a revolving door of wives for my wife s boyfriend to choose from Hopefully I get mine back soon Until then here s a few pointers from a fellow cuck If you re going to YOLO YOLO with a percentage of your money not all of it Seriously please I ve lost a lot of money when you go on here you re seeing the 3 4 people a day that made ridiculous money There are 10 000 000 fucking people on this subreddit Don t think it s normal to make crazy amounts of money every day Most people with losses do not post I for one have lost a lot and I don t post them because fuck that If I don t take a pic it didn t happen However let s say you did YOLO and you lost your dad s retirement Once your dick shrivels and you ve come down to Earth you can look at the stock market for what it is complete degenerate gambling There is no rhyme or reason You wish you could have only known AMC would jump 100 yesterday The people that had all of that money on it probably didn t know what the fuck happened No one does While not unforeseeable the timing is nearly impossible to predict Instead of following the weekly trend the best way to have your moment is to ZERO IN ON ONE STOCK that means buy shares and a few long options Once you see the trend start to pick up put more money in It s better to learn everything about one quality stock than 1 thing about 1 463 stocks Humans aren t computers and we don t have the bandwidth to be fucking Zoltar Unless we re rich enough to make our own waves For me that one stock is BABA I like it it s true not just for retail investors but for institutional investors as well There are so many people that haven t touched this stock and it s not a matter of if it is simply a matter of when This is broader than a one DD post you can find a million DD s but this one is fucking easy money BABA is so underpriced it s embarrassing it s about the only value stock left and once people realize it then it ll go nuts I can t tell you to buy it though that s just what I m doing I find that a lot of people are learning about stocks so you ll have younger investors mature to look for stocks with more true potential from a wider perspective This one is one that people will realize as they graduate from the glory days of meme stocks and so forth However I don t want to get bored SO IN THE MEANTIME With a percentage of my portfolio coloring book I can play the trends and learn more to keep a vested interest and be in the loop The trends are great because I find a lot of good moves to profit from quickly But I get too excited in the mornings A little about premarket I Don t buy right at the open I usually wait a minute The premarket doesn t always dictate what happens when the market opens From my experience if the premarket is WAY up then when it opens the people will take their profits before waiting for the next dip The market usually steadies after the first hour and a half or so if we hit a decline it tends to jump back up at around midday https www thebalance com common intra day stock market patterns 1031456 https www thebalance com common intra day stock market patterns 1031456 It s a bit different now since most trading isn t done in New York however Market Makers are still a thing and most of them are older and have this shit locked in and a consistent schedule amp x200B So when you see BB is up 37 premarket expect some profit taking before you start buying the top I ve made this mistake COUNTLESS times In terms of AMC and other sentimental stocks I have no clue but a good fucking rule of thumb is just to know that if it can go up THAT FAST it can go down JUST AS FUCKING FAST TAKE PROFITS The best way to make money is to sell when shit is going crazy way up way fast A good rule of thumb is to make a conscious effort to know what your entry and exit points are Just as if you d create a stop loss create an exit point with what you re willing to part with some of your shares or some of your options Don t just wait for the top because you don t fucking know it You can look at the chart see how it fluctuates then try and anticipate reasonable entry and exit points When an option goes up 4 000 00 the greater fool theory CAN prevail but it doesn t always I had a NOK option go up 4 000 but there was no buyer Not everyone is that stupid Sell at a price that you might be stupid enough to buy it at Think against your natural reaction The market moves off of reactions but it s the ones who push their fear aside that make the dough amp x200B Ok done here Not a financial advisor amp x200B K dude I will see you when you get home from work btw I moved my Ferrari into your garage next to your wife s Corolla

stock the world seems to have forgot about I ve been bleeding out on FDs in sideways trading hell on this for too many months and its about time everybody opens their eyes to this play and reap the inevitable rewards In the shadow of the AMC mega gains you might overlook CRSR s respectable 7 lift this week But this movement is actually the sign of a fuse thats just been lit I shouldn t have to give most of you too much introduction on the company itself Corsair was founded in 1994 and has since become one of the global leaders in PC gaming hardware and peripherals The company IPO d last September at 15 and made a heroic run up to almost 51 before retreating into a seemingly never ending sideways cycle The company has a proven track record in an exploding industry Rockstar Fundamentals Whether you care about the F word or not Corsair has been an incredible buy opportunity Even before the pandemic their revenues and profits were growing CRSR is on track to exceed 2bln revenue this year more than doubling 2019 sales Profitability margins have been increasing every year since IPO They have plenty of cash in the tank and have been paying down debts Its held 5 by Insiders and a whopping 77 by institutional investors https preview redd it r6tc7coxn3371 png width 836 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 26e7364054a60f1b492cfcbd2b1fb672c1a77ab6 https preview redd

Memory Corsair has been making strategic acquisitions in the streaming space most notably scooping up Elgato By all accounts Corsair is making all the right moves and is currently firmly in undervalued territory Months of sideways strangulation by FUD bears and Shorts CRSR investors have endured many months of maddening sideways trading For the first few months it seemed like it was trading with the market and that investors were just waiting to see what happened with some upcoming news But after releasing good news after good news the stock has continued to stagnate and bounce around in completely unnatural intraday boom bust cycles Almost on queue swinging 2 to 2 to 2 every day The reason for this is due to a mix of a very low float and ridiculously low volume These two factors have allowed swing traders and institutional short sellers to play this stock like a fiddle CRSR has just 92 M shares outstanding and 26 51M shares in the float Most of the shares are held by institutions Short interest has been hovering around 20 Which is high on its own but doesn t tell the full story Big pocket institutions have been selling tens of thousands of shares short in the AM then covering intraday With the low volume it doesn t take much to push the price down substantially without much ammo The big boys have been writing calls buying puts and then using shorts and their own holdings to push the price down before exercise Meanwhile bears have been spreading FUD throughout the investment world about CRSR on 3 primary points None of which have actually come to fruition 1 CRSR is a Pandemic Play and gaming will magically disappear after things return to normal This is the biggest boomer bs The pc gaming and esports industries have been absolutely exploding over the last few years Not to mention the streaming space which has been growing independently of it CRSR sales are cyclical like every retail company but Q1 sales showed no signs of slowing Gaming is not going anywhere 2 THE SPOOOOKY Lockup period will cause millions of shares to flood the market There was tons of FUD spreading about 14 million IPO shares that would become unrestricted for sale back in March People were convinced that these shares would flood the market instantly and tank the price But the lockup period came and went almost no shares were actually sold 3 The global supply chain shortages means CRSR will not be able to grow True the microchip shortage is a threat to CRSR but its also a threat to every other company in that space What they ve announced in their reports is that they had MORE DEMAND THAN THEY COULD FULFILL That is not a bearish signal Despite the supply chain woes CRSR sales dramatically beat expectations showing they adapted and overcame this issue You may also be interested that the latest to join the short party is our good friends at Shita del making a short play at the end of May The 59 Earning Beat everybody ignored While some were expecting lackluster Q1 21 results as the pandemic wanes and supply chain issues rage on in the May 2021 earnings release CRSR subverted all expectations They beat estimates by an incredible 59 If anybody needed proof positive CRSR could weather the FUD this was it But despite the stellar report the stock actually DROPPED on the earnings report and never recovered You might be saying of course the stock dropped every tech stock drops on earnings Yes this is true IF there is a runup in the share price before the announcement But in this case there was no runup the stock had been stagnant and even declining before the announcement This is when every retail CRSR holder knew this stock was not making natural movements it was being intentionally held down By every logical account the stock should have lifted in the weeks following the Q1 results And because it didn t the market has been ignoring CRSR due to the very effective FUD campaigns and short seller But this also means that the stock has entered deep into undervalued territory LOW FLOAT VOLUME ROCKET Given all the drama why should you be looking at this stock Because the same factors that bears have been using to hold this stock down are exactly what will cause it to take off ALL CRSR NEEDS TO BLOW IS A LITTLE MORE VOLUME The big bears have written calls and puts stacked around the 30 35 strikes out through the EOY

bearish trading strategies will become ineffective They will lose a ton of money Breaking Out CRSR just hit 35 shr today for the first time since early March This might not seem like much but its the spark we needed I will reiterate all this stock needs to pop is slightly more positive volume This stock is poised to blow up fast and hard The float is too small the short selling tactics will not work when this thing makes a run At the moment it can be moved with only about 50k shares volume if the volume increases even by 10 or so its going to run As CRSR continues its exceptional performance it s only a matter of time before it breaks free from the cycle and it looks like it will happen sooner than later When it does happen the shorts will crumble TL DR A few thousand more people buy CRSR

financial advisor nor am I giving any financial advise This is an entertainment comedy nonfactual post I m a retard posting on WSB with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in F So proceed on your own risk F Ford 3 months ago I spent so much time on part 1 and after posting it I sadly realized that people are lazy Apes don t want to read mountains of DD They just want a 5th grade level TLDR This Ape got you and this DD will basically be a Long version of a TLDR I ll try to make it concise and to the point as much as possible 5 hours later I failed at this objective lol Though if you are interested in my initial DD which took 2 days of research here s the link https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lsh9fh ev play buying leap calls on america for the next FYI I will not include any points mentioned in part one like for example why it s grossly undervalued etc Spoiler Alert it predicted F 150 EV pump Let s jump into it Our ambition is to lead the electric vehicle revolution CEO Jim Farley 1 Ford s secret weapon unleashed For the last 44 consecutive years the F 150 has been Americas best selling Truck In 2019 the Ford F Series was second only to the Apple iPhone which raked in 55 billion in terms of total revenue generated The F Series generated more revenue than the NFL MLB NBA and the NHL combined Just something to think about On May 19 Ford has unveiled its EV F 150 after Biden had driven it a week prior The EV s features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min video It has all the features crucial for it s target buyers Construction workers Farmers Free lance delivery drivers Basically hardworking Blue collar Americans and it s a Truck which actually looks like a Truck Ford knows what pickup owners want IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said More importantly it s an F 150 first an EV second Ford didn t abandon the F 150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years Now Ford s EVs are targeting middle class value buyers High quality cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla right now with sales more on this on 5 The F 150 starts at 32 500 after Federal tax credit Cheaper than any of Potential because they don t exist yet competitors with superior car features Moreover on May 26 it was announced that 70 000 Trucks were already reserved As Ford promised F 150 Lightning will deliver more features and cost less Don t forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year 2 Ford Rivian Partnership Ford Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September It s looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now Ford is 62 50B at 14 94 Ford has initially invested 500 million in Rivian but it added much more of an undisclosed amount Farley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market As more companies continue to invest in Rivian Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares but that s not why we invested Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend Farley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV SUV market too with a Lincoln or Explorer Rivian car He understands that the first move is the most important one in the EV territory and until now with the Mach E and F 150 Ford execute the mission perfectly Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices and high quality Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1 3 Ford SK Recent Partnership On May 20 Ford and SK Innovation announced that they have signed a MOU for a joint venture to be called BlueOvalSK to manufacture battery cells and arrays in the U S BlueOvalSK to produce approximately 60 gigawatt hours GWh annually with potential to expand To put that into perspective By 2030 Ford expects annual energy demand for its vehicles to be up to 140 GWh annually in North America and up to 240 GWh globally They are Taking the Battery development seriously from now and preparing to eat the EV market share 4 Ford Government contracts Ford clearly has business and government fleets in mind Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said Ford revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F 150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday Called the Lightning Pro it s equipped with a standard battery that s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs 39 974 the same as the base price for retail F 150 Lightnings Ford s vision to lead the EV market has a no brainer component Elon Musk lacks a vast base of business and government fleet customers it s targeting with new battery powered trucks and vans Ford s focus on converting fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts Ford is in bed with the government and they could easily scoop up most EV vehicle related contracts with their connections 5 Recent EV sales Today Ford has reported a 184 jump in electric vehicle EV sales in May Overall total sales for May including EVs and non electric vehicles grew 4 1 year on year Total sales were up 11 3 for the year to date Now for the surprising Mach E Ford s first EV this year sales The Mach E is eating up Tesla sales Morgan Stanley shows that Tesla s share of the US EV market fell to 69 in February down from 81 a year ago Mach E accounted for nearly 100 of the Tesla share loss said Adam Jonas Morgan Stanley s auto analyst Now for international sales Mustang Mach E was the best selling vehicle of any kind in Norway in May the first full month of sales On the other hand Tesla Model 3 was sixth on the sales list Ford is not Fucking Around and they are doing it right in the EV space 6 Price Target For the price target

your newly found tendies so they go forth and multiply I mean who the fuck wants to work from home anymore when you can just from home And that s where my bovine friends come in Now that markets are closed I can finally divert my attention away from staring at my stonks and do something constructive like convince other people to also spend every waking minute staring at their stonks Fair warning this DD contains the term Ultra Bull which for me at least triggered some major PTSD about my wife s BF condom packs littering my bedroom floor Pick that shit up Jefe It s common courtesy Guh this is a fuck ton of words already First things first Cramer shit on this stock Jim Cramer said Clean Energy Fuels Corp has run out of gas Sigh you poor geriatric fuck that pun was pathetic even for a guy who cried when the Eagles lost SuperBowl LII Also how dare you challenge my confirmation bias If your going to challenge me I choose NG4 Golden Eye at dawn And no Odd Job we all know that shit is for

I have no idea Traffic Sentiment CLNE has rocketed pun into the fourth position in a list of tickers mentioned on Reddit today So what fourth is for kids with wrinkles exactly but it came from nowhere DEAR GOD YOU MIGHT GET IN EARLY Yesterday it was bottom feeding with the likes of people who buy bath water off of onlyfans com hey guys how are ya Today it s riding high passing the likes of an

started generating excitement today like a Britney CD insert at a middle school in 1999 don t judge me When the price hits 13 2 5 million or so shares worth of OI will suddenly fall ITM and get exercised faster than your b hole after 7 of those 1 chipotle melts from T Bell fuck me are those good for 1 Now obviously that strike is the trigger for a major event but the 10 12 levels are no joke

you re thinking fuck off retard 2 5 million shares isn t even going to fill my gaping asshole since it hasn t recovered from my PLTR calls and UPST puts FUCK UPST FUCK and AMC had 17 38 billion shares traded today overestimate I haven t checked 2 5 million is a TON for CLNE though it would be 50 of an average day s volume and in terms of that s about 32 5 million in equity HOLY FUCK IT FINALLY MADE A 2 A very influential user on here who definitely likes the stock ran some actual not retarded math and determined that a sweep of only 6 million or so of total capital would be needed based on the order book on that given day to push the price to that level and put the options ITM That s only 550k buys or so Will 550K shares purchased sustain it there Obviously no because rainbow bear homos will sell too but the point is that it will take very little action a concept which you re very familiar with to get there what the fuck now it s 1 again Shorts have been beating this thing down DAILY and the interest increases steadily over time This isn t a play where we re going to see huuuuuge volumes of short shares but it s still important to mention because when you use buzzy words like AI

transportation and absolutely zero travel centers of america this section is going to be brief because I know no one fucking cares The point of this section is that beyond this epic short term opportunity this company is going to fuck long term and for legitimate reasons This is not financial advice my mom ties my velcro shoes daily CLNE is focused on heavy transportation markets and providing trucking with a fuel that isn t killing the planet faster than social media influenced justice campaigns Let s review some alternative green energy technologies and talk about how they can spoiler alert they fucking can t better serve this market Hydrogen no substantial infrastructure in the US and if it does come it will be years decades before it s developed enough to support network of highways for trucking Hydro Wind lol wtf are you talking about how could that power a truck EV s the obvious competitor here and very feasible for consumer transportation However trucks are fucking heavy Like heavier than your mom after another trip to Golden Coral for 10 all you can eat filet mignon you know she says MIG NAHN and you want to kill her for it You know what trucks don t need Substantial amounts of additional weight in the form of batteries dragging their efficiency down Solar I m not even going to entertain this RNG renewable natural gas FUCK why are you here requires a truck only to have its engine converted read not replaced and it runs just like normal The fuel is carbon negative because CLNE traps already existing bad gasses and repurposes them into fuel Sources
