naked shorting in relation to recent events,Full disclosure stolen from r options A Case story of Naked Shorting in GME TLDR Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME and if true was likely aided by DTCC whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1 28 because it would ve caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened I know ape can t read but I implore you to read the whole thing originally wasn t going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226 and later in the range of 150 percent of total float Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs https wherearetheshares com Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example r wallstreetbets comments le235t gme institutions hold 177 of float why the Where do these shares come from One potential explanation is synthetic long shares created via a loophole described here r wallstreetbets comments leorks evidence points to gme shorts not having covered or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting I m an entrepreneur not a finance expert so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject I started with this https www sec gov investor pubs regsho htm Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver For example human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book entry form thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three day settlement period A fail may also result from naked short selling Interesting We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox Abusive naked short sales can be used as a tool to drive down a company s stock price to the detriment of all of its investors The Commission is particularly concerned about persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission s Regulation SHO adopted just two years ago Selling short without having stock available for delivery and intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three day settlement period is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities Specifically these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership voting lending and dividends from issuers Moreover they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling which could be used as a tool to drive down a company s stock price Source https www sec gov news speech 2006 spch071206cc2 htm In a different speech Mr Cox re iterated that short selling helps prevent irrational exuberance and bubbles But when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed that is not contributing to an orderly market it is undermining it Mr Cox also referred to the serious problem of abusive naked short sales as a tool to drive down a company s stock price and that the SEC is concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in Regulation SHO which reminds me of this piece I wrote r wallstreetbets comments leorks evidence points to gme shorts not having covered source for SEC Chairman s words https www sec gov news speech 2008 spch071808cc htm As another datapoint Robert J Shapiro former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that naked short selling has cost investors 100 billion and driven 1 000 companies into the ground Source This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted https time com time magazine article 0 9171 1126706 3 00 html but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008 https www sec gov comments s7 08 08 s70808 170 htm I also read One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company s shares for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books This has been alleged to create phantom or counterfeit shares sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares and artificially depressing the share price Shortly after I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers Taibbi said that the two firms got a push into extinction from a flat out counterfeiting scheme called naked short selling Source https www rollingstone com politics story 30481512 wall streets naked swindle All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen potentially even an infinite short squeeze On 1 26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze On 1 28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre trading started the stock shot up to 513 in pre trading and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling followed by several other brokers Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying but funds were not When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2 5 billion to Melvin Capital one of the short side funds and is also responsible for something like 40 of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself Now personally speaking its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this However looking into the details of what happened a skeptical part of me became suspicious Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars https fortune com 2021 02 02 robinhood gamestop restricted trading meme stocks gme amc vlad tenev nscc So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening On that day there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag Worse DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least Then I read something that caught my eye DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts From an article dating back to 2007 Depository Trust amp Clearing Corp is a little known institution in the nation s stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers About 99 of the time trades are completed without incident But about 1 of the shares valued at about 2 5 billion on a given a day aren t delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days for one reason or another These failures to deliver have put DTCC in the middle of a long running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies share prices Source https www wsj com articles SB118359867562957720 Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time According to Wall Street Journal There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens The fight is over how prevalent the problem is and the extent to which DTCC is responsible Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens DTCC and others say it isn t widespread enough to be a major concern Source https www wsj com articles SB118359867562957720 It has been alleged in tens or hundreds of lawsuits that the DTCC and its Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds Law suits have been brought against Merrell Lynch Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley JP Morgan UBS other market makers and also the DTCC The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases The information that they do release is incomplete self serving and misleading Source https smithonstocks com part 3 in series on illegal naked shortings role in stock manipulation prime brokers and the dtcc have a troubling monopoly on clearing and settling stock trades As a thought experiment lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME many many indicators point to this and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME wouldn t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn t get out and blow up in their faces Something to consider Because had they not done what they did on 1 29 Thursday many traders believe the squeeze would ve happened that day From the Wall Street Journal The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice The latest move came last month when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale But some critics argue the SEC still hasn t done enough Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months Until that failure is resolved there are effectively additional shares of a company s stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer s account critics say This phantom stock can put downward pressure on a company s share price by increasing the supply Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked shorting problem source https www wsj com articles SB118359867562957720 From everything I ve seen as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1 26 many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented I personally hold the following hypothesis GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221 and 150 at various times and as late as 1 29 reported by S3 to be 122 https twitter com ihors3 status 1355246955874701314 GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs r wallstreetbets comments leorks evidence points to gme shorts not having covered and using those to cover their positions but not truly covering which is illegal to cover using this particular method and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float The counterfeit shares can have been used in aggressive naked short attacks to further drive down the price of GME which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts may ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME There was potentially collusion on 1 29 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed Also a compelling theory put forth by someone on what the 800 dollar calls were for and how they could be used to cancel out naked shorts includes data graphs recommend giving it a read

Agriculture https www globenewswire com news release 2020 12 31 2152113 0 en US Department of Agriculture Selects Draganfly Commander Drone html All of these accomplishments have been made in lt 3months and they re continuing to invest more in marketing and PR with the CEO becoming very active on social medias Utube and Twitter as well as doing interviews on news stations like Bloomberg to really put their name out there Bluntly put the company was as asleep the past 2 decades but now as the drone industry has drawn so much attention through R amp D and emphases in contactless and unmanned transportation services catalyzed by COVID the company s current investments in R amp D product ingenuity and revenues are on a tangential incline In the past year the company s share price was indeed stale as they were merely listed in the shitty Canadian markets under the ticker DFLY CN https dfly cn But as soon as they entered PINX able to be traded by American investors their share price saw a massive surge Not only that they re now trying to become listed on the NASDAQ https www globenewswire com news release 2021 01 13 2158016 0 en Draganfly Begins Process to List on NASDAQ html expect lt 3months for them convert stock exchanges Competitor Analysis There are always the big names in the drone industry and many players are entering this market as there seems to be a rising demand Boeing BA AeroVironment AVAV Lockheed Martin LMT Ambarella AMBA Parrot PARRO to name a few But of course Draganfly cannot be compared with these giants yet Currently I would put Draganfly beside Alpine4Technologies ALPP A pennystock that s seen massive inclines as they re making similar strides like Draganfly such as acquiring companies establishing strategic partnerships getting listed on the NASDAQ etc Both of these stocks have escaped the pennystock zone rather quickly Financial Analysis Well their financials aren t very good Probably the only caveat in investing in this company As a value investor you d say they re extremely over valued But what era are we living in We easily create massive bubbles for growth stocks and we only invest in speculative growth stocks quickly inflating their share price to x100 revenue multiples But one thing is for sure they ve seen a massive surge in revenue that caught everyone s attention in its recent quarters Fiscal 2020 Third Quarter Highlights Revenue in the third quarter grew by 222 to a record of 1 453 000 compared to revenue of 451 000 in the same period in 2019 Revenue increased 527 365 or 56 as compared to the three months ended June 30 2020 and Gross Profit increased by 47 5 in the third quarter as compared to the same period in 2019 and increased 29 from the previous quarter ended June 30 2020 Catalysts They successfully become listed on the NASDAQ This will be tremendous as it would garner more investors to look into this stock Building up from my previous point the most bullish catalyst that will rocket this to the moon ARKX ARKX the Space Exploration ETF that ll become tradeable on March 29 which will have 45 55 holdings sending this stock to the moon as the date approaches ARKX publicly announced that not only will ARKX have holdings in space exploration aircrafts they ll be investing in drone companies https evtol com news ark invest announces space exploration fund including drones electric aircraft Hence why becoming listed on the NASDAQ is imperative for Draganfly to soar Even if they are not picked up by ARKX Draganfly will still do well as ARKX makes headway for the drone industry as a whole Continued marketing and partnerships They might become partnered with a big name as the drone industry is rather small at the moment Price target At least 12 lt 3 months Positions 10 000 shares

offering a wide range of services Primarily their revenues are from being a search engine taxi services and other segments Currently they offer more than 70 services Streaming subscriptions like

cash flow to ensure that companies have enough liquidity to stay afloat and keep them from issuing new shares to raise capital Spikes in cash flow from growth companies is not uncommon it is mainly due to usual acquisitions restructuring re investments made Current outstanding shares 345m amp x200B Now on to some of their services This is just a brief overview as their business model is pretty extensive and by this time you lovely bastards have already bought OTM calls expiring this weekend Don t yo this is a long term play Yandex Lavka 1 Grocery delivery within 5 12 min is the goal Some sites are achieving this already 2 Takt time per grocery item bagged is 10s Takt time is the amount of time it takes to complete one process 3 Groceries are then transferred to drivers for delivery think Amazon Prime Now 4 In order to reduce costs additional lavkas in high concentration areas will be built 5 Not all but some Lavkas are kitchens where actual food is cooked 6 Yandex Rover is making deliveries actively in three different locations Currently a test but with the goal of going 100 driverless for deliveries and reduce costs amp x200B Yandex Market 1 Their current primary growth segment They ve recently acquired Sberbank s stake Russia s most influential and one of largest banks and now own 100 of market Their goal is to rival other marketplace and ecommerce companies such as Ozon ru https Ozon ru 2 They currently have fulfillment centers and are in the process of building additional ones Does not want to store its own Yandex branded products but wants to become a pure marketplace that offers fulfillment services for sellers and makes it easier for customer cliche but think Amazon amp x200B Yandex Go 1 Offers delivery services to residential and commercial customers stuff ranging from documents to pianos 2 More than 100k deliveries made per day on other customers orders 3 Delivery with a click which delivers the orders to nearby lavkas think Amazon locker Delivery goals are to be within 15 min amp x200B Yandex Cloud Not much to say here but theyre offering cloud services to companies Main competition Amazon AWS Yandex Maps Same as above Main competitor Google Maps Yandex Search Their actual search engine that makes up bulk of their revenues 1 What I loved seeing in their recent financial statements is that while search engine revenues kept increasing their TAC traffic acquisition costs the cost Yandex pays for others to refer customers to them is decreasing What does this mean It means customers are going directly to Yandex instead of using a medium Think why the fuck unless you re a boomer would you go to google search for amazon when you can go to amazon directly This is actually a legit problem Google faces as Amazon cuts down on their revenues by not allowing customers to see Google Ads 2 TAC decreased nine months ended Sep 19 to Sep 20 by 16 while total ad revenues grew by 1 Read that again god damn it They re paying 16 less while maintaining their ad revenues their biggest segment Yandex Self Driving Group Yo This shit Is Legit Let me tell you about the streets of fucking Moscow Dirt snow murky or none at all traffic lanes chaotic drivers alleys tighter than your uncles anus when JNJ took another 1 5 hit on his portfolio And they STILL managed to develop an autonomous driving vehicle that navigates through all that shit without user input They currently have logged over 5 5 million miles using autonomous driving in Tel Aviv Michigan and Moscow That is a big fucking deal They also have a partnership with Hyundai However coming straight from their engineers it will take several years before fully autonomous driving can EXCEED human driving This means it will take several years for perfection whos to say sales cant happen before that Other stuff They sponsor educational camps and programs that focus on hard sciences in Russia Physics mathematics engineering and they continue to choose talent from these areas This lessens the reliance on foreign specialists from the US Europe to develop their products They focus heavily on customer service and truly understand their core audience I am telling you Russians especially those born in Soviet era is TOUGH to accept technology And yet they ve done it by Yandex taxi and Yandex Lavka I m kinda of a gay bear for our stock market right now I feel like we re running on fumes with the stimulus cash and might see some extreme volatility in short term in US stocks Institutions have loaded up on Yandex since late 2020 Don t ever take this as a tell

cases in this case I am also a gay bear Russia is not stable politically things can be done under the table True fair risk But more or less the same thing in US except it s official lobbying insider trading congress hearings that are just a facade They re too over extended in their segments They re focusing on all at once instead of focusing on what they can do really well I would be concerned about this if their cash flow revenues and net incomes would be decreasing YoY However their current trajectory is that theyre consistently increasing Also think about it more simply if they have these specialists working on all these segments they can easily sell them off for a profit Yandex Pay was a cashless payment system that was 100 sold off to Sberbank It is something that Yandex created and then re invested those proceedings to their different ventures like Yandex Market What else you got I am legitimately interested as my overconfident ass has 50 of his portfolio in this

by what went on with GME and am now seeing the effects of this flow into CBWTF which I have been buying on its way down from over 2 to under 0 15 over the last 3 years Auxly Cannabis Group was originally started as Cannabis Wheaton around 2016 by Chuck Rifici and Hugo Alves Chuck Rifici was the co founder of a company originally called Tweed Marijuana and now is known as Canopy Growth Corp the largest marijuana company in the world After a falling out with his co founder of Tweed Bruce Linton the last CEO of Canopy Chuck left Tweed the company was re named Canopy and Chuck set out to create a cannabis streaming company that would take minority ownership stakes in small cannabis companies to help them scale and grow Auxly co founder Hugo Alves current Auxly CEO is a lawyer who was previously a partner at the law firm Bennett Jones and brings a wealth of regulatory knowledge to Auxly The vision was to build a vertically integrated low overhead cannabis company built around financing that would be ready by the time cannabis became legalized in Canada When marijuana was legalized on October 17th 2018 the only product that was legal to be sold was cannabis flower At this point Auxly had already made numerous financing deals and acquisitions of growers processors and retail stores and was prepared for a wide range of products However as the flower market cannabis 1 0 struggled to have a large amount of success and with the next wave of cannabis products such as edibles topicals concentrates and vapes cannabis 2 0 not becoming legalized until 2019 Auxly looked to be in not a great place A number of large greenhouse deals Auxly had fell through as the industry quickly moved to shut down excess flower growing capacity Luckily Auxly had opted for a vertically integrated low overheard model from the very beginning unlike other companies in the industry who had spend tons of money scaling capacity for growing This allowed Auxly to scale down their cannabis 1 0 rollout plan and pivot their business model to prepare more for the cannabis 2 0 legalization which they expected to be more popular among consumers Fast forward to October 17th 2019 This day marked the end of the first year of marijuana legalization and also the legalization of a second wave cannabis 2 0 products At this point Auxly had hit some major milestones financing deals trimmed some fat and has secured a handful of wholly owned subsidiaries that act as cornerstone assets that are outlined below Imperial Brands Partnership Auxly secured a 123m CAD investment from Imperal Brands IMBBY

even launched a new value price vape brand called Back Forty Auxly is also sitting in one of the top spots for gross margin amongst all Canadian licensed producers with around 30 gross margin Auxly s plan from the very beginning to be a lower overhead producer has paid off by having some of the best margins in the industry and will continue to increase as production and cultivation continues to scale Auxly management has taken initiative to try to drastically reduce Capex and SG amp A and is currently guiding that they will be cash flow positive by the first half of 2021 Auxly has a great management team a strong foundation of assets funding and partnerships has one of the largest market share of 2 0 products and is expanding their 1 0 market participation in a safe and efficient way With launching new product SKUs rapidly increasing revenue 800k to 15m in one year guiding for profitability first half of this year and some of the best margins in the industry I feel as though Auxly is the most exciting and undervalued company in the Canadian cannabis industry It is crazy to me to see Auxly finally getting some attention and love after 3 years of being crushed by poor performance and dilutive funding While there are a lot of shares outstanding due to the dilutive funding I feel as though the company is undervalued and I am looking forward to continuing to hold the shares I have bought over the last 3 years which has accumulated to quite a large amount and see Auxly grow into one of the top cannabis recreational medicinal and wellness companies in the world through

case with AMC Is the run over Has the squeeze squozed No AMC s price jump back on the 27th of Jan was due to a high demand in the stock following the GME squeeze People who did not want to miss out on an another opportunity wanted to jump on the next trend that was hot on WSB This also explains the sudden drop in price of AMC A lot of new members of WSB and novice traders who were looking to make a quick buck out of the momentum Those who saw GME explode in a matter of days perceived that the same may happen to AMC That accompanied by numerous false expectations built up by Stocktwats and some WSB members caused for all of those who had entered at the peak of AMC to suffer cognitive dissonance i e FUD The number one rule of marketing is never create high expectations that you cannot meet Why Because while it may drive a lot of new clients in the short term it will damage your brand and your company s success in the long term The same rule applies to practically everything else In AMC s case high expectation was created dates were given and when those expectations were left unmet novice traders got spooked and closed their positions and sold their shares Accompanied by constant media bombardment of fear mongering news left and right data manipulation etc I personally believe that this is what drove the price down Some form of market manipulation could have had a play here but I d rather base my DD on more tangible reports rather than speculations Hedge funds are notorious for using media coverage and PR to influence the price of a security With all of that being said why do I believe that AMC has an incredible potential to explode Utilization rate was 91 4 on the 8th of February amp x200B https preview redd it 0c97xy7f21h61 jpg width 827 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 69645d9d36c5b86b2bfdb262c8ced2b09cbbfe04 And has since dropped to 88 4 which is still quite high amp x200B Processing img kejxp7cg21h61 What this shows us is that about 89 of the stocks available to be borrowed have been borrowed However as you can see the total number of shares on loan has increased from 81 7m to 82 3m This just shows that the drop in utilization rate has dropped as more shares have been qualified as suitable to borrow recently bought shares What else do we know We now know thanks to Fidelity that retail ownership of the stock is 87 5 amp x200B Processing img u9x5jktg21h61 Why s this exciting Well if we look at the exciting case of VolksWagen VW The short interest of the stock was about 13 The main reason why it exploded was because there were no stocks available for short sellers to buy back was and cover their positions was very low as Porsche had increased its stake in VW to over 74 Short sellers were forced to buy the stock back at what the supply holders were willing to give for it Simply because they can do that So hedges have two options accept defeat and buy back to close their positions and hedge their risk by buying some of those stock Or keep paying a hefty premium based on the floating APR which changes literally everyday based on the volume Institutional investors are increasing their portfolio holding of AMC Vanguard 55 46 increase worth I dunno but they have bought 2 7M new shares Blackrock 69 increase worth 13 17M Northern Trust Corp 41 increase worth 2 12M And many more who bought into the stock recently amp x200B Processing img m9vn8olh21h61 We re also seeing a lot of people reporting that when they attempt to short the stock they are receiving error messages telling them This stock is hard to borrow Such as Etrade amp x200B Processing img 4cm18t4i21h61 And the lightspeed platform amp x200B Processing img f5lk36qi21h61 Which also reported that the available shares to short are 460k with a borrow fee of 4 5 Another report from NakedShortReport shows us that the short volume of AMC was 40 yesterday amp x200B https preview redd it l5yzw34k21h61 png width 993 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 868c7efaae2f563be6c672a51c1551ba7084e5d8 Naked short report collect their data from FINRA But it s interesting to see that Fintel is reporting a 21 short volume I ve genuinely lost all hope in them by now CONCLUSION What this leaves me to believe is that AMC is turning into a bubble for hedgies that is ready to burst any moment now Don t lose hope and hold your positions if you can If you can t that s fine Look after yourself first This is an extremely important lesson for newbie traders and investors for the number one rule of Do not let your emotions control your investment decisions This is probably the best stock to train that element Invest what you are willing to lose especially when dealing with highly speculative and volatile stocks such as GME and AMC For all of us who are still holding stay strong This might prove to be beneficial However this is no guarantee obviously Take everything I ve said with a grain of salt and do your own research I just wanted to share with you my personal speculation Let me know what you think P S Again I ain t no financial expert nor advisor but I sure af have

the case with AMC Is the run over Has the squeeze squozed No AMC s price jump back on the 27th of Jan was due to a high demand in the stock following the GME squeeze People who did not want to miss out on an another opportunity wanted to jump on the next trend that was hot on WSB This also explains the sudden drop in price of AMC A lot of new members of WSB and novice traders who were looking to make a quick buck out of the momentum Those who saw GME explode in a matter of days perceived that the same may happen to AMC That accompanied by numerous false expectations built up by Stocktwats and some WSB members caused for all of those who had entered at the peak of AMC to suffer cognitive dissonance i e FUD The number one rule of marketing is never create high expectations that you cannot meet Why Because while it may drive a lot of new clients in the short term it will damage your brand and your company s success in the long term The same rule applies to practically everything else In AMC s case high expectation was created dates were given and when those expectations were left unmet novice traders got spooked and closed their positions and sold their shares Accompanied by constant media bombardment of fear mongering news left and right data manipulation etc I personally believe that this is what drove the price down Some form of market manipulation could have had a play here but I d rather base my DD on more tangible reports rather than speculations Hedge funds are notorious for using media coverage and PR to influence the price of a security With all of that being said why do I believe that AMC has an incredible potential to explode Utilization rate was 91 4 on the 8th of February amp x200B Processing img vfzin8lg31h61 And has since dropped to 88 4 which is still quite high amp x200B https preview redd it 98vvwidh31h61 png width 353 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 743a2c23504fc1414b8a7e234d32274a4083a1d6 What this shows us is that about 89 of the stocks available to be borrowed have been borrowed However as you can see the total number of shares on loan has increased from 81 7m to 82 3m This just shows that the drop in utilization rate has dropped as more shares have been qualified as suitable to borrow recently bought shares What else do we know We now know thanks to Fidelity that retail ownership of the stock is 87 5 amp x200B https preview redd

of the stock was about 13 The main reason why it exploded was because there were no stocks available for short sellers to buy back was and cover their positions was very low as Porsche had increased its stake in VW to over 74 Short sellers were forced to buy the stock back at what the supply holders were willing to give for it Simply because they can do that So hedges have two options accept defeat and buy back to close their positions and hedge their risk by buying some of those stock Or keep paying a hefty premium based on the floating APR which changes literally everyday based on the volume Institutional investors are increasing their portfolio holding of AMC Vanguard 55 46 increase worth I dunno but they have bought 2 7M new shares Blackrock 69 increase worth 13 17M Northern Trust Corp 41 increase worth 2 12M And many more who bought into the stock recently amp x200B https preview redd it cwuglgpj31h61 png width 1209 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

it s interesting to see that Fintel is reporting a 21 short volume I ve genuinely lost all hope in them by now CONCLUSION What this leaves me to believe is that AMC is turning into a bubble for hedgies that is ready to burst any moment now Don t lose hope and hold your positions if you can If you can t that s fine Look after yourself first This is an extremely important lesson for newbie traders and investors for the number one rule of Do not let your emotions control your investment decisions This is probably the best stock to train that element Invest what you are willing to lose especially when dealing with highly speculative and volatile stocks such as GME and AMC For all of us who are still holding stay strong This might prove to be beneficial However this is no guarantee obviously Take everything I ve said with a grain of salt and do your own research I just wanted to share with you my personal speculation Let me know what you think P S Again I ain t no financial

inside,The short version Shroom stocks have huge upside due to their actual medical effectiveness being very high loads of studies quoted to back it up ongoing approval of many psilocybin based pharmaceutical drugs in North America current administration making decriminalization easier Several mushroom stocks are backed by huge investing figures such as Peter Thiel and Kevin O Leary AKA 3 parts to this DD 1 The science why mushrooms have huge potential as medicinal products 2 The rise of mushrooms and psilocybin as medical drugs 3 Specific stock recommendations and my positions My core thesis Mushrooms have a lot of scientific evidence backing their beneficial effects for specific conditions This means that eventually psilocybin based drugs are bound to get approved which will drive the entire mushroom sector up 1 THE SCIENCE WHY THEY HAVE HUGE POTENTIAL AS MEDICINAL PRODUCTS The evidence behind the effectiveness of mushrooms for various health conditions is piling up Harvard University the study authors and the commentators who include Charles Schuster former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse Nobel Prize winner Solomon Snyder and nationally known addiction expert Herbert Kleber recommend revived investigation of the therapeutic and scientific uses of hallucinogens https www health harvard edu newsletter article Reviving the study of hallucinogens https www health harvard edu newsletter article Reviving the study of hallucinogens Pharmacognosy Review They are also one of the richest source of anticancer and immunomodulating agents Thus these novel myochemicals from these mushrooms are the wave of future https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC3249912 https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC3249912 3 Biotech Journal This will further help the researchers to understand the metabolites and find other metabolites as well from the mushrooms which can be used for the potential development of the drugs to treat various life threatening diseases https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC6056353 https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC6056353 DEPRESSION psilocybin therapy for a startup was given breakthrough therapy designation a

nih gov pubmed 25586396 A randomized double blind trial from Johns Hopkins in 2016 found that one single dose of psilocybin drastically improved quality of life and decreased depression and anxiety in people suffering from life threatening cancer diagnoses https journals sagepub com doi full 10 1177 0269881116675513 https journals sagepub com doi full 10 1177 0269881116675513 SUMMARY There is a huge amount of scientific evidence showing the potential of psilocybin against depression heavy smoking and drinking to improve quality of life in cancer patients and as an anti cancer agent This medical evidence is not well known and relatively hard to find and analyze making it an opportunity for the entire psilocybin sector 2 THE RISE OF PSILOCYBIN DRUGS SLOW DECRIMINALIZATION Psilocybin is slowly decriminalized in the US Denver Oakland and Santa Cruz have legalized its use not long ago Lawmakers in Ann Arbor Michigan voted to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms and it s been legalized for therapeutic use in the entire state of Oregon I m NOT claiming that full decriminalization is coming anytime soon However the Biden administration SHOULD in theory make at least partial decriminalization a real possibility However my main argument is that it doesn t have to be legal on a major scale at all to explode The real major trend is the use and approval of psilocybin in pharmaceuticals Whenever a new field get such high amount of scientific studies proving its potential see above it s inevitable that startups and firms will try to create patented drugs to benefit from it And governments are starting to realize that targeted use of psilocybin for specific health conditions can be very beneficial Which means that this opportunity is becoming more and more real and interesting for biotech companies According to thekit ca https thekit ca In Canada The process is well on its way In August 2020 federal health minister Patty Hajdu granted four end of life patients exemptions from current drug laws to use psilocybin to help deal with the anxieties of their terminal illness Fifty three year old Laurie Brooks who has colon cancer was one of them read her story next in our Psychedelics Now series Three more exemptions quickly followed perhaps a harbinger of restrictions being eased In other words various psilocybin based drugs are being approved as we speak all over North America As we ve seen with marijuana Canada is usually a trend setter and approval of psilocybin pharmaceuticals in Canada is likely to lead to the same outcome in the USA As a matter of fact it s already happening in the US Like I said earlier the startup Compass Pathways s new psilocybin treatment received breakthrough therapy status essentially giving it a fast track to FDA approval This would have NEVER been possible under the previous administration and is a sign of things to come SUMMARY The current administration makes decriminalization of mushrooms more likely However even if full decriminalization is light years away the FDA approval of psilocybin based drugs and the same phenomenon in Canada is driving the entire sector way up Again this is due to the fact that mushrooms ACTUALLY WORK for a wide range of health conditions 3 SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AND MY POSITIONS Now with all this in mind if the entire mushroom sector is bound to explode which stocks do I recommend 1 Compass Pathways CMPS No need for a huge explanation here CMPS is the company whose drug received breakthrough therapy designation This makes FDA approval significantly more likely Probably the leading mushroom stock Oh and the stock is backed by Peter Thiel too 2 Mind Medicine MMEDF Kevin O Leary invested in the pre IPO round of 24 million They re currently running clinical trials to measure the effectiveness of LSD for anxiety and headaches The company focuses on psychedelic oriented therapies for anxiety addiction and ADHD which are probably the most promising areas of research at the moment 3 Champignon Brands SCHRMF Also using psychedelic medicine against depression PTSD and other mental health conditions They re already offering ketamine treatment for adults with depression in a rapid treatment center in Ottawa There are obviously other stocks but I ve vetted these 3 stocks for management integrity extremely important in a sector like psychedelics and long term commercial viability My positions 1000 shares of CMPS 2000 shares of MMEDF 4000 shares of SHRMF Track record My last recommendation of BG in WSB is now extremely profitable called it at 70 now trading at 76 Usual disclaimers There s no guarantee of anything ever and most morons who invest end up losing money Sorry pal

customers in a way that has any effect because the Federal Reserve will just give them a loan at zero percent interest rate with no term limits This means consumers can have no control over the behavior of a major business This is not good If for example I give you a loan of 100 dollars at zero percent interest and say there is no deadline to paying it back Pay it back next week month or 100 years 1000 if you really want Did I just give you a loan or did I just give you 100 bucks As long as US dollars still have value this arrangement when the interbank lending rate is 0 real interest or less essentially gives the banks direct access to the printer and they can consolidate purchasing power among themselves all they want and rent it back to the public and corporations while not performing any significant service This is an outcome we can t accept The only solution is to short the fiat until it reflects its true value Zero Borrow as much money as you can preferably a collateralized personal loan rather than giving BoA more business and trade it for something else Probably something relatively safe The other way is to get a loan from a credit union and obviously they would want collateral But isn t that just trading on margin Yes But it s also a fiat short The point is that trading on margin is a fiat short If trading on margin scares you you can always just invest in safer things You can continue trading what you naturally do with your own money and stick the margin cash into a basket of very safe commodities Why is fiat s true value big brain value zero Because the real value of currency is driven by consumer preference and if people were more intelligent they would not prefer a currency that steals from them or enables the banks to steal everything Let s say we have the US dollar and gold shillings at some exchange rate If people have a real preference for the gold shillings or a dis preference for the dollar and the exchange rate history has so far been relatively stable they will say that there is no harm in owning gold shillings I can always exchange them back but I personally value gold shillings at 0 5 above the market rate If they are at the margin which is more likely if a lot of people feel the same way then that becomes the new exchange rate Then feeling safe with the new exchange rate they continue to value the gold shillings at 0 5 above market rate personally That process continues until the value of one currency increases so that the amount in existence times the price equals the amount of value that people want to hold in that currency If people are intelligent they would dis prefer currencies that enable theft from themselves when they own it But they will also naturally dis prefer currencies that loose value and have volatility which is what a short would do It would invite more people through the door in realizing maybe USD is something I don t want to hold onto and then the cycle continues Really the other way to look at it is that currency preference impacts the risk tolerance one has for holding it If once currency is so preferred by some people that they are willing to hold it in spite of risk it growth will continue faster because its growth is volatility and so is self defeating unless the preference negates risk to a slight degree better than is present for other currencies But what about Gresham s law Isn t being dis valued good for a currency Gresham s law only applies in the immediate not the long term People not only have a preference for giving payment in forms that are losing value but they prefer to receive payment in forms that are not Often the one receiving has less leverage because they make it their business to accept payment it whatever form they can get and consumers make it their business to do business with who they find convenient But Gresham s law isn t the only factor in determining which currencies are exchanged and thus are currencies People prefer to both transact and hold in currencies that other people value that don t expose them to risk that don t defraud them that other people exchange that has exchange mechanics they like plus a modifier for Gresham s law But Gresham s law can t keep a currency afloat forever It merely adds a resistance to change but doesn t hold out for long You can see that there is even another more persistent factor counter acting it in that doesn t expose them to risk If a currency falls like a rock it won t be exchanged from long Look at Venezuela where people have taken to exchanging in things other than their fiat currency Then the currency also loses that other people value and that other people exchange And that currency is dead And the people are usually better for it ditching a defunct currency Therefore it is both possible and useful to short the US dollar and fiat more broadly There is a benefit to society It strips entitlement from organizations with undue entitlement that results in them essentially stealing from everyone It once was that banks weren t as rich as people though They had to pay high interest rates around 7 in the 70s or 9 with a CD to access money When you got a loan for a house you weren t borrowing from the bank You were borrowing from your neighbors with the bank as an intermediary They didn t own anything They were poor and hoping to make a few cents off of being an intermediary Now banks essentially own everything outright and have to pay nothing to be in that position That s what giving them a money printer did It s time we make what comes out of that printer worth nothing

test markets for Opendoor Charlotte and I firmly believe that this company is going to go far They are going to completely disrupt and revitalize the real estate industry A bit of background about me and my credentials for writing this Due Diligence I have been a licensee since early 2013 My husband is real estate closing attorney His office handles 300 real estate closings per month with 4 offices and 18 20 full time employees My husband was not always a real estate closing attorney Back in 2010 2015 his main bread and butter was handling foreclosure defense He represented people who were facing foreclosure and helped them avoid it by delaying the process through the court system helping them apply for obtain loan modifications or negotiating short sales with their lender Back then the market was still recovering from the 2008 crash and there were a lot of people who were upside down in their houses They simply couldn t sell them and move on They owed way more money than houses were selling for and had to convince the bank to allow them to sell the house The fed bailed out the banks by allowing short sales and taking a lesser payoff than what was originally lent out but the process for getting them to agree to do so on an individual level was long complicated and very difficult As a Realtor I assisted with this many times and listed dozens of short sales During the markets in 2008 2014 this was a huge majority of houses Around 2015 the scales tipped back and the market for the most part was nearly recovered Currently there are no short sales VERY rare if so Currently the market is Charlotte is such that inventory cannot keep up with the demand I talked to a Realtor yesterday who was in the middle of a bidding war with 53 other offers on the table It is common for most houses to get 20 offers within hours of listing It s an absolute bloodbath out there To say that I understand this industry is an understatement I know it in and out up and down left and right I eat sleep and dream in real estate and have for a long time iBuying is going to shift the entire landscape of how real estate is purchased I am seeing it happen here now in real time So let me explain Realtors have always been the vehicle of connecting buyers and sellers to one another in the process of buying or selling a home They hold the coveted keys to the castle This current age of free data and knowledge with the internet has slowly started to shift that power away from them over the past 20 years The Association of Realtors has done an excellent job of protecting the industry over the past 2 decades but technology is getting to the point where they won t be able to continue to do this in the way they have in the past Only Realtors have access to MLS however MLS shares that data with online listing websites like Zillow and Realtor com Those websites then attract buyers in the market looking at property they capture the data and then sell the data to the Realtors as leads It s ironic but Realtors have funded the vehicles that will be the end of their industry eventually Every property listed on the MLS is usually listed with a Supra iBox that houses the keys for the house for showings Only Realtors are allowed to hold the keys to these Supra boxes and everytime they are opened that data is captured and stored Opendoor has created their own system for lockboxes and showings They have their own lockboxes And anyone can download the app to their phone and access the Opendoor properties Without a Realtor In most situations sellers list their home while they are still living in the property They have to because until recently there were only retail buyers who bought them and sellers needed the proceeds from their sale to buy their next house Sellers listed their house and dealt with the headaches of showings and repairs negotiations and strict timelines for closings Sellers went to closing in a moving truck and so did buyers Everything relied on perfect timing for everything to happen Lots of drama and massive potential for any one thing to go wrong that sends the entire house of cards tumbling Delayed lender appraisal yada yada yada You take a lot of Xanax in this industry Enter Opendoor A company that pulls the power of the transaction away from the coveted few and puts it right into the consumers hands On both the buyer and seller sides You see they have the capital to do this They have the money to purchase the house without the headache of the buyer s side and their drama Seller calls the shots on when closing happens Seller doesn t have to deal with showings Seller doesn t have to deal with fixing up their house or repair negotiations Seller doesn t have to hear about the buyer s demands Seller doesn t have to rely on the buyer s lender s drama Seller doesn t have to deal with Realtors Seller doesn t have to pay commission Oftentimes 6 Seller is in control Seller has total power of the transaction Opendoor makes it easy Money is merely a measurement of stored time and energy People underestimate how valuable that is Opendoor provides value in saving both for the seller They eliminate the stress and uncertainly of the unknown Opendoor owns the house after closing They then ready the property to list for sale They have entire departments devoted to this and marketers on staff who understand exactly what sells a house the quickest They optimize the house with the knowledge they have Then they list it Except they don t use one of those mysterious Supra boxes to house the keys to the house that only Realtors have access to They use their own lockboxes And they give the power of the showings to the consumer Buyer directly No agent required The buyer can download their app and access any of their properties on their schedule No working around some Realtor s schedule The buyer has the power to steer the ship in their own home buying process When buyer is ready to make an offer they can fill it out directly on the Opendoor website The form is so easy to understand that a child could navigate it The form fills in the contract and meets the specific legal requirements for each state In the past this was where Realtors could valuable The contracts were so hard to understand the regular consumer couldn t manage them without help Opendoor makes it possible to Kinda like Turbo Tax with taxes Similar in that regard Additionally Opendoor offers the buyers discounts for making offers to them directly Opendoor If you buy with Opendoor and finance with Opendoor Home loans ODHL you can save up to 1 of your home price via a combination of an ODHL lender credit and either a seller credit at closing If buying directly or a commission refund If working with an Opendoor agent Amounts vary And yes Opendoor has their own in house mortgage company to finance your home as well Opendoor Finance with Opendoor Home Loans and get up to 1 000 credit at closing Now is the time where I recommend you move over to Opendoor com and spend 5 minutes browsing their website directly You will quickly see how easy the interface is to navigate Yes even for the retards on this sub In a few years legislation will catch up and it will start allowing eNotary services on closing documents Covid is the vehicle for pushing this through Notes Deed of Trusts even deeds will legally be signed electronically Eventually even the closing will be able to happen all online Opendoor says they will handle this part through their app too The real estate iBuying ecommerce market is going to EXPLODE with Millennials and Zoomers and even some Gen X coming into the market As a Millenial myself I don t like or want to deal with other people We grew up behind the screen and we simple don t know or understand the social skills it takes to communicate face to face Not only that we don t want to It s a waste of time We want to control everything and we want instant gratification Currently Opendoor is only active in 20 markets in the US They plan to scale to 100 markets within a year In the Charlotte market I work in I have seen the closing attorney who handles the Opendoor closings NOT my husband scale from 1 employee to over 100 employees within 2 years Comment from an Opendoor employee on my original post u casrox I have some insight Former employee Basically the way opendoor works is by buying houses for less than market price and creating a floating inventory of product houses they they actual place in a holding subsidiary Some of these houses are in hot markets so flip relatively easily some are in colder markets so the price will be lower and it will take longer to sell All these factors condition of house and title issues come into play when they buy a house or sell a house at a certain price They use a proprietary algorithm so don t know all the specifics as I wasn t a programmer and never messed with that They make their money from a combination of closing fees title work fees and profit off their house flipping A seller buyer can also bring their own realtor in but will end up paying both opendoor fee and realtor fee A lot of times they are able to make pretty decent profit on hot market houses that cover the losses they might suffer on a property they are having a hard time selling or that ends up being a complete wash due to unforseen circumstances a house that had a murder happen in it and company was never informed for instance They have well informed title teams with full curative and escrow staff in house due to their acquisition of title company named osnational They were doing so much prior to acquisition that osnational created subsidiary companies that s exclusively worked on title and closings for opendoor Due to this they are able to complete title work extremely fast and in some cases 24 48hr closings were not out of the question They make money in other ways as well such as doing outside contract title work for other companies and having a mortgage company built into business opendoor mortgage to increase the number of fingers they have in the proverbial pie I never saw the numbers as I was just a cog in the machine but I can tell you the output transactions increased month over month for many months prior to my leaving The only real risk they run is of housing market does cool and they are stuck with too much inventory just like of car market cooled and carving had too many cars and no buyers With interest rates low tho they also get a steady income stream from refinances so not sure how big of a hit they would take if the cool off only lasted a couple months I still do same job just for another company and will say the whole housing industry buying selling transactions is booming So much so that at the company I work for now we are understaffed and 60hr weeks are not uncommon in order to keep up with massive volume Opendoor flips primarily low mid price range houses which I assume is because it lowers the risk in case cool off period happens The place I currently work does real high end boutique place 1 5mil 3mil is average price range and we are slammed so I can assume pretty easily that opendoor is even more slammed Finally opendoor is also increasing to more and more markets Since I left they have expanded to a handful of markets I know about and I m sure others that they haven t disclosed publicly yet Anyway thanks for coming to my Ted talk wHat AbOuT tHe CrAsH cOmInG wE aRe In A bUbBlE As someone who was in the industry during the recovery during the 2008 crash and who helped people avoid foreclosure firsthand I can explain to you how what we see happening now is NOTHING like what we saw happen then The catalyst for the 2008 crash was the teaser ARM Adjustable rate mortgage rates that people were given for their mortgages These rates fluctuated as such a volatile rate that homeowners found themselves in situations where they could not pay their mortgage within a few years of buying They did not understand the implications of the ARM loans when they signed on at a teaser discounted interest rate and did not realize how drastically their mortgage payments would change once those rates adjusted The majority of home owners now are at a 2 5 FIXED 30 year interest rate Their mortgage payments are about 50 less than what the going rental rate is at least in my market People are literally saving thousands of dollars by owning their homes vs renting It s cheaper wHaT AbOuT tHe PaNdEmIc and tHe ImPeNdInG FoReClOsUrEs As someone who works in this industry I am seeing firsthand that every lender is pushing the unpaid mortgage payments on the backend of the notes This will allow people to avoid paying large lump sums up front Additionally NO ONE IS UNDERWATER in their houses right now So if for some reason a lender were to demand payment the seller could simply sell and walk away I haven t seen a single lender do this Not one tHiS iS lIKe CARVANA bUt ReAl EsTaTe iS rIsKiEr No owning real estate is no riskier than owning cars Cars are a depreciating asset Real estate is an appreciating asset 95 of millionaires are made with owning real estate myself included Many people see real estate as a safer store of value than even gold or other goods Definitely safer than having it sit in the bank Comment If I knew I was selling my property for less then fair market value potentially tens of thousands of dollars I d suck it up and hire an agent My Response Everyone has their different requirements desires and wants Many have different ones Grandma afraid of Covid and doesn t want showings No Problemo No Realtor interview process or dealing with them in the house either Yes please Closing happens on my watch at my desired time without crazy buyers in a moving truck barking up my ass Sign me up I control the entire transaction myself without relying on a Realtor to do it for me Sold Some people don t care about a few thousand bucks if they know that the time energy and stress was less Those things have value too People don t realize that Money is merely a storage of value for work time energy Retail buyers require 10x the headache and energy You may end up making 2k more on paper but you ve lost it all and more by the end of the transaction with the time and energy you had to spend to get there tHiS iS tHe UbEr Of HoUsEs No it s not Uber has zero assets They don t own a single car They have nothing but their systems and software Opendoor actually holds tangible assets unlike companies that literally own nothing like DoorDash Airbnb etc Okay I think I m going to wrap this up I m sure Ill think of more stuff and will add to it later but I have to get some work done My position 14 contracts calls shorts and leaps 1000 shares

would share my email response from their investor relations team regarding political risk in African Mining Operations ,Again please note this is an investor relations team who s job it is to inform but also encourage investors I agree with his sentiment on African region specific mining and the risk levels but please do your own dd before purchasing mining stock which can be very volatile gt Thu Feb 11 7 33 PM Hi gt gt It is a question we receive a lot so here are my candid and somewhat long winded thoughts gt gt These concerns typically are raised by North American investors versus UK based investors which I believe at a base level is due to geography and familiarity North American investors will willing invest in mining companies in South America while UK investors prefer investing in Africa and shun South America gt gt I have to say after many years in this business I am on the side of UK investors South America has a long track record of governments imposing new royalties and taxation regimes let alone nationalization on mining while Africa or more importantly the right regions of Africa should be considered among the most desirable regions for investing in mining in the world gt gt A key phrase above is the right regions in Africa as for an investor to be apprehensive to invest in mining in Africa is almost akin to an investor saying they are apprehensive of investing in mining in the Americas There is no doubt there are countries in Africa that are questionable but West Africa has a long established history now of being very pro mining I believe it has been 40 years since one of the countries Ghana returned from a 15 year experiment of nationalization that failed as mining output cratered as mining is a people intensive business that requires skills and capital gt gt If you look at the recent history countries in West Africa like Burkina Faso Mali Cote d Ivoire and Senegal have profited immensely from mining and since adopting commercial mining codes that reflect internationally accepted standards in Mali s case 30 years ago this has resulted in significant foreign investment in the gold sector and gold tax receipts to the governments The fact is that mining is a critical backbone of these economies and if you look at the history there is very little of what you see in South America Governments and more importantly local communities are very welcoming of mining done the right way by companies that adhere to first world environmental standards gt gt In Burkina Faso where our producing Yaramoko mine is mining revenue contributes approximately 16 of the total government revenue This is poor country that relies on the income of mining and the skills and career development that come with it Generally in mining for every 1 generated by mining an additional 3 are generated elsewhere in the economy so the impact of mining to these economies are even higher Therefore it stands to reason that these countries would not want to rock the boat which is all fine and well when saying that but you can look at their track records to see this is put into practice gt gt Our Yaramoko mine from initial drill hole to production was 5 years There is nowhere else in the world that you can see projects move ahead this quickly Our next mine S gu la which will be coming online next year 4 years from initial resource and which has the potential to more than double our production and cash flow without having to raise a share since we can fund it from our operations received its Environmental Approval in September last year and the Mining Permit in December This will be one of the highest grade open pit mines in Africa and as a testament to the government and local communities buy in the Government of Cote d Ivoire Ivory Coast approved the mine in 8 months This is not because we cut any corners as we adhere to IFC Performance Standards and the Equator Principles but the government and people want these projects Notably when we acquired the project in April 2019 from Newcrest the mining minister of Burkina Faso wrote to their equal in Cote d Ivoire to recommend they approve the acquisition voicing their support for Roxgold a contribution towards socio economic development in Burkina Faso gt gt On a political front both Burkina Faso and Cote d Ivoire recently had elections in late 2020 with both incumbent retaining their seats This means we have another 4 years in both countries until the next election cycle Naturally elections in Africa and West Africa always carry some headline risk so getting these events behind us should alleviate some concerns from investors However not to keep hitting this point but even political turmoil in West Africa has had little effect on mining in these countries Look at Mali which had a coup in August and not one mining company has been affected as Mali knows it is in the country s best interest to keep the gold mines running gt gt On a monetary policy front these countries use the West Africa CFA Franc which is pegged to the Euro and the West African Economic and Monetary Union an agreement among countries in West Africa have aligned their fiscal and monetary policies and have an agreement to promote regional economic integration gt gt Finally the reason you want to look at West African miners once you accept the jurisdictional risk is that the Birimian Gold Belt has been the most prolific region in the world for gold discoveries in the last 15 years There has been the discovery of over 75 million ounces of gold in the past 15 years with almost 50 located in Burkina Faso and Cote d Ivoire is considered to be underexplored historically which is why there has been a rush of investment there We are in the right jurisdiction and have the cash flow producing power to drive growth organically without needing to dilute shareholders As S gu la moves forward and investors start to recognize the impact this will have on our cash flows we are confident our share price will step in line with our earnings growth Meanwhile we continue to drill away at Boussoura which is in the heart of the Birimian Belt and has been returning intriguing results that have us now believing we have a 3rd project to put in our pipeline of development gt gt Roxgold continues to trade at a discount to our peers as the average investor still sees us as a single asset producer with the one mine in Burkina Faso In the next 18 months we will be multi asset producer out of Burkina Faso and Cote d Ivoire with an exceptional exploration portfolio in the right jurisdiction to move projects ahead quickly gt gt Hope that was not too lengthy gt gt Regards

you The Curious Case of Benjamin Butto err Black Berry BB ,Listen up reta err I mean memelords I know we ve all moved on from the meme era into the weed era and hopefully people stick around that one due to the fundamentals for a while but if not and soon to be a redux of the vehicle era but there s one meme stonk we need to have a real honest heart to heart about and hey it even ties into cars Let s talk about Blackberry BB First let s get some misconceptions out of the way Blackberry was never a short squeeze stonk even though it ended up getting roped in with the other squeezers we were denied squozing because of Wall Street cheating A lot of people thought it was and that s simply not the case Blackberry was is and always will be a phoenix rising from the ashes story nostalgia peppered with functionality You know kind of like how you sometimes go watch some classic porn to beat off to and don t stop to think about the fact that the actress is now in her 60 s and probably has super saggy tiddies Next misconception It s not a Boomer mobile phone company They don t make phones anymore phones that are branded with their logos are made by another company that pays licensing for the logo and some of the patents Blackberry sold all their mobile patents months ago Third misconception No matter how much we ask they re never changing their name back to Research in Motion so that we can talk about Rim jobs Sorry just isn t going to be a thing So what are they It s simple really They re now an enterprise level software security company When you think about it it s not such a big pivot given that their security encryption in their heyday was so powerful that they ended up having to set up offices in certain nations because it was impossible to crack and ran afoul of certain international laws Let s take a dive into the financials before we get into the story At the time of this writing BB is a 7 billion dollar company with shares trading in the 12 50 range Even after the meme war collapse they re still worth double what they were when the ball dropped in New York City with absolutely nobody watching in person and everybody at home wondering why even Anderson Cooper was using an autotuner They generate a hair over a quarter billion dollars in revenue each quarter over the last year and in 2020 had a negative EPS of about 32 cents a share as they retooled though they trimmed that to 23 cents a share for their last quarterly earnings report They have about a billion dollars in cash on hand and receivables and they have about half a billion dollars in debt It s not a great fiscal outlook there but it s certainly manageable for a growth company which is what they presently are Where do they make their money Almost half of their revenue is legacy income from selling endpoint management and secure communications licensing A third of their revenue comes from licensing their patents Oh they also own Cylance for you IT help desk monkeys That shit s pretty boring not gonna lie Your wife s boyfriend might find it interesting but only because he can use it to laugh at you that you know this shit But the rest The rest is where things get interesting Blackberry Radar is a fleet management solution and the most interesting thing is well for that we have to go back in time for a moment Wayne s World flashback dream noises July 29th 2017 Las Vegas Nevada 50 000 of the world s most feared hackers descend upon Sin City for a weekend of debauchery drinking and talking about all the new and interesting ways they found to break shit or in general cause chaos A young hacker from Wisconsin positively stuns everybody at a panel by revealing how it is that he found he could effectively hack almost every late model vehicle on the road that possessed connected features from range and while the vehicles are in motion using music theory It s an absolutely stunning revelation something matched only by how terrifying the implications of it are And all anybody needed was a 300 RF modulation tool Using this he found he could take control of every mass produced car on the market except those made by Volkswagen Group and Tesla and those only because they had randomized frequencies they used This guy fucked This process was so dangerous that for one of the only times in DefCon s history they didn t publish the how to publicly Oh and a team from a then relatively unknown EV company in China called NIO won the car hacking capture the flag tournament in less dramatic fashion Something had to be done Enter Blackberry I ll spare you all the things that have happened since then but what you need to know is this Blackberry came up with a solution to defend against this and a myriad of other problems not to mention Europoor compliance in the form of ISO 26262 not to mention autonomous security and their security software suite QNX is now on almost every new car rolling off a factory line today This software is also critical for EV s because it controls battery management ECU s that s the shit that makes it so you don t have to drop 10 grand on a new power plant every 2 years Or for those of you with IQ s of 60 Computer make car gooder OK so that s cool But how does this get me TENDIES man How much can these guys make They re coy about this and won t give hard numbers but there are ways we can estimate what they re pulling But to do that we need to go back in history again and take a look at a stock nobody cares about More Wayne s World noises Enter Nuance Communications NUAN You ve probably never heard of these guys but you and almost everybody you know has used their products at some point They used to be best known for their Dragon Naturally Speaking software suite which your grandparents who decided they were too old to figure out how to use a fucking keyboard bought so that they could talk to their computer and send you messages that you hated getting unless it came with a 20 dollar bill but which they thought you cherished forever However at some point around 2010 IBM whom the Nuance CEO at the time was close friends with the management of literally just gave about 125 patents around voice recognition to Nuance thinking that they were worthless Nuance took these patents and for a brief moment became one of the coolest techs on the planet because their tech is what made Apple s Siri Amazon s Alexa Microsoft s Cortana Samsung s whatever it was called and a billion other voice recognition platforms work That is until Steve Jobs Jeff Bezos Steve Ballmer and everybody else Nuance was dumb enough to trust to let look under the hood of their secret sauce and they all stole the IP and made their own platforms leaving Nuance rotting in a hole in the desert But one of the really cool things Nuance expanded into before they went full retard was they bought a couple of companies around 2013 or so Tweddle and some other company I can t be bothered to look up and got into the connected car space At one point Nuance s Dragon Drive virtual assistant was in every new car made by 9 of the world s top 10 auto makers OK dude my wife s boyfriend is asking me to bring him a beer Can you speed this along What does this matter It matters because we can look at what NUAN was getting in licensing for putting their virtual assistant in these vehicles and use that data to extrapolate an estimate of what BB is getting for their software With just their 9 car makers at their back they were generating over 300 million dollars a year and that was almost a decade ago and just for something that would tell you where to pick up your Down s Syndrome medication Add a premium for security include all the auto makers carry the one smoke a bowl to help you concentrate adjust for inflation This is a market worth about oh roughly 750 million dollars a year for Blackberry on the conservative side once they actually start charging a market rate for this product Right now they re adopting the same go to strategy Microsoft has been employing with Azure which is to basically GIVE it away in order to gain market share and penetration and then send Fat Tony to collect once the car maker is reliant on it Plus all the other stuff we already glossed over because it s boring as shit Applying the average multiple of earnings for cybersecurity firms out there their lack of competition in the space etc And you come up with a market cap valuation target of oh roughly between 45 and 50 billion dollars once they re firing on all cylinders And they don t have to worry about Google or Apple throwing 10 000 engineers at this to make a competing product because it s just not worth it to them so they re largely gonna get left alone Or by using maths a share price of somewhere in the neighborhood of 87 50 Give or take 10 bucks Make it 15 to the downside just to be safe Yeah man Cool So I m in It s gonna go to that by like Friday or something An enterprise level cybersecurity company with a sub 10 billion dollar valuation is basically unheard of in this century But this is not a burn play where you re gonna get 50 gains every day with no work It s a company that s going to have to melt up to that It still won t be to that point this time next year BUT that doesn t mean it doesn t have a great story It just means that this isn t something you do a 0DTE YOLO on and expect to get something out of And making an Avengers meme about it isn t going to send it to the moon This is something you buy and stash in a musty corner of your portfolio so you can tell your Boomer parents that you re being responsible with your investing and you were just joking about betting your inheritance on weekly FD s for shitty online dating sites where the women have to talk to your sorry ass first Oh and it ll make the lambo you buy with the money from this safer Because I know it matters here are 69 rockets so you apes understand what all this meant no there aren t going to be any rockets I lied Disclosures Positions I am long BB holding 100 000 shares 7 67 average and another 5000 January 2022 8c s All my love Chad Dickens

many of you I consider myself a connoisseur and producer of modern aut I am autist in my own right and as such I have spent hours looking over the shady financial reporting of this shady company Of course I am in no way certified to give financial advice to anyone I am simply concerned that this company if it is really fraudulent is going to destroy investor s savings and I think it s only fair that I express these concerns I ll try to keep this concise and not miss any details because there is a lot going on here and it really does get complicated Fair warning my decision has been to invest in some put options on February 11th before the price started dropping and it s up to you whether you want to as well I give no advice on such an investment but I personally think I made the best choice and I know for a fact that their financials do not add up so this is more to call attention to anyone who might be convinced to invest just how bad of a decision that would be Here are some reasons A OBVIOUS SHILLS I won t name names but obvious shills like u Masternewworldorder https www reddit com u Masternewworldorder have been trying to pump up the stock price through a social media campaign and ride the coattails of the GME debacle I would not just simply post this guy s name on here if I had any other way to show how all 18 posts on his account are about hyping Sundial using the GME fiasco as a model for doing so He even mentions GME calling SNDL the next SNDL To you buddy if you re doing what everybody knows you re doing and the SEC finds out you and those you work for or with will probably be arrested Not only that but his page clearly breaks a few rules on the sub Pump amp Dump most likely advertisement market manipulation etc If you re just riding the hype wagon you should really choose another company to hype up If I m correct in my math they don t have the funds to operate through the quarter nor can they get a loan to continue operations I ll discuss their lies about their debt at the bottom of the page I ll just say for now it s my belief that they are either doing a pump and dump or using share capital to have enough cash that they can file for bankruptcy B DISGRACEFUL FINANCIALS Financial reports must comply with a ton of SEC and FTC laws about documents that they have to file This is to protect those who would wish to invest their money so as to be protected from the sort of activities that would destroy them and any trust in the stock market that they had Maybe I m cynical but that last part is the most important SEC wants trust because then they have a functional system A company that is traded on an American stock exchange must fulfill certain requirements regarding their financial reports that usually allow for an exception in the case of international filers but Canada is very similar in this regard though perhaps notable from this stock that s not the case at all 1 1 Their most up to date report shows 500 million in share capital with 70 million equity I believe that s Canadian 2 leveraged against the share capital is a 500 million accumulated deficit up 140 million from the year before Coincidentally their debt obligations are down 140 million from the year before as well This suggests they are using issued stock and general market manipulations to pay off their debt They say that the issuance of more stock is for a few things depending on which report you read I can t find them all but trust me https www sec gov cgi bin browse edgar action getcompany amp CIK 0001766600 amp type amp dateb amp owner include amp start 0 amp count 40 https www sec gov cgi bin browse edgar action getcompany amp CIK 0001766600 amp type amp dateb amp owner include amp start 0 amp count 40 it s in here somewhere They say it s for purchasing of new properties or maybe operation activities but they never clearly state that they are paying off their debt with the new stock I don t know if that s illegal or not but it s definitely untrustworthy 3 For the 9 month period from January 1st 2020 to September 30th 2020 they had 12 million in revenue which cost them 10 million to sell but they also lost 20 million to inventory obsolescence and 60 million to asset impairment As an investor I would like to know why that happened but their reporting makes absolutely no mention of it in their section Risk Factors on all F 3 filings 2 They may not have to include that but again you should really be given the opportunity to find out and any company acting with the foresight to know stockholder trust is important any company who wants to succeed will make these things abundantly clear C LETTER FROM THE AUDITOR This is the icing on the cake and which verifies to me that there is so much more going on here than I could even understand The auditor is paid by the company to look at their financials thoroughly to see if the condensed info meets standards and fairly describes the company s information to the potential stockholders This auditor has time and again given them the same letter more or less stating that their financials do not show that the company has been acting in breach of their debt covenant which is the most evidence of a serious issue here They also say that various other issues in Sundial s reporting gives them concern that the company should not and probably will not be able to continue operating the way that they are 3 This is all I need to know really And why any speculative raise in their market capitalization on the stock market gives me serious concern about the current state of our economic system It s examples like these which destroy investor confidence and lead to seriously tough times Shorting this position is not just profitable it s necessary to save the soundness of our economy in my opinion D SUSPICIOUS REASONS FOR FULFILLMENT OF DEBTS If securities on an exchange are linked to the equity of a firm that goes bankrupt and cannot operate then all that money goes out of investors hands and into the hands of debtors or is liquidated and given to the preferred stock holders Luckily for the executives and majority shareholders of Sundial Growers Inc they have a tiny little clause hidden in one of their reports which says that all liquidated funds must first be given to preferred stock holders before any is given to issued common stock traded on any exchange 4 This is important because they have clearly stated that they can issue indefinite numbers of preferred and common stock and that preferred stock gets first right in the case of liquidation Essentially they can use the extra stock issuance to dilute costs and trick investors into thinking EPS is getting closer to that above 0 marker total earnings continues to drop further every statement while also separately securing any cash left by issuing more preferred stock to themselves upon liquidation so that you the investor get absolutely nothing while they get any proceeds from going bankruptcy possibly even millions E WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE COMPANY EVEN https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1766600 000110465920114508 a20 32923 1sc13g htm https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1766600 000110465920114508 a20 32923 1sc13g htm Some guy named Ryan Dunfield who is mentioned nowhere else in their financials received 100 000 000 shares in preferred stock for absolutely zero dollars in cost to him well actually it s that Ryan Dunfield gets 25 million share s redacted company name redacted company name and 1920576 ALBERTA LTD all get shares as well However these are 3 companies of which Ryan Dunfield is the president and or CEO Ryan Dunfield got 1 10 of all stocks available not to mention voting power from these stocks without paying any money for them This was filed very recently too It was filed after the last known financial report on September 30th I haven t calculated all of the other people s issuance of preferred stock either but this is definitely suspect to me These sorts of dealings are being done all the time by this company but they drown out the sec filings by naming every single filing under the exact same document name so it s damn near impossible to keep track of any of it F NUMBERS DONT ADD UP This by itself is really pretty common and not signs of impending doom but it s also convenient that they just issued common stock to fill the company with cash and actually did away with all of their debt If that is to be believed sorry I can t find any proof in their filings then they are a rarity among companies to have done so and maintained a 600 million cash reserve Not to mention that the 500 million accumulated deficit the 100 million total debt and accounts payable along with a 90 million operating loss all is somehow accounted for by 18 million in financing income stock issuance I presume before September 30th of last year and supposedly 100 million in stock issuance if you read any related news and less than 200 million in illiquid assets Honestly I don t know how these numbers can make turn 20 million or so cash into 600 million cash in 3 months However they managed to pull that off this year I m pretty sure that they will continue to leverage this as a deficit against their Share capital If that s the case they now have 600 million share capita l with 690 million in deficit leveraged against that I m not sure if anyone is aware of this but if you owe a bank money you can t simply say Sorry this isn t actually a debt it s a deficit It doesn t work that way and reporting it that way is serious fraud They may not actually be prosecuted for this fraud but it still exists and it is damaging to those who would invest in it G SHOW THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE SEC WE CAN HANDLE OURSELVES The institutions have not invested anything in this company and I suspect it has everything to do with their financials I bet you if a company with a large amount of institutional ownership operated the way this company does then the SEC would be their to protect the institutions so fast Instead it s left up to the little guys who don t have enough money to pay Treasurers from the shady San Francisco political bubble 800k in speaking fees to fend for themselves We all take the most risk in the market because we re targeted by scammers immeasurably larger competition and indifferent regulators In my opinion this short position against Sundial would be exactly what we need to show regulators what it s like to do their job By the way I m pretty suspicious about the timing of this sudden increase in cash given that I m pretty sure tax season and financial reporting season are very soon Both of which would help secure them a new loan to save their ass I wonder why a struggling company would want their book values to look a little better with this H MAGIC NUMBER If all of this is lost on you at least realize that my they potentially have a 690 million deficit I m my math is right 69 What else do you need Sources 1 https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1766600 000156459020053193 sndl ex991 6 htm https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1766600 000156459020053193 sndl ex991 6 htm 2 https

kicking off utm source google amp utm medium bd amp cmpId google It s the rise of many physical commodity prices such as those of food oil metals chemicals fuels and the like driven by various factors but this COVID one is mostly by the stimulus spending and a weaker US dollar and the parabolic growth being observed in the East led by China where we see demand above 2020 levels This new roaring 20s will be accompanied by easy monetary and fiscal policy more a weak US dollar and stronger inflation all supportive for commodity prices Yes I repeated what I said because it is important And why Oil Besides the obvious reason of Saudi did an output cut and raised prices on the crude I personally think another reason is because we have put so much emphasis on renewable energy like Solar and Hydrogen but we ignored the basic scientific fact that in order for a total energy replacement and revolution to happen it will take at least another 20 50 years So oil will still be around and

mckinsey com industries oil and gas our insights energy 2050 insights from the ground up And oil companies have seen some rebound but they are far from the pre COVID level and if the commodity super cycle is happening it is already happening go check the oil companies tickers today as explained by everyone s favorite market guru Marko Kolanovic from JPM then I personally think we will very likely see oil companies going parabolic across the board as the major funds that have made huge profits from tech and renewable energy to cycle some of the profit into the oil which needed some tendie love and most importantly it is undervalued Out of all oil companies I personally think KMI Kinder Morgan Inc and EPD Enterprise Products Partners will benefit most fabulously from this energy cycle Why Because besides the fact that both KMI and EPD are oil industry first team relatively large market cap players their option prices are very reasonable for a good trade if the super cycle takes off with a rocket engine Let s let the data speak KMI Kinder Morgan Inc is trading at 14 77 market cap 33 43B KMI pre COVID crash high price was 22 16 on 02 19 2020 KMI 20 call 03 19 21 is asking for only 0 03 EPD Enterprise Products Partners is trading at 21 76 market cap 47 50B EPD pre COVID crash high price was 26 22 on 02 20 2020 EPD 26 call 03 19 21 is asking for only 0 06 Kinder Morgan and Enterprise Products are what I find as large enough market cap so they will not be too easy to dilute shares and their OTM options for 03 19 21 and later dates are priced very very well For me these are the type of options trades to get tendies and this super cycle will have large funds coming in hoards and get on this oil sector rocket TLDR Commodity SuperCycle is happening Penny options from oil companies such as KMI Kinder Morgan Inc and EPD Enterprise Products Partners will take off Sources https markets businessinsider com news stocks commodity supercycle outlook roaring 20s economic

in fact is NOT a meme stock You might ask why is that Well here are a few of their partnerships and products that they re developing and have already developed Partnership with Amazon On December 1st BB announced a multi year agreement https www blackberry com us en company newsroom press releases 2020 aws blackberry join forces to accelerate innovation with new intelligent vehicle data platform text OverviewContact 20Us AWS 20and 20BlackBerry 20Join 20Forces 20to 20Accelerate New 20Intelligent 20Vehicle 20Data 20Platform amp text SEATTLE 2C 20WA 20and 20WATERLOO 2C 20ON 2C 20Amazon 20Web 20Services 2C 20Inc with AWS which is Amazon s cloud service business The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry s Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform IVY BlackBerry IVY is a scalable cloud connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data normalize it and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud Automakers can use this information to create responsive in vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences Partnership with Baidu On January 25 BB announced the expansion https www blackberry com us en company newsroom press releases 2021 blackberry expands partnership with baidu to power next generation autonomous driving technology of its strategic partnership with Baidu http iv baidu com whose high definition maps will run on the QNX Neutrino Real time https blackberry qnx com en software solutions embedded software qnx neutrino rtos Operating System RTOS and will be mass produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of GAC Group https www gac motor com Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd The milestones build on the company s January 2018 https www blackberry com us en company newsroom press releases 2018 blackberry and baidu partnering to accelerate connected and autonomous vehicle technology agreement to make BlackBerry QNX s industry leading operating system OS the foundation for Baidu s Apollo autonomous driving open platform BlackBerry QNX BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi BMW Subaru Volkswagen GM Toyota and Honda NVIDIA is even building its AI self driving platform off of BlackBerry s QNX technology BlackBerry IVY In addition to the QNX https www fool com investing 2020 12 07 investors overreacting blackberry deal with amazon Operating System their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy which is a cloud based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles BlackBerry Spark Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints Through their UES they plan on improving cross platform visibility cyber threat prevention and remediation while simplifying administration Okay so why is this important 1 BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 million vehicles 2 BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers Audi BMW Ford etc view data and insights on their vehicles This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle even like a problem with the sensors the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update 3 They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products In the future we could see a shift from hardware driven vehicles to software defined vehicles 4 Not only are they focusing on this but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise Unmanaged BYO use case https blogs blackberry com en 2020 09 blackberry achieves highest score in gartner critical capabilities report for unmanaged byo use case Gartner Research who published the study even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare IBM and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors In fact NONE of BlackBerry s customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack And the stock price is still 12 The Sobering Part of this DD After taking a look at their balance sheet I can agree with the skeptics that they re not raking in a ton of money right now but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued especially when compared to their competitors I mean based on this information ALONE the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now BlackBerry s current market cap is around 7 billion with its competitors like Palantir a software company that I m sure you ve heard other YouTubers talk about hovering at 60 billion And funny enough Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity just like BlackBerry If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir its stock price would be 110 Final Thoughts Here s what the skeptics don t realize though They don t realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition and that boomers probably still think it s a phone company Well it s not With their partnership with Amazon Baidu their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark BlackBerry IVY and their QNX operating system for vehicles it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry s future growth Maybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now maybe then it ll be taken much more seriously But only once people realize that it s not a meme

YEARS OUT WHO CARES WILL Disclosure this was all taken and edited from u krush0910 who wrote an extensive dd and you retards missed it also I m not an investment advisor Realtors have always been the vehicle of connecting buyers and sellers to one another in the process of buying or selling a home They hold the coveted keys to the castle The Association of Realtors has done an excellent job of protecting the industry over the past 2 decades but technology is getting to the point where they won t be able to continue to do this in the way they have in the past Only Realtors have access to MLS however MLS shares that data with online listing websites like Zillow and Realtor com Those websites then attract buyers in the market looking at property they capture the data and then sell the data to the Realtors as leads Every property listed on the MLS is usually listed with a Supra iBox that houses the keys for the house for showings Only Realtors are allowed to hold the keys to these Supra boxes and everytime they are opened that data is captured and stored Opendoor has created their own system for lockboxes and showings They have their own lockboxes And anyone can download the app to their phone and access the Opendoor properties Without a Realtor In most situations sellers list their home while they are still living in the property They have to because until recently there were only retail buyers who bought them and sellers needed the proceeds from their sale to buy their next house Sellers listed their house and dealt with the headaches of showings and repairs negotiations and strict timelines for closings Sellers went to closing in a moving truck and so did buyers Everything relied on perfect timing for everything to happen Lots of drama and massive potential for any one thing to go wrong that sends the entire house of cards tumbling Delayed lender appraisal yada yada yada Enter Opendoor A company that pulls the power of the transaction away from the coveted few and puts it right into the consumers hands On both the buyer and seller sides You see they have the capital to do this They have the money to purchase the house without the headache of the buyer s side and their drama Seller calls the shots on when closing happens Seller doesn t have to deal with showings fixing up their house or repair negotiations buyer s demands doesn t have to rely on the buyer s lender s drama have to deal with realtors or even pay commission Oftentimes 6 Opendoor makes it easy Money is merely a measurement of stored time and energy People underestimate how valuable that is Opendoor provides value in saving both for the seller They eliminate the stress and uncertainly of the unknown Opendoor owns the house after closing They then ready the property to list for sale They have entire departments devoted to this and marketers on staff who understand exactly what sells a house the quickest They optimize the house with the knowledge they have Then they list it Except they don t use one of those mysterious Supra boxes to house the keys to the house that only Realtors have access to They use their own lockboxes And they give the power of the showings to the consumer Buyer directly No agent required The buyer can download their app and access any of their properties on their schedule When buyer is ready to make an offer they can fill it out directly on the Opendoor website The form is so easy to understand that a child could navigate it The form fills in the contract and meets the specific legal requirements for each state In the past this was where Realtors could be valuable The contracts were so hard to understand the regular consumer couldn t manage them without help Opendoor makes it possible to Kinda like Turbo Tax with taxes Similar in that regard Additionally Opendoor offers the buyers discounts for making offers to them directly Opendoor If you buy with Opendoor and finance with Opendoor Home loans ODHL you can save up to 1 of your home price via a combination of an ODHL lender credit and either a seller credit at closing If buying directly or a commission refund If working with an Opendoor agent Amounts vary And yes Opendoor has their own in house mortgage company to finance your home as well Opendoor Finance with Opendoor Home Loans and get up to 1 000 credit at closing In a few years legislation will catch up and it will start allowing eNotary services on closing documents Covid is the vehicle for pushing this through Notes Deed of Trusts even deeds will legally be signed electronically Eventually even the closing will be able to happen all online Opendoor says they will handle this part through their app too The real estate iBuying ecommerce market is going to EXPLODE with Millennials and Zoomers and even some Gen X coming into the market As a Millennial myself I don t like or want to deal with other people We grew up behind the screen and we simple don t know or understand the social skills it takes to communicate face to face Not only that we don t want to It s a waste of time We want to control everything and we want instant gratification Currently Opendoor is only active in 20 markets in the US They plan to scale to 100 markets within a year In the Charlotte market I work in I have seen the closing attorney who handles the Opendoor closings scale from 1 employee to over 100 employees within 2 years Comment from an Opendoor employee on the original post u casrox I have some insight Former employee Basically the way opendoor works is by buying houses for less than market price and creating a floating inventory of product houses they they actual place in a holding subsidiary Some of these houses are in hot markets so flip relatively easily some are in colder markets so the price will be lower and it will take longer to sell All these factors condition of house and title issues come into play when they buy a house or sell a house at a certain price They use a proprietary algorithm so don t know all the specifics as I wasn t a programmer and never messed with that They make their money from a combination of closing fees title work fees and profit off their house flipping A seller buyer can also bring their own realtor in but will end up paying both opendoor fee and realtor fee A lot of times they are able to make pretty decent profit on hot market houses that cover the losses they might suffer on a property they are having a hard time selling or that ends up being a complete wash due to unforseen circumstances a house that had a murder happen in it and company was never informed for instance They have well informed title teams with full curative and escrow staff in house due to their acquisition of title company named osnational They were doing so much prior to acquisition that osnational created subsidiary companies that s exclusively worked on title and closings for opendoor Due to this they are able to complete title work extremely fast and in some cases 24 48hr closings were not out of the question They make money in other ways as well such as doing outside contract title work for other companies and having a mortgage company built into business opendoor mortgage to increase the number of fingers they have in the proverbial pie I never saw the numbers as I was just a cog in the machine but I can tell you the output transactions increased month over month for many months prior to my leaving The only real risk they run is of housing market does cool and they are stuck with too much inventory just like of car market cooled and carving had too many cars and no buyers With interest rates low tho they also get a steady income stream from refinances so not sure how big of a hit they would take if the cool off only lasted a couple months I still do same job just for another company and will say the whole housing industry buying selling transactions is booming So much so that at the company I work for now we are understaffed and 60hr weeks are not uncommon in order to keep up with massive volume Opendoor flips primarily low mid price range houses which I assume is because it lowers the risk in case cool off period happens The place I currently work does real high end boutique place 1 5mil 3mil is average price range and we are slammed so I can assume pretty easily that opendoor is even more slammed Finally opendoor is also increasing to more and more markets Since I left they have expanded to a handful of markets I know about and I m sure others that they haven t disclosed publicly yet Anyway thanks for coming to my Ted talk CONCERNS WHAT ABOUT THE CRASH COMING WE ARE IN A BUBBLE As someone who was in the industry during the recovery during the 2008 crash and who helped people avoid foreclosure firsthand I can explain to you how what we see happening now is NOTHING like what we saw happen then The catalyst for the 2008 crash was the teaser ARM Adjustable rate mortgage rates that people were given for their mortgages These rates fluctuated as such a volatile rate that homeowners found themselves in situations where they could not pay their mortgage within a few years of buying They did not understand the implications of the ARM loans when they signed on at a teaser discounted interest rate and did not realize how drastically their mortgage payments would change once those rates adjusted The majority of home owners now are at a 2 5 FIXED 30 year interest rate Their mortgage payments are about 50 less than what the going rental rate is at least in my market People are literally saving thousands of dollars by owning their homes vs renting It s cheaper Additionally the 2008 crash happened because people were able to get mortgages by stating their income There was no underwriting process that verified anything They called them NINJA loans No Income No Job No Assets This simply can t happen anymore at any point after the 08 crash Lenders verify income debt and credit 3 times during underwriting now even the day of closing WHAT ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND IMPENDING CLOSURES As someone who works in this industry I am seeing firsthand that every lender is pushing the unpaid mortgage payments on the backend of the notes This will allow people to avoid paying large lump sums up front Additionally NO ONE IS UNDERWATER in their houses right now So if for some reason a lender were to demand payment the seller could simply sell and walk away I haven t seen a single lender do this Not one Comment If I knew I was selling my property for less then fair market value potentially tens of thousands of dollars I d suck it up and hire an agent Everyone has their different requirements desires and wants Many have different ones Grandma afraid of Covid and doesn t want showings No Problemo No Realtor interview process or dealing with them in the house either Yes please Closing happens on my watch at my desired time without crazy buyers in a moving truck barking up my ass Sign me up I control the entire transaction myself without relying on a Realtor to do it for me Sold Some people don t care about a few thousand bucks if they know that the time energy and stress was less Those things have value too People don t realize that Money is merely a storage of value for work time energy Retail buyers require 10x the headache and energy You may end up making 2k more on paper but you ve lost it all and more by the end of the transaction with the time and energy you had to spend to get there THIS IS UBER FOR HOUSES Opendoor actually holds tangible assets unlike companies other than just their software like DoorDash Uber etc Sidenote I would wager that it s VERY likely that they eventually create a property management interface on their app that connects landlords with tenants for a fee and handles the Property Management side of things This is an obvious next play I can t confirm this but it s just what I would be implementing of this were my company

are difficult times for this sub and it s almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks Instead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before The following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn t my native language I will try my best Palantir as a Company the beginnings PLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal As a payment service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early The CIA also funded PLTR they are always funding stuff like this Siri as example This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture I will explain this point later You retard still reading Nice here some rocket emoji s to pump your dopamine and keep you happy Let s start with the DD First of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years amp x200B 1 The Management Before I start with the product I rather start with the management You can sell the nicest thing in the world I can guarantee you that the product definitely won t be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management Intel With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp co founder Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad Seriously tho I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions amp x200B 2 PLTR Business model products Before we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don t have any business with PLTRs We create data We don t fuck with it We creating with using our phones or working in the office Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data PLTRs customers base isn t neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments That s the reason why their products aren t so tangible for many people PLTR basically offers systems to big companies governments which import their data into these systems PLTR doesn t sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it They sell platforms They got 2 Products called Graham and Foundry You may think wtf is this guy talking about Let me explain it in 2 examples First example is Syria with Graham It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the rest of the world for you But this wasn t so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information s are crucial in a war PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely Civil problems over there could also be fixed https www mercurynews com 2016 10 04 palantir using big data to solve big humanitarian crises https www mercurynews com 2016 10 04 palantir using big data to solve big humanitarian crises Actually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR In their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way Gotham our first software platform was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies They were hunting for needles not in one but in thousands of haystacks And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs In Afghanistan and Iraq soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants and helps U S and allied military personnel find what they are looking for https www sec gov Archives edgar

directly from the S1 File of PLTR page 121 An Airbus A350 for example has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects Foundry was built for them The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data Both of these systems solving big issues with less effort The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the machine with data The key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power All they do is working on their platforms and improving it https www

at Lockheed Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like look guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn t get the contracts This was also the swamp trump was talking about https www bloomberg com news articles 2016 10 28 inside palantir s war

door looks open amp x200B 4 Valuation problems I could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it s not necessary Expect the costs of research and development maybe marketing the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters It s a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1 Let s talk about the market The whole market seems overpriced but it isn t tbh Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate There is nothing with a solid interest rate around not even in emerging markets At the stock exchange like in 70s the companies had to offer a return a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8 interests without risks These times are gone since the 2000s So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies Now back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set cheap imo First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process PLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess https www bloomberg com news articles 2018 09 04 morgan stanley s long romance of palantir pays off as ipo nears https www bloomberg com news articles 2018 09 04 morgan stanley s long romance of palantir pays off as ipo nears Morgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100 post split or stuff like that These guys are very focused on numbers and I know it s difficult to price in the potential and perspectives But you can t ignore these things for a fundamental valuation If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company This ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion https www bizjournals com sanjose news 2018 11 14 palantir ipo valuation morgan stanley html https www bizjournals com sanjose news 2018 11 14 palantir ipo valuation morgan stanley html How is this difference possible and why is this happening Because people don t understand what they are valuating This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don t have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don t understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend That s why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him The transformation and the generation change didn t happened yet That s why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla Guys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012 At that time it wasn t possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions Look at the IPOs like doordash Bumble I m not going to call this a bubble Just check out their business cases and use the metrics Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash On page 12 of the S1 balance sheet Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got PLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it s miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don t understand that their products are game changers for industries governments and defense forces Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR amp x200B 5 Risks for PLTR Despite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk We face intense competition in our markets and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position The S1 Form didn t aged well Actually I don t think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable As PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn t rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices PLTR is years ahead with their products I think the greatest risk still are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities There are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts People fear changes but they can t avoid the changes With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time It s a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect The risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren t relevant anymore People complained that PLTR wasn t profitable for 18 years Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said love us or leave us alone https www bizjournals com sanjose news 2020 09 09 palantir ceo makes livestreamed pitch to investors html https www bizjournals com sanjose news 2020 09 09 palantir ceo makes livestreamed pitch to investors html But even this changed recently PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130 000 000 Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits Well just you wait amp x200B 6 Conclusion and Outlook If you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo Let s connect the dots and bring this information to a point 1 The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms defense industry is no match for PLTR products The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago The chains are off 2 Military expenditures rising worldwide amp x200B https preview redd it qqcv8vzee4h61 jpg width 744 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2 https www sipri org media press release 2020 global military expenditure sees largest annual increase decade says sipri reaching 1917 billion https www sipri org media press release 2020 global military expenditure sees largest annual increase decade says sipri reaching 1917 billion With Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government Biden want to reduce the military expenditures PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden 3 PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales They don t have any significant costs when they acquire new customers Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data We don t work with it but big Institutions does Here is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it The systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public fractured healthcare systems erosions of data privacy strained criminal justice systems and outmoded ways of fighting wars will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change 4 PLTRs value The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble People don t know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks Facebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued They did it because Facebook didn t had a way to monetize their users especially on mobile platforms Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued A remember the recent examples Bumble Bruuuh Don t get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations Use these metrics on PLTR with great products great management low cost base and less odds as ever before PLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective 5 Do you use PLTR Me Neither It s not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR But their customer base is not only America I m not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products I don t need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about I have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing If all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60 70 With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more What s next Now we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending For the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs The most important part will be guidance for 2021 We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening The second event is the ending of the lock up period You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola Just 1 2 days after they announced they don t got the GM deal The stock tanked for a good reason You know the guy Trevor Milton But in PLTRs case everything is different Despite the successful deals they got does a guy who says love us or leave us alone sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility I don t expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel If some employees drop their shares it should be fine I would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3 It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up I don t think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid long term What does all this means for you Nothing Please don t do any market activity based on my DD I m just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses This is not a financial advice My hearts bleeding for all the GME holders My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized the pumpers In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently bye bye 20 k karma If you are new to this please don t do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly I m not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock I have 70 shares and a CSP Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub Leave

Their impressive trial data on HPV glioblastoma covid 19 MERS etc is so much stronger than others DNA science is cost efficient safe and effective Their success going to cost big pharma BILLIONS so they re not going to let Inovio succeed They ll hire shorts to manipulate people and they ll keep the FDA from approving trials In covid 19 s case Inovio went from the FIRST biotech to design a vaccine construct to the last company struggling to keep up due to lack of funding support and a lot of FDA DELAYS For the sake of honest science We have to hold the line and stay strong together what

swept under the rugs with no funding or support from OWS BARDA DARPA etc I mean they ve gone the furthest with MERS another family of SARS Covid The unexpected FDA hold on phase 2 3 that caused a short attack INO was initially suppose to begin phase 2 3 in the summer 2020 However for some reason it kept getting pushed off and investors were hella confused Meanwhile other vaccines were able to speed ahead It wasn t until September when Ceo Joseph Kim was finally able to tell anxious investors that s they re able to begin phase 2 3 by the end of September He was so confident in delivering the news that the stock was able to rise freely from 9 19 HOWEVER at the same time short interest suspiciously grew at the top The design plan of phase 2 3 was complete and everything was ready to go by end of September Here s a video of the ceo explaining phase 2 3 for covid 19 https twitter com covidobsessed status 1309991300305911809 s 21 But how did short interest increase sooooo much the week INO was supposed to begin phase 3 Suddenly on September 28 the FDA coincidently paused phase 3 over questions about their device which tested over 2000 patients safely already the stock was violently shorted down to 10 and patient Retail Longs got fucked big time http ir inovio com news releases news releases details 2020 INOVIO Reports FDA Partial Clinical Hold for Planned Phase 2 3 Trial of

leaked it out for some sort of deal If so it s market manipulation and completely criminal Also if the FDA had questions WHY DIDN T THEY ASK DURING PHASE 1 IN APRIL WHY DID THEY DELAY INO S PEER REVIEW PUBLICATION ON COVID 19 In addition to the FDA hold WHY did it take 6 MONTHS for the Lancet to publish peer review covid 19 data on Ino 4800 phase 1 while other vaccine s data were published within 3 8 weeks Inovio was the 2nd vaccine to begin phase 1 in APRIL In every conference call you can hear the CEO s frustration having to wait for the publication Publication of good data on a

getting a little bit frustrated too that we re not moving as fast as we would during the peer review process but I am very hopeful that we will be presenting our data through a peer review publication in the coming weeks So that s what our plan is And again the publication is not tied to the FDA release of the partial clinical hold It wasn t until Christmas Eve when Inovio was finally able to publish their peer review for covid 19 By then Moderna AZN and Pfizer were already gearing up for EUA and JNJ Novavax were advancing through phase 3 Link to Phase 1 data http ir inovio com news

reported Offers best in class thermostability including a five year projected shelf life at normal refrigeration temperature and no frozen transport or storage requirements It was highly SUSPICIOUS that BOTH peer review publication and phase 2 3 approval were conveniently slowed down so others can get ahead or gain more credibility for funding Like I said this is a battle against the corrupt system working with shorts Shorts big pharma and manipulating journals are all working together to fake a narrative that they never delivered a product to market so they re a fraud If that s the case then why does Moderna get the green light with no products on market They had the right connections with fauci and slaoui of OWS As much as we all want the FDA to pass biotechs based on science it s a money who you know game That s just the sad reality And that needs to change There are LEGIT reasons why longs call Inovio the Tesla of biotech they use a cellectra device to deliver dna effectively and safely into the skin with ELECTRICAL PULSES they have breakthrough science that doesn t require refrigeration and delivers strong KILLER T CELL data they re cost effective and easy to produce they WILL disrupt surgery and big pharma s traditional methods they re constantly being harassed by shorts and is one of the most shorted stocks on the market CITRON relentlessly shorted Inovio numerous times in 2020 You can see it in the chart on March 6 April 24 and June This isn t a pump and dump it s constantly getting attacked It s always an uphill battle against the financial system the FDA and big pharma s power and influence over it all The only way to squeeze them is if we look at their data and see that they DO DESERVE A CHANCE WE NEED TO HODL THE LINE TOGETHER The biggest manipulative argument for shorts is they re a pump and dump and never delivered a product to market but please take the time to analyze WHY THAT IS 1 years of constant delays and slow down by the FDA even during a pandemic 2 lack of support and funding to run these expensive trials 3 by the time they get to phase 3 the disease or virus is waned or dies down so they won t have enough people to test on Therefore they have to shelf their study until they get enough funding or need for it 4 the Inovio we know today with DNA medicine didn t launch until 2009 So all the 40 years of no product bear comments are just noise and manipulative Source https www investors com news technology ino stock buy now Upcoming catalysts that can lead to a short squeeze A short squeeze WILL EVENTUALLY happen and it s overdue We re in a pandemic EVERY eligible vaccine deserves a chance not shorted to the ground and manipulated completion of ino4800 phase 2 and start of phase 3 for covid 19 they began injecting 400 patients in December and the second doses recently finish the end of this month We hope to see preliminary data in a month and the start of phase 3 in March HOPEFULLY NOT DELAYED BY FDA AGAIN completion of ino4800 phase 2 for covid 19 in China and South Korea about the same time The good news is that if the FDA pauses Inovio again they have trials in Asia that might continue to prove their vaccine credibility more DOD funding for phase 3 INO Isn t just a covid play We look forward to the completion and progress on their other promising studies HPV VGX 3100 demonstrated clinically significant

details 2021 INOVIO Announces Proposed Public Offering of Common Stock default aspx VERDICT Inovio retail longs were constantly beat the fuck up but still staying strong because our time will come But more importantly Inovio needs us their science needs to come to light If they can t get the funding from the government maybe the people will fund them through a much needed short squeeze Either way there needs to be more awareness of this situation Big pharma have way too much power and control over our health system and medical advancements INO to 300 WE THE PEOPLE NEED TO SUPPORT THEM I m super happy for GME and AMC and wallstreetbets is doing An amazing job sparking this revolution If this happens to Inovio it ll also change our health system tremendously for all PLEASE SHARE THIS
