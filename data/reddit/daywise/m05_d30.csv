market It took a 176 rally in AMC stock price in one week to finally dethrone GME and become the most discussed stock of the week GME is a close second and had an exceptional week in the market Virgin Galactic also made into the top 10 list due to them successfully completing their spaceflight Another newcomer to the list is BlackBerry If a stock could run for President it should probably be BlackBerry as the percentage of people who have a bullish outlook on the stock far outweighs any other stock which is reflected in the sentiment Electric car makers are still continuing to generate

Virgin Galactic exploded in mentions due to its SpaceShipTwo craft pictured above reaching space This marked the company s first flight in more than two years and they expect to launch paying customers as soon as 2022 Wall Street analysts have flip flopped on their rating first downgrading the stock price by 33 and then upgrading it back to their earlier recommendation a 50 hike Overall the company has already reached the consensus 12 month price target of 31 20 and has risen a cool 25 in the last week Beyond Meat BYND The stock has rallied 28 last week mainly following commentary from CNBC s Jim Cramer On his Mad Money show Cramer said the WallStreetBets crowd should make Beyond Meat the next meme stock to drive a short squeeze He specifically noted that almost 25 of BYND shares are held short setting up a scenario for sharp gains Since Wednesday there has been a continuous stream of BYND YOLO s and DDs across Reddit sparking the rise in the discussion BlackBerry BB shares jumped as much as 12 Wednesday amid cheers from Redditors and a broader rally in meme stocks One important thing to note here is BlackBerry s short interest still remains below 10 of shares outstanding meaning any short squeeze wouldn t have too much room to run This https investorplace com 2021 05 blackberry by any other name would have a much higher valuation article has an interesting theory where they argue that BlackBerry by any other name would have a much higher valuation NVIDIA NVDA announced a stellar quarter with revenue of 5 66 billion up 84 percent from a year earlier and Data Center revenue of 2 05 billion up 79 percent from a year earlier They are projecting a record 6 3B revenue next quarter The stock experienced a delayed earnings reaction and has gained 8 4 this week Considering how hard it was to buy the new NVIDIA product I don t expect their revenue growth to plateau anytime soon Sundial Growers SNDL was trending as the stock passed the 1 mark last Friday For those who are not familiar with the company it was ridden up from 60 cents to almost 3 within one month last February With the current rally in stock price and with the price getting over the psychological barrier of 1 interest seems to be picking up SOME FAQ s How does the program work The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative What is sentiment It s calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment You get pre trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative I have modified it to analyse financial comments also eg Calls puts moon gain loss etc It then classifies the statement between 100 and 100 depending on if it s negative or positive respectively The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments Thank you for reading Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor

anyone who has a long or short position in SHOP https constine substack com p pressclub with mark zuckerberg daniel Have a listen Facebook CEO talks about the 400 000 000 creators and businesses on his platforms and Spotify s CEO talks about the soon to be 50 000 000 creators on his platform They talk with Shopify CEO about how all 3 companies need to work together to enable a 360 omnichannel experience for creators and businesses so they can connect with their audiences in different ways and in different places share content in different ways tell their stories in different ways monetize themself everywhere and lower friction for them How many of these 450 000 000 creators and businesses on Facebook and Spotify plus on many more such platforms do you think Shopify can enable to help merchants connect to all such platforms over the next 1 2 5 10 years 50 000 000 100 000 000 Imagine when Spotify artists like Eminem who uses Shopify seen here https shop eminem com adds a Shopify BUY button on Spotify Eminem has 22 MILLION followers on Twitter https twitter com eminem 32 MILLION followers on instagram https instagram com eminem 47 MILLION subscribers on YouTube can t post YouTube links here 91 MILLION followers on Facebook https m facebook com eminem 555K followed in tiktok https vm tiktok com ZMeU2vtCU HUGE SALES for musicians on Spotify when they add a Shopify BUY button there Coming soon based on what Spotify s CEO said How about when podcast creators large and small add a Shopify BUY button on Spotify Joe Rogan uses Shopify seen here https www higherprimate com How many sales is Joe and other such podcasters are going to make when they add a Shopify BUY button in Spotify This is what Spotify CEO said in the podcast in the link above about this topic Daniel Ek And our view just in the space of audio just a few years ago we had about 3 million creators on our platform 00 08 45 And today that number s over 8 million and we ve said by 2025 we think of will grow to about 50 million creators So just the explosion of the people who want to be creative and who are expressing themselves through music through podcasting through audio it s just staggering And what s fascinating to me as we spoke about is this notion about making it so that more of these people can live off of their passion and live off of their art that they re creating 00 09 17 And what s interesting I feel is that it s very much of an omni channel expression by these creators So it used to be before that if you were a musician as an example you just put out music That was the thing that you were doing But almost every successful creator now is omni talented and in omni channels 00 09 42 That means that they are on YouTube putting up videos They are on Instagram They are perhaps putting together brands and putting it on Shopify but they re also putting out music and merchandise on Shopify and music on Spotify of course and touring And so they re really just doing a multitude of different things and connecting with their fan bases across many different platforms 00 10 05 And so I think it s a super super interesting early stage but there s a lot of friction still of being a creator and managing your fan base across all of these different platforms that I think will be considerably easier in the coming years And even this distinction between what a casual fan is and what a super fan is I think will dramatically change in the coming years 00 11 02 Yeah I think we re still in the early days of creating deeper fan engagement between creators and fans 00 11 10 And it s definitely a sort of big theme that we re investing behind And as you said I think when I look at streaming the early innings were all about just access and just having access to the content and moving more and more of these minutes that was being spent in traditional offline radio or broadcast radio on to online on demand 00 11 31 And as as more and more people now have started doing that And we have hundreds of millions of people around the world that are streaming music every single day The engagement profile means that we are creating a lot of fans and we re creating a lot of super fans too So far music has been a one size fits all where we ve just monetized it through the streaming revenues in itself 00 11 56 And you had to as a creator figure out how to monetize that fan base off of other platforms But I think the future is that we will become a lot better at monetizing your fans and your super fans even on Spotify And I like to think and hope that platforms like Shopify and others can then interact with Spotify 00 12 18 And likewise you can have Spotify content beyond Instagram or Facebook in order to drive that 360 experience No wonder Cathie Wood form ARK Invest

media attention around a possible correction It makes sense we ve had some volatility lately seasonality is upon us markets have looked somewhat extended at all time highs And yet it seems like we just can t get a meaningful pullback Two weeks in a row we touched the 50DMA on SPY the Nasdaq found support about 8 down from its ATHs and the Russell has been trading in an ever tighter range but there s been no urgency to the selling and just a week and half after hitting some recent lows we re back just a few points off ATHs Analyst calls for a pullback are still out there but even they concede that they ve no idea when and we could possibly see new ATHs before such an event occurs After the recent weeks of scary inflation data bonds aren t buying it a digital asset crash and recently Fed taper talk you have to wonder what would be the catalyst to initiate such a pullback if we re still just a few bps off ATHs after all that Close to six weeks on the picture looks different We ve reset some of the stretched technical indicators the inflation data looks temporary for now and the market held up well through some choppiness To summarize the thoughts of other more

narrow range since mid April since the last bounce we ve been drifting upward which seems to be the direction of least resistance Will be bullish if we break above the recent ATH at 422 4238 on ES but could be range bound for awhile QQQ in a similar situation support at 316 but expect to need a break above 335 13750 on NQ to warrant a bullish stance IWM still range bound but had an encouraging week moving through the 21 and 50DMAs but this could just be another head fake within this range Since the recent lows on 05 19 we seem to have lost all selling conviction and are simply drifting higher You can see MACD crossovers and rising RSI on all indices indicative of a momentum shift However I d be careful about being too bullish here until we ve had a close above the top side of the ranges here we may not crash but we may need some kind of catalyst to push us higher from here Keep an eye on the risk on trade is this a momentum shift or just a bounce Based off the action the last few weeks and how things look now it s hard to have any bearish conviction in the short term The same could be said for the bulls and I don t see any catalyst to spur further upside on though there is

MUST listen for anyone who has a long or short position in SHOP https constine substack com p pressclub with mark zuckerberg daniel Have a listen Facebook CEO talks about the 400 000 000 creators and businesses on his platforms and Spotify s CEO talks about the soon to be 50 000 000 creators on his platform They talk with Shopify CEO about how all 3 companies need to work together to enable a 360 omnichannel experience for creators and businesses so they can connect with their audiences in different ways and in different places share content in different ways tell their stories in different ways monetize themself everywhere and lower friction for them How many of these 450 000 000 creators and businesses on Facebook and Spotify plus on many more such platforms do you think Shopify can enable to help merchants connect to all such platforms over the next 1 2 5 10 years 50 000 000 100 000 000 Imagine when Spotify artists like Eminem who uses Shopify seen here https shop eminem com adds a Shopify BUY button on Spotify Eminem has 22 MILLION followers on Twitter https twitter com eminem 32 MILLION followers on instagram https instagram com eminem 47 MILLION subscribers on YouTube can t post YouTube links here 91 MILLION followers on Facebook https m facebook com eminem 555K followed in tiktok https vm tiktok com ZMeU2vtCU HUGE SALES for musicians on Spotify when they add a Shopify BUY button there Coming soon based on what Spotify s CEO said How about when podcast creators large and small add a Shopify BUY button on Spotify Joe Rogan uses Shopify seen here https www higherprimate com How many sales is Joe and other such podcasters are going to make when they add a Shopify BUY button in Spotify This is what Spotify CEO said in the podcast in the link above about this topic Daniel Ek And our view just in the space of audio just a few years ago we had about 3 million creators on our platform 00 08 45 And today that number s over 8 million and we ve said by 2025 we think of will grow to about 50 million creators So just the explosion of the people who want to be creative and who are expressing themselves through music through podcasting through audio it s just staggering And what s fascinating to me as we spoke about is this notion about making it so that more of these people can live off of their passion and live off of their art that they re creating 00 09 17 And what s interesting I feel is that it s very much of an omni channel expression by these creators So it used to be before that if you were a musician as an example you just put out music That was the thing that you were doing But almost every successful creator now is omni talented and in omni channels 00 09 42 That means that they are on YouTube putting up videos They are on Instagram They are perhaps putting together brands and putting it on Shopify but they re also putting out music and merchandise on Shopify and music on Spotify of course and touring And so they re really just doing a multitude of different things and connecting with their fan bases across many different platforms 00 10 05 And so I think it s a super super interesting early stage but there s a lot of friction still of being a creator and managing your fan base across all of these different platforms that I think will be considerably easier in the coming years And even this distinction between what a casual fan is and what a super fan is I think will dramatically change in the coming years 00 11 02 Yeah I think we re still in the early days of creating deeper fan engagement between creators and fans 00 11 10 And it s definitely a sort of big theme that we re investing behind And as you said I think when I look at streaming the early innings were all about just access and just having access to the content and moving more and more of these minutes that was being spent in traditional offline radio or broadcast radio on to online on demand 00 11 31 And as as more and more people now have started doing that And we have hundreds of millions of people around the world that are streaming music every single day The engagement profile means that we are creating a lot of fans and we re creating a lot of super fans too So far music has been a one size fits all where we ve just monetized it through the streaming revenues in itself 00 11 56 And you had to as a creator figure out how to monetize that fan base off of other platforms But I think the future is that we will become a lot better at monetizing your fans and your super fans even on Spotify And I like to think and hope that platforms like Shopify and others can then interact with Spotify 00 12 18 And likewise you can have Spotify content beyond Instagram or Facebook in order to drive that 360 experience No

going on ,For all of the new baby apes I know a lot of you have questions and I thought it would be helpful to provide you with some overall context to understand the significance of the movement you just joined Covid hit last March and a couple of big hedge funds concocted a plan to drive AMC into bankruptcy by shorting it and make a ton of money in the process You short a company when you think the value of the stock is going to go down When the country locked down and AMC closed their doors and their revenue literally went to 0 overnight it was a no brainer play for the hedge funds So they started borrowing millions and millions of shares from brokers and sold them short at the market price at the time and they pocketed the cash from the sale The idea is that the stock price will drop you can buy them back later at a lower price and then return the borrowed shares to the broker and keep the difference If the company goes bankrupt the stock goes to 0 and they don t have to buy anything back at all and keep everything This is what they were banking on They ve done this to company after company over the years and they saw this as a sure thing as any Well a bunch of people on Reddit affectionately known as Apes noticed they were trying to drive AMC GameStop and many other retail brick and mortar stores into bankruptcy and banded together to buy up all the available shares driving up the share price This resulted in the mini squeeze in January But Apes didnt sell after that And the hedge funds didn t cover their short positions either I e buy back the millions of shares they had borrowed and sold short The Apes kept buying and buying and holding and holding and once the real shares were all bought up the hedge funds doubled tripled and quadrupled down on their short position and started making synthetic shares IOUs and selling those shares into the market trying to drive the price down When the price dropped instead of selling like the hedge funds wanted them to Apes said thank you very much for the discount and kept buying more and holding Nobody has sold for the past 5 months since the movement really got started in January and more and more people are jumping in and adding more everyday Now because of all of the synthetic IOU shares the hedge funds have created to keep shorting AMC us Apes likely own more way more shares than are actually supposed to exist as much as 6x 8x by some estimates But real or synthetic each share the hedge funds sold short is a liability on their books that must be bought back in order to close out their position They literally have hundreds of millions of shares possibly billions to buy back and we own them all They have to buy them back eventually and every day that the borrowed short shares are still on loan the hedge funds are paying interest to the brokers they borrowed them from Meanwhile it costs us nothing to hold Things started to come to a head a couple weeks ago because the interest rate on the borrowed shares was reported to be as high as 250 1 2 is normal for your average stock so the hedge funds are collectively paying hundreds of millions of dollars every day just to hold their position and a lot of them are starting to miss the payments and margin calls could be coming very soon That s when the fun starts At that point the broker forces them to buy back all of the hundreds of millions of shares they have borrowed and sold short because the broker doesn t want the hedge funds recklessness to fall onto them And remember the Apes own all the shares and aren t selling The hedge funds can only buy a share for what an Ape is willing to sell it for and us Apes really love our shares Once the margin calls start the computers just start buying back all of the shares at the best available price no matter what that price may be They all have to be bought back Everything must be settled And if the cheapest price an ape is willing to sell for is 1 000 or 10 000 or 100 000 well then that s what the hedge funds will be forced to buy the borrowed shares back for in order to close out their position Apes are going to hold and hold and hold driving up the price further and further to make the hedge funds bleed as much as possible until they are inevitably forced to buy back their millions of shares They will need to buy our shares and we set the price And remember it costs us nothing to hold This movement has been building for the past 5 months but you just heard about it yesterday One thing Apes don t do is set dates for the squeeze Nobody knows when it will happen all we know for sure is that the math says it s inevitable as long as we hold I only see three possibilities as to how this all plays out 1 AMC goes bankrupt and the hedgies win please note this is not going to happen AMC has enough liquidity to last them through 2022 and the most passionate shareholder base in the universe Not to mention a pretty badass CEO who has completely embraced the new shareholder base 2 Hedge funds are somehow able to meet their daily margin payments to avoid being margin called and they strategically close out their short positions over time causing a sustained Tesla type squeeze over a period of a year or more remember apes aren t selling until we re at the moon 3 Hedge funds will be margin called and forced to buy everything all at once and we ll have the most violent squeeze in the history of short squeezes The price is infinite as long as apes hold I wouldn t bet on 1 2 will require patience and 3 will be absolute insanity and in my personal non financial advisor opinion is the most likely outcome Either way we re winning the battle This beautiful movement is growing by the day and we can hold longer than they can Never before has anything like this happened where millions of regular people have been able to band together to take on the billionaires who have been screwing them over time and time again and be able to actually hit them where it really hurts It is the big hedge fund himself on the other side you know the one who has his hands in all the retail brokerage apps to make sure our orders get routed to him to fill And then they fill them with synthetic shares that they don t even have and dig themselves even deeper They created and marketed easy access to the stock market to the retail investor because they only saw the retail investor as prey Just another way to bleed us dry They never saw this coming Like I said everything will eventually have to be settled Margin calls are coming And the SEC has already enacted several rules to prepare as much as possible for the catastrophic fallout from this event and to make sure that something like this can never happen again The millions of little guys with an app in their hand are a threat now and I m sure they ll adapt to it So this could very well be a once in a lifetime opportunity here Although I m not a financial advisor I m Buying More and More and Holding for my fellow Apes
