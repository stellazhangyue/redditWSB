2018 That s still a sweet opportunity ,Hey Ya Remember the early 2000s It was all about lace up jeans giant cargo shorts Gilmore Girls Lord of the Rings the Atkins Diet and the BlackBerry Long before the iPhone the BlackBerry was the most beloved mobile gadget in the universe known especially for its reliability its security and its full keyboard But Research In Motion the company that made it didn t change quickly enough with the times and the sweet fruit of its labors went sour The company renamed itself BlackBerry NYSE BB in early 2013 and set on a course of reinvention first around smartphones and then around software Many people wrote it off And that s where we see a major opportunity BlackBerry has been quietly accelerating in its new mission securing all the connected devices that the modern world increasingly relies on You ve heard of the Internet of Things chips embedded in all the stuff around us transmitting a wealth of data Call the business angle the Enterprise of Things BlackBerry s new focus still draws on its expertise in endpoint security which shows us the fruit hasn t fallen so far from the tree But this time around it s securing things like self driving vehicles emergency health networks financial reporting and much more If your image of BlackBerry is stuck in the past read on This is a company with a future Second Bloom It s no surprise that most investors would pass BlackBerry by after a quick glance Revenue has declined every year since 2011 and even then the company s share price was far below the peak of nearly 150 that it reached in mid 2008 But this is quite simply an entirely different company than the BlackBerry most people remember and its turnaround is just starting to take hold Moreover the company s progress is masked by the continuing decline of old legacy businesses that aren t part of management s vision or our investment thesis going forward BlackBerry continued to sell its own handheld devices until mid 2016 and there are still BlackBerry branded devices available so current results continue to suffer from the decline of this business Service access fees SAF related to legacy users of BlackBerry operating systems are also dwindling Given that these two businesses still represented roughly 50 of revenue in fiscal 2017 their continued decline has been keenly felt But the meat of the current business Software and Services has grown at an average annual pace of 15 over the past three years reaching 782 million in fiscal 2018 the company s fiscal year ends in February This is now by far the largest part of BlackBerry and we expect revenue for the company as a whole to stabilize this year and start rising thereafter The company s QNX operating system in particular has been driving growth Traditionally used in vehicle infotainment systems it has grown into the software backbone that can run all the chips in a vehicle including safety and communications BlackBerry has struck key deals with Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA Baidu NASDAQ BIDU and others around this technology Baidu in turn has made QNX the core of its Apollo platform and has partnered with automakers like Ford NYSE F and Hyundai to make this the core of future autonomous vehicles This certainly isn t the only area where BlackBerry s business is growing but it s emblematic of the niche the company is carving out securing endpoints in the Internet of Things with a particular focus on enterprises It has been a leader in Gartner s NYSE IT Magic Quadrant for enterprise mobility management for the past two years making it one of the Top Dogs in a sector that s expected to grow revenue at a 25 annual pace through 2021 Still Green That hasn t yet put BlackBerry in the black but it s building the core of a very profitable business Since being recapitalized by Fairfax Financial in 2013 BlackBerry has boasted a strong balance sheet with 2 2 billion in cash and 810 million in convertible debt which will likely convert to shares rather than being repaid Gross margin improved from 49 in fiscal 2017 to an amazing 73 in fiscal 2018 indicating not only the company s shift from hardware to software but also some considerable pricing power Management also expects the company to deliver positive free cash flow this year it did last year too albeit thanks to a large one time adjustment Add it up and this is a 5 4 billion company currently generating around 800 million in very high margin software revenue leaving aside the remaining hardware and SAF businesses with over 80 of that revenue recurring With a gross margin that improved to 76 in the most recent quarter we expect this business to ultimately produce profit margins in the 20 to 25 range even as the top line continues to grow That looks like an attractive price point Risks and When We d Sell There are a lot of reasons to look more deeply at BlackBerry s financials but the surface picture remains unflattering For the time being this remains a company with shrinking revenue and marginal profitability Changing that relies not just on continued growth of the software business but scaling the business so that BlackBerry s relatively high sales marketing and R amp D costs come down as a percentage of revenue The company is a leader in a growing sector but its competitors companies like IBM NYSE IBM VMware NYSE VMW Cisco Systems NASDAQ CSCO and others have a lot of resources That s why it s important that BlackBerry establish an especially strong presence in areas like vehicles but we would like to see it keep getting wins in other areas too The Foolish Bottom Line Not every turnaround works but BlackBerry has already become a leader in enterprise mobility management by leveraging its security DNA This company has spent the last five years under CEO John Chen honing its new focus and at this point he says the company is largely done reinventing itself and ready to focus on furthering its leadership Chen should know he s a turnaround expert who was previously brought into database company Sybase returning it to profitability before it was sold to SAP NYSE SAP in 2010 Whether or not BlackBerry remains on its own or is ultimately acquired we expect it to continue expanding its capability and reach in keeping connected things safe and secure The best part is that many investors can t see the green shoots growing from the rotten fruit of a decade past That s a sweet opportunity

don t want to read Skip To The Bottom For The Video and Update Financial Disclosure At End STAR iStar Inc is a real estate investment trust REIT with a market cap of 1 28 billion dollars their primary focus is on ground leasing There are examples below where STAR gets their revenue under these circumstances of ground leasing They do through their subsidiary of SafeHold STAR owns 2 3s of SafeHold 1 A factory in need of cash The factory will sell the land under their factory to STAR and then STAR will lease it back to the factory 49 of revenue figure include net leasing 2 STAR purchases raw land develops the land and leases or sells the land to a new business 33 of revenue this number includes residential For those interested in how financially strong their ground leasing subsidiary is You can find their financials on yahoo finance below https finance yahoo com quote SAFE financials p SAFE https finance yahoo com quote SAFE financials p SAFE STAR is also involved in residential development and is currently building out one development with 3500 homes and another massive development in the pipeline with an estimated 16450 homes with over 700 acres of industrial commerical

exceptional company that flourished with high earnings and I admit they have seen better days However I firmly believe the bad days are behind them now with nearly 10 billion dollars in revenue in the pipeline from just residential development I am placing a target price of 22 75 without any WSB fuckery They also recently increased their quarterly dividend to 0 125 to common stock holders That is 50 cents a year just sitting on the stock That is why it s marketed to mutual funds and ETFs as a relatively safe security Below is a one week chart of STAR After market today is currently sitting at

situation here The fuck if I know But I will get into some key factors and you can make up your own bloody ape minds STAR has a total 70 24M shares in float or the number of shares that are currently available to the market Of those shares 20 79 or 14 6 million are shorted These are the exchange reported numbers provided by Ortex However Ortex estimates the true number of shares shorted is 15 79

million shares are essentially locked away from the shorts There is only 1 way for the shorts to gain access to these shares and that is to buy up all outstanding shares in each mutual fund ETF and

steady supply each day due to cash inflow into their funds Let us exclude these 22 04 million shares from float for the sake of the argument The real floated shares can be estimated to be 48 2 million shares and the short interest just above 30 The daily average volume traded is about 950k shares Most of the buying is conducted by ETFs and mutual funds Now let us say there was an increase in share price to 20 The shorts may start to cover their position But they won t be able to do it fast enough with the trading volume available to them They would need to recover 14 6 million shares when the daily average volume is 950k that is dominated by purchases by ETFs and Mutual Funds That would take them weeks of purchasing to cover during a normal trading environment All while the share price continue to climb due to increased buying pressure Melt up Below is an image of how long it took the shorts to build up their short interest Hedgies would have to fight each other for the shares

160 countries Sabre travel solutions is used by more than 435 000 global travel agents More than 300 leading airlines use Sabre Airline solutions Needless to say the pandemic hit SABR business hard As of this writing the share price is 13 87 which is 37 off of its share price of 22 36 on February 19 2020 after which it started tanking because of the pandemic While airlines and hotels have largely recovered and are hitting or close to all time highs SABR is still lagging While SABR has rallied over 100 since October 2020 there is still more room to go Google Partnership On January 21 2020 Sabre and Google joined forces to help digitally transform the traveler s experience and co create the future of travel On Oct 22 2020 Sabre and Google announced that they are developing an Artificial Intelligence AI driven technology platform that is an industry first in travel The technology known as Sabre Travel AI TM is infused with Google s state of the art AI technology and advanced machine learning capabilities that will help customers to deliver highly relevant and personalized content more quickly deliver personalized content that better meets the demands of today s traveler and create expanded revenue and margin growth opportunities The Company is integrating Sabre Travel AI into certain products in its existing portfolio with plans to bring those to market in early 2021 I know I know everyone puts out press releases nowadays with the words AI in it but they are an old company and I think the partnership shows how SABR can still innovate Short Interest According to TD Ameritrade the short interest is 19 17 Are they thinking Sabre which launched in 1960 and revolutionized the travel market with the industry s first semi automated flight reservation system and since then has evolved to manage more than 260B worth of global travel spend annually is going to continue to lose money when the world is ready for the Great Reopening Technicals Mini cup and handle

Catalysts , Just like most of the other people posting about it here lately I don t really know anything at all about the company Cleveland Cliffs CLF That being said I think its safe bet based on the name though that it has something to do with both the city of Cleveland and also obviously cliffs amp nbsp While I can t tell you much about CLF I can tell you quite a bit about the city of Cleveland and the wonderful geological features known as cliffs and why I am bullish as fuck on both of those amp nbsp Fundamentals I know for most of you WSB newcomers you may be used to trading on emotions and memes but its important to look at the fundamentals as well so before we get to the memes lets start with some fundamentals and important background information amp nbsp Cleveland Founded July 22 1796 source https en wikipedia org wiki Cleveland History Cleveland is the second largest city in the state of Ohio with a population of 381 009 source https www census gov quickfacts clevelandcityohio Cleveland had a 2019 GDP of 118 17 Billion up 1 5b from 2018 and nearly 13b since 2009 source https www statista com statistics 514232 gdp forecast of the cleveland metro area As of 2021 Cleveland has an annual budget of 1 8 billion source https www wksu org government politics 2021 03 16 cleveland city council passes 1 8 billion budget amp nbsp Cliffs A cliff is a mass of rock that rises very high and is almost vertical like a wall source https www nationalgeographic org encyclopedia cliff Cliffs have been around for hundreds of millions of years and show no signs of going anywhere anytime soon Fossils dating back 313 million years have been found inside of cliffs source https www cnn com travel article grand canyon cliff collapse fossil footprints scn trnd index html Cliffs are known for forming major geographical features such as waterfalls Source http justfunfacts com interesting facts about cliffs Cliffs are the sole required equipment for the popular sport of cliff jumping source https en wikipedia org wiki Cliff jumping amp nbsp Indications of Substantial Short Interest Now unfortunately the SEC does not regulate municipalities or geological features thus hedgefunds are not required to report their short positions in these areas That said there are certainly some major indicators that these funds likely have significant short positions in both Cleveland and cliffs amp nbsp Cliffs The sport of Freestyle Cliff Jumping emerged in the 21st century and has exploded in popularity So much so that Redbull even now hosts a global cliff diving world series source https www redbull com us en event series redbull cliffdiving Despite this clear rise in popularity of cliff related sporting we have not seen a correlated expansion in the number of cliffs in the world This is clearly a sign that the growth rate of cliffs is being heavily suppressed by short sellers Cliffs are eroding at increasing rates As of 2016 it was found that England s famous white cliffs have been eroding at 10 times their previous rate over the past 150 years source https phys org news 2016 11 england white cliffs dover eroding html 150 years before 2016 was 1866 What could have happened in England in 1866 to kick off this increased erosion of cliffs In 1866 the bank Overend Gurney and Company took on substantial investments in long term investments rather than holding short term cash reserves as was necessary and found itself in a liquidity crisis that bankrupted the company leading to a financial collapse known the Panic of 1866 in England source https en wikipedia org wiki Overend Gurney and Company That begs the question what were these investments that caused them such trouble Could it be that they were illegally naked shorting the white cliffs The timeline makes too much sense to ignore The continued increased deterioration rates of these cliffs indicate that its likely still going on Overend Gurney and Compnay may have failed but certainly someone further up the chain took over their positions Think of what we saw recently with Melvin Capital and Citadel amp nbsp Cleveland Despite Cleveland s solid fundamentals year to year growth of more than 1 5b and growth of 13b since 2009 Clevelands overall economic growth ranks 2nd to last among the 66 largest cities in the United States source https www wkyc com article news local cleveland wallethub cleveland slow growing city survey 95 c99dafef 9398 4606 bea1 e1d1ce2da0c8 clearly short sellers are hammering this great city into the ground The 2011 hit movie Kill The Irishman https en wikipedia org wiki Kill the Irishman Filmed in and based on events in the city of Cleveland Who s the head of notorious short selling hedgefund Citadel None other than Ken Griffin Where s the surname Griffin popular Griffin is a surname of Irish English and Welsh origin source https en wikipedia org wiki Griffin surname Now we don t want to go full blown conspiracy nut here but this looks like a pretty clear signal from the city of Cleveland that they want some serious revenge on our boy Ken Griffin They must know that we own the entire float and there is illegal naked short selling going on amp nbsp To The Moon Even if we completely ignore the obvious short interest in both Cleveland and cliffs if we look closely they re both clearly trying to speak to us about an upcoming moonshot At the end of the day it s really just like Ryan Cohen and DFVs incredibly obvious hints in their tweets amp nbsp Cliffs Trivia time Where is the largest cliff in the solar system Yup Already waiting for us on the god damn moon Uranus moon Miranda to be specific The Verona Rupes cliff is estimated to be a whopping 12 miles high source https en wikipedia org wiki Verona Rupes nothing says

Cleveland s NBA team the Cavaliers play That s right ROCKET MORTGAGE FIELDHOUSE Not just a company that recently experienced a squeeze of its own but also literal source https en wikipedia org wiki Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse amp nbsp Potential Upcoming Catalysts What kind of fuel could be coming up to Cleveland and cliffs to the It could be anything but here are some potential catalysts I ve found in my research amp nbsp Cliffs Global Warming Melting glacial ice and rising sea levels may unintuitively actually benefit cliffs Sure existing cliffs may face increased rates of erosion but said erosion also has the potential to create new cliffs as well Everyone knows that hip new cliff is way cooler than a boring hundred million year old cliff Now new cliffs being created by erosion from rising sea levels will likely take thousands of years but melting glacial ice could also provide a shorter term catalyst For all we know there may be some fantastic cliffs hidden under all of that ice Ice melting away to reveal previously unknown cliffs could be a massive catalyst amp nbsp Cleveland Return of the King LeBron James has 2 years left on his contract with the Lakers When it ends he will be 38 years old and likely at or nearing retirement It would only be fitting for him to come back to Cleveland where it all started to finish up his career The return of LeBron would be a massive financial boon for the city of Cleveland likely blowing short sellers out of the water and inducing game ending margin calls The Hyperloop Project There are plans in place for a hyperloop train between Cleveland and Chicago that could cover the 300 miles in only 28 minutes Recently plans were announced to expand this project to connected Cleveland and New York as well source https www

by u coachB88 I think he has done a great job explaining how gamma squeezes work in plain language and how it s very clear that we are looking at a 2nd rocket up for CLOV Full DD quoted below Link to the original post https www reddit com r CLOV comments nw9qd1 massive gamma squeeze incoming Massive gamma squeeze incoming So first off this is my first attempt at a DD and while I ve covered some of this on my channel I guess some of you would rather read crazy right Also I should note I ve been celebrating our week so far and I m about 4 in so if I make any mistakes let me know and I ll edit it Yes I m celebrating we started this week at roughly 9 and were up to 17 in after hours HUGE GAINS pullbacks are expected So anyways let s start with the difference between a GAMMA squeeze and a SHORT squeeze GAMMA squeeze is entirely pushed by options activity and has absolutely nothing to do with shorting a stock Every option call contract has a DELTA assigned to it The delta is the number of shares that the contract writer needs to own in order to hedge that contract Every call contract is essentially the right to buy 100 shares but the writer of that contract doesn t always own the shares this would be considered writing NAKED CALLS So when these NAKED CALLS get written the call writer typically will only own the amount of shares equivalent to the DELTA If the delta is 20 that means the contract has a 20 chance of expiring in the money and the call writer will carry 20 shares in their account for hedging purposes As the stock rises in price the DELTA will increase and now the call writer must also carry more shares to hedge the contract https preview redd it 224cres1ub471 png width 870 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3548d431698e209a111e9aeb9b4f1fddce8a93d2 Example Hedgie wants to sell a 6 18 20 call on CLOV CLOV is currently trading at 16 92 and the DELTA is 48 48 chance of being in the money hedgie now needs to own 48 shares to hedge his contract Hedgie also is a big time firm that doesn t actually sit behind a desk and push buttons so he has a computer algorithm that does the button pushing for him So as CLOV eventually rises to 18 DELTA now increases to guessing here 53 now hedgie needs to own 5 more shares and his algorithm goes into the market and buys those 5 shares Also notice in the example that there are 23 872 contracts at the 20 strike for 6 18 So when CLOV rises to 18 not only does our hedgie need to buy 5 shares all the hedgies need to collectively buy 119 360 shares to hedge all 23 872 contracts x5 most anyways some might be covered calls but that s another post in itself This is how a gamma squeeze works and this is the leverage power of options So whats been happening both to our benefit and detriment lately has been mostly GAMMA related amp x200B https preview redd it ozfe5m55ub471 png width 856 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 82a22197a8fbe3a7cd46f520a798e299f7dba4aa Notice the amount of contracts open interest between 8 15 that s a total of 114 562 contracts which equates to 11 4 million shares So yesterday on 6 8 we absolutely saw a gamma squeeze when the price broke 18 50 and ran to roughly 25 amp x200B https preview redd it tvbkj3c7ub471 png width 1180 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 7028bdb84b8f8bb8d972cf23c15fbf1ea42a5cb3 As the price pushed upwards of 18 50 all those 114k calls slowly increased in DELTA and forced hedgies algorithms to buy more and more shares which eventually led the DELTA to increase faster and You guessed it Buy more shares to hedge those naked calls WE ABSOLUTELY SAW A GAMMA SQUEEZE YESTERDAY running from 18 50 to 25 So we got to 25 and topped out Then what Well it works in reverse too so as price declines the algo s get to dump shares to un hedge their position which works against us and magnifies our decline So now I know what a gamma squeeze is and how it works So what s yours point Well today the option chain got extended to 40 and you beautiful apes loaded up on more calls contracts amp x200B https preview redd it azkczeq8ub471 png width 856 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 4f720a4f9adee1803596271379515e507ef13730 Between the 15 and 22 strike there are 149 888 calls contracts which by my quick math are roughly 50 hedged if someone wants to really break it down go for it and i ll edit the post That s 14 9 million shares 50 of which have not been bought yet So as we pump this price upwards of 26 to make a new all time high we can assume that most of these will increase in DELTA to almost 99 and force those algo s to keep buying Creating another gamma squeeze Which would likely push us into the 30 range BUT WAIT theres more Remember I said the option chain was increased from 22 to 40 today Well guess what these numbers don t reflect today s options activity but we can take a guess how many calls there might be by looking at the volume column amp x200B https preview redd it 2po8qz6bub471 png width 852 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5e7ffe5debeb4ff7171ef314f27a370c31369bc8 I see 83k in volume on the 22 strike today 29k on the 30 and 41k on the 40 among all the other calls So these numbers haven t been added to our equation And yes volume includes buys and sells so if these calls were bought and sold throughout the day it wouldnt entirely indicate where the open interest will be tomorrow BUT there was a ton of volume and as the 23 40 strikes get loaded up can t wait to see tomorrow s numbers that earlier push to 30 I told you about will likely create its own gamma squeeze in the 22 25 range And it keeps going until we blow the whole damn option chain out Are you excited I am You know what happens when an option chain gets blown out They add higher strike prices like 23 40 today and you know what that sets up MORE GAMMA SQUEEZES OK OK OK I m done on Gamma talk so what about the short squeeze Well I have no clue when shorts will be forced or inclined to cover but I know the higher we drive the price the faster they will have want too TLDR GAMMA squeezes are option driven SHORT squeezes are short driven They are separate but Gamma squeezes will help increase the price and eventually lead to a short squeeze These options dont expire until next friday 6 18 So the potential for the strikes to keep getting higher and earn ape more bananas is very high TLDR2 If you really hate reading check out

one electric vehicle stock to buy for the long haul Canoo NASDAQ GOEV got pummeled in late March GOEV stock sold off near 40 after the EV maker announced on its first ever conference call as a public company some surprising changes to its team business model and vision A Canoo MPDV being loaded with small shipping containers Source Canoo media Wall Street didn t like the changes mostly because they result in revenue projections being revised significantly lower over the next few years GOEV stock plunged more than 20 in response But the changes management announced on the call do not at all impact the company s core value props which are its technology its engineering team and its IP Instead they are changes related to how the company plans to monetize its ultra valuable multi purpose platform MPP While such changes will result in less revenue in the short term they should also result in the more revenue and profits in the long term Also of the note the management changes are mostly finance related and do not materially impact Canoo s ability to improve its underlying MPP technology which is the only thing that really matters here To that end my long term bullish stance on GOEV stock remains unchanged I continue to believe that Canoo has assembled a world class engineering team that has created a transformative MPP technology which will create a new generation of new and improved consumer and commercial electric vehicles that maximize interior vehicle space and are therefore exceptionally useful when applied to family vehicles pick up trucks and delivery vans In that context of that big picture the selloff in GOEV stock looks like a golden long term opportunity Subscribe to Innovation Investor for Luke s top Next Gen Mobility stocks Here s a deeper look GOEV Stock A Shocking Conference Call One look at the GOEV stock chart and you can easily tell that Canoo s fourth quarter conference call went pretty poorly The call itself was full of shocking surprises that had analysts scratching their heads First the company basically said it will scrap its engineering services business Originally the story at Canoo was that the company was going to provide engineering services to other auto makers to help them make EVs on top of Canoo s MPP technology and that this revenue would help the company subsidize operations until it developed sufficient manufacturing capacity to make tens of thousands of its own vehicles Last year Canoo announced an engineering services partnership with Hyundai But that partnership is now dead and it looks like the reason why is because Canoo has decided to deemphasize its engineering services business in order to protect its IP Makes sense Back in its original projections however Canoo was calling for all of its revenues in 2021 and most of its revenues in 2022 to be from this now defunct engineering services division In other words Canoo s 2021 and 2022 revenue estimates need to move significantly lower Second Canoo also said they are moving away from the subscription business model for its lifestyle vehicles Remember a big part of the Cannoo story was that the company was trying to pioneer a new subscription business model wherein consumers could rent its vehicles on monthly subscription plans But due to balance sheet risks inherent to that model management is moving away that model in favor of just selling vehicles directly to consumers Third as an extension of changing its business model from engineering services and subscription sales to vehicle B2C and B2B sales management is pulling its original long term model offered when the company announced its SPAC merger Fourth the CFO is out and that s never great news when a top level C suite executive resigns just months after the company goes public Oh and against the backdrop of all those changes the company s CEO wasn t even on the conference call Instead the call was headed by Tony Aquila the company s Executive Chairman who joined in October 2020 Breaking Down the Changes At first glance the aforementioned changes announced on Canoo s conference call look like deal breakers for GOEV stock But they aren t At all Remember all of the value at Canoo rests on the company s world class engineering team and the signature MPP technology they have collectively developed None of the changes announced on the conference impact that value A switch away from engineering services protects the IP of that technology Sure it eliminates a revenue source But at the same time it should boost Canoo s direct to consumer and direct to business sales channels at scale since no one else will be building vehicles on top of this MPP technology The subscription business model was a cool idea that if it worked out would ve been nice But it was always a long shot And without it Canoo will still sell tons of lifestyle vehicles trucks and vans No change there Profit margins also won t be impacted by this change since Canoo still plans to resell the same MPP chassis multiple times which is where the higher margins come from anyways Scrapping the model out to 2025 reduces visibility But doesn t change the underlying technology or its ability to scale By 2025 I actually think revenues will be higher under this new business model than the previous one given higher volume of B2C and B2B sales And finally the finance team isn t driving the value at Canoo The engineering team is and that engineering team remains fully in tact So long as that remains true the future of Canoo will look bright What Really Happened In my opinion here s what really happened at Canoo You have this world class engineering team They developed this breakthrough MPP technology They then got a bunch of not world class finance and strategy folks to put together a game plan to monetize that technology That game plan was half baked and risked the company s IP via engineering agreements with competitors while also putting stress on the balance sheet via subscription sales So when some more experienced business people came into the business following the SPAC deal including longtime technology business exec Tony Aquilla they convinced the Board to make some big changes to the strategy side of the business They re making those big changes right now and at the end of the day Canoo will emerge as a company with both a great technology and a great game plan to monetize that technology Long term then I feel the tough changes Canoo is making today actually position the company for bigger and more durable growth Specifically having full control over the IP widens Canoo s technological moat selling via upfront sales should actually boost cash flows and reduce down balance sheet risks and focusing on the commercial market mostly allows Canoo to maximize the biggest advantage of its MPP technology which is that it maximizes interior space of vehicles Strategically I like these changes I understand Wall Street s having a tough time digesting them Wall Street doesn t like change This is big change Of course GOEV stock is going to be weak But long term investors would be wise to work through this weakness and stay the course Luke s Top EV Stocks to Buy Subscribe to Innovation Investor Today Canoo will emerge from these changes as a stronger company and long term this company will turn into a major player in both the consumer and commercial EV markets Bottom Line on GOEV Stock GOEV stock represents one of the most compelling long term plays on the Next Gen Mobility revolution wherein the world is pivoting from legacy gas powered cars to self driving EVs But Canoo is just one of my top electric vehicle stocks which represent the cream of the crop when it comes to disruptive technological innovation in EVs These companies all feature second to none management teams and massive long term potential Each of these next generation mobility stocks could post Tesla like returns including a secret startup that s spearheading the self driving revolution and a company I consider my EV sleeper stock of the decade By Luke Lango InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst

my first attempt at a DD and while I ve covered some of this on my channel I guess some of you would rather read crazy right Also I should note I ve been celebrating our week so far and I m about 4 in so if I make any mistakes let me know and I ll edit it Yes I m celebrating we started this week at roughly 9 and were up to 17 in after hours HUGE GAINS pullbacks are expected So anyways let s start with the difference between a GAMMA squeeze and a SHORT squeeze GAMMA squeeze is entirely pushed by options activity and has absolutely nothing to do with shorting a stock Every option call contract has a DELTA assigned to it The delta is the number of shares that the contract writer needs to own in order to hedge that contract Every call contract is essentially the right to buy 100 shares but the writer of that contract doesn t always own the shares this would be considered writing NAKED CALLS So when these NAKED CALLS get written the call writer typically will only own the amount of shares equivalent to the DELTA If the delta is 20 that means the contract has a 20 chance of expiring in the money and the call writer will carry 20 shares in their account for hedging purposes As the stock rises in price the DELTA will increase and now the call writer must also carry more shares to hedge the contract https preview redd it 224cres1ub471 png width 870 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3548d431698e209a111e9aeb9b4f1fddce8a93d2 https preview redd it 224cres1ub471 png width 870 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3548d431698e209a111e9aeb9b4f1fddce8a93d2 Example Hedgie wants to sell a 6 18 20 call on CLOV CLOV is currently trading at 16 92 and the DELTA is 48 48 chance of being in the money hedgie now needs to own 48 shares to hedge his contract Hedgie also is a big time firm that doesn t actually sit behind a desk and push buttons so he has a computer algorithm that does the button pushing for him So as CLOV eventually rises to 18 DELTA now increases to guessing here 53 now hedgie needs to own 5 more shares and his algorithm goes into the market and buys those 5 shares Also notice in the example that there are 23 872 contracts at the 20 strike for 6 18 So when CLOV rises to 18 not only does our hedgie need to buy 5 shares all the hedgies need to collectively buy 119 360 shares to hedge all 23 872 contracts x5 most anyways some might be covered calls but that s another post in itself This is how a gamma squeeze works and this is the leverage power of options So whats been happening both to our benefit and detriment lately has been mostly GAMMA related

webp amp s 82a22197a8fbe3a7cd46f520a798e299f7dba4aa Notice the amount of contracts open interest between 8 15 that s a total of 114 562 contracts which equates to 11 4 million shares So yesterday on 6

18 50 all those 114k calls slowly increased in DELTA and forced hedgies algorithms to buy more and more shares which eventually led the DELTA to increase faster and You guessed it Buy more shares to hedge those naked calls WE ABSOLUTELY SAW A GAMMA SQUEEZE YESTERDAY running from 18 50 to 25 So we got to 25 and topped out Then what Well it works in reverse too so as price declines the algo s get to dump shares to un hedge their position which works against us and magnifies our decline So now I know what a gamma squeeze is and how it works So what s yours point Well today the option chain got extended to 40 and you beautiful apes loaded up on more calls contracts https preview redd it azkczeq8ub471 png width 856 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 4f720a4f9adee1803596271379515e507ef13730

quick math are roughly 50 hedged if someone wants to really break it down go for it and i ll edit the post That s 14 9 million shares 50 of which have not been bought yet So as we pump this price upwards of 26 to make a new all time high we can assume that most of these will increase in DELTA to almost 99 and force those algo s to keep buying Creating another gamma squeeze Which would likely push us into the 30 range BUT WAIT theres more Remember I said the option chain was increased from 22 to 40 today Well guess what these numbers don t reflect today s options activity but we can take a guess how many calls there might be by looking at the volume column https preview redd it 2po8qz6bub471 png width 852 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5e7ffe5debeb4ff7171ef314f27a370c31369bc8 https preview redd it 2po8qz6bub471 png width 852 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5e7ffe5debeb4ff7171ef314f27a370c31369bc8 I see 83k in volume on the 22 strike today 29k on the 30 and 41k on the 40 among all the other calls So these numbers haven t been added to our equation And yes volume includes buys and sells so if these calls were bought and sold throughout the day it wouldnt entirely indicate where the open interest will be tomorrow BUT there was a ton of volume and as the 23 40 strikes get loaded up can t wait to see tomorrow s numbers that earlier push to 30 I told you about will likely create its own gamma squeeze in the 22 25 range And it keeps going until we blow the whole damn option chain out Are you excited I am You know what happens when an option chain gets blown out They add higher strike prices like 23 40 today and you know what that sets up MORE GAMMA SQUEEZES OK OK OK I m done on Gamma talk so what about the short squeeze Well I have no clue when shorts will be forced or inclined to cover but I know the higher we drive the price the faster they will have want too TLDR GAMMA squeezes are option driven SHORT squeezes are short driven They are separate but Gamma squeezes will help increase the price and eventually lead to a short squeeze These options dont expire until next friday 6 18 So the potential for the strikes to keep getting higher and earn ape more bananas is very high TLDR2 If you really hate reading check out my YT channel coachbstocks I started live streaming CLOV this week and I explain most of this shit on there Edit here s a post I made on

so I ve been following this company for sometime Triterras amp x200B I first heard of it mid December 2020 following a massive dip I m a huge proponent of understanding causes behind big dips and finding potential in such stocks it did seem tempting then but I avoided it wholesale as the dip was caused by a sister company under the same CEO receiving a statutory demand for payment from one of its creditors amp x200B This dip saw the share price fall 40 ironically one day after being given an outperform by an analyst check motley fool s article dated 17 dec amp x200B Following which Triterras has seen ups and downs in its share prices with the biggest blow being a fraudulent enquiry early this year The share price gradually dipped to an all time low of 4 72 on May 13 2021 but quickly rose to the 6 mark and gradually to the 6 30 mark over the past few weeks with a significant level of resistance amp x200B Just last night it finally popped to 7 87 before consolidating at 7 40 end market 15 99 market gain The average analyst call on this stock is 16 by year end 6 1 2 months from now Now I m sure this stock would already be 50 70 there if not for 1 The lack of PR with regards to the fraud enquiry EPS dates 2 It being based in a foreign country Singapore amp x200B It is also worth noting that trading volume on this stock is extremely low prior to last night which previously meant lower volatility pushing away potential traders amp x200B It s also one of the highest shorted stocks on the market at 1 and a half million floats and 5m shorts Search up Triterras on plotlion amp x200B Naturally I ve been one of the most risk adverse guys in all of history and there wouldn t be anyway in hell that I would step into this stock in a million years amp x200B I did notice something quite interesting with the company however Despite the countless short reports and current pending fraud investigation they ve been quietly hiring top level staff on the side with one particular person catching my eye Mr Sri Vasireddy CTO post check out his linked in and youtube him up amp x200B They also made quite a few interesting partnerships on the side One with Western Trade Union and another as a 8m acquisition of Invoice Bazaar giving them further leverage over potential customers partners in the gulf area where a bulk of trade finance deals go down amp x200B These points combined with a 50m share buyback programme they initiated early on and the fact that they ranked first place in the Singapore Founder category FinTech Awards by the Monetary Authority in Singapore Biggest Main finance authority in Singapore makes me think that these guys know exactly what they are doing amp x200B I won t go into too much detail about Singapore but a quick google search will show that it is truly the city of now and the future Its management of Covid has been phenomenal and there s little surprise that the highest net wealth holders are flocking to the island state due its security social political economical and lack of tax amp x200B Finally the thing that has enticed me most about Triterras is that is has an incredible opportunity to disrupt a 1 5 trillion SME Trade Finance Gap Exploring this sector is a deep wormhole but I strongly advice reading up about it TODAY Before Market Opens whether on their official website or elsewhere before jumping onto the wagon amp x200B All these points have shown me that the company truly has outstanding opportunity in the long term as a growth company stock Just based on analyst ratings its touted to hit 16 by end of the year from the current 7 amp x200B And while I have always been incredibly hesitant about over night explosive stocks which is really the whole point of WSB I m beginning to realise that this could be the opportunity of a lifetime perhaps more so than the company s long term growth will ever achieve amp x200B Yesterday s 15 explosion has been on the cards for sometime One more explosion and I can see all the shorts frantically covering With authorities stepping in to help hedge funds I feel like short squeezes might soon be a thing of the past and this is perhaps one of our final opportunities to make it big this way and never have to worry about money again amp x200B All it really takes is one big time short to cover resulting in an all out scramble to cover amongst the players and an all time explosion of the stock price amp x200B I know I should have probably said this earlier but I wanted to make sure I shared my DD so you guys could do your own too and not just jump on this bandwagon blindly amp x200B Having secured a 700 swing portfolio gain in the past year sadly due mostly to Covid I see this short term scenario opportunity as an even more lucrative boost than anything I ve ever participated in despite all the crazy earnings over this blessed year amp x200B Seeing yesterday s jump of 20 to 7 80 in 2hrs I d say that we don t have much time before this explodes again And once that ship sails it ll be ages before it comes back again just see how long it took AMC BB to resurface post initial breakout amp x200B Finally the beauty of investing in this company now is that it s already hit rock bottom And assuming it somehow does go lower it ll eventually buck back up due to the long term growth goals capabilities of the company amp x200B If however we get enough people on this in the short run and that probably starts tonight then the sky is barely limit and the shorts will be our boost to Valhalla and beyond amp x200B I wish you all the best amp x200B Let s go make some money

these funds are purchasing a steady supply each day due to cash inflow into their funds Let us exclude these 22 04 million shares from float for the sake of the argument The real floated shares can be estimated to be 48 2 million shares and the short interest just above 30 The daily average volume traded is about 950k shares Most of the buying is conducted by ETFs and mutual funds Now let us say there was an increase in share price to 20 The shorts may start to cover their position But they won t be able to do it fast enough with the trading volume available to them They would need to recover 14 6 million shares when the daily average volume is 950k that is dominated by purchases by ETFs and Mutual Funds That would take them weeks of purchasing to cover during a normal trading environment

day due to cash inflow into their funds Let us exclude these 22 04 million shares from float for the sake of the argument The real floated shares can be estimated to be 48 2 million shares and the short interest just above 30 The daily average volume traded is about 950k shares Most of the buying is conducted by ETFs and mutual funds Now let us say there was an increase in share price to 20 The shorts may start to cover their position But they won t be able to do it fast enough with the trading volume available to them They would need to recover 14 6 million shares when the daily average volume is 950k that is dominated by purchases by ETFs and Mutual Funds That would take them weeks of purchasing to cover during a normal trading environment All while the share price continue to climb

,For some context I am not some idiot sitting alone writing this post hoping to bag the next big market move I ve worked at 2 investment banks one starts with a G and 1 hedge fund and can confidently say that this company can justify holding a good percentage of any long term high growth portfolio It isn t crap What They Do Vuzix or VUZI is an optical company producing smart glasses that is now over 20 years old so it isn t a bullshit company based out of someone s garage cough CLOV cough and is one of the leading companies for supplying smart glasses and augmented reality technologies they re also on track to receiving several juicy military contracts from the US government these are like infinite money hacks since everyone knows that US defense contracting is OP as a revenue source as their company s origins are in military display solutions remember when the US government introduced these literal ESP wallhack goggles https www dailymail co uk sciencetech article 9517833 Armys new night vision goggles look like tech used Halo video games html They make stuff like that and are rumored to be receiving more government contracts like this one https www proactiveinvestors com companies news 936705 vuzix completes delivery of customized waveguide solution for a major international defense contractor 936705 html from a few months ago This is a huge revenue stream that is only going to continue growing over the next several years In addition they also sell computer display devices and software a market that will only continue to grow and provide an additional solid revenue stream as there s always going to be some chimp on WSB that needs a computer monitor to see their overnight millionaire gains But let s talk about what you all only give a shit about since no one actually cares what these companies do amp x200B DD Due Diligence Why This Stock WILL Moon VUZI is soon to be added to the Russell 2000 and 3000 indexes https www prnewswire com news releases augmented reality and smart glasses innovator vuzix to be added to russell 3000 and russell 2000 indexes 301309224 html bringing more exposure and attention to this already great company Even Cathie

point of interest the augmented reality market is expected to grow at a CAGR compound annual growth revenue of 43 8 YOY from 2021 to 2028 reaching a market size of 340 16 billion USD in 2028 citation https www prnewswire com news releases augmented reality market size worth 340 16 billion by 2028 cagr 43 8 grand view research inc 301228121 html That is 12 7x the current market size of 26 75 billion USD Boiled down augmented reality market will go to the moon Vuzix s current market cap is 1 2 billion or 4 5 of the total market If the company stays the a similar percentage of the total market cap by 2028 it ll reach a valuation of 15 3 billion That is nearly 15x its current size But it doesn t stop there the percentage of total shares shorted is at 15 97 For reference AMC has 20 of its total shares shorted and it FUCKING MOONED Though unlike other companies with high short interests this one has a solid structure and great future It IS a good company There is not only a short squeeze play here but the company is solid and has a small market cap with tons of room to grow at only 1 2 billion AMC has a market cap of 24 76 billion and if we see a squeeze even HALF the size of AMC s VUZI can stand to 10x its current valuation and reach a share cost of 190 up from 19 that s a whole lot of gains to buy a whole lot of Wagyu steaks and tables at Nobu amp x200B But it still doesn t stop there Though bear in mind the next bit of DD is highly speculative I can see military contracts growing over the next 1 2 years And not just by a little but by a huge fucking amount Explosive some may even call it yes pun intended We may very well see ourselves in WWIII https www forbes com sites davidaxe 2021 06 07 anticipating war with china the us air force is spreading across the pacific by 2023 and with wars there are war dogs People that profiteer off governments hemorrhaging money into building bigger and better armies Playing companies that reside in the military industrial complex especially high growth military tech companies like VUZI can stand to make you all millionaires And as they say Never let a good crisis go to waste In the event that all hell breaks loose at least you ll all be enjoying your tendies from a multi million dollar home Be the war dogs and fight for your country financially amp x200B Finally it still isn t even close to ATH Sitting at 19 per share as I write this VUZI reached 31 per share on April 8 2021 That s a 63 difference from its current share price Or as I like to call it the potential to reach at least a 63 gain 12 if this stock receives the right exposure amp x200B Where I Can See It Headed Honestly who the fuck knows But if I had to place bets I can see it reaching 30 in the next 2 weeks if it receives the right exposure to retail investors In addition this price is not a pump and dump like AMC nearly striking 70 VUZI s price will hold strong regardless of where it ends up because VUZI is a solid company that has great growth potential over the next few years Even if it doesn t receive the attention it deserves I would urge anyone reading this to buy just a few shares to hold in your long term portfolios You won t regret it amp x200B Any comments questions concerns are appreciated I ll do my best to answer them But like any other human I cannot predict the future This is just one guy s opinion on a potentially huge play

fuck does one DD on WSB cause a 4 4b stock to move up 11 450m in market cap Clearly something must be wrong with the market right Here s some fun math https www youtube com watch v msDuNZyYAIQ t 41 for you WWE s IV was 35 The standard deviation for a daily move using the rule of 16 is 35 16 2 1875 It moved 11 2 1875 about five standard deviations The odds of that Roughly 1 in 1 74 million Let me know if this is miscalculated So how does a 1 in 1 74 million event occur And more practically Why didn t it close at a lower more statistically reasonable price The SMELL high bang for the buck If you remember my first post yesterday https old reddit com r wallstreetbetsOGs comments nvibpi wwe can you smell what the stock is cooking I chose this ticker due to it passing the SMELL test S hort Interest is high M arket cap is high E xtremely Memeable L ow IV lt implies low volume as well L ow Float What differentiates WWE from other new meme stocks CLOV CLNE etc are the Low IV and Low Volume I ll touch on that in a sec First let s get one thing straight The bump from yesterday was definitely from my original post To me that s incredible because I don t even consider that post a wild success It didn t hit the frontpage It was buried a few pages deep for awhile it got a late start In the end it garnered 1k upvotes and 230 comments WWE reached something like 25 in mentions on WSB Meh Yet still caused a five sigma move in the stock That s pretty good leverage I think that s the SMELL at work particularly the low IV and low volume There s just not much liquidity in this stock Not much of the market cares about it If they did then after settling down at 65 00 with volume tapering off where were the profit takers Where were the shorts A 10 day with zero news and momentum seemingly fading and it stays at 10 five sigma levels With a single 1k upvote WSB post I m bullish Show me the memes Now do me a favor and find some second generation meme stocks with DD post numbers that low that have done anything Seriously I d be grateful if you find one I don t think any stock has moved 11 much less five sigma of its IV from a single DD before Well maybe CLNE But it wasn t five sigma and it was already widely discussed recently before the run up I could be wrong here A more typical example CLF a new star a had several DD posts yesterday all raking in multiple times the amount of upvotes and comments And what did CLF do yesterday Up 14 With an IV of 60 a 14 move is 3 2 standard deviations away or 1 in 1000 odds All of that attention and it breaks out by an amount 1000x more likely than what happened to WWE WWE got far less attention but moved a much more significant amount See what I m saying Also yesterday the other second generation meme tickers were fetching in tens of thousands of upvotes across several posts They seemed to just hang out Some dumped Meanwhile WWE just hangs out even while the WSB trend ranking is like 26 https www quiverquant com wallstreetbets on the rankings Scroll down to Trend Map or Ctrl F for WWE It s mentions count is way down there below CRSR BARK SI SDC TWNK and a bunch of other shit I had no idea anybody still cared about or just started fawning over And yet WWE pumped and did not dump gt Why didn t it close at a lower more statistically reasonable price I believe there is simply not much real inflows or outflows in WWE Remember the daily volume on this was generally very low the IV was very low and it s 120 insitutionally owned Nobody trades this it s not expected to move much and the shareholders are boomer funds How many of those institutional owners actually reposition their holdings regularly I don t think many At least not many did yesterday The WSB post started reaching obscurity but WWE held steady at 11 gains with literally no fundamentals changing from day before The shorts are being cautious and the longs are just chilling If you believe that my one shitty little post was enough for what happened yesterday then you should see that it doesn t take much to move this stock With WWEs meme potential and it being short squeeze season there s a lot of upside and not a whole lot of downside maybe 11 back down to where it was News Porn This type of coverage can t hurt Bloomberg Newest Meme Stocks Extend Gains With No Sign of Craze Fading https www bloomberg com news articles 2021

to see these tHe sQuEeZE iS nOt sQuOZe In case any of you are into this for the squeeze potential 22 of available float let s discuss If you don t care about sqeeziness great you can skip this I don t believe we saw any squeeze yesterday Post market and pre market shows extremely bullish activity MMs and quant algos see an uptick in WWE mentions on the bane of our existance Asks for options go up defensively Market opens and plethora of options orders come in Not a crazy amount just 1k upvotes worth They continually hit the ask and ramp up the volatility MMs are forced to gobble up shares to deltahedge from both the new options and also the huge gap at open and also the huge increase in IV Remember based on the prices they ve sold the existing OI this is a five sigma event On a stock with hardly any volume to support that Stock wobbles around as the feeding frenzy ensues Volumes tapers down stock holds at 10 No hockey stick squeeze No high volume spikes mid day Thus I think no margin calls and no covering Furthermore I m told Ortex did not show a decrease in shares on loan I ll update this tomorrow when that data becomes available Conclusion It is my opinion that non retail longs and shorts are just sitting on the sidelines Not much profit taking not much shorting and not much covering They re all being cautious Look at institutional ownership of this thing 120 How many of these fund managers are going to reposition their WWE holdings mid day Probably not many I feel like yesterday s movement was all us MMs and HFTs shuffling Just from one itty bitty 1k upvote post That s a lot of leverage The SMELL in real What happens if this post hits 2k Or this thing gets memed by others What happens if shorts actually start to cover What happens if there s an acquisition But don t kid yourself this is still speculative I m now less bullish but not bearish about A fundamentals based justification of current share price I m now more bullish about The impact that visibility here could have on the share price The probability of shorts covering probably slowly for now but possibly biting the bullet if we get into the 70s The IV getting more jacked 90 IV is high for this ticker but low for a meme stock And lastly when this thing peaked just after open and you all complained about not getting in Well I felt ugly I felt stupid I felt gay https www youtube com watch v do8VgY4bqI amp t 50s Sorry about that My next DD if I find another SMELLy stock will be during market hours TLDR I m bullish that a single 1k upvoted DD on WSB reaching only 25 most mentioned was able to move this stock 11 up 440m to market cap which 35 IV is a five sigma event About 1 in 1 7 million By comparison CLF had several posts each with 3k upvotes 3x the comments etc and it saw a 14 move That s 3 2 sigma move about 1 in 1000 To me that indicates there is not much liquidity in WWE and the volume yesterday was MMs HFTs quant funds and retail buying options and shares 120 institutional ownership must have a lot of float locked up as well and they re not in the business of repositioning randomly on a bump with no news Price held at 11 five sigma above what the market thought this was valued at a day ago despite no news Why no sell off Again all this from a single moderately successful post To me this reads as bullish the small visibility on WSBs has a massive impact on the share price More massive than any other tickers I ve seen catch on here lately I saw no signs of covering or margin calls Neither did Ortex Positions After yesterday s action the risk reward for options is significantly higher I don t think the IVs are too crazy yet but the odds of a 20 bagger are slim unless we see CLF levels of hype Regardless I trimmed most of my options and have left in the amount I started with Same positions as before but now evenly spread Jun 18 65 70 Jul 16 60 65 70 Jan 22 60 If this post picks up traction I ll be adding onto the 70s at open I will likely buy many shares at open as I think the worst case with them is they go down 11 to 58 No biggie

their aircrafts Investment Information Commercial Space Flight Industry Over the past decade space flight has been innovated consistently through rapidly advancing technologies decreasing costs and greater access to capital for private space flight companies organizations Many governments have taken a hands off approach to space flight and funded private companies who compete for contracts and are forced to be constantly innovating in order to win these contracts This competition has resulted in technologies that greatly reduce the waste emissions and cost of space travel Virgin Galactic has been able to incorporate the best innovations in space flight into their aircrafts to create a reusable rocket that increases launch consistency number of launches and decreases the cost of space exploration Lastly Virgin Galactic is exploring certain strategic relationships in order to advance their technologies identify new applications accelerate their progress and enhance their growth as a company Financial Information Financial Performance Good Virgin Galactic increased their R amp D expenses by 19 YoY although this is considered a cost it is necessary for their business to spend on R amp D and I believe the improvements in technology derived from R amp D spending will be considered an asset in the future Financial Performance Bad In 2020 Virgin Galactic s revenues decreased by 93 7 their gross profit decreased by 96 34 their net loss increased by 199 79 and their net margin decreased from 47 to 27 This is due to the fact that the US government decreased their engineering service budget having adverse effects on Virgin Galactic s business Liquidity Position Virgin Galactic currently has a cash position of 665 9M and an additional 13M of restricted cash Having this many cash should help Virgin Galactic to weather the storm in the meantime until the eventually are able to have a positive net income Stock Based Compensation Virgin Galactic s board of directors along with the shareholders adopted the 2019 Incentive Award Plan which reserved 21 21M common shares to be awarded to employees consultants and directors If these shares were to be distributed evenly over the next 3 years there would be dilutionary effects of 2 85 year Director Compensation Table Virgin Galactic awards members on their board with stock awards in 2020 Virgin Galactic gave out awards of 124 994 to 4 board members totalling 500k of stock compensation In Virgin Galactic s 10 K report they stated that this compensation resulted in a total of 99 465 shares distributed to these members This would cause share dilution of around 0 04 which is essentially negligible Anniversary Awards Virgin galactic also gave out some anniversary awards to some of their highest ranking employees to recognize their ongoing service In 2020 they gave out 931 93 common shares to 4 of their longest standing high ranking employees this would cause share dilution of 0 4 although this dilution is not a large figure it still adds up over time Colglazier Awards In 2020 Virgin Galactic awarded their CEO Michael Colglazier with a maximum of 1 070 000 in monthly installments over 60 months This represents 214 000 shares being distributed to him every year which would have a dilutionary effect of 0 09 year Palermo Awards Furthermore in 2020 Virgin Galactic also awarded their COO Enrico Palermo with a maximum of 200 828 shares however upon retirement he only decided to take 25 50 207 shares which would cause a dilution of existing shares of 0 02 Exercisable Options Currently there are 717 603 underlying shares in options that are exercisable If all of these options are exercised there will be dilutionary effects of around 0 3 although this is not much it adds up Virgin Galactic s Strategy Virgin Galactic plans to use their proprietary and reusable flight system to seek to provide affordable safe reliable and regular transportation to space for their customers Virgin Galactic has highlighted a few ways in which they intend to achieve this Commercial program for Human Spaceflight Virgin Galactic is in their final stages of readying their commercial spaceflight program and has been vigorously testing their VSS Unity Spaceship https www virgingalactic com mission Currently they are happy with the performance and are completing the final touches like adding a cabin interior before they prepare their first future astronauts for space Expanding their Fleet of Rockets Virgin Galactic plans to build more of their VSS Unity Rockets to expand their fleet of vehicles Furthermore they are working on building two SpaceShip III vehicles By creating these vehicles Virgin Galactic is hoping to increase their annual flight rate which will help them to maximize their revenues Lowering Costs Virgin Galactic is constantly looking for ways to improve their manufacturing and operating efficiency in order to decrease their total cost per spaceship Furthermore as they continue to manufacture additional spaceships and improve their technology they believe that their costs will decrease smoothly over time Leverage their Proprietary Technology Virgin Galactic intends to continue to expand on their proprietary technologies to pursue growth opportunities and enter into agreements with other government organizations for the use of their ships Management Team It is very important to look at the credentials of the management team https www virgingalactic com who we are our team especially when looking at high growth stocks that have mainstream hype Furthermore this is increasingly important when looking at SPACs or companies who previously were listed publicly via SPAC like Virgin Galactic By looking at the management team you get an idea of their experience and expertise in the field which helps to validate the company and decrease the chances of a scam A great example of a SPAC with an awful management team is NKLA Nikola https utradea com stocks NKLA and look at what happened to them Virgin Galactic s CEO was formerly the Chief of Staff at NASA and was the Space Shuttle Launch Integration Manager at NASA as well Virgin Galactic s President of Aerospace Systems has 20 years of experience in aerospace defense and cyber security industries Virgin Galactic s VP of Engineering had 40 years of experience working under Lockheed Martin Virgin Galactic s team of pilots has 269 years of combined flight experience with organizations like NASA RCAF RAF US Air Force and the US Marine Corps Furthermore there are many distinguished members on Virgin Galactics Space Advisory board including former NASA Chief of Staff George Whitesides and former astronauts Sandy Magnus and Chris Hadfield I think that this management team is well rounded and very experienced This is very good to see in a business as technical as Virgin Galactic s and it shows me the legitimacy of their business and their future potential Furthermore there is no doubt in my mind that this is a legitimate company who is making serious efforts to change space travel for all of mankind Competitors Virgin Galactic has competition both in the private space and in the public markets Virgin Galactic s private competition provides more of a threat to their operations business so I decided to include them However Virgin Galactic s public competitors are not as big of a threat but I have to include them in this section because of the comparable analysis that is later to come Virgin Galactic s private competitors include Space X and Blue Origin both of these companies namely Space X have made tremendous strides in the space travel industry and have made several advancements that have made space travel easier to access Virgin Galactic s public competitors are companies that operate similarly to Virgin Galactic have similar goals for their business and are listed on the public markets These companies include The Boeing Company BA https utradea com stocks BA Lockheed Martin Corp LMT https utradea com stocks LMT Aerojet RocketDyne Holdings Inc AJRD https utradea com stocks AJRD and Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc SPR https utradea com stocks SPR These companies will be seen again in the comparable analysis where I will compare the financial ratios and multiples of Virgin Galactic to that of these competitors Investment Valuation The only way in which I could value Virgin Galactic is via comparable analyses Furthermore since there were only 3 multiple and or ratios that exhibited a positive number I had to choose to compare those ratios multiples The ratios multiples that I chose were P B https www fool com investing how to invest stocks price to book ratio PEG https www thebalance com fundamental analysis understanding the peg ratio 3140796 and EV Assets https www wallstreetmojo com ev to assets P B By comparing Virgin Galactic s P B ratio against their public competitors listed above in the competitors section of this report I arrived at a fair value per share of SPCE of 25 73 which implies a downside risk of 29 24 EV Assets By comparing Virgin Galactic s EV Assets multiple to that of their public competitors I arrived at an implied downside of 69 17 or a share price of 11 21 PEG The last ratio that I examined was the PEG which implied an upside of 14 99 to a share price of 41 81 Average Comparable In order to arrive at an unbiased valuation I decided to take the average of the 3 results that I arrived at through my comparable analyses By doing this I got an all encompassing fair value of 26 25 share which would imply a downside risk of 27 80 I do not think that this is the be all and end all for valuing SPCE because in this analysis I compared their ratios multiples to other companies that were already more mature and were not solely focused on commercial space flight An example of this is Boeing Boeing has plans for space travel however their business is generated through the sale of airplanes this is vastly different from Virgin Galactic so the comparable does not make the most sense So although Virgin Galactic is not an undervalued stock today they may be in the future when they make their own revenues However I do think that this valuation implies that current and potential investors should be aware of the risk and potential downside of this investment however wherever there is risk there is reward and the reward for this investment could be astronomical once again pun intended Risks Share Dilution Virgin Galactic has a lot of programs and awards that incentivize their employees and directors through stock compensation These programs awards include stock based compensation director compensation table anniversary awards Colglazier awards Palermo awards and exercisable option awards By grouping all of this dilution into one figure we arrive at a maximum dilution for the year 2020 to be 3 68 This is a large number and should be considered by new and existing shareholders alike However this is a high growth potential investment so it is not uncommon to have higher figures of dilution Financial Performance Virgin Galactic s financial performance in 2020 was very poor however it was due to the loss of contractual revenue from the US government In the grand scheme of things Virgin Galactic will not be relying on the US Government for the majority of their revenues so it should not scare away investors from the bigger picture revenues for Virgin Galactic Catalysts FAA Approval If Virgin Galactic can get their last 2 approvals from the FAA they can start to take their commercial space flight business seriously and start to generate their own revenues Once they start generating their own revenues they should be able to turn a profit and work towards overall profitability of the business Successful Flights If Virgin Galactic can continue to have successful trials and flights their reputation as a commercial space travel business will be solidified This is especially important during the early stages of their business because trust is everything TLDR Great financials strong leadership and milestone accomplishments SPCE is poised for continued growth if they can continued down this path Credit to u Lost Guarantee229 https www reddit com u Lost Guarantee229 The Original Post with pictures and graphs can be found here https utradea com positions

is an Embarrassment of Riches We agree with Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor BCX9930 is a great challenge and we are happy we have one My only concern is I have no concerns Pipeline in a Molecule My aim is to make c5 inhibitors obsolete This is Big BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project amp x200B amp x200B V II Phase I study amp x200B On March 22 2021 BCRX announced that BCX9930 will be advancing from PH1 to Pivotal PH3 Trials in PNH following the successful proof of concept trial totally skipping the Ph2 Pivotal PH3 trials for PNH and proof of concept trials in renal complement mediated diseases are expected to begin in 2H 2021 Straight jumping from a PH1 to a pivotal PH3 trial is something that s not common in the bio world it accelerates the process of the drug develoment giving it a chance to hit the market in a smaller span of time The quicker the drug is in the market the better and the more value it brings for investors On March 22 the company unveiled BCX9930 Ph1 data 100 of treatment na ve patients and 83 of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were transfusion free Prior to the trial 22 of treatment na ve patients and 17 of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion free Hemoglobin levels increased by a mean of 3 5 g dL in treatment na ve patients and 3 2 g dL in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients at last visit mean hemoglobin levels were 11 8 g dL and 12 2 g dL respectively amp x200B https preview redd it arazk0265g471 png width 1440 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

gathered the data from the main studies in this kind of inhibitors In the Q1 2021 ER ConferenceCall apart from reporting excellent Orladeyo revenues the company announced it came to an agreement with the FDA Basically they changed the Primary and Secondary endpoints of BCX9930 s study From now on the change of Hgb levels from baseline and the tranfusion free reduction will be the main endpoints of the study So pay close attention in the chart given below to the underlined numbers in red those are the Hgb level change from baseline and the transfusion free units reduction numbers BCX9930 by far has achieved the best results making it the best in class treatment amp x200B https preview redd it zbrgppf75g471 png width 1146 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0e161ad37f234bf595edb8f0f7a1c2767f71a195 The main Competition in the field of this kind of inhibitors is conformed by the treatments mentioned below amp x200B Alexion Soliris C5 0 1 Hgb 68 Approved

Hgb 100 PH3 amp x200B KOL s Key Opinion Leaders praised BCX9930 PH1 data regarding the transfusion rate reduction noting it couldn t have achieved better results it can t do any better 100 transfusion reduction Basically BCX9930 posted such good data that FDA wants the treatment in the market the quicker the possible That s why they Skipped the PH2 jumping from Ph1 to Pivotal Ph3 s and also changed the Primary Secondary endpoints of the study to ease the approval path amp x200B amp x200B V IV Alternative Pathway amp x200B What makes BCX9930 a game changer is it being an oral inhibitor of the Factor D enzyme that controls both extravascular and intravascular haemolysis advantage that widens the spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat Other inhibitors like Alexions Soliris C5 can just treat up to 2 diseases aHUS PNH While ours BCX9930 aims for 8 diseases https ir biocryst com static files f093d843 a642 41c6 8a65 1b5d1800f6cd page 26 as of now that s why

8 diseases we reach to the following conclusion The potential market size BCX9930 will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to 28 56B 51B year This numbers are explained below 1 2 Due to COVID 19 the market for PNH and aHUS was anticipated to grow from US 4855 million in 2020 to US 7023 million by 2026 it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5 89 during 2021 2026 3 Anca vasculitis prevalence in the USA rounds 10 20 per million 3300 6600 patients Using Soliris which costs 500 000 year We would aim for 1 65B 3 3B market size as of now Expected to grow by 2025 4 The global systemic lupus erythematosus market size is expected to reach USD 3 08 billion by 2025 according to a new report by Grand View Research Inc 5 8 IgAN The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone Prevalence rounds 45 million meaning 14 850 patients or a potential 7 25B market size using Soliris s yearly price 6 C3G Prevalence in the USA round 14 140 per 1M people 4620 46 200 patients If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs 500 000 year the potential market size we aim for rounds 2 31B 23 1B 7 PMN prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN so we would potentially aim for a similar market size meaning 7 25B amp x200B amp x200B V VI Alexion Buy Out amp x200B On December the 12th 2020 Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B More than 90 of their revenue come from their C5 inhibitor being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen You might think why does this matter Well remember we have the best in class Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion s and is able to treat x4 times more diseases than they do aswell This buy out reflects how undervalued BCX9930 is Apart from the buy out I think it s essential to mention that Alexion bought Achillion s Factor D when it was in Ph2 for 930MM In 2020 Alexion s SOLIRIS eculizumab ULTOMORIS Ravulizumab net product sales were 5 13B Treatments that are currently approved to treat PNH and aHUS As a quick example using the average biotech mid cap x7 revenue multiplier and the revenue Soliris managed to generate in 2019 5 13B 35 91B It would mean a SP value of 203 90 for BCRX I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in class treatment and it s able to treat x4 times more diseases therefore aims for a bigger TAM amp x200B amp x200B V VII Soliris Ultomoris patients survey amp x200B BCRX recently did a survey with 23 PNH patients 12 of them using Ultomiris and the other 11 Soliris The survey showed that 91 of the patients were interested in switching due to the reasons explained in the pic below amp x200B https preview redd it 2zesa1of5g471 png width 1448 amp format png amp auto webp amp s c05e7574c33145be90082457208ccb6b1e20a2f0 Some of the patients treated with BCX9930 were asked some questions among them the 6th one expressed his desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 twice a day oral pill As we have seen it before with Orladeyo patients are highly willing to switch from needles to oral pill form treatments amp x200B https preview redd it dzw3kecg5g471

treatment that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their C5 inhibitor and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the 40B mark BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a 30 of Alexion s buy out price this is 11 7B meaning 66 44 Same thing as with Orladeyo happens here BCX9930 is an Orally taken treatment the other approved treatments out there requiere usage of Needles so we shoud expect BCX9930 to follow Orladeyo s steps or perhaps perform even better now that the company has gained valuable experince with the launch of Orladeyo amp x200B BCX9930 value 66 44 SP https

explained in the Institutional section before all good bio tech investors do know who Alexander J Denner founder of Sarissa Capital is After recently increasing his stake in BCRX along with BlackRock he now owns a 5 of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc Denner has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning 789 in the last 3 quarters showing strong conviction in the company Since Denner opened his position in Alexion it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal as shown in the picture below amp x200B https preview redd it bqvj6maj5g471 png width 1300 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 075d8d0286936a5a94979d55fc3a69d8b2606df2 amp x200B After this exhaustive analysis of the company we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a strong BO candidate A Buy Out coming from Biogen BIIB company where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors would make total sense in the following 1 2 years once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled BIIB s financial position in the last year has notoriously worsened the profitability has gone down a 71 25 in the last year They need new revenue sources and BCRX s excellent pipeline could change so Takeda TAK could be another excellent suitor for the BO considering how Orladeyo is stealing its HAE patients market share It also is important to mention that Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M amp A candidates

we should expect from Biocryst in the upcoming years From 2007 to 2014 Alexion s SP grew a 1777 Being valued at 10 5 in 2007 and 186 6 in 2014 Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their C5 inhibitor was approved to treat additional diseases firstly PNH then aHUS as the market size it captured became wider and the amount of patients it treated slowly scored up Biocryst Pharmaceutical s SP managing to do the SP move Alexion s stock did is more than doable considering the unique pipeline it possess Having in mind Alexion made 66 4 MM revenue the first year 2007 while BCRX expects to

Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management With this agreement BCRX was funded with 325 000 000 in order to support Orladeyo launch Jon Stonehouse CEO confirmed that the company will not need to do

exhaustive analysis we come to the conclusion that BCRX is severely undervalued and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline it should be valued around 180 PT will keep growing as we get new data updates from the on going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing potentially making it have the Best Risk Reward ratio in the Bio Sector I naturally do have a position in this company my average

Read, Bah Gawd Bah Gawd It s Due Diligence What s more ape than professional wrestling Well hold onto your tendies because while ya boy u pennyether had a great technical analysis https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nvcyxf wwe can you smell what the stock is cooking about how to make your childhood nostalgia finally cash you out for a change I noticed a big gaping Nia Jax hole https www youtube com watch v vcl69RfGw54 in the writeup Fortunately I m here for the run in so distract the ref while I pontificate As it happens we don t need to imagine what it looks like to have a major combat sports league sold for a big profit In fact we just had that exact circumstance happen just a few years ago The UFC And The WWE Aren t Actually That Different Yes we know the UFC is real fighting and the WWE is a scripted stunt show But beyond the real or fake dichotomy the essential product is the same The product is the simplest story of all me you fight ooga booga Both companies are monolithic America based entities that the average consumer conflates with the product itself People train UFC and refer to indie wrestlers as doing WWE Both companies operate premium priced streaming services for additional over the top content beyond their television offerings WWE Network vs UFC Fight Pass Both companies offer tertiary programming on multiple channels featuring their promoted stars Both companies boast lucrative television contracts Small Time Vs Big Time Many Bananas The UFC sold for 4 billion in 2016 about 4 5 billion today and many tendies showered upon the Fetitta brothers who had purchased the ailing organization for a mere 2 million in 2001 At the time the price seemed rather high particularly considering the interest payments due on the investment that crimped fighter pay and sponsorship deals Nevertheless the organization remained successful and has seen its estimated value increase considerably during the interim Speaking as a lifelong fan of professional wrestling and a longtime mixed martial arts fan there s no comparison when it comes to the product The WWE is just bigger Big Time Wrestling The WWE is just bigger Bigger television deals More airtime More viewers More shows More content Content content content That s why NBC backed up the Brinks truck for the big WWE pay per view deal that saw the WWE sign over their American WWE Network subscribers to consume their content on Peacock TV instead The 1 billion 5 year deal https www msn com en us tv news how the dollar1 billion wwe network deal puts peacock into the ring with streaming giants ar BB1d5ous for WWE Network content is separate from the 1 billion 5 year deal https www thesportster com wrestling wwe fox deal worth one billion dollars with Fox for WWE Smackdown and the separate 5 year deal with USA https www sportskeeda com wwe wwe confirms new tv deal with usa network and fox sports for Monday Night Raw and NXT on Tuesday nights Apparently Vince likes billion dollar deals who knew If someone has figures for the USA deal please enter in the comments At the time of the UFC s sale the UFC was still working through its original deal with Fox https heavy com mma mma news 2011 08 ufc fox announce new television deal which consisted of 24 The Ultimate Fighter fights and 6 live UFC Fight Night events This would comprise about 40 hours worth of programming per year Currently the WWE produces a staggering 260 hours of top line content per year weekly Monday Night Raw 3 hours and WWE Smackdown 2 hours shows generally drawing 1 5 2 million viewers per show T 156 hours of B level content including 2 hours of NXT 650 000 viewers per show and 1 hour of 205 Live not many unfortunately 40 hours of pay per view content per year Remember these are American viewers only global viewing audience is considerably higher Revenues Dana White must have made a deal with the devil because the UFC s 2016 revenue came to 666 million WWE s 2020 revenue came to a staggering 974 million https corporate wwe com media Files W WWE annual reports 2020 annual report pdf in the midst of a pandemic itself suggesting a deal of at least 7 billion for the company For comparison s sake the WWE s current market cap is just shy of 5 billion However I believe 7 billion is a lowball estimate To wit The UFC at the time relied heavily on individual pay per view sales to drive revenue The UFC s comparable reliance at the time on superstar fighters such as Conor McGregor and Ronda Rousey meant their big numbers could not be relied upon Meanwhile the WWE presently relies on long term guaranteed television contracts and premium streaming revenue The advent of on demand and streaming services have given leeway for the stratospheric rise of television rights fees for live sports in the last several years I would be very surprised if the WWE went for anything less than 10 billion and I would assume closer to 12 billion A 12 billion sale price would price WWE at 157 share considerably up from 64 57 today and making many gorillas happy with their bananas Unusual Corporate Moves The fact that WWE recently released a lot of talent isn t news in and of itself The company has historically performed a spring cleaning of sorts every year after their Wrestlemania event where dozens of wrestlers are given a wristwatch and a kick in the butt on the way out the door daddy However there are a few key differences this year By all appearances the WWE did not exactly fight hard to keep one of their absolute top stars in Daniel Bryan whose contract expired shortly after Wrestlemania While a lot of talent released post Wrestlemania were either underutilized roster fillers or underutilized but talented midcarders a number of releases this year raised eyebrows Among the odd ones out Samoa Joe beloved wrestler turned commentator Mickie James beloved veteran women s wrestler BRAUN STROWMAN the titanic former world champion with a big dollar contract Aleister Black who had just been re introduced and featured in the main event of WWE Smackdown not two weeks prior to his release Perhaps even more importantly there was the matter of the merging involving multiple layoffs of two separate media departments https www mandatory com wrestlezone news 1236661 wwe merges digital and tv departments amid many layoffs Combined these to me look as if the WWE is cleaning shop both internally and on the surface level to prep itself for a sale Releasing high dollar talent and extraneous roster guys will give new owners a clean slate to work with and if they want someone back they can always try to get them back including Strowman I would assume Corporate downsizing makes the books look better Vince Being Vince Vince McMahon s uniquely monomaniacal approach to the WWE creative process extends to his entire business approach The ultimate alpha male gorilla ape whatever Vince is the last word on all creative decisions in the business Whatever happens on his show happens for a reason Until recently he even sat in the gorilla position https www ringsidenews com 2020 08 21 vince mcmahon hasnt sat at gorilla position backstage in wwe in quite some time during televised events It s a thing yes It takes a lot of energy to run book and manage a wrestling promotion even a small regional one And while Vince has often bragged about his virility and even posed for the cover of Muscle and Fitness https i pinimg com 736x 6c f1 e1 6cf1e1897b84ff75c63f5da38cef8986 fitness magazine vince mcmahon jpg at the age of 69 he s getting OLD Now 76 years old Vince McMahon has made only sporadic and brief television appearances In my opinion Vince is looking to put a capstone rather than a headstone on his legacy and one way to do that is to take his father s modestly successful wrestling promotion and permanently cement it as an unarguable business success by selling it for an obscene amount of money That s The Bottom Line I think the WWE is setting the table for an acquisition and I believe the eventual acquisition price will be considerably above the market cap I believe the true acquisition value of the company is north of 10 billion perhaps as high as 15 billion for an eventual range of 131 197 share Ape out

unbiased as possible and we ll leave the overhyping to the apes A few disclaimers I m a CPA in training with a Master s in Accounting from Bentley University so I do thoroughly know how to read and interpret financial statements and can layer in some technical ratio analysis to back my opinions I am fairly new to trading but am good at picking up chart trends and understanding how the bigger picture affects the daily stock price With that said I m still very much a newbie on valuations and the market as a whole The other disclaimer is that I currently hold 12 5 of my portfolio in RKT and am considering 1 5 2x that position in the coming days Allow me to first talk about the market conditions then the health of the company itself and then I will move to the stock I ve been very torn about what to write in this part of my DD A lot of people are wary of rising interest rates and decreasing demand in the future of the US housing market While these woes are valid I believe the Fed understands we are still far off from a full recovery COVID 19 is still very prevalent across the globe which will continue to put bottlenecks in supply chains and stretch out the full recovery Investors are also short sighted so when RKT reported in their recent earnings that their GOS margin gain on sale will be lower than it was over the recent year the stock tumbled This makes logical sense that it will be lower in the future though because we are coming out of a period of historical demand for mortgages and refinancing Rocket even lays this out in their report stating that their strong earnings over the last year clearly demonstrates how well positioned they are in the market With RKT diversifying its offerings mentioned below and the Fed unlikely to raise rates until at least late FY21 early FY22 these market woes don t deter me from my bullishness Fundamentally RKT is an extremely strong company for a myriad of reasons strap in Quicken Loans Rocket Mortgage is the largest non bank retail lender in the country by a massive margin more than 2x larger than the second United Shore Financial Non bank lenders can offer more flexible loans than banks with lower down payment percentages While bigger is not always better one should simply look to a company s customers and employees to determine long term viability and market share retention growth Rocket Mortgage has been named 1 in the U S for Client Satisfaction in Mortgage Origination by JD Power for 11 years in a row boasting a 91 customer retention rate and ranked 194 on the recent Fortune 500 list Fortune ranks Rocket as 5 in their list of 100 Best Companies to Work For They also offer employee discounts on mortgages which is an awesome perk The company is quite robust financially RKT brings a portfolio of offerings that give it huge competitive advantages as well as a seemingly healthy balance sheet with increasing operating margins during a time where home ownership is at an all time high and average home prices have appreciated 3 YoY Dan Gilbert Rocket s cofounder and chairman still owns 75 of the company despite starting the company in 1985 He recently became the 36 th richest person in the world after Rocket s IPO Together with the CEO Jay Farner they ve kept Rocket Quicken on the cutting edge of new technology the company is investing heavily in new platforms to streamline the lending process and provide a full service suite of products to their clients Notably they reported a 220 increase to 45 000 agents nationwide in adoption of their Rocket Pro Insight platform which provides real estate agents with realtime updates on the status of their clients mortgages and allows them to assist along the way They offer Rocket Auto an automotive retail marketplace that pulled down 360 million in gross merchandise revenue for Q1 Amrock an insurance services property valuation and settlement services company just had its best quarter in history with closings up 110 from last year And RocketHomes com a fully integrated home search website which had a mind boggling increase of 300 to 1 5 million unique monthly visitors Needless to say this is a company that is operationally sound growing exponentially with massive resources loved by its customers and takes care of its employees The company is focusing on growing its other revenue streams building out its platforms and grabbing more market share in an industry where it s already dominating There are plenty of press releases and news articles out about Rocket which is also a positive in my eyes as I value transparency I also like that they are a company that advertises a lot and has key partnerships and sponsorships as this further builds brand reputation Switching gears to the actual RKT stock itself and valuation There are a myriad of reasons the stock is where it s at today which I ll try to touch on but in the last week I finally got it looking at the price action and putting the pieces together It s here that I ll say I m torn on the cost benefit of RKT being a meme stock as it can lead to overselling shorts piling on which we ve seen but during current shifting bullish market conditions back towards small cap growth I do see this as a benefit Again this is where brand reputation name recognition helps immensely as it already has huge retail interest The primary reason I believe RKT to be undervalued at 20 other than what I ve mentioned previously is the possibility of an addition of RKT to the S amp P 500 and the recent addition to the Russell 1000 index I won t get into why this is be a massive deal for the stock but I will discuss what brought RKT to this point To be in the S amp P a company needs to be US based with market cap of 10B post 4 straight profitable quarters and have 10 of public float Basically RKT has 8 of its total company in Class A shares available to the public which has 100 of the economic interest and the other 92 in Class D shares with more voting power but no economic interest the vast majority of which Dan Gilbert owns and the rest for institutional investors and employees seeing rumors of Hathaway buying a stake as Gilbert and Buffett are amigos not confirmed It s TOTAL market cap is around 38B with the publicly traded shares valued around 3B Unfortunately I have read that S amp P will not allow new companies with more than 1 class of stock Gilbert could convert all of the class D shares into class A to meet the S amp P s criteria In my opinion choosing to keep RKT structured as is has proven beneficial as Gilbert and management have kept 70 of the voting rights because they believe they know how to steer the company best So far this has worked quite well for them as you don t become the 36 th richest person in the world with an industry leading company without steering through some tough waters TLDR I m fine with them not going in the S amp P but even being added to the Russell is a very bullish sign Technical Details amp x200B RKT Daily https preview redd it kon8hv7mcg471 jpg width 1812 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 87736b6042af9551455b9faec2f11d2de5131c9e The stock has struggled to break the 50 MA but is recently coming off a breakout from the 10 MA on volume and renewed retail interest in meme stocks In its short history the stock has traded mostly in this 19 24 channel but has tried and failed to breakout and hold multiple times At the most recent date I could find RKT had a short interest of about 20 million shares out of 136 million outstanding a 100 increase from the prior reported date Also notice that nice cup and handle forming with solid support at 19 50 and a recent breakout in the last 2 days I will admit I have NO idea what Rocket should be worth but based on its multiples it seems grossly undervalued at 20 22 If you believe the company can continue even coming close to these growth metrics it s trading under 10x forward P E which seems low for any industry especially with the recent index rebalance of value growth stocks Now more anecdotally I have read and heard of MANY bag holders of RKT when it was trading in its higher range and can confirm by looking at the option chain that there is far more open interest in ITM calls vs ITM puts indicating that options traders are more bullish than bearish I believe investors don t fully understand what a quality company they have on their hands with retail volatility in full effect and the shorts piling on to scare away the bulls creating heavy selling pressure Bears clearly are wary of an over inflated housing market and rising interest rates which will hurt their profitability but I believe financially RKT will weather any such storm due to their market share and continued push towards revenue diversification This is not financial advice and simply my own opinions

interest of the free float,Alright gents TLDR of the Play POSH is a solid reopening play as people will need to replace their wardrobe They will sell the old wardrobe on POSH to people looking to update theirs on POSH Good fundamentals if you care with solid growth YOY and is beginning to expand internationally The stock has almost 50 of the public float sold short according to Ortex and no shares left to borrow according to Fintel The stock is not actively traded and would be hard to cover if there were large buying pressure or catalyst Positions 6000 shares and looking at the 6 18 60C if the stock were to get any traction They are only 20 I came across some really solid DD on Poshmark a few months ago and have been watching it ever since Here is a brief rundown of POSH Poshmark is a platform where a seller can sell used clothes shoes handbags etc Usually it is name brand items They charge a commission for using the platform and that is their main revenue driver When the original post was made the stock had fallen to 40 from the IPO high of 100 The OP says that POSH is thought of as a stay at home stock and not a reopening stock which is false I and the OP say that it is a reopening play His thesis is that people have been sitting at home not buying new clothes because they are not going out The reopening means that they will have to purchase a new wardrobe because of new styles and they may have gotten fatter during the lockdown I personally have gained about 20 pounds which I am calling my Covid 19 Sorry for the pun I have used POSH to replace my LULU ABC pants for my return to the office It was a good experience So there are two bullish trends that are good for the company People are replacing their wardrobe and selling the old on POSH and then you have cheaper people like me searching for the new wardrobe on POSH Double edged sword People also have started a side hustle using POSH Typically people search though thrift stores and find items they try to flip on POSH There is also a large social ecosystem that has coalesced around the plat form TLDR of the DD people got fat during the lockdown and will need to replace their wardrobe They will either buy new items and sell their old stuff on POSH to other people looking to replace their wardrobe with used items People also shop for vintage items and flip them on POSH Now the original post was about two months ago and there have been some developments that support the thesis and other overall bullish news The reopening has been in full swing with the CDC saying that vaccinated people dont need to wear masks I was in NOLA this weekend and it was exactly the same as I remember Retail has been going bananas and blowing out every imaginable estimate Even GAP blew earnings away and who the fuck shops at gap Bottom line people have been buying a lot of new clothes POSH signed a deal with SNAP to integrate the two apps which adds yet another social level to the platform and specifically targets their main audience GenZ and younger millennial https www fastcompany com 90638876 poshmark and snapchat team up to court gen z consumers for posh parties and shopping https www fastcompany com 90638876 poshmark and snapchat team up to court gen z consumers for posh parties and shopping Now where does that leave stock Shorted into oblivion that s where I calculate that there are about 15MM shares in the float with 7 5 8MM shares held by institutions That leaves around half of the public float available for retail around 7 5MM shares According to Ortex there are about 3 5 3 7MM shares sold short Which means about 45 50 of the free float is shorted Also the days to cover at 4 79 and a cost to borrow rate of 3 45 amp x200B Ortex Data from last night https preview redd it

this stock and a reason why the shorts were able to clobber it was that there it is an extremely low volume stock Like 10 day average of 640K shares low Yesterday was about 350K It was so low that when I opened my position and used a market order and the stock moved a full percent with about 6000 shares purchase amp x200B Position opened yesterday afternoon https preview redd it fg4npmyfig471 png width 1110 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 7529bcd703ad0f386884a803d6468b909cf47123 A couple of months ago when I started to follow the stock the IV was over 100 Now it is around 70 Not the cheapest in the world but certainly not the most expensive Great story but whats the play I think if reddit took this stock seriously and purchase shares with a mix of options that the stock would explode There isn t enough actively traded stocks for the shorts to cover and they cant short the stock any more because there aren t any left for them to short I have 6000 shares which I purchased this yesterday afternoon see above The 6 18 60c could get really juicy if the stock can get any traction I think shares are the way to play this and you should only buy options if you are ok with setting your hard earned tendies on fire There is no volume on options which makes them risky Position 6000 shares and I will likely add more once I close my CLF Thanks

boring and you just don t know where to put your sweet tendie money FEAR NOT AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT JINKOSOLAR Disclaimer I am by no means a financial expert this is not financial advice and I once looked for my headphones while listening to music with them First things first What the fuck is a Jinko Only the biggest friggin Solarpanel manufacturer that s what At this very moment they supply THE WHOLE PLANET excluding Antarctica I think with TOP OF THE LINE SOLAR JUICE They are literally milking the sun Boring stuff first to get it over with Sure 1 Technical Analysis TA is like astrology for rational grownups it works until it doesn t Still we can deduce certain developments and in the end only need to trick the algos So here is a picture amp x200B https preview redd it 5cwojf3sug471 png width 1920 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 978b4f6e2b8c382247dacf8b28c37546e57f22b1 What is this shit and what does it mean The top picture shows the most recent downtrend WHICH JUST GOT FUCKING BROKEN and the still valid older downtrend from mid last year The top red line is the next target which would be 60 or almost 50 above current shareprice If this gets broken too there are clear skies ahead which is always good for solar The second picture is the MACD which means Macdonalds which basically means when the line moves from below the center to above the center it s a bullish signal Since this just seems to be occurring one could speculate that this will start a MASSIVE BONKERS BULLRUN The last picture is the RSI and I included it because it looks pretty Are you bored yet It gets worse before it gets better 2 THE NUMBERS MASON WHAT DO THEY MEAN Just looking at numbers alone won t give you a good indication if a stock is performing well is undervalued yada yada Nice boy that I am I compared some metrics between Jinko and competition for you in Excel like the fucking nerd I am amp x200B https preview redd it wzzipat5vg471 png width 500 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3c0cd1c824df9c9ccb8a5aa9274381fba9533f5b As you may have noticed Jinko ABSOLUTELY DESTROYS those 2 other guys in sales but is a LITTLE BITCH when it comes to profits and market cap Why is that am I retarded for recommending this bullshit to you Maybe Then again a closer look to the expenses reveal that most of the sales money goes to SG amp A which is just administrative overhang in a company think of salespeople the janitor the low level support who watches stocks all day on their phone Why do they have so much of these BECAUSE THEY ARE ON LITERALLY EVERY CONTINENT ON THE EARTH Seriously look it up Australia Middle East Asia Europe Africe both Americas They have locations everywhere And customers are pleased I ll tell you that You know who else expanded everywhere aggressively in their history It starts with A and ends with 1 day delivery The other problem is that Jinko relies heavily on materials for producing especially silicone I think you know that this shit is expensive right now So what do they do Like the GIGACHADS they are they are actively acquiring mining companies so they don t have to pay stupid premiums https preview redd it izpet1cdvg471 png width 500 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 066908e318a77a46a964cbb9a7326e7375321850 THEY ARE VALUED AT NOT EVEN HALF THEIR SALES YOU CAN T FIND THIS ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE SOLAR SECTOR 3 BULLCASE So what s next for Jinko why would the stock rise at all I already talked about expansion and being independent from material producers Let me tell you about something going on in the heart of europoor country Germany Chances are high that Die Gr nen which literally translates to The Greens a german political party which is all about protecting the environment will be elected into government this summer There are laws in the making which would force every homeowner to install solar panels on their roofs Why is this important for Jinko There are virtually no solar panel manufacturers left in Germany since the big solar bust some years ago so we are dependant on foreign goods on this one And since Jinko has the best performing modules and already has a strong presence and network in Europe they will get a big slice of that juicy cake Next let s look at their products the panels themselves AT THIS VERY MOMENT you can buy the world s 7 panel regarding efficiency at 20 2 for 0 76 W Compare that to 1 which has a measily 2 2 more efficiency for DOUBLE the price Are they stupid That s not all though Jinko recently achieved a whopping 25 25 efficiency on their upcoming product line You heard that right we can soon suck off daddy sun for 1 4th of his output Let s not forget sleepy joe on this one He promised a fat green deal I bet my left asscheeck that solar will be included They recently appointed a new CFO who himself has an extensive record in the solar industry He worked at Canadian Solar which is also a good stock to look at They did that to prepare for the STAR listing which is basically the NYSE in Shanghai Chinese people have very limited access to the stock markets now they can get in on this beautiful dragon 4 BEARCASE I am not here to deceive you precious donkeys No DD is complete without looking at the dark side There is obviously the CHYNA Factor at play here Go watch The China Hustle if you want to know why Wallstreet is shy when it comes to Chinese stocks It doesn t really apply to Jinko since they are not just a doghouse in the middle of nowhere valued at millions but psychology is a bitch Also trade wars cold wars hot wars world of warcraft is all on the table What troublesome times we live in Next is the issue with slave labour There are concerns that parts of the materials used are extracted in regions where the Uyghurs are abused and mistreated and possibly used as modern slaves I am not there and can neither verify or deny those claims but its good to keep in mind 5 SAY THE LINE BART I am hesitant to use it but it is what it is Guess who is short on the

alerted to WISH before this I had never heard of this company After skimming the latest 10 Q and 10 K I found no obvious red flags The company is generating decent Revenue 2 5B from latest 10 K and plowing it all into marketing and product development as per latest 10 Q Music to a growth investor s ears Considered that WISH IPO on December 16th 2020 and started to trade from 20 to an all time high of 32 85 February 1st 2021 Pulled the trigger on a small amount on 6 9 Stock dipped purchased some more Stock dipped purchased some more Repeated until full retard attrition mode reached Averaged priced 11 20 on 6 9 with ballz deep of shares That night started to dig deeper into the company Wish App Best analogy I could come up for the Wish iPhone mobile app is a cross between Amazon app with regards to experience and price levels and delivery times that of Alibaba Personally I use Amazon Prime for all online shopping Unless it s a hard to get item then I got to E Bay maybe Etsy or purchase directly from the vendor s site If I need volume I will use Alibaba but it s a f ing hassle to deal with import tax and delivery on heavy items I have yet to try Ali Express Because I have never heard of Wish until now I immediately installed the app and by the end of the night sent an invite code to 3 people and purchased roughly 184 of stuff I wanted to get The app has a nice flow and it upsells using promo codes and add hoc discounts Very addictive experience perfect for a retarded consumer such as myself That night I ended up with Green Point Laser that could start a fire 12 00

what its like ship cost 0 75 Polarized sun glasses gift at join ship cost 1 00 So now I wait for it all to arrive Some of the things are shipped from USA and labeled as such and many other things will take more time as they come from Gina et all similar to E Bay and Alibaba I was blown away at how cheap and easy it was to place the order Shipping didn t make sense for some of the things but the price offset that The feeling I had was similar to when I walked into a Walmart store for the first time The only thing nagging me is that most of the things I bought from Walmart either broke or I threw away so I have a full expectation of the same for the above mentioned products but this is not the point and I digress If the above items arrive as described Wish is my new go to online shopping Financial Consideration Amazon and Alibaba are obvious competitors Because Wish is relatively new it s not turning a profit However the steady Revenue and user base growth over compensates this in my opinion Based on https www businessofapps com data wish statistics https www businessofapps com data wish statistics I am expecting 2021 Revenue to be around 3 65B based on historic values amp x200B

generate So given my estimated revenue for 2021 of 3 65B and WISH s price of 10 79 as of 6 10 2021 it is roughly 2X 3X undervalued against the competitors Making Fair Value of the stock in my opinion 20 40 with market cap at around 30B 10B which aligns with original valuation the founders wanted and only half of what it IPO at https www businessinsider com wish ipo shopping app public filing covid

short term play Lennar, This is a freaking huge opportunity It is quite honestly ridiculous how undervalued this is after the dump it just had I even went to the SEC filings to see if it had any material statements that would cause it to tank so hard but there was only an 8 K filed 2 days ago as an update for Q2 earnings on July 28 that was extremely positive this is when the stock started to tank by the way This is the 9th Largest Homebuilder by the way It announced 15 Quarterly dividend for a 1 percent annual yield Continued expansion into the Dallas Fort Worth Market and the Louisville KY market which are growing areas That their revolving line of credit increased 140M to 800M That sustained demand supported by supply side constraints is enabling continued price increase and that 2Q absorptions are increasing 25 YoY to roughly 5 sales per community per month Entry level home buyers represent 80 percent of deliveries which is huge because this is most of their business Though they sell first and second move up buyer homes and lifestyle homes This is demographic as Millenials and the first of the Gen Z generation age up into their prime home buying years Over the next 5 year period millennials will continue to age into their prime home buying years and that dovetails with the 4M Home undersupply of homes combined with the 1 2M per year that will need to be built per year just to keep up with existing YoY demand Homebuying starts in March reached a bit over 1 7M homes seasonally adjusted which means only a 500K cut into that huge undersupply of homes Mortgage rates are still under 3 Timber prices have drastically declined though are still high since May 7th from 1670 to 1167 which is a 43 1 decline You can see timber stocks trending downward as futures decreased in a sort of simultaneous pattern They operate in 17 states and most of them are in high growth states There is a startling low available of resale homes and the inventory supply continues to decrease into 2021 I know this because I had been the one researching UWMC but it s backed up in the 8 K The US average is 2 months worth of supply but in the majority of the places where they operate it s below 1 and in a lot of cases below 7 They purchase lots to not get caught out and scale easily Their ROE in 2019 was 11 8 in 2019 highlighting how it is already a strong business 2020 was 17 6 and LTM Q1 2021 was 22 9 LTM income was 367 2M in 2021 and 206M in 2020 They have 45 in new contracts and the total lot supply increased 61 to nearly 58 000 lots Their gross margin expanded 340BPS to 21 1 in 2021 and they expect continued YoY margin expansion They have a backlog worth 1 58B HOMES ALONE 4097 Homes They ve had strong acquisitions and their financial services business lends to strong consumers with a 710 or 744 average FICO depending on the business Their homebuilding debt to net capital is 19 9 Their Book value per share has gone up 63 since 2017 to Q1 2021 and the book value per share is now 40 74 That s a price to book of 1 64 Their tangible price to book is 39 63 or a tangible price to book of 1 68 I know the tangible price to book is higher even though it s lower than P B but the SP is moving as I write this sorry Finally the only debt they have due is in 2025 and as of now their not using their line of credit EPS was 3 on a diluted basis for Q1 2021 alone on net income of 101M 2020 their EPS was 6 13 Diluted but they have gotten an EPS of 3 in the first quarter of 2021 alone They are set to demolish 2020 and even a very conservative EPS of 8 gives them an 8 34 EPS If timber futures continue to decrease and the margin continues to expand organically then the company is poised to blow an EPS FY of 8 by a not insignificant margin I would expect EPS of 10 12 which would give a forward p e ratio of 6 67 to 5 56 Alternatively if you want a short term play Lennar is attractively priced in the short term with a price to earnings ratio of 9 6 and it is down 2 35 today it was down more at 91 69 The 91 91 5 options for June 18th are juicy as you only need Lennar to go up 2 5 roughly to be in the money and the IV is low at 44 45 percent This is a pure earnings play as earnings are on the 16th You can either sell the IV runup or see if there is a spike at earnings The stock is down 4 6 in the last week and 12 93 in the last month nearly wiping out its 3 Month Gain Chart That means expectations are quite low even though CCS made a update saying things were going to be even better in Q2 than it was in Q1 Be aware of Theta Burn as it s 14 This is a risky play obviously a WSB With that said I m already up roughly 10 intraday My positions 5 July 18 91 dollar Contracts at 2 45 for Lennar 4 9 17 65 Call Contracts at 8 80 for CCS The Premium is high but I am accounting for the fact I want to see Earnings lmao if you want to try to find a bounce in the short term feel free to buy closer contracts and see if it bounces up due to being oversold 4 Shares Might buy more of CCS

is legit ,I ve been following since IPO and I m very familiar with how it trades I m not here to convince anybody to buy and I m not here to say other stocks suck Go ahead and promote your stock I don t give a shit I m simply stating what I believe is going to bare investors fruit soon Great part is you don t have to hold through all the bullshit manipulation to capitalize Before diving in to why I think RKT is a huge buy right now there s something that should be discussed before reading this All these meme stocks are posted when the stock is already up 50 Your chances of losing money is very high when you buy those levels The sub needs to understand how to buy low and sell high even though people pride themselves on losing money for some reason I don t think RKT is a meme stock to be honest and fuck that term Just because we do our diligence and like the stock doesn t mean it s a fucking meme stock I get that this is a Wendy s there are dumb asses but dummies can make money too I like the idea of buying hold and averaging down but yolloing OTM contracts on high volatility at all time highs it s just throwing your money in the garbage If you think that s cool then fine do what you want I don t give a shit but you re not helping anybody but hedge funds RKT is up 20 over the past two weeks There are a lot of retail investors that were ready to get out at 22 and a lot of swing traders just playing the gap fill The thing is those shares have been getting brought up The only reason the stock dropped as low as 16 is for two reasons one Gilbert transferred class D shares to class a shares for employee stock program at a 15 discount in order to increase the float and allow for more institutional ownership This actually really helps the stock Two Growth funds sold the stock and now value funds are eating it up This also includes a recent purchase from Swissbank The stock is trading differently and shorts are having a lot harder time manipulating it due to the institutional accumulation in the Russell 1000 and additional value funds You can check my previous DD s for sources and more info Right now the stock just filled the gap and hit a wall around 22 7 Institutions are letting retail buy and testing their patience Reason why institutions do this is because they need to determine whether there are real investors or just impatient little children that cry if a stock doesn t go up 50 in 1 hour Once they see where we are buying they won t allow people to accumulate very long at those levels What happens next is called a retest at 22 7 Since Its already been doing some consolidation at those levels it will most likely break and when it does break it will go to 25 If 25 creates a lot of volume and attention there are about 45 000 contracts for June 18 at 25 25 could be a huge wall of resistance but there could be a plan in place or this could just be a fake out before it actually takes off I believe the floor 18 5 or 19 5 so I would look to accumulate at now 19 5 and then load up at 18 8 with a stop loss of 16ish if you want I believe they would initiate the buyback before it gets back below 17 simply because employees get the stock at a 15 discount and Dan transferred shares at 16 8ish so I would assume the stock stays 15 above this level Now I wanna be very clear that this is not a fucking mortgage play Right now that is what the market wants retail to believe This is about a company I have previously worked for and I know firsthand that they achieve the goals set forth They have yet to prove otherwise Rocket homes is basically Zillow and their activity increased 300 in quarter one Additionally rocket auto drops this August I don t know about you but I don t get too thrilled going on to Carvana or Kelley blue book in order to find a car I talked to three different people before I actually get to the person that I want and then I have to find financing Rockets mission is to make this as easy as possible so you can go onto a very clean website pick a car you want they will do the financing for you and then provide you with the vehicle Won t be surprised if they shipped the shit right to you eventually Keep in mind that Detroit used to be the home of car manufacturing Didnt Gilbert basically owns Detroit after buying up all the real estate after 2008 and has been rebuilding it since It s a totally different city now I have recently been there One thing I really want to put emphasis on is the brand I wouldn t be surprised if you started to see rocket homes commercials and a rocket auto commercials before September They have also linked partnerships with golfers with big names and are using that for more marketing As of right now they have not even started marketing these aspects but trust me it would be insane to think that they won t make it work because if it s one thing they know how to do it s to market Everyone wants the next big thing you ll see commercials over and over again and eventually you ll actually see what rocket auto is about When you see the platform you will hands down choose it over any other bullshit website out there currently for cars On top of that they ll be the ones to provide you with the loan they ll be the ones to profit off the sale They don t need a financing company like typical dealerships when you buy a car They will fund it right to you Competing with Zillow is a bit more of a challenge but I still think they will prevail The company has a shitty PE ratio right now because it s still being valued as just a mortgage company Institutions however aren t stupid and know this will change once the sectors start being marketed You can see the price action right now is it institutional accumulation before they let retail pump it up If you think that institutions would start buying a stock based off of mortgage credentials in a rising rate environment then I don t know how you ll ever be convinced That is not what they re doing What I do know is that they probably believe that the amount of income they ll receive from their new revenue streams will certainly provide RKT the capital to obtain more market share in that field Which is lucrative Companies like Amazon wish they could get into mortgages Except it s very difficult field to just enter No one knows anything about mortgages except for people who do it Did you know that Lindsay gross gave a speech He was Dan Gilbert s roommate in college at law school He actually expressed Amazon had an interest in mortgages this is when the company was private After looking over all of the financials and complications they decided they wouldn t actually be able to be successful due to their business model RKT got lucky and was at the right place at the right time They merged technology with mortgages which is extremely profitable allowing for a constant stream of very high revenue thus creating easier means to market additional revenue streams as they plan on doing Position 2600 shares 17 86 and 100 40 89s for 2023 I also have additional calls but I don t really like giving that information out because I m a little paranoid about hedge funds reading this shit This is not advice I m just stating the facts If you re looking to enter a position I believe the stock will test 25 and possibly all time highs in the next few months I believe by 2023 it ll be over 150 a share I would buying share until iv dies down on options Another thing I want to mention is that leaps are crazy expensive right now I wonder why TLDR rocket auto and rocket homes are soon going to be a very well known products and institutions are starting to accumulate and take notice This is not a mortgage play this is a value play Don t ever listen to any articles to justify price action that s for the sheep It just makes sense All you have to do is accumulate for the next two weeks and I think you ll just see green moving forward Below 20 a share won t be seen after September ever again imo Edit typos

wrinkled brain ,Senseonics Holdings Inc is a medical technology company that develops and manufactures a unique implantable continuous glucose monitoring CGM system Its products include Eversense and Eversense XL which are implantable CGM systems to measure glucose levels in people with diabetes for a period of up to 90 and 180 days The Eversense 90 days has FDA approval since 2018 and the Eversense XL 180 days is already approved in Europe and FDA approval is expected by the end of the third quarter A CGM system provides glucose measurements regularly and gives the user an alarm when sugar levels drop too low or go too high it can also be used in connection with an insulin pump to automatically deliver insulin when needed Eversense technology is unique as it is a long term CGM system that can last up to 180 days versus 7 to 14 days from the competition and it is the only one implantable under the skin and works with a removable transmitter in competing products you cannot remove the transmitter otherwise you have to replace the whole device It is a CGM system that allows for freedom of movement and the user can decide when to use it and all this with even better accuracy than all other CGM systems in the market The almost demise of Senseonics in 2020 was due to some self inflicted errors and bad luck The company tried to commercialize Eversense on its own in the USA and that consumed much of its economic resources without much success and then when COVID hit the company stopped commercializing Eversense as it couldn t get physicians to perform the sensor implant procedure In March 2020 Senseonics was forced to make a 48 5 MM repayment to one of its lenders that panicked and that pushed the company into the limits of insolvency and forced it to look for a partner or outright sale Enter Ascensia Diabetes On August 10th 2020 the company announced a strategic collaboration with Ascensia Diabetes Care This is a transformational alliance for Senseonics as Ascensia is a dedicated diabetes company with a presence in 125 countries and 10 MM customers It has the trust and reliability of being in this business for over 70 years Ascensia is the market leader in the Blood Glucose Monitoring BGM market with its COUNTOUR portfolio of devices and it is the combination of several important companies with interests in the Diabetes market Ascensia is based in Switzerland and it was established in 2016 through the acquisition of Bayer Diabetes Care by PHC Holdings formerly known as Panasonic Healthcare Holdings which is a KKR portfolio company Ascensia Diabetes Care is betting big on Senseonics Not only are they providing 35 MM in convertible debt financing but will also invest an approximate 250 MM over the next five years to commercialize and market Eversense in exclusivity all over the world So why would such a company with approximately 1 Billion in annual sales is interested in a 4 MM revenue company I believe Ascensia recognizes the enormous potential of this technology which could eventually make redundant even their current business Ascensia business is CONTOUR a razor razor blade business model in which the company sells blood glucose measuring devices for a low price and makes money selling the small lancets that are replaceable Make a tour through Amazon or simply Google Blood glucose monitoring and you will find that this market is over saturated with dozens of suppliers competing in price Ascensia prices its wares at a premium over competitors but the technology is mature so I am not so sure if new diabetes clients will be choosing Contour going forward Basically they need a new product that can reinvigorate the brand and put them once again at the leading edge of the diabetes market Currently the Senseonics Eversense device requires calibration twice a day that could be done using a Contour device to measure the glucose level and input the result in the Eversense device via an iPhone or Android Phone But as the following slide shows the company has a product pipeline with next generation devices that will require increasingly less calibration The Eversense XL submitted for approval to the FDA requires only one calibration a day and the Eversense 365 will require only one rebalancing a week reducing considerably the use of lancets for blood monitoring systems The technology has huge potential to disrupt the current CGM market which is a 5 plus billion market today growing at about a 35 CAGR according to SENS management and dominated by three large companies DexCom DXCM Abbott Labs ABT and Medtronic MDT This market is exclusively focused on the Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients which are intensively managed that means they need insulin shots and many even use insulin pumps as they cannot produce any insulin themselves The number of people with diagnosed diabetes in the USA in 2020 was 34 2 of which 1 6 MM have Type I Diabetes unfortunately the number of people with Diabetes is growing very rapidly as can be seen from this National Diabetes Statistics Report 2020 With FDA approval for the Eversense XL expected by the end of the third quarter Senseonics will start to eat at the market share of the incumbent companies in the industry but the real game changer will come with the Eversense 365 as it will open up the Type II market to this new type of CGM devices Here the opportunity is really huge and they face no competition and none is expected anytime soon either Currently people with Type II diabetes have only BGM devices like CONTOUR to help them monitor their blood levels but that requires pricking a finger to get blood and only provides a measurement at that particular moment The 365 device will require only a 5 minute intervention every year to remove and replace the sensor and if the company gets to the point that won t need a transmitter as you scan your smartphone over the sensor then I believe the sky is the limit for Senseonics as there are 420 MM people with diabetes in the world The company is providing the current guidance as to future revenues I believe these numbers to be conservative once the Eversense XL gets approval in the USA I am confident it will be approved it has already been approved in Europe and the 90 days device was unanimously approved in 2018 by the FDA s Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices Panel of independent medical experts that voted 8 to 0 that the system not only was safe and effective but also that its benefits outweighed the risks Senseonics is a high risk high reward type of investment but the type of risk I like basically there is a small chance that the company will file for insolvency anytime soon and with the Ascencia alliance it stands a very good shot at disrupting the diabetes market In my opinion Senseonics has the makings of a potential multi bagger from here and aggressive investors would be advised to initiate a position at the current levels Next catalysts for the company will be information of progress in the commercialization in Europe and from April 1st in the USA then it will be the Eversense XL approval by the end of September

presents a promising future and attractive opportunity for investors given the energy transition the world is undergoing With CLNE S established brand and reputation in the renewable gas industry I believe they are well positioned to serve the growing demands for RNG Company Overview Clean Energy Fuels Corp NASDAQ CLNE https utradea com stocks CLNE provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and relating fueling solutions primarily in the United States and Canada The company supplies renewable natural gas RNG compressed natural gas CNG and liquified natural gas LNG for light medium and heavy duty vehicles They serve heavy duty trucking airports public transit industrial and institutional energy users as well as government fleets With over 20 years in the alternative fuels industry they are one of the largest if not largest U S providers of FNG for commercial transportation and have a unique position in the market because of their valuable Environmental Credits RNG which is delivered as either CNG or LNG is created by the recovery and processing of naturally occurring environmentally detrimental waste methane from non fossil fuel sources such as dairy farms and agriculture facilities Methane is one of the most potent climate harming greenhouse gases with a big impact on global warming 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide They are focused on developing owning and operating dairy and other livestock waste RNG projects and supplying RNG to their customers in the commercial transportation sector 2020 Financial Results Revenue CLNE s 2020 total revenue was 209 2M which had a YoY change from 2019 of 15 2 or a decrease of 52 3M This decrease was primarily due to lower volume related sales but partially offset by customer contracts with their Zero Now truck financing program and an increase in station construction sales Of the total revenue in 2020 84 1 was from volume related revenue mostly from fuel sales and the performance of O amp M services Despite 2020 s bad financial performance attributable to economic conditions we also saw similar companies in the industry posting decreased revenues CLNE is positioned for high revenues with the upcoming ventures and new developments that will allow the company to expand and meet the growing demand in the transportation sector Expenses Total cost of sales accounted for 63 5 of total revenue 55 4 from product cost of sales and 8 1 from service cost of sales The total cost of sales decreased by 12 6 or 26 7M YoY primarily due to decreased gallons delivered during 2020 and their lower effective cost per gallon The total operating expenses also decreased but attributable to decreased revenues In the prior year 2018 to 2019 we saw decreased operating expenses and increased operating margin which was due to cost reduction efforts Going forward if CLNE is able to continue decreasing their operating expenses and keep at a positive operating margin then they ll be able to post a profitable period in the upcoming years that ll help with seeing shareholder returns Debt CLNE has a short term debt of 3 59M and long term debt of 82 09M of totalling 85 68M making up 44 6 of their total liabilities They have a debt ratio of 0 27 which is relatively low compared to the competitors identified that have an average of 0 68 representing CLNE s lower debt to assets Despite the capital intensive industry CLNE is operating in their lower ratio is primarily attributed to their high cash position The lower ratio also gives insight into the company s ability to pay off their future debts and their lower risk for bankruptcy Recent Developments Amazon It was announced in April this year that CLNE signed an agreement with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon RNG The fuel will be provided at 27 existing CLNE fuelling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations that expects to be constructed by the end of the year This agreement was announced after Amazon s action earlier this year to reduce the carbon footprint of their delivery fleets Bp Joint Venture A joint venture was finalized in March this year with BP Products North America Inc to develop own and operate new RNG projects at dairies and other agriculture facilities This joint venture is valued at upwards of 400M with BP investing a total of 50M This joint venture will help to RNG production and meet the growing demand Chevron Adopt a Port Chevron U S A a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corp is investing a total of 28M into this initiative that focuses on providing truck operators near ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach with cleaner carbon negative RNG in order to reduce GHG emissions Chevron s funding will allow truck operators to subsidize the cost of buying new or converting RNG powered trucks Investment Thesis Growing Demand for RNG The demand for RNG produced from biogas is significantly growing due to federal state and local regulatory authorities on reducing the emission of GHG such as methane Over the past decade the transportation sector has been the fastest growing end market for RNG where it s used as a replacement for fossil based fuel This growth is mainly driven by an increased focus on reducing GHGs across America and worldwide With any car truck bus or any other vehicle capable of being manufactured to run on RNG the shift to RNG is imminent In the U S renewable energy growth is expected to accelerate in 2021 and forward as the Biden administration starts to execute many initiatives including Rejoining the Paris Climate Accord Investing 2T into clean energy over the next 4 years Fully decarbonizing the power sector by 2035 in order to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 Renewable natural gas production has already more than doubled from 2015 to 2018 growing by an annual average of 30 If the industry continues to grow at this rate of growth we can expect that the industry would reach 1B gallons of the annual production of RNG transportation fuel in 2022 Final Thoughts With CLNE being the biggest producer of RNG in the U S and the increased demand for RNG set to accelerate as stricter restrictions come into place we will see a shift in the transportation industry into cleaner fuel sources The company is well positioned in the RNG industry to continue being a leading provider and deliver attractive returns for shareholders in the future to come Going forward I hope to see more news on developments with bigger corporations looking to hop on the RNG wave I think it is only soon until cities regulate the use of RNG in more commercial use transport like public transport and we see the shift to decarbonized transport Sources 1 https www fool com investing 2021 04 19 clean energy fuels and

https investors biogen com static files 8e58afa4 ba37 4250 9a78 2ecfb63b1dcb Both trials were stopped at the halfway point after preliminary analysis found that they were unlikely to show efficacy Instead of rejecting the drug the FDA stepped in with Biogen to salvage the trials As more details about Aducanumab came out following approval the noise surrounding this decision only grew News of the 56000 a year price tag on Aducanumab 5 https thehill com policy healthcare 557206 biogen ceo says 56k a year for new alzheimers drug is a fair price hit the Reddit front page and if you d take a gander at any of the comment sections discussing Aducanumab you ll see a range of responses including this one from r medicine gt FDA granted approval to aducanumab on the basis of the reduction of beta amyloid NOT for the slowing of cognitive decline in patients This is frankly a troubling shift away from clinical efficacy and towards biomarker endpoints which we don t even know if the beta amyloid hypothesis is correct Everyone is now going to be burdened with the cost except Biogen and Biogen investors to test whether or not the amyloid hypothesis is correct and this one from r
