gentlemen greetings to you all The year 2021 is arriving From China s capital Beijing I extend my New Year wishes to you all 2020 was an extraordinary year Facing the sudden coronavirus pandemic we put people and their lives first to interpret the great love among humans With solidarity and resilience we wrote the epic of our fight against the pandemic During the days when we addressed the hardships together we saw the heroic spirit of marching straight to the frontlines holding posts with tenacity taking responsibility to get through thick and thin sacrifices with bravery and touching moments of helping each other From medical workers to the people s army from scientific researchers to community workers from volunteers to those who built the projects from seniors to youths born after the 1990s and 2000s numerous people fulfilled their missions at the cost of their lives and protected humanity with sincere love They pooled their drops of strength into tremendous power and built an iron wall to safeguard lives Many figures marched ahead without hesitation many relays were accomplished hand in hand many scenes showed touching moments all these vividly illustrate the great spirit of fighting against the pandemic Greatness is forged in the ordinary Heroes come from the people Every person is remarkable Our sympathy goes to all the unfortunate ones infected with the coronavirus We salute all the ordinary heroes I am proud of our great motherland and people as well as the unyielding national spirit Only in hard times can courage and perseverance be manifested Only after polishing can a piece of jade be finer We overcame the impact of the pandemic and made great achievements in coordinating prevention and control and in economic and social development The 13th Five Year Plan has been accomplished in full The 14th Five Year Plan is being comprehensively formulated We are accelerating the pace to set up a new pattern for development and are deeply implementing high quality development China is the first major economy worldwide to achieve positive growth and its GDP in 2020 is expected to step up to a new level of 100 trillion yuan China has seen a good harvest in grain production for 17 years in a row China has seen breakthroughs in scientific explorations like the Tianwen 1 Mars mission Chang e 5 lunar probe and Fendouzhe deep sea manned submersible Construction of the Hainan Free Trade Port is proceeding with vigor We also defeated severe flooding With the military and civilians heedless of danger and difficulty and standing in unity we managed to minimize the damage of the floods I inspected 13 provincial level regions and was glad to see people carefully implementing coronavirus prevention and control measures racing against time to resume work and production and sparing no efforts to advance innovation Everywhere were vibrant scenes of confident resilient people making the most of every minute In 2020 China made the historic achievement of establishing a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieved decisive success in eradicating extreme poverty We launched the final assault on the fortress of entrenched rural poverty and cracked this hardest nut Through 8 years under the current standard China has eradicated extreme poverty for the nearly 100 million rural people affected and all the 832 impoverished counties have shaken off poverty These years I have visited 14 contiguous areas of dire poverty The unremitting efforts of the folks and the wholehearted contribution of the poverty eradication cadres often come to my mind We still need to stay tenacious like a bamboo deeply rooted in the rocks keep our feet on the ground and work hard to paint a magnificent picture of rural vitalization and steadily march ahead towards the goal of common prosperity This year we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone among others and 30 years of the development and opening up of Pudong in Shanghai As I stood on the southern coast as the spring tide surged and on the colorful bank of the Huangpu River my mind was filled with a myriad of thoughts Pilot trials have become models and leading forces and explorations to innovate have become leading forces of innovation The opening up and reform has created miracles of development In the future we should further deepen reform and expand opening up with greater courage and create more Stories of Spring We are not alone on the Great Way and the whole world is one family After a year of hardship we can understand more than ever the significance of a community with a shared future for mankind I had many phone calls with friends from the international community both old and new and attended many cloud conferences What we discussed most was staying united to combat the pandemic We still have a long way to go in pandemic prevention and control People from all over the world should join hands and support each other to early dispel the gloom of the pandemic and strive for a better Earth home 2021 will see the 100th birthday of the Communist Party of China Its 100 year journey surges forward with great momentum Its original aspiration remains even firmer one hundred years later From Shikumen in Shanghai to the South Lake in Jiaxing City the small red boat where the first CPC congress concluded bore the great trust of the people and the hope of the nation The boat has sailed through turbulent rivers and treacherous shoals and has voyaged across violent tidal waves becoming a great ship that navigates China s stable and long term development The CPC bears its eternal great cause in mind and the centenary only ushers in the prime of life We adhere to putting people at the center stay true to our original aspiration keep our mission well in mind break the waves and sail out for our journey ahead and we will certainly realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation At the historic crossroad of the Two Centenary Goals the new journey of comprehensively building a modern socialist country is about to start The road ahead is long striving is the only way forward We have strived broken through brambles and thorns and crossed ten thousand rivers and thousands of mountains We will continue to strive march ahead with courage and create brighter glory At just this moment the festive lanterns have been lit and family members gather for reunion The New Year is coming I wish our land to be splendid our country to be prosperous and our people to live in peace I wish you all a harmonious smooth and auspicious year full of happiness Thank you

which was mainly a preface foreplay to this The idea was to be able to finish it all in one go but I ran out of my supply All jokes aside life came up and I thought I could finish it rather soon but that didn t happen Many of you have an attention span that is longer than you could last in bed so I ll just spill the DD here I highly encourage you to go back to that post because I m trying to coordinate and a make a push for charities donation ideas and creating a social media push trend to not only round up undiagnosed Autists out there but to also to send batman signals to TheDogFather Ryan Cohen The best news can be slaughtered by poor presentation I have doubts with Sherman up there perhaps they ll use someone effective DD points 1 GME is making a bigger push to becoming PC oriented not just games and accessories but parts as well 2 The reason Sherman was able to qualify GME as essential business was because of the few PC stuff they had Then they sold out of that PC stuff in March and after that they were basically open because of PC qualification despite not having any PC items By switching to technology category Sherman would have to qualify them into that The way he has been able to do so is for 2 reasons A To ensure that they ll stay open in similar lockdowns This will probably not be mentioned but the dude did push for his stores to remain open and got backlash for it Already tarnished a damaged image B Change business model and get in that Tech Train 3 OmniChannel experience 4 GME has signed contracts with about 6 vendors and providers a couple which were just recently That number was a ball park off the top of their mind These include MSI NewEgg and so on 5 You will be able to outright buy gaming PCs in stores and or just order any part you may need They ve ran small trials for these and plan on rolling it out to stores at different times Unfortunately not every store will have the same experience products based on demographic size but they should still be able to order and ship to home or store pick up 6 Stores will have dedicated areas for PC experience Ok let s be realistic most stores are the size a studio so the PC area will be a house for ants But if you check out local GME stores and see empty display areas locked glass with nothing in it this is where it is probably going to be dedicated 7 Even if you buy 10 card with 5 certificate you re not hurting GME All those cards have been paid for before they got on the wall You re helping money come back plus the goal is that people will spend more money The goal from my 1st post with push of pro memberships wasn t to rely on the 15 or 20 and have that as the savior The idea is that with more memberships you have more leads and you have people who are more likely to buy products from you You ve now successfully pried someone from going a bigger retailer or online merchant 8 Buy memberships for other people You can also buy memberships for business such as daycare hospitals etc At the very least they can have a physical magazine delivered on a monthly basis 20 version even if they never choose to use certificates 9 Pro Rewards digital gamers benefit hugely Remember those PSN Steam etc cards there is 40pts for every dollar spent on those as opposed to 20 pts on everything else Why does this matter Faster points to redeem certificates for yourself or charities already affiliated with GME Every 5k can be redeemed for 5 certificate or donated to charities If you just recently signed up you got 10K points already plus welcome 5 coupon Your 1st official 5 certificate will be available 1st of each month so you may have up 20 available pretty soon 10 GME now offers their own CC which is available to use the same day They also offer flex pay options from 2 different vendors who allow you to qualify from your phone and make payments GME isn t taking this risk they get paid from the vendors customer pays the vendor They also have a rent to own program with minimum of 120 Final points Most customers are buying for other people that isn t going to change So while e commerce is huge some Karens will always need to show up to store But GME sells used games for nearly same price as new or more expensive than new games They don t make this decision they sign contracts that can t reduce price on these games until x amount of time But GME barely offers any for my product Hi there they are a business the most important thing for a business is to be in profit How long 1 minute is depends on which side of the bathroom door you re on Let s talk a quick lesson of value vs worth Your PSP might be worth 100 to you but it only has a a value of 5 to GME Why Because for every 1 person that comes in looking for a PSP they have 15 others trying to trade in After they reach their limit of trade in wtf are they going to do Collect every PSP at the price you want them to So that s part of why you get offered low prices There s other things involved They have bills to pay electricity rent wages medical benefits legal fees alarm security maintenance on commercial grade AC ventilation and many more Oh yea they also provide people with a safe place to trade in without risking getting robbed shot or killed When any business closes it s not just those employees who lose their job The services that that business relies on mentioned above now lose a customer and revenue as well There is less stores for that AC company to send people out to which means less money for them which leads to more lost jobs And you know what caused it That lazy bum who chose the comfort of purchasing from home from an online merchant etc There s much more to this and this is just the tip of the iceberg when people choose how you do business and shop There s pros and cons to everything I m not saying never order online but try to keep a balance Support your local businesses when you can TL DR ICE changed to Tech because they are changing their ways and going more PC oriented They ve signed contracts with vendors and providers More focus to PC gaming include actual gaming computers and parts that can be ordered Don t forget the hashtags when

understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just cloud and software and why Salesforce will become like SAP The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies First you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP What the fuck is ERP you might ask ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees Basically companies don t want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them Where s the problem you might ask Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP it s difficult to understand what the experience is like amp x200B https preview redd it htsfvr8uro861 png width 500 amp format png amp auto webp amp s db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd Basically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks The issue is when one of these companies want to customize the software https en wikipedia org wiki Enterprise resource planning Disadvantages to meet unique demands for the company This re engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money Interestingly enough you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they re unhappy even though they use their software So what you might ask wouldn t SAP still be generating tons of revenue Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution amp x200B https preview redd it ugj07ez0to861 png width 984 amp format png amp auto webp amp s c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20 Let s look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops Around May to August their stock price went up 60 do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems By looking at their past quarters you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP s clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to modern cloud technologies https en wikipedia org wiki SAP Corporate restructuring Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things Now the important part What the fuck does SAP s troubles have to do with Salesforce As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management CRM https en wikipedia org wiki Customer relationship management is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions As you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent For example many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end user adoption rates https en wikipedia org wiki Customer relationship management Criticism Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients customization becomes complicated and prices become costly These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time planning and money Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability Another big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data This can help build a better relationship with the customer Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020 Furthermore Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with recent acquisitions https en wikipedia org wiki Salesforce Similar to SAP I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better Business will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions So how can we use this information to print tendies The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP amp x200B https preview redd it vl629rb14p861 png width 927 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5 Basically the idea is to try and play puts especially around earnings If Salesforce misses their guidance then it could the stock in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype The next earnings will be early March You can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly amp x200B tldr buy puts in march amp x200B Disclosure long on GME

309,kobcex,t2_40dz0l7,1609508025,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kobcex/the_tsla_2021_trade_plan/,1,The TSLA 2021 Trade Plan, TLDR Tesla enters 2021 with huge tailwinds Bullish for the first half of the year More caution in the second half as competing EV products start entering the market at an accelerating pace Biggest risk is the market discounting the effect of strong EV competition starting in 2021 Avoid shorting TSLA The 2021 TSLA trade plan What moves the stock Knowing that TSLA is decoupled from its business metrics an inquisitive investor will wonder what drives the stock s price The answer is partially uncovered by understanding who owns the stock According to Macroaxis com as of December 30th Institutions own 42 52 of Tesla s stock the Public i e Retail Investors owns 37 46 and Insiders own 20 02 gt Institutional investors aren t selling TSLA s institutional investor base consists of large passive funds such as funds tracking the S amp P500 which recently added TSLA to more active hedge funds specializing in innovation and growth Passive funds increase the buying pressure of TSLA while adding minimal selling pressure Today the majority of the workforce regularly contributes their salary to passive funds for retirement and said funds are unlikely to trim their holdings of a stock unless during an infrequent rebalancing event The active funds that remain invested in TSLA tend to have celestial expectations for the company and are also unlikely to sell at this valuation For example billionaire fund manager Ron Baron believes that Tesla currently at a 659 billion market cap should be a 2 trillion dollar company Another major fund manager Cathie Wood gives TSLA a 2024 price target of 7 000 Assuming minimal changes in total float that equates to almost a 7 trillion dollar market cap So TSLA s institutional investor base are hardly sellers of TSLA and still believe there is significant room for the stock to run despite its incredible 2020 performance gt Retail investors aren t selling What about TSLA s retail investor base This question is easily answered Over the years TSLA has built a diehard fanbase that has equally high if not higher expectations of the company than some of the institutional investors Some people believe the company s CEO Elon Musk has developed a cult of personality Tesla s cult like fanbase manifests online as a large number of YouTube channels and online forums dedicated to the company and in a broader sense Elon Musk For example the main Tesla subreddit r teslamotors has more than 901 000 subscribers at the time of writing gt Insiders aren t selling Of the remaining 20 of TSLA stock the majority is held by Elon Musk and he s certainly not eager to sell noticeable quantities of his holdings given the ensuing bad PR So if investors are hesitant to sell TSLA TSLA is bound to appreciate aggressively every time there s good news and appreciate slowly in the absence of news as passive funds and its ardent fanbase continue to buy in In other words TSLA is a heavily news driven stock with a heavy bias for upside This is exactly what we saw in 2020 TSLA entered the year having solved its Model 3 production problems while managing to maintain solvent This act alone unceremoniously discarded a dark cloud over the company on whether it ll manage to produce cars at scale before its heavy debt burden catches up with the company s treasury With that the path was clear for a string of good news to catapult the stock to grandiose heights They included the opening of the Shanghai factory the 5 for 1 stock split the S amp P500 inclusion and record sales and deliveries in the third quarter Even good news from the tangentially related company SpaceX who Elon Musk is also the CEO of has been positive for TSLA The Plan and Headwinds Tesla will enter 2021 with boosted by tailwinds from its 2020 success If Tesla maintains its current pace of execution ceteris paribus fancy business major speak for all other things being equal its stock price is expected to continue to appreciate and befuddle its critics Tesla is finally able to produce Model 3 s at scale has a foothold in the Chinese market and is readying to launch the Cybertruck to a red hot North American pickup truck market In addition like Pavlov s dogs 2020 has conditioned investors to not bet against TSLA with the stock shrugging off multiple negative news events like the COVID 19 pandemic the expected post S amp P500 inclusion sell off which never happened and the Apple EV announcement In 2021 it s recommended to continue to avoid shorting Tesla no matter how tempting With that said there are significant headwinds facing Tesla that any long positions should be aware of Tesla currently has an 81 66 market share of the US EV market The biggest risk going into 2021 and beyond is the significant ramp up in EV and battery technology competition from legacy auto manufacturers Tesla s stock price has only emboldened the executive teams of these companies to pour significant resources into their EV businesses GM Volkswagen and Ford are leading the pack GM has invested 27 billion into its EV business and is planning to launch 30 EVs by 2025 Two EVs have already been announced the Cadillac Lyriq and the Hummer EV with both receiving an overwhelmingly positive public response GM has also developed an in house battery technology called Ultium that s the central pillar for its 2025 plan A step above GM Volkswagen is investing 41 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 70 EVs by 2030 It s also aggressively investing in battery technology For example Volkswagen has a large stake in QuantumScape a company that claims to be developing a revolutionary solid state battery technology Last but not least Ford is investing 11 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 40 EVs by 2022 Deliveries of its flagship EV the well received Mustang Mach E is already underway An honorable mention goes to Apple which plans to start production of its own EV in 2024 If TSLA is a news driven stock a growing string of negative news about the company s shrinking North American and European market share should apply downward pressure on price The worry is that investors are so exuberant about the stock s stellar 2020 performance that the effects of emergent serious competition from legacy auto manufacturers are heavily discounted In 2021 although it remains very bullish for TSLA going into the first half of the year it s recommended to avoid aggressively starting or adding more to an existing position in the latter half of the year This is when the rate of competing EV products entering the North American and European markets is expected to accelerate Prudent investors should watch how the public reacts to this large structural EV market change before making any moves I wrote about stock market DD here FinanceTLDR blog https www financetldr com

Current ROI 0 Projected ROI 0 Trades pending Processing img yl4zjvw9wq861 Introduction Happy New Year TL DR I am going to double a small account over a year and you are going to watch Three months ago I wrote up a guide on consistently outperforming the S amp P500 using Theta Gang strategy That guide got a lot of positive feedback and I suggest those who missed it take a look How to CONSISTENTLY Outperform the S amp P500 using Theta Gang Strategy A Comprehensive Guide to Wheeling ETFs https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments iz68r4 how to consistently outperform the sp500 using And if you are truly retarded check out my recent Tips for Noobies Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments k4ztif top 5 tips every noobie trader must know I ve since decided to put my skills to the test and will attempt to double a small 8000 account by the end of 2021 using similar strategies This will mostly be an educational experience and I will walk you through all my thought processes and my trades as I make them so hopefully the retards among you can learn a thing or two And if I blow up the account that will be entertaining as well right Some of the less experienced among you may think this is a simple feat The more experienced among you will know achieving such consistently high returns will be an incredibly difficult feat I put my odds of success somewhere around 20 to be honest But it will be a good education for both of us Really I only need to achieve around 6 return every month to break 100 by the end of the year after compounding and put in those terms the task doesn t sound so daunting does it Still I will be forced to make some very aggressive downright risky plays in order to make this remotely possible If my wheeling ETF guide was about a safe conservative strategy this guide will be the opposite Keep that in mind if you are foolish enough to copy my trades Wish me luck I will need it Basic Strategy I will not leave any tool off the table here If I see an opportunity I will take it But for the majority of my trades I will be using a very simple strategy Find high implied volatility stonks and sell options on them I will typically be selling cash secured puts since naked calls carry excess risk which means I want to look for stocks I am generally bullish on long term Using ToS I ve set up some very basic filters to scan for promising stocks to trade 1 Option Implied Volatility gt 80 for tendies 2 Stock Volume gt 5 000 000 for liquidity 3 Market Cap gt 1B to comply with WSB rules 4 Stock Price lt 82 collateral maximum Scanning with these filters brings up a lot of familiar names GME PLTR QS NKLA LAZR FCEL UVXY ACB XPEV SPCE and so on In other words the type of stonks retards like you are buying expensive options on Running the Numbers I will try to not get too technical and into the weeds with this experiment I ll be using some very basic math to decide which options to sell I highly recommend you play around with the numbers on options to really get an intuitive feel for how they work For example if I were to ask you what happens to the relative cost of premium day as DTE increases on an option what would be your answer If you don t know just run some simple numbers to find out SPY premium DTE day 332 5 66 4 440 10 44 652 21 31 1915 140 13 7 As you can see premium cost per day decreases as time till expiration increases It s more complicated than that of course but we are keeping it simple here For that reason I will be doing something I generally don t advocate Selling weeklies to squeeze a bit of extra juice out of my options This also means I will be holding them all to expiration to deal with issues like higher gamma Here is another simple equation I can use to give me a lot of information Premium 365 DTE Strike Max ROI Basically what I m doing is estimating the returns from selling the same option for an entire year with a 100 success rate Since I m aiming for 100 ROI any options I sell will need to be over 100 in this formula Of course I won t have a 100 success rate on my trades so I should probably aim even higher to give myself some buffer maybe around 120 Let s try it on some ATM options to get a relative comparison of option value SPY 12 2 PSTH 48 1 GME 140 5 PLTR 111 1 QS 263 7 UVXY 134 2 Don t put too much stock in these numbers I m just using them as a simple comparative tool for judging the profitability of different options We can glean even more information from the above number if we multiply it by the Prob ITM of course to get something closer to an Expected Value for an option which I will perhaps go into more detail on next month Finally I ll be throwing around various other calculations as I go day ROI month premium collateral and so on I will need to watch all of these and more to reach my goal My First Trade Looking at the stocks in my filter there are two that really stand out to me GME and PLTR That s right everyones favorite meme stocks GameStop is interesting as a short term play and has very high IV But I m not confident in the company as a long term play and would hate to be assigned hundreds of shares of that shitty brick and mortar hellscape Palantir on the other hand has serious growth potential long term and I would not mind being assigned It has also been hit hard recently and is at a more reasonable entry level which also makes it a good choice Therefore I will be trading PLTR as my first play I want to sell an OTM put to give myself some downside protection against a further drop but not so far OTM that I can t break my 100 ROI goal Let s plug some of the Jan 15 options into my formula above to get a breakdown of the potential ROI 21 strike 74 2 22 strike 108 4 22 5 strike 131 9 23 strike 155 5 Either the 22 or 22 5 strikes are right near the sweet spot we are looking for in terms of return Of course conditions will likely change on Monday and I may need to reassess but at the moment my current play seems to be Sell to Open 3 contracts of PLTR 22p 1 15 If Monday opens red it will be even better for us since we get in at a cheaper price with likely higher IV on top So I for one am praying for a bloody Monday for Palantir sorry bagholders Of course after selling 3 contracts at 22 strike we will only have used 6600 of our 8000 capital I may need to look for one more smallish trade on a stock in the 14 range to take full advantage of our capital If GME drops on Monday we could consider a far OTM play there for instance amp x200B TL DR I am going to double a small account and you are going to watch I will update this post as plays are made and will create a new post each month as a recap As always questions are welcome
