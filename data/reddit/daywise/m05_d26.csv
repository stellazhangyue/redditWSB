not take anything I say as investment advice I m definitely not your financial advisor and you should always do your own research Past performance of a stock does not predict future performance You should ALWAYS consult a grown up before spending any of your money Everything in this text is purely theoretical We are not a collective group of people You are alone responsible for what you spend your hard earned tendies on YOU are the catalyst we were always praying for and have always been Warning this made my emotional lil bitch cry because this could really be the greatest transfer of wealth in history And why FOMO buyers will just act as our thrusters flying past the bloody moon and beyond I do recommend puttin on this absolutely amazeballs song for a fully 7d experience https youtu be 2j 4wVkaIB8 Disclaimer I just like the stock PS I truly hope I will be able to truly communicate how beautiful the impact of just liking a stock can have on the greatest 180 in history We are the whale we thought we needed Hi Thank you for reading this far Thank you for trusting me on the promise of helping you to grow a wrinkle with a 50 50 mix of jacked titius and confirmation bias DNA I don t really know how anything in the real world work tho So you are a ape who likes a certain stock Welcome to the 300k strong home where research of this stock is debated DDs on how it might act in the future A common thesis on this sub has been that there have been some fuckery on the stock market and somehow more shares than actually exists have been sold But being the dumb money irrational retail investor that you are you might or might not now that the stock market is a zero sum game One might now that the person selling the stock believes that the value of the stock is equal to the price they sell it for While the buyer believes that the price of the stock is will actually be greater in the future Meaning that this ape can get this stock at a discount This ape might have exchanged a share of his life for some bananas Exchanging his time knowledge and skills and transforming that into bananas that he can spend on things this ape like This is economics 101 The average ape thinking like this might decide that he is willing to bet on average 100 on this outcome a month A few people here might earn way more than others But if you are living paycheck to paycheck the rewards should be proportional to your cost of living either way This ape might also be so wrinkly and wise that he knows that infact this investment isn t into a dying brick and mortar store Despite what the MSM have been preaching for the last few months Because dumb retail investors have not access to the resources that smart money have Because smart money believes that this stock is actually overvalued and should go down They believe it so much that they might infact be betting more than they what they have on hand on it every day The dumb ape might infact have some more bananas over for leisure spending at the end of each month Being such a dumb ape he knows from Warren Buffet that spending money on a product you are a shareholder in isn t market manipulation and does infact might give a boost to the companies earnings number And infact the average ape might reward him or herself with 20 dollars of spending at his new favourite store Many apes don t have access to this store at the moment but lets say that the average wise ape have the brain wrinkle count that when he she wants a gopro instead of buying it at another store he can just order it from his favourite store This ape gets super excited when he sees his item being delivered faster than any other place while also knowing deep inside his her head that at the absolute minimum 5 of this banana spent goes to the pocket of the company he is a owner of That is adding 5 to the bottom line of a company this ape is a proud owner off This dumb ape knows if more and more people starts agreeing that this business isn t in fact dying but it s actually growing at an insane pace Which this dumb ape knows would only add to the demand of his golden tickets With his basic understanding of supply and demand for a finite product He thinks that this only makes the odds of his bet paying off 300k apes that likes the stock enough to spend 100 a month that the price goes up is 360m money betting that the price goes up It is also 6m spent in his favourite store which is 300k in pure profit in the store he believes will grow in the future That 300k isn t wasted but is used to find more items and ways to turn a profit for gamestop The average ape might like his investment strategy that he explains his reasoning and the amazing service to 0 1 of his hers ape buddy That is 30k more people that decides that 100 on this investment seems wise And soon all the people might realise that this is actually a gold nugget in the making and it might actually be a wise investment decision after all Making this a self fulfilling prophecy It was even written in the sky tonight A bloody full moon what more confirmation bias do you need 360m might not be seen as a lot but I m really doing some bare bone calculations here and that is 1 8m shares being locked up a year at 200 a share That is 20 of a Ryan Coan or 2 5 of the total amount of shares in existence Every day that goes by more and more people will see that this might actually not be a bad investment I evolved from an X holder in January to a XX holder now and when Gamestop opens back up in my country I will for sure spend my bananas there How many people are there actually out there with the same belief than me Thank you for reading My tits are for sure jacked and my hands are made out of diamonds The educational value here has for sure made my smooth brain turn a little more wrinkly so I will always consider myself in the green I might even decide to retire some of the shares I ve bought since I know the extra wrinkles on my smooth brain will give me ROI for life Which might raise the floor for some less fortunate souls How much money does people actually spend for education A share seems like fine tuition

was fortunate enough to meet with Abel Avellan along with other investors recently I wanted to share my notes with the reddit community to help clear up a lot of confusion and misinformation out there Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor do your own due diligence amp x200B BlueWalker 3 Deployment BlueWalker 3 will have the full technology stack implemented 10 meters x 10 meters array and has ability to connect directly to handset and provide streaming voice data Have tested apps on core networks of Vodafone AT amp T Rakuten and some other telcos in Africa Have interconnectivity with telcos setup and ready for launch Using two vendors one is Rakuten s Altiostar that is the interface with the carrier s network Designed service so AST doesn t need to modify current mobile phone in any way After you get a text message to opt in your phone takes over and you won t know if you are connected to a satellite or a tower BlueWalker 3 is 1 5 ton satellite the size of a pickup truck Will be launched this year from Kazakhstan The profile of the satellite is very thin like a table and built in modules The deployment of BlueWalker 3 is the final production of all the development that has gone into the technology After the successful launch we will go immediately into producing 20 satellites for first phase of launch The biggest risk I put in context this way Connecting to a phone from a satellite is nothing new This has happened for 25 years Satellite phones are bulky and proprietary The premise of what we do is that EVERY phone today is part of our market Satellite phone is 1 watt of power and 3DBI of gain and bulky An iPhone today is 0 25 watt of power and DBI of gain Difference is the satellite phones connect to a satellite that is a couple hundred kilograms whereas our satellites are 1 5 2 tons and have all the power and gain to connect to a regular handset The satellite will fly at 600 kilometers The full production satellite will be larger 20 meters x 20 meters array and will be a little bit heavier Building satellite with modules called microns which are elements that form the phase array Built the tech ourselves in Israel but will be outsourcing future production to NEC in Japan but all the tech is our IP and the final production and assembly will be done in Midland TX Utilizing Wireless Carrier Partner s Spectrum We will be using lowband midband and c band We have the ability to tune into any cellular spectrum 700 950mhz 1700 2200mhz and C Band Our ability to utilize a carrier s spectrum is software defined so we can tune per beam per cell into multiple different bands So we have total flexibility We don t own the spectrum we partner with AT amp T Vodafone Telefonica American Movil etc to use their spectrum where it isn t lit up used and then interconnect that spectrum to our gateways via B Band 45Ghz satellite backhaul You have a field of view which is the area a satellite can see which is 2 800 kilometers not sure if this is the right number within each of the field of view you have cells which is the equivalent to a tower So for a satellite you can have 2 800 cells in low band and 10 000 cells in midband All these cells are in the frequencies that are native to current mobile phones We don t want to modify current phones We want users to be able to access SpaceMobile from responding to a text message All the native cellular spectrum is used which then gets translated to the B Band spectrum down to the gateway where we have eNodeB and rack of equipment that then connect to the carrier s network In the US we only need 2 gateways but we will be using 3 gateways in carrier neutral locations of American Tower 1 East Coast 1 in Midland and 1 in Hawaii Mobile Users Covered by a Cell Depends on what spectrum is being used but it s between 300 10 000 users based on how much overbooking you are putting on the spectrum and what packages you are offering Roughly per satellite we can produce 1 6 million gigabytes per month If you were to allocate 1 gigabyte to each user that s 1 6 million subscribers But in the equatorial areas where we are charging 1 or less you can multiply those subscribers by 10x In the US if you re charging 25 year then you give people more data High end market is for people moving in and out of connectivity If you re in the home you use WiFi If you re in coverage area you use your current carrier plan If you move out of coverage you will connect to SpaceMobile If you re on a plane or driving to the hamptons or going to a cabin in a remote location you would connect to SpaceMobile The other part of the opportunity is people who don t have internet or phone We are starting with this market in the equatorial countries Working with Vodafone and AT amp T Vodafone is the largest telco in the world outside of China 640M subscribers and a leader in technology development They are very progressive in how they think about utilizing new technology Vodafone is the largest holder of cellular spectrum on the planet I personally financed 7 5M to develop the technology and launched the BW 1 to prove that the technology works Then I invited Vodafone to work together Vodafone has worked closely with me to help design the service from the beginning to ensure that nothing in their network infrastructure would be changed Vodafone CTO in March 2020 video said they ve been working with AST SpaceMobile for 18 months Mid 2018 Vodafone spends hundred of billions of dollars every year on their current infrastructure I want to piggyback their investment and not change anything Vodafone provided a lot of technical support Also provided access to their supply chain which was very important Vodafone diligenced AST for over a year Vodafone invested in Series B and in the PIPE We are very close to Vodafone and they are an ideal partner Also American Tower Samsung useful to have handset guy and Rakuten Altiostar is very important for us Abel also partnered with AT amp T in his first company so he has a great relationship and that s why he partnered with them now Issues with Latency Existing Protocols and Noise These problems are solved by the technology covered by our patent claims These issues were addressed by our demonstration with BW1 All the cellular infrastructure is designed to work with a range of 100km If you go out on a boat you stop seeing a coast because the earth is curved The same thing happens with signals So all the LTE and 5G protocols and every system is designed to sustain 100km of distance Typically you have towers 5 25km from where you are There are two effects when you have a satellite high up that is moving you have two effects on the signal one is doppler and one is delay Doppler is the same effect when you see F 1 racing car when you see it approach and then it s going away the sound changes Satellites have the same issue when it approaches you and it s going away Cell phones can t cope with these issues So we have patents that can deal with doppler and delay without needing to modify current mobile phones We have patents that also cover how to create kilowatt satellites cost effectively we patents for the architecture We have a family of patents to deal with all these issues One key aspect all of this technology goes into software that is on the ground and not in the satellite We want to be completely independent of 3G 4G 5G tech that is used by mobile handset The satellite is like a gigantic mirror relay The satellite is a beam former and takes those beams from cellular spectrum and translates it down via satellite spectrum to the gateway Phased array is very well known technology Every tower has a phased array and we adapted that to be used in our satellites What s the Magic We have the ability to create a large aperture cost effectively that has sensitivity and power to collect signal from mobile phones This ability is protocol agnostic whether it s 3G 4G 5G that doesn t change Building a satellite of this size at an effective cost is a big part of the magic The other part of the magic is the software that manages communication from satellite and the mobile phone Launch Costs There are many launch providers US SpaceX Astra Blue Origin Europeans Russians we re using Soyuz Indians launched BW1 So many options for launch providers Cost has gone down orders of magnitude NASA you could pay 30 50k per kg now it s order of magnitude less and continues to go down Selecting Wireless Carrier Partners Big believer in creating huge barriers entry 1 000 patent claims Highly technological approach to solve the problem It will take years for competitors to try to catch up with us We have patent insurance with Lloyd s of London AST pays premium each year and when someone violate patents Lloyd s utilizes legal resources to pursue Other barrier of entry we have 800M subscribers out of 5B in the world under mutual exclusivity which will keep others from trying to enter Won t do anymore of these mutually exclusive deals It s a multi billion dollar opportunity and market is big enough that other competitors will eventually come I m ok with this but I m years ahead and I have 20 of market secured with mutual exclusivity I will be launching service first and will have experience Patents will position us to have 5 10 years of advantage But market is so big the focus is delivering the technology and getting service up and running by 2023 Yes there will be customer wireless carrier announcements after the merger closing but I can t say when To give you a sense it takes 1 telco to add 200M subscribers This is great business model 1 agreement we get millions of subscribers Future agreements won t be mutually exclusive so we will add as many carriers as we can For example in South America we have 3 out of 4 largest carriers AT amp T won t let me disclose everything we re doing but they are looking at SpaceMobile to have the same effect as when they had exclusivity with iPhone vs competition Just imagine one telco saying you re phone can work everywhere on a plane or train vs competitor Competitive Landscape Lynk is trying to accomplish something similar with 10M of funding which is very tough Have not partnered with any wireless carriers to date Lynk s patents reference me in the prior art Their approach is using small satellites like what we did with BlueWalker 1 You can t do broadband or other services with small satellites You may be able to send a text message and the receive something back 2 hours later It s unclear how you can deliver this solution to customers without working with wireless carriers Omnispace Omnispace is a spectrum play I know them very well and don t see them as a direct competitor to AST SpaceMobile AST SpaceMobile we are making a play for all the large wireless telco carriers which makes the model work Everyone else is doing something completely different Milestones Catalysts One major milestone obviously is the launch of BW3 Another major milestone would be increasing the signed access to 1 3B of subscribers to a number that I can t disclose yet There will be service launches and regulatory approvals on a per country basis many of them in Vodafone markets many of these coming There may be news with some of our technology partners providing non dilutive financing to support us We will start manufacturing of the 20 satellites and I will do a video of the facility that will be coming out We will keep the market informed but I need to keep a balance to not share too much to competitors The US Senate passed a bipartisan 9B 5G Fund for Rural America AST SpaceMobile was part of FCC comment period for the 5G Fund I am confident we will get some portion of this fund For example SpaceX got 885 5M of the 9 2B RDOF Rural Digital Opportunity Fund SpaceX is providing Internet to the home however we are providing connectivity for the mobile handset in rural areas which is important for 5G This is the only way for the US to light up 5G across the entire country especially rural areas It will be perfect timing as the decision will be made after the launch of BW3 but before the constellation is launch 7 senators writing letters to the FCC in support of AST SpaceMobile AT amp T is also supporting us We will keep the cadence of the marketing up Video with Jason Silva is just the beginning We will do videos of the facility satellite launches etc We are going to have wonderful research coverage not only because of interest in our company but also people that are covering our investors partners American Tower Vodafone AT amp T they are all going to be in I can t say who will be covering us but it will be very good coverage Final Thoughts Have all the technology components in place and more than funded now Commercial risks are gone Will announce many more wireless carrier customers soon This will work it s just a matter of time

1207,nlmzdx,t2_h362v,1622051282,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlmzdx/riot_and_mara_dd_from_the_oracle_that_is_great/,0, RIOT and MARA DD from The Oracle that is Great Daddy Elon,Hello fellow WSB degens I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today s run up will continue on a meteoric rise Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20 s for each stonk This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20 s because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post certain underlying asset disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid 20 s like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine or Amazon AWS buying 2 3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year More mining equipment more revenue You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today 26 5 21 both of these stonks are up double digits As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading Now on to China banning CUA mining in China China controls 65 of the total hash rate of CUA If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65 To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice This is how CUA mining works Now imagine that China currently takes 6 5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6 5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65 Not sure Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number 1 8 to all the other miners The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care Theres a lot of stonks bottom line What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being dirty this is because China controls 65 of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams sizes of dams total output of individual dams total output of all dams etc Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood The only bill cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon s master plan He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil gas and coal energy Until 2023 if you start an oil gas or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80 100 percent of the project Yes that is right That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33 and its now like 26 Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this Disclaimer

the ground, Introduction As the title suggests I believe there is a company that does not yet suffer from an insanely inflated valuation like most EV companies has the potential to become a serious player in their own niche of the market and is bound to go through some amount of short squeeze in the near future should they continue to execute So let s start with a little background information The Company Arcimoto FUV is an electric vehicle company headquartered in Eugene Oregon that sells a tandem two seat three wheeled electric vehicle It was founded by Mark Frohnmayer in 2007 after he sold his stake as a co founder in game development company GarageGames The idea for Arcimoto started when Frohnmeyer was looking for a small electric vehicle for his everyday trips around town to reduce his carbon footprint He discovered the only options were Tesla Roadster which was clearly overkill or a golf cart which did not offer the right amount of utility The Product s Enter the Fun Utility Vehicle FUV https youtu be wG tiCV3oX4 a tandem two seat three wheeled electric motorcycle with an EPA rated range of 102 city miles per charge and a size between that of a car and a traditional motorcycle The vehicle will have a fuel economy of 173 7 MPGe at city driving speeds and is freeway capable with a maximum speed of 75 mph 121 km h The company officially launched production and delivery of the retail Fun Utility Vehicle on September 19 2019 After the FUV Arcimoto introduced alternative products called the Rapid Responder an emergency response vehicle the Deliverator a package food delivery vehicle and the Roadster a roofless version of the FUV All of these products are based on the same platform allowing Arcimoto to save costs on manufacturing tools and production The vehicles are already about 15 more energy efficient than the best EV the Model 3 and Arcimoto is targeting to increase this to roughly 50 The Execution Which brings us to the biggest caveat for the company While I have a lot of faith in the CEOs drive to make this company a success as well as the potential of the product the company still has a lot to prove In 2020 they delivered a total of 117 vehicles While this might not sound like a lot it is worth keeping in mind that Arcimoto has only invested roughly 100M into their company so far For comparison companies like Tesla Lordstown Fisker and Nikola had not delivered any cars after the first 100M investment That said the biggest challenge for any EV company as Elon Musk would be willing to attest to is getting to full scale production Arcimoto has recently purchased a new facility the rAMP which is targeted to have a manufacturing capacity of 50 000 units per year once fully operational Additionally this facility will function as a prototype for scale replication for global expansion In other words if this facility functions well they will copy paste the damn thing all around the planet Obviously this new facility comes with a lot of required investments and unknowns for the company but also a lot of opportunity In response to their plans and partially due to the hype around EV companies the stock rose from little over 1 during the COVID crash to 36 during the peak in February The Shorts Which brings us to the short situation around the company While the company had had some trouble with aggressive short sellers pre COVID this seemed to be a thing of the past after their massive run up during the recovery But alas the shorts had other plans In March just after the stock had mysteriously dropped more than 50 from its ATH potentially in part due to the overall decline of growth stocks but probably for other reasons we will get to a law office announced an investigation into the company concerning possible violations of federal securities laws According to the law firm Arcimoto had delivered less than 5 of the pre orders it had touted since 2018 and that the Company s largest customer is secretly owned and operated by an undisclosed related party FOD Capital LLC Moreover the report alleged that one day before Arcimoto touted a 90 day trial for first responder units in Orlando the Company had filed a total production recall notice due to safety issues with the electronic drivers in the vehicles which can lead to unexpected battery shutdown and immediate loss of traction power What followed were months of constant press releases about potential class action lawsuits and the stock price plummeting another 55 to a low of 8 During the earnings call on May 18th Frohnmayer stated that he believes the lawsuits are chock full of falsehoods and misrepresentations that the lawsuit is based on a report by a short seller of the company s common stock and that as of that time no motion to certify a class has been filed Source Arcimoto Q1 2021 Earnings Webinar https youtu be h nmvAq93nY t 3298 The Squeeze I already wanted to put this post out earlier in the week but didn t find the time for it Today I felt I had to before it was too late as the stock suddenly shot up roughly 20 in a single day This entire rise happened within 1 5 hours time clearly suggesting the beginnings of a short squeeze to me My Take While I have no definitive proof I am quite convinced that the supposed class action lawsuit is completely bogus and an attempt to drive the stock into the ground at the benefit of the short seller s The stock s short interest as of May 12th was roughly 30 putting it in the top 8 most shorted stocks in the market According to Yahoo Finance this increased to 36 since If you look at the news coverage about the company in the past two months https finance yahoo com quote FUV p FUV the amount of spam about the law suit is quite frankly ridiculous with 57 separate news articles about the law suit none of which contained any tangible information This to me is quite clearly an aggressive marketing campaign to scare investors away from the company As for the shorts my opinion is clear the lawsuits is bogus and the stock is heavily overshorted Today was the first step in a short squeeze that should take the stock back to its rightful levels While it almost definitely got ahead of itself trading at 36 earlier this year I believe it should at least be trading at 2x it s current values 15 20 based on fundamentals As for the future of the company I believe the pace at which they will be able to get the rAMP factory up and running will be crucial for the short term outlook of the company Long term their ability to drive costs down and whether they ll have enough demand to sell 50 000 units per year will determine whether this can become a multi billion dollar company If the demand is there my projections tell me they could be in the 10 17B range by 2024 Tl dr Arcimoto FUV is a company that makes three wheeled electric cross overs between a car and a motorcycle and is trying to scale production from 100 to 50 000 units per year over the next couple of years but is getting shorted into the ground based on a potentially probably bogus lawsuit and as such has become a tremendous investing opportunity

this you will find out WHY the markets actually ARE rational amp x200B To start out i d like to say this will be full of totally non referenced facts that i ve heard over the years in reading books studies and video presentations If that bothers you stop reading amp x200B If you are still here I want to outline the difference between Apes and Artists why they have a hard time understanding each other and how each type of person can be profitable in the stonk markets amp x200B Agenda amp x200B First I will describe how to determine if you are an Ape or an Artist amp x200B Second I will describe how each should approach investing using this forum and the world around them amp x200B Third I will summarize why both Artists and Apes Cost hedge funds bigtime money in the internet age and explain some common phenomenon in current markets to back up my theories Summarizing eventually why markets are currently rational amp x200B Part 1 intelligence actually does matter amp x200B To determine if we are artist or ape we need to make a few assumptions amp x200B Autist here refers to someone not just on the spectrum but of above average intelligence likely by a few tiers I will use IQ for this conversation amp x200B Why does this matter There are many tests to determine intelligence but IQ has been proven to be the best most reliable test That said it isn t overall very reliable at all Scores can range for the same person from 10 20 depending on the type of test amp x200B Given all of that let s accept this assumption as a way to speak on intelligence Are we discounting the genius artists and visionaries that would score below average on an IQ test Sure But those people probably aren t in the market anyways amp x200B Now that we know how important IQ is the problem becomes much more interesting amp x200B Studies show that a person with an 80IQ has a hard time understanding how a person with a 100IQ thinks However a person with a 100IQ has just about as hard of a time understanding the 100IQ person amp x200B For reference an IQ of about 110 would be needed to be a decent performing college student at a main university amp x200B Genius level IQ would start at about 140 and go to 180 and higher amp x200B There are approximately 25 of the population of geniuses or 200M people on this planet amp x200B APES by IQ amp x200B If you are at about 80 120IQ you are probably an ape There are differing levels of ape but you will have an easier time understanding how each other think amp x200B ARTISTS by IQ amp x200B At about 140IQ and above you are disconnected from the reality of how others think and live It s possible you aren t even on the spectrum believe it or not autism is not usually associated with high IQ its a myth still 25 chance of genius amp x200B What if you can t take an IQ test to determine this amp x200B Here is where I help you amp x200B APE by OUTLOOK You work a shitty job and you think other people are really smart You tell your smart friends how you think one of your buddies is like good will hunting They aren t You probably have good work ethic if you are a contributing member of society Often times the people you think are weird are just smarter than you If you think alot of people are weird probably an ape Generally if you are an APE you will be preety happy in life and will blame most of your failures on circumstance and bad luck You could be right but that doesn t matter The point is this is your personality amp x200B ARTIST by OUTLOOK You probably also work a shitty job and you used to think other people were really smart You had friends that told you dude X person is like good will hunting and you got excited to meet them You are always let down when you meet them Because you fit into a super high of IQ you will have a super hard time understanding anyone For this reason you have few friends you can connect with You are probably generally unhappy and you blame yourself If you have a good job you are probably still unhappy because you see people that you know without a doubt are retarded in charge of you as managers You are probably right This is most likely your personality amp x200B Part 2 How should each invest amp x200B APES You need to realize you are NEVER going to be able to analyze financials Just stop trying Your strength is you understand how the average American thinks When something gets hyped pumped get in early and just sell before the hype dies down You need to stay on social media with your friends tick tok instagram twitter etc and make trades FAST Speed is your greatest ally take tips from others and trade with SPEED You are gambling this is a wendys you need to buy in when it starts getting hyped and sell when its STILL hyped Not when the hype starts to die down So just live your life follow socials and trade FAST on HYPE Easy amp x200B ARTISTS You yes you are the ones that complain when markets aren t rational because you read some books about PE s and some good DDs and all the numbers made sense Well guess what Numbers are only half the equation Public sentiment in gambling speculation all short term trading is gambling this is casino etc is super important You as an Artist cannot understand what the retarded Apes are doing It s like imagine you are in the forest and a group of gorillas come up to you and they are chilling and a big silverback rolls in ranting Would you have any idea what they are saying No but I bet the other gorillas figure it out faster than you It s the same with the Apes If you want to make money you have to either learn to understand Ape thought processes and logic or lack thereof OR trade only on numbers and extreme logic You are most likely to do well trading on numbers and extreme logic but with longer time lines So Leaps are probably better than FDs for you or even owning shares However when you hit you will hit BIG if you go in on FDs Michael Burry a self proclaimed autist and king of artists even himself almost went tits up if the housing market didn t crash soon enough Keep in mind Artists you may only be a college professor type intelligence of like 120IQ and you aren t a genius If you can memorize a shit ton of numbers but can t make mind leaps you will get burned so so hard when you think you are being perfectly logical amp x200B Part 3 IS THE MARKET RATIONAL amp x200B Yes The problem is it s rational for the majority of the population that are Apes Sub 140IQ etc It s a problem of perspective For APEs it really is as simple as AMC movies movies open soon must buy movies It s likely those that think the market is irrational are 1 confused apes that are parroting a line they don t understand BuY tHe dIp or 2 agitated autists who just can t see or understand 60 IQ points below them where the logic is much simpler and hype is much more effective It truly does all come down to no one can see above or below their IQ amp x200B Implications and conclusion amp x200B How does the rise of the Apes in investing thus dominate the market The average American just has a shit ton of disposable income now In Austin Texas you have hobos with smart phones riding on scooters down the street They could easily open a robinhood app using the starbucks wifi they camp there literally and toss 500 on a yolo bet Middle or average Americans Apes have a stupid amount of buying power as a

rational artists Doesn t work in America not yet Here retarts got moneys amp x200B Hedge funds really really don t like this To be honest most hedge fund types are actually artists They are extremely smart logical people Probably most successful decision makers are genius or close to genius at least on an IQ test They just don t see the apes coming and the internet has made ape s ability to mobilize and their velocity extreme Now that even low IQ minimum wage apes that work in Wendy s can invest with stuff like robinhood makes it simple enough to trade for a retart we truly have a threat to the system And it s all ultimately a translation problem If payment for orderflow didn t exist they would face existential issues amp x200B Love it or hate it Apes are here to stay It s literally
