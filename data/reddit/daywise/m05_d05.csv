wp content uploads AST SpaceMobile Investor Presentation Public 12 15 20 pdf The company will provide 5G capabilities to regular cellphones from space they target the 5 billion phones moving in and out of coverage every day or in monetary terms 1T in TAM Why should you care The recent market hit to high growth speculative plays has not spared ASTS This has put the stock at a relatively attractive valuation at approximately 1 2B cheaper than for PIPE investors who bought in at 1 4B The company represents the most asymmetric risk reward play on the market right now It will either 20x 100x or go bust Let me explain if they get only 1 of their TAM which is 10B then at a cheap P E ratio of 10x telecom industry average is 30x according to Damodaran http pages stern nyu edu adamodar New Home Page datafile pedata html it gives the company a 100B market capitalization representing an 82x opportunity Alright 100x if everything goes well right Yes let me tell you why I and many others some incredible DD from other investors like u apan man think that the company will succeed Because this is a highly speculative play and will give you a VC like risk reward exposure I analyzed it like a VC using the BMC desirability feasibility and viability Desirability Targeted Segment Their satellites will offer services to large telecom companies which will help telecom companies expand their subscriber base and have a unique competitive advantage against other carriers Think of AST s satellites like 5G towers in space Of the currently 5B existing end users the company has 800M subscribers under exclusivity agreements with companies like Vodafone AT amp T Rakuten Telefonica Ooredoo Telstra and others To put this a bit into perspective the only other company really trying to achieve that is Lynk https lynk global but they have only 10M in funding compared to 464M for ASTS and currently do not have any commercial agreements Customer Relationships amp Channels All the customer relationship services as well as sales efforts are done by the carriers Basically AST provides the 5G capability and the carrier offers it to its subscribers moving in and out of coverage This is a good reason why the future cost structure of ASTS is so attractive Value Proposition Designed to eliminate coverage gaps and enable billions of people globally to stay connected through their mobile phones Imagine watching hot tub streams on the plane Feasibility Key Partners In the value chain AST designs integrates and tests the satellites while their subsidiary Nanoavionics builds the main components They will use any available launch services such as SpaceX Blue Origin GK Launch Services Ariane etc The fact that they have a wide array of choices available greatly reduces successful launch risks Moreover the main reason why the space based applications industry will absolutely explode in the coming years is the ever decreasing launch costs price to send a kg of payload in space https www futuretimeline net data trends images rocket launch costs trend jpg Regarding financial and strategic partners the company has received funding from Vodafone Rakuten American Tower and Samsung in previous rounds as well as in the PIPE 12 month lock up Key Activities AST will design and integrate the satellites The company s CEO Abel Avellan is also a big believer in creating huge barriers to entry they patent a lot of the key elements of their business model Of course their biggest focus is getting the service up and running by 2023 Abel is also working on new wireless carrier agreements To give you an idea on average 1 telecom adds around 200M subscribers Future agreements won t be mutually exclusive like with Vodafone so they can add as many carriers as they want Key Resources Talent technology and funding Abel Avellan is not much of a salesman but he is a genius he seeded AST and was the main contributor to a lot of the technologies that enable the 5G satellites to work Maybe he is as autistic as Elon who knows As mentioned previously they managed to attract funding from Vodafone American Tower and Rakuten Vodafone spent nearly 18 months doing due diligence on AST s technology and has concluded that it works For further funding ASTS is participating in the 9B 5G rural fund for America http licensing fcc gov cgi bin ws exe prod ib forms reports related filing hts f key 441408 amp f number SATPDR2020041300034 They currently have the support of 7 senators bipartisan and AT amp T In my opinion there is the potential for AST to get about 1B in non dilutive funding from the government which would significantly accelerate the company s plan for global coverage Viability Revenue Streams Revenues come from an agreement with telecom providers basically comes in the form of a monthly subscription fee The end user is seamlessly connected from towers on the ground to AST satellites Cost Structure Because the satellites are in LEO orbit they will need to be changed every 5 7 years The company is working on a way to repair extend the lifetime of existing satellites The long term play Shares options LEAPS this one has it all I would recommend longer dated options or shares because the main catalyst is the launch of BW3 in Q4 2021 So either 01 2023 or shares The short term play Shares or options dated august The stock has been severely beaten down and could regain some momentum in the coming weeks Furthermore the stock has a relatively small market cap and could be very explosive on any news such as new carrier agreements analyst coverage etc Abel Avellan has mentioned that they are in the process of signing a new 500M subscribers agreement and the silent period ends this Friday TL DR ASTS is the most asymmetric play on the market right either 100x or 0x Positions 35 000 shares

being manipulated yes but that doesn t mean it isn t still a perfectly functioning There are so few floating shares because Dan holds basically all of them Insider holding here is a GOOD sign even if it s currently holding the stock back for a number of reasons He holds because he knows gt amp x200B What the fuck does it take it to get you to look at a stock that s undervalued while it s undervalued Before it s blasted off There was just a 500m block to charity ABOVE market price 25 50 ffs Just watch this hot fucking meme https drive google com file d 1gskJfY368klJgtj241hCdEiEPN6k4OTM view get hyped explanations context https i imgur com xrwnDSk png and realize that even after last earning s massive paper gains Dan G hasn t sold a single share amp x200B Shares of Rocket where Gilbert is the majority shareholder jumped more than 70 on Tuesday adding 17 30 per share According to InsiderScore com and securities filings Gilbert owns roughly 1 9 billion shares of Rocket putting his paper gain on the stock at more than 32 billion The move pushed Gilbert into the top 20 of Bloomberg s Billionaire Index with roughly 64 billion Now THIS is the narrative that is particularly uninspiring amp x200B OF COURSE THEY LL KILL EARNINGS the bears say but the stock will go down anyways amp x200B amp x200B This for a company not trading at high multiples and barely above its IPO price A company which most people acknowledge will likely blast estimates and doubled last ER blowout asterisks here obviously If you re convinced that is spellbound the curse is lifted after Cinco de Mayo amp x200B a low volume stock with a low public float is an easy target for manipulation Its real PT has been max pain ever since you apes figured out what that is This shouldn t deter you from playing EARNINGS If this is seriously your only concern in a free market consider the shock to that system earnings will bring High volume The gets massively increased attention at the drop of a dime The needs only volume for fuel As America s largest other blowout mortgage earnings are showing the market s strength and playing into s hype But Companies is not just Mortgages it already is and will continue to be so much more than a single successful venture It s already a long standing meme here Strong memetics You literally can t shake from this sub You ll notice the increase in yolo posts and comments lately in anticipation of earnings because it has once again presented itself a cheap entry near its Launch Date Fun fact the ticker isn t mentioned in this post because it wouldn t get through automod Due updates for Auto will be massive for the neglected narrative that is more than just a mortgage company is viewed as a one trick pony amp x200B Could we be looking at more than just a blowout earnings This is complete speculation on his intentions for moving the date but knowing Dan there s a non zero chance that this is the case from r team F 13 filings are due 05 17 reports that show institutional ownership had originally posted estimated earnings for late May I believe they moved it to May 5th with the other mortgage companies so that investors can compare who really is going to be and that they aren t just a mortgage company I believe they want to release something dope on earnings before the SEC reports are due Acquisitions partnerships are great but this means so much more for the stock if it were to happen The 1 reason the stock is at its current level is because its shares are 93 owned Institutions don t like that because they invest on sure things Whether they trust Dan G or not there is an inherent risk with that and institutions have fiduciary responsibilities to their clients If there is a huge partnership or acquisition then I would reasonably assume the equity would come from the majority share holder Dan G s valuation and market cap is low because it s viewed as a mortgage play essentially A big partnership or acquisition would provide justification for analysts to re evaluate their P E ratio This would take the stock to insane levels over 100 gains I wont do the work for you Just take a look at Rocket Homes one sector of and compare it to Zillow let me know which one you find is better Then look both company s P E ratio That should show you the possibilities The constant blow out earnings innovation speed to produce is just confirmation that it s a company that can get it done Dan is a prideful competitive guy If you have no idea who Dan is The letter in which he goes after Lebron James for leaving his team The Cavaliers https www espn com nba news story id 5365704 https www espn com nba news story id 5365704 Don t you just love that energy And even if he can t control the outcome of basketball games he goes all out to protect his image Given the circles he s in and the connections he has it s clearly not lost on him that his reputation in the world of finance is smudged by a dud IPO He s adamant on fixing that and openly expresses his distaste for those betting against his company For him this is because of how they affect his image It s not like he issued that special dividend because he needs the cash amp x200B Options chain disconnected from stock price A larger move is being priced in despite the flat close and I believe that IV is still low compared to what we ll see We know that meme stocks are reflexive meaning that once the actual stock price begins rising PM it becomes a shiny investment to apes on the fence LOW RISK HIGH REWARD There are different ways to play this and for the absolutely uninitiated I would recommend SHARES The stock has shown consolidation so the downside at this point is minimal This truly is a great one to sit on until its potential is realized and some day soon we ll never see these levels again However if you re trying to a nice vacation this month Positions not financial advice 45x 5 7 25c amp 29c up 100 on a red day for 66x 5 22 26c 20x 9 17 29

should almost never short the S amp P500,A bunch of noobs with their crayon charts are coming back to tell you why you should short the S amp P500 I m here to tell you that they are mostly idiots and you will almost surely not make money doing it as a long term play Story time Back in 2019 long before gmreeeee this sub had less than a million subscribers and we talked about things like earnings plays the nasdaq 100 the infinite leverage kid TrAdE TalKs GoiNg WelL and Donald Pump Back then you could make free money by just buying tech calls or literally anything for that matter In February 2020 the S amp P500 was ripping higher and higher on increasingly worse news mass covid outbreaks trade talks going to shit Jerome Powell doing NotQE and bonds flipping their shit Then one sunday night spooz opened sharply lower and drill team 6 went to work These dudes were causing circuit breaker after circuit breaker and options liquidity went to shit across the board Implied volatility was so high that a call ten strikes above market was basically the same price as the atm ones Then when we thought it couldn t get any worse Putin said that Russia was not going to cut production at OPEC and crude futures plummeted The price action was so crazy that front month crude futures settled at negative prices This means that you had to pay people to take your oil Then all of a sudden the market rebounded and all the smug shorts got their asses handed to them as the S amp P500 went through multiple circuit breaking weeks of face ripping rallies So what happened and why should you not bet against the S amp P500 amp x200B 1 The S amp P500 has the most liquid options market in the world and the way in which options are hedged means that market makers are usually forced to buy after extended drawdowns Large institutions like pension funds have a tremendous amount of equities on their books and these assets need to be hedged in times of stress When a big risk event comes along these big dogs will buy puts to protect their holdings They will also sell calls using their equities as collateral to bring in some premium throughout the year regardless of risk The market makers are on the other side of this trade so that are usually assumed to be long calls and short puts Let s just look at short puts for now If you are a market maker then you want to eliminate your directional risk Since short puts will lose you money if the underlying goes down you can short shares to hedge your short put Remember now that puts have two huge components that determine price volatility and how close the market is to the strike When a bunch of short puts are in the money then it will have a high delta This means that the MM s will need to short a ton of shares to hedge the large delta The big kicker here is that for one volatility is mean reverting and two that the option will eventually expire When volatility mean reverts as it must since risk is not constant in our world the deltas on the short call will reduce Less delta means that MMs are short too many shares and they need to buy this is the effect of vanna Hence vix drop share buys in general not always The second factor is that eventually the options will expire and hence the market maker will no longer need to short into dips to hedge their gamma meaning there is less selling pressure They might even need to buy to get flat from all the short stock they have after their options expire It is no coincidence that the huge rally we saw in 2020 off the covid lows happened the day after a massive amount of in the money options expired during March quad witching If you want to read more about this stuff here is a good resource https squeezemetrics com download The Implied Order Book pdf https squeezemetrics com download The Implied Order Book pdf amp x200B 2 Bond yields are incredibly low and this creates a risk on appetite If you are rich where do you put your money right now If you put it in bonds then you are not even going to beat inflation and moreover if yields spike your bond will be worth significantly less These factors make bonds with long duration a risk both immediately and also in opportunity cost We can put our money into an asset that will do nothing or we can put it into a large index like the S amp P500 where over 10 years we know that we can probably get at least 20 out of it The best part is that big money can easily hedge its directional risk by buying puts and if needed sell calls against holdings to pay for the put This means big can get protection for free All this infers that there is a natural flow of money into the market Evaluations might be crazy high right now but they start to make more sense when you adjust it for bond yields Dr Edward Yardeni has a blog that talks about this more in depth https www yardeni com pub valuationfed pdf https www yardeni com pub valuationfed pdf amp x200B Now of course this stuff could be wrong and a well articulated counter point can be found on Dr Lacy Hunt s open letters Economic Overview hoisington com https hoisington com economic overview html There s also Steve Van Metre and his youtube channel along with Jeff Snider with similar content amp x200B 3 The S amp P500 is comprised of the best 500 companies America has to offer They are the ones that will THRIVE when conditions are tough because their competition will most likely not make it Know that all the things I mentioned above are very real structural reasons for why shorting the S amp P is a very dangerous play If you want to scalp the short side then I don t think there are any issues but holding a short position for any time longer than a week means that you are working against all the factors I mentioned above When will the S amp P500 be overvalued Well if we adjust for bond yields probably at 7000 8000 on the spx So sit back and enjoy the free money Don t over leverage on the long side because big down moves do happen but why not just buy a few call debit spreads that expire in a month and profit off of an unstoppable juggernaut Buy one call in the money and sell one call out the money Until the 10 year has yields over 5 or until China invades Taiwan I think we don t have much to worry about

bunch of noobs with their crayon charts are coming back to tell you why you should short the S amp P500 I m here to tell you that they are mostly idiots and you will almost surely not make money doing it as a long term play Story time Back in 2019 long before gmreeeee this sub had less than a million subscribers and we talked about things like earnings plays the nasdaq 100 the infinite leverage kid TrAdE TalKs GoiNg WelL and Donald Pump Back then you could make free money by just buying tech calls or literally anything for that matter In February 2020 the S amp P500 was ripping higher and higher on increasingly worse news mass covid outbreaks trade talks going to shit Jerome Powell doing NotQE and bonds flipping their shit Then one sunday night spooz opened sharply lower and drill team 6 went to work These dudes were causing circuit breaker after circuit breaker and options liquidity went to shit across the board Implied volatility was so high that a call ten strikes above market was basically the same price as the atm ones Then when we thought it couldn t get any worse Putin said that Russia was not going to cut production at OPEC and crude futures plummeted The price action was so crazy that front month crude futures settled at negative prices This means that you had to pay people to take your oil Then all of a sudden the market rebounded and all the smug shorts got their asses handed to them as the S amp P500 went through multiple circuit breaking weeks of face ripping rallies So what happened and why should you not bet against the S amp P500 1 The S amp P500 has the most liquid options market in the world and the way in which options are hedged means that market makers are usually forced to buy after extended drawdowns Large institutions like pension funds have a tremendous amount of equities on their books and these assets need to be hedged in times of stress When a big risk event comes along these big dogs will buy puts to protect their holdings They will also sell calls using their equities as collateral to bring in some premium throughout the year regardless of risk The market makers are on the other side of this trade so that are usually assumed to be long calls and short puts Let s just look at short puts for now If you are a market maker then you want to eliminate your directional risk Since short puts will lose you money if the underlying goes down you can short shares to hedge your short put Remember now that puts have two huge components that determine price volatility and how close the market is to the strike When a bunch of short puts are in the money then it will have a high delta This means that the MM s will need to short a ton of shares to hedge the large delta The big kicker here is that for one volatility is mean reverting and two that the option will eventually expire When volatility mean reverts as it must since risk is not constant in our world the deltas on the short call will reduce Less delta means that MMs are short too many shares and they need to buy this is the effect of vanna Hence vix drop share buys in general not always The second factor is that eventually the options will expire and hence the market maker will no longer need to short into dips to hedge their gamma meaning there is less selling pressure They might even need to buy to get flat from all the short stock they have after their options expire It is no coincidence that the huge rally we saw in 2020 off the covid lows happened the day after a massive amount of in the money options expired during March quad witching If you want to read more about this stuff here is a good resource https squeezemetrics com download The Implied Order Book pdf https squeezemetrics com download The Implied Order Book pdf 2 Bond yields are incredibly low and this creates a risk on appetite If you are rich where do you put your money right now If you put it in bonds then you are not even going to beat inflation and moreover if yields spike your bond will be worth significantly less These factors make bonds with long duration a risk both immediately and also in opportunity cost We can put our money into an asset that will do nothing or we can put it into a large index like the S amp P500 where over 10 years we know that we can probably get at least 20 out of it The best part is that big money can easily hedge its directional risk by buying puts and if needed sell calls against holdings to pay for the put This means big can get protection for free All this infers that there is a natural flow of money into the market Evaluations might be crazy high right now but they start to make more sense when you adjust it for bond yields Dr Edward Yardeni has a blog that talks about this more in depth https www yardeni com pub valuationfed pdf https www yardeni com pub valuationfed pdf Now of course this stuff could be wrong and a well articulated counter point can be found on Dr Lacy Hunt s open letters Economic Overview hoisington com https hoisington com economic overview html There s also Steve Van Metre and his youtube channel along with Jeff Snider with similar content 3 The S amp P500 is comprised of the best 500 companies America has to offer They are the ones that will THRIVE when conditions are tough because their competition will most likely not make it Know that all the things I mentioned above are very real structural reasons for why shorting the S amp P is a very dangerous play If you want to scalp the short side then I don t think there are any issues but holding a short position for any time longer than a week means that you are working against all the factors I mentioned above When will the S amp P500 be overvalued Well if we adjust for bond yields probably at 7000 8000 on the spx So sit back and enjoy the free money Don t over leverage on the long side because big down moves do happen but why not just buy a few call debit spreads that expire in a month and profit off of an unstoppable juggernaut Buy one call in the money and sell one call out the money Until the 10 year has yields over 5 or until China invades Taiwan I think we don t have much to worry about

because it didn t get an traction Either way I got a pretty good message from another redditor that I will include I also need to add the recently released ASO announcement amp x200B Alright the weekends now over but that doesn t matter for most of you since Wendy s never closes and you need to work overtime to keep losing it on Robinhood with stupid FD s Reading this won t take long and you can go back to using your lunch breaks to give discounted brojobs next to the dumpster to support your grind I am here to talk about my two favorite plays at the moment which you ve either forgotten since reading it in the post title or you re just too retarded to know the tickers It s fucking Academy Sports and Clean energy If you just spat out your fresh semen and crayon lunch then pop an Adderall and try to decipher the symbols on your screen that make up the English alphabet If you need help download a synthetic voice text to speech program and have it read to you If that still doesn

and macaroni noises in the bedroom First one Academy Sports Most of you unwashed neckbeards probably haven t stepped foot in an Academy Sports store because it promotes doing things outdoors You d just waltz around feeling guilty for gaining another 40 pounds during Covid and purchase a DD sports bra for your girlfriend even though the cute cashier knows you reek of desperation she can even smell it with her mask on It s okay because your card is going to be declined and you ll shamefully walk out while the repulsed cashier attempts to scrub your Cheeto dust and dandruff from the nooks and crannies of the card reader Academy Sports is an American sporting goods store chain We are all well aware of the effects that Covid had on retail during 2020 and know it s been a dumpster fire Academy reported earnings https investors academy com news releases news release details academy sports outdoors announces record sales and earnings on March 30th and somehow these motherfuckers blew the roof off Fourth Quarter and Full Year Comparable Sales Increased 16 1 Fourth Quarter Gross Margin Rate Expanded 420 basis points over Q4 2019 Full Year Net Income Increased 157 2 over 2019 to 308 8 million How did they do it I have no fucking clue Their e commerce sales increased by a cool and modest 60 7 Where the fuck did this demand come from Looks like you guys were sitting around in your moldy basements jerking off to some other retard s gain porn while too ashamed to post your loss porn and Academy Sports was out there busting loads on faces and you just wait on your knees and take them to the forehead eyes wide open Makes no sense you sick fucks act like getting sperm in your eyes is something you can add to a resume since you watched a lot of kids Anyways here s an excerpt https www fool com earnings call transcripts 2021 03 30 academy sports and outdoors inc aso q4 2020 earnin While many of our categories benefited from the COVID 19 crisis several of our key businesses such as licensed apparel team sports equipment apparel and footwear and back to school were adversely impacted and should return to normal this year In addition to each of these businesses driving sales growth they are all margin rate accretive and should drive a return to a more traditional mix of sales Fourth we will improve our management of several seasonal categories where there are not worldwide inventory shortages but where our initial inventory buy in 2020 was not enough to meet the strong demand This year we have modified our planning and allocation on products like grills and water sports to support additional sales compared to their normal trend line As we begin 2021 we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong results because of our incredible team the continued development of our key initiatives and the stronger deeper relationships we have built with our customers The company is providing the following estimate for fiscal 2021 Comparable sales are forecast to range from up 2 to down 2 This is an 18 to 14 increase on a two year stacked basis Okay great so people bought a lot of workout equipment Who cares What you semen suckers fail to understand is that some guys were able to find a woman that is attracted to them in a way that they will ACTUALLY have sex with them and sometimes that results in kids Those kids have been at home all fucking year and their parents want them out of the house so they can boink on the kitchen table again Ding ding those rusty gears in your seemingly empty head are starting to grind Yes wow vaccines are starting to become mainstream and everybody is pent up at home with their crotch goblins Enter every single recreational sport available Beyond boosts in kids sports equipment that we will probably see this part of my DD is literally just my personal social media feed where everybody on Facebook and Instagram is doing anything in their power to get the kids out of the house and bragging about it we are obviously going into outdoor season That means camping vacations swimming and other things people with active and healthy lifestyles do Academy Sports has it all Tents grills coolers clothing swimsuits fishing gear canoes sleeping bags Do me a favor walk into an Academy Sports store and look at the demand for yourself I obviously expect that Academy Sports will continue to exceed expectations and I am not the only one Show me another stock with a 100 buy rating https www marketbeat com stocks NASDAQ ASO price target and if you re too lazy type in ASO on Robinhood and look for yourself Now I m going to get into the most interesting part ASO has a 100 buy rating from 8 different analysts blew away earnings during a pandemic and has amazing financials and a healthy balance sheet It s kind of weird that it is 9th on the most shorted stock list https www marketwatch com tools screener short interest when every other company on that list looks like it could use some adrenaline shots or life support ASO was previously the most shorted stock on the market a few weeks ago If I had a guess it looks like shorters realized they shorted a company that didn t deserve to be and they want to cover before wallstreetbets gets a sniff of it Oops it s too late now Dick s Sporting Goods is trading at a PE ratio of 14 and has a short interest of 16 https fintel io ss us dks Academy Sports is sitting at an SI of 33 62 and a PE ratio of 8 Seems a little bit fishy to me and smells like a ripe vagina is wafting the room What could these large funds know that we don t Hmmm let s try nothing and the fact that they were hoping to capitalize on another seemingly Covid ravaged retailer Does this remind you of anything else I am not going to sell this to you as a short squeeze because those only happen when you have a very tight float on a company where buyers start jumping in droves while short sellers are already underwater in their positions Also interesting because at the end of March it went from around 24 50 to around 32 00 and the price hasn t gone below 28 39 Also of note the average 10 day trading volume for ASO is 1 584M The entire float is 40 436 703 https www marketwatch com tools screener short interest shares with 33 62 of the float shorted leaves you 13 594 583 shares short That gives you 9 days to cover with average volume if they did nothing but buy and were the only ones doing so Do what you will with that information or go do the math yourself To me it looks like some retards with a lot of capital put themselves in another bad situation Most recent rating from a JP Morgan analyst moves it from 32 to 35 If you re comparing companies in the same sector who would you prefer to make your long AND short bets on Operating income of Academy Sports at 129M in 2019 222M in 2020 and 424M in 2021 with a smaller PE ratio or Dick s with 445M in 2019 409M in 2020 or 741M in 2021 and a PE ratio twice that of the former I already know you little ringholes get mad when you see a DD on a stock only after it s up 150 for the week but this is one of those times when this post was made while the stock is down 3 for the week and up 10

with natural gas fuel Moving forward in our thinking as well as in our vehicles means a safer healthier planet for all of us This change is happening Natural gas is abundant and economically viable and is increasingly being adopted as transportation fuel by countries around the world Hmmm I can t even begin to imagine what type of political administration or historical time notably marked by unprecedented climate change when a company providing an alternative to diesel especially one that is clean and readily available could POSSIBLY flourish I was a truck driver for some time and pumped over 500 dollars of fuel into my semi each day Looking over the finances fuel prices accounted for 20 more than the cost of the 2 drivers to work over the road on a weekly basis Fuel is generally the highest percentage of operating costs in the freight transportation business We are set to enter into a period of economic recovery and anyone with half a brain synapse knows freight transportation is at the heart of industry Not that this is entirely related but Amazon just posted a round of earnings that once again exceeded expectations Amazon s sales increased by a modest 44 fucking percent Why does it matter Shut the fuck up and keep reading Clean Energy signed an agreement https www marketwatch com story clean energy fuels stock soars after supply equity investment agreements with amazon 2021 04 19 with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon renewable natural gas as 27 of its existing fueling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations Yeah you read that correctly Amazon sales blow the fuck up and they have found a place that they can cut operating costs and it just so happens to be through a partnership with the only other company that has the infrastructure to support them in this endeavor It goes without saying that the current administration is going to be pushing for renewable and clean energy harder than your wife threw you out of the house when her boyfriend

Find assets at a less retarded entry point Good luck and go back to whatever smooth brained moron shit you were doing before seeing this Here is a long message I recieved from u edwardDiGi Hello I am quite an expert on CLNE and natural gas mobility I wrote some reports blogs on seekingalpha about the sector if you are interested follow me and I can send you the link about CLNE amp AMZN I am convinced that the Raymond James analyst got all wrong about the stock The warrants transaction is basically a call option on the success of CLNE in the next 10 years and I am sure Amazon does not want to sell those shares at 14 but at much higher values I am not sure how Total fits into this as it seems they cannot acquire the total ownership of the company anymore without sharing it with Amazon Nevertheless the warrant strike price at 13 49 should be the main reference point for the years to come I recommend you to have a look at WPRT as it seems that Amazon expects thousands more of natural gas trucks on the road This is going to benefit the JV between Cummins CMI and Westport WPRT https www reuters com article us amazon engines natural gas exclusive idUSKBN2A52ML https www reuters com article us amazon engines natural gas exclusive idUSKBN2A52ML The JV has to be renewed or acquired by CUmmins by the end of this year I personally expect it to be renewed here an extract of my report FOCUS US Market developments AMZN amp CLNEAmazon logistic managers may have noticed the amazing growth of Renewable Natural Gas supply in the USA In 2021 more than 50 of all natural gas used by the US transport sector was coming from renewable sources http www ngvjournal com s1 news c1 markets us biomethane surpasses 50 of all on road fuel used in natural gas vehicles Major oil companies expect to further increase investments on Renewable Natural Gas production plants Total https www cleanenergyfuels com press room clean energy and total to develop additional carbon negative fuel and infrastructure BP https www naturalgasintel com bp partnering in two rng ventures socalgas interconnecting more landfill gas and Chevron https www chevron com stories chevron brightmark expand partnership on dairy biomethane fuel projects all signed different agreements with Clean Energy Fuel or other operators in this regard Chevron in particular expects to increase production of RNG by 10x by 2030 But what is the driver of the interest in RNG A part of the answer relies in a special Credit System created in California to support low carbon fuels The Low Carbon Fuel System calculates the carbon intensity of a specific fuel directly in the manufacturing plant For the second consecutive quarter the California Air Resource Board certified that RNG in the state recorded a negative carbon intensity https www rngcoalition com infographic The LCFS system is currently adopted in California Oregon and British Columbia https thejacobsen com news items states considering lcfs The State of Washington is planning to adopt it by 2023 and some plans exist to make it a Federal plan RNG creates a further revenue stream for farming communities thus from an electoral point of view few politicians would be brave enough to do not support it A sign that the current Secretary of Energy is fully aware of the benefits of RNG for the HD truck sector is contained in the news http biomassmagazine com articles 17864 doe offers 61 4 million for biofuel bioenergy projects of the grant of 61 4 million from the DoE for biofuels and RNG R amp D projects Therefore it becomes clear why later in April 2021 Clean Energy Fuel the largest network of CNG amp LNG stations in the US partially owned by French oil company Total committed to sell 100 of Renewable Natural Gas by 2025 announced a supply agreement with Amazon https www businesswire com news home 20210419005219 en Clean Energy Signs Agreement with Amazon for Low and Negative Carbon RNG The deal is remarkable for the industry for a number of reasons CLNE owns or manage around 550 stations and Amazon agreed to use 27 of them and to further upgrade or build additional 19 stations The total amount of stations at non exclusive service of Amazon should be around 46 In 2020 CLNE sold 382 million gallons in 2019 around 400 million gallons for around 48000 vehicles associated with them On average in a no COVID time a Clean Energy Fueling station provided around 0 7 million gallons per year If we assume that on average a Natural Gas truck consumes around 8000 gallons per year 400 000 000 48 0000 but average is more like 11 000 gallons per year it is easy to see that the 700 trucks bought by Amazon would consume less than 5 6 million gallons thus absorbing just 8 stations volumes As a reminder we are talking about upgrading or using 46 stations six times this amount It is evident that Amazon thinks that in the future there will be many more natural gas trucks on US roads They are so certain about this that Amazon also requested to have the option to be part of the shareholders of Clean Energy Fuels Indeed Amazon was able to get the possibility to buy through warrants in a 10 year time span a total of 53 million shares of the fueling station company at a strike price of 13 49 per share It is quite obvious that the intention of Amazon is to profit from the growth of natural gas mobility in the incoming years selling those shares at higher price to pay the cost of fuel of its logistic operations Therefore the most important point of the discussion is what Cummins will do with the Cummins Westport JV I think that Cummins has not any interest in disappointing its smaller partner Given that the other half of the JV has for each of the parties a price equal to 130 of TTM operative revenues around 130 million two important considerations need to be done Cummins can buy the other half but it is quite clear that a non competition agreement for the spark ignition engines has to be included in the deal In this case the overall price must be considerable higher given that the trucks sector may dramatically shift towards RNG mobility and further opportunities subsist in the diesel train conversion see Optifuels and Cummins Westport Even if Westport agrees to a non competition agreement with Cummins in the spark ignition NG segment and let s say receives 250 million or more HPDI 2 0 can still represent a threat for both the diesel and LNG offering of Cummins in North America HPDI is compression ignited technology currently licensed to VOLVO and Weichai Both the companies have the option to sell the engines globally VOLVO is a client of Cummins Westport in North America Therefore Cummins has four different options Renew the JV asking Westport to put HPDI 2 0 license on the table Buy the other half of the JV asking Westport to put HPDI 2 0 on the table and granting higher compensation than in the first case Buy Westport but current and future valuations may decrease the likelihood of this scenario Buy the other half of the JV saying goodbye to Westport In the fourth scenario it is clear that Westport may fall in the hands of Weichai in a matter of seconds Weichai could either buy a stake in Westport like they did in regards to Ballard 20 of the share capital and Ceres Power 25 share capital or favor a merger between Ballard and Westport Ballard valuation may favor the possibility of a merger of the two Vancouver based companies The merger would create a Canadian champion in the alternative fuels mobility landscape that will own the best PEM fuel cell technology the HPDI 2 0 patents and the control of the hydrogen and methane components manufacturing lines valves etc for the automotive sector The merger would be relatively cheap for Weichai and Cummins will have a powerful rival right at the North American border As a reminder the previous CFO of Ballard Mr Guglielmin is now a director of Westport Cummins CEO said in the last cc today that natural gas has a significant role to play That s the end of the post and that s all I got for you Now you can return to the act of holding your wife s hair while she goes down on your neighbor Thank me later My

protect retail and market from destructive short selling in preparation for Thursday s House Financial Services Committee hearing ,Heya WSB some info came out of Better Markets that s worth sharing in light of the upcoming House Financial Services Committee hearing this Thursday It s a good opportunity for retail investors to get better informed and get empowered Better Markets is an independent non profit whose focus is the promotion of public interest in the financial markets They re like the watchdogs of Wall Street post 2008 They re proposing the following recommendations to the SEC I m merely copy pasting the meat of their most recent report amp x200B Public Transparency gt The SEC must dramatically improve short interest reporting All short interests must be publicly reported in a 1 timely 2 comprehensive and 3 standalone manner designed to maximize the informational value that rationalizes short selling and other short interests in the securities markets gt gt Recommendations gt gt 1 Form 13F The SEC must implement a long overdue Form 13F filing requirement for institutional investment managers that 1 includes a standalone short interest schedule as a supplement to existing long position reporting 2 contemplates public reporting of all threshold short interests including those involving securities lending borrowing options and equity derivatives positions and 3 is published on at least a monthly as opposed to quarterly basis with an appropriately minimal delay calibrated solely to protect trading strategies gt gt 2 Securities Lending Reporting The SEC must implement section 984 b of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 which instructed the commission to increase the transparency of information available to brokers dealers and investors with respect to the loan or borrowing of securities and which was supposed to be completed n ot later than 2 years after the date of the Dodd Frank Act s enactment in July 2010 1This flagrant disregard of a Congressional directive must be remedied with a securities lending regulatory and public reporting framework see also comments relating to the consolidated audit trail below gt gt 3 FINRA Broker Dealer Reporting The SEC must require the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA to implement daily aggregate short interest reporting for broker dealers as it has implemented for the equity trade reporting facilities see footnote 2 below Presently FINRA Rule 4560 requires broker dealers to report total short positions in all customer and proprietary accounts in all equity securities only twice per month As above we encourage the SEC and FINRA to require broker dealer short interest reporting with an appropriately minimal delay gt gt 4 FINRA Equity Trade Reporting Facilities amp Exchange Reporting The SEC must implement regulations requiring FINRA to continue to publish daily short interest volume and monthly short interest transaction files in a format and with content acceptable to the SEC The SEC must similarly implement regulations requiring the securities exchanges to continue to publish daily short interest volume and monthly short interest transaction files in a format and with content acceptable to the SEC The SEC must also consider consolidating information in a descriptive monthly short sale report and making some portion of the data available through its data visualization tools Regulatory Safeguards gt The SEC must ensure that short selling is subject to a reasonable unambiguous regulatory framework that restricts and deters short selling practices that interfere with fair orderly and efficient markets gt gt Recommendations gt gt 5 Eliminate Market Maker Exception to the Locate Requirement The SEC must institute a broad prohibition on naked short selling see Appendix A below and abandon the market making exception to the Locate Requirement in Regulation SHO 3 That loophole permits the largest proprietary trading firms to engage in naked short selling on the theory that it facilitates trading in hard to borrow securities However the SEC s settlement regulations with respect to mandatory buy ins already provide special accommodations to market makers that cannot close out their short positions within the failure to delivery FTD close out timeframe gt gt 6 Short Position Accountability and Limits The SEC must implement a net short position accountability and position limits framework along with a special filing requirement for market participants that have net short positions at least in hard to borrow equities deemed excessive i e exceeding an SEC determined threshold relative to the total tradeable float in a security Stocks experiencing aggregate short interest in excess of 90 percent of the tradeable float in the security for example should trigger imposition of this position limits framework gt gt 7 Uptick Rule The SEC should reinstitute the Uptick Rule which ameliorated price declines associated with short selling for almost 70 years without significant effects on the development of the U S capital markets The SEC s elimination of that rule prior to the 2008 financial crisis was unnecessary and poorly conceived Although there is merit to the Alternative Uptick Rule we are not persuaded that a single day 10 percent downturn in a company s share price should be required to reinstate uptick restrictions on short selling Operational Integrity gt The SEC must ensure that operational integrity is maintained throughout the clearing and settlement system gt gt Recommendations gt gt 8 Mandatory Buy Ins and Punitive Fee Assessments The SEC must continue to require clearing broker dealers to immediately close out failures to deliver FTDs during the settlement process 4which should include mandatory 1 buy in processes on T 2 for short sales in a T 1 settlement framework and 2 fee assessments designed to punish and deter firms with FTDs that are not closed out timely under Regulation SHO Fee assessments should climb as the outstanding period for a short selling related FTD lengthens gt gt 9 T 1 Settlement The SEC must shorten the settlement cycle to T 1 i e trade date plus one trading day which would reduce operational and other risks in our settlement system including risks associated with FTDs and naked short selling The securities markets currently operate on a T 2 time horizon Because margin models at the National Securities Clearing Corporation account for risks during the period of time that elapses between the trading and settlement of transactions a shorter time horizon for settlement like T 1 would not only reduce risks to the clearing and settlement system but also generally reduce liquidity demands and risks to clearing firms that must meet margin calls calibrated to the risks and volatilities expected for the firm s overall portfolio during the unsettled risk period In addition to these benefits the shortened T 1 settlement period may diminish the number of unsettled transactions arising from the re lending process which has been characterized as creating temporary phantom or duplicate shares Monitoring and Enforcement gt The SEC must ensure that the Division of Enforcement DOE has the information to protect investors and markets and punish and deter unlawful short selling practices including manipulation and fraud gt gt Recommendation gt gt 10 Consolidated Audit Trail Short selling information will be part of the CAT once operationalized The SEC therefore must promptly implement the long overdue and industry delayed CAT so that its divisions can analyze timely and comprehensive information on short selling for oversight enforcement and policy purposes See our CAT fact sheet The SEC also must require regulatory and public reporting of certain information relating to securities lending activities Thus it must explore requiring securities lending reporting as part of the CAT Conclusion gt Recent data analyzed by the SEC suggests that short selling may comprise as much as half of all listed equity share volume 5Despite this fact the practice is subject to a rudimentary regulatory framework Our recommendations for reasonable short selling transparency requirements regulatory safeguards operational improvements and monitoring and enforcement measures would enhance the current SEC framework protect fair orderly and efficient trading level the informational and trading playing field for investors and better serve issuers companies investors and the purposes of the securities markets i e to support capital formation and the integrity of the price discovery process that informs capital allocation gt gt Unless the SEC makes significant progress in each of the four identified areas certain short selling practices in the U S securities markets will continue to undermine investor and issuer confidence as well as the fundamental purposes of our markets Just passing important information forward that I am not skilled enough to summarize properly

killer earnings that did NOT include their recent mining explosion,My one and only DD on here was for GO a couple years back https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments cqih7t dd buy go calls when it had its first earnings which were killer profitable and it initially barely went up It then went up 20 in 2 days after my post Dudes made as much as 600 from that I m seeing a similar opportunity in SOS a company involved in several different areas but who has been diving head first into er digital mining can t use certain words in posts They ve had press releases for buying mining equipment but not about how much they are actually mining Here s the earnings release for 2020 they just put out this morning https www prnewswire com news releases sos ltd announces fiscal year 2020 financial results 301284523 html https www prnewswire com news releases sos ltd announces fiscal year 2020 financial results 301284523 html That does NOT include any revenue involving mining as they only got started with that in 2021 and this is for fiscal 2020 Given the shitty year many businesses had in 2020 this one was growing by leaps and bounds The general sentiment among bulls is wait til people discover they are also mining now and I agree with that There s been speculation based on the hash rate they re supposed to be able to do with the rigs they ve PR d about purchasing that they d be mining 3 5 bit a day and 63 a day of coin 2 You can do the math on how that would annualize and remember that their revenue last year with the REST of their businesses was 50 3 million per that press release Now consider their market cap is only about 800 mil and they re a digital business Look at the revenue multiples other companies are at including in the same space like RIOT and MARA and if what they are able to mine is accurate this company would have annualized revenue of only about 1 4 of their market cap at current prices lol imagine the prices of a month or a year from now and unlike some shitty brick amp mortar operation with tons of overhead they are a digital company Basically no reason whatsoever to have this low of a market cap AND it s heavily shorted so it could fly in a heartbeat as it has already done once before That said here s what s been holding them back lately 1 Hindenburg did a short report on them a while back We all sure love them don t we They think the company is a complete sham You can see lately the short manipulation that s been happening given what s been happening to coin 2 s price Feel free to look at their report and see what you think 2 They re a Chinese company Which yes means probably greater risk they re fraudulent in some aspect but I don t want to even think about how much China has absolutely been reaping the rewards of getting into bit etc several years back when they first generated the explosion that saw that price go over 1000 which seemed crazy at the time Anyone need a time machine Point being this is one area where it s no surprise to see a Chinese company with a strong focus in it 3 They kind of suck at PR both timing as well as what they release It s added to the bear perspective that they re a sham Personally I think it s likely just a case that they don t really have any great marketing minds among them to really navigate PR well 4 They ve had offerings in the past No surprise it s common for smaller companies to get cash to expand and that s what they re keen on doing per their miner purchases 5 Some would say rather than invest in this invest in what they mine instead I would normally agree if their price wasn t held down extremely low at the moment Who gives 5 possible negatives in a DD But I feel despite these things they re primed and ready to get movin on up There are pretty active communities of investors already into it on Reddit and places like StockTwits and if it builds good momentum it ll be hard to stop This DD will not dive further into this like how they might compare to RIOT MARA and other similar companies in terms of hash rate vs market cap TA or whatever else Any other SOS stans feel free to chime in on additional stuff to look at to back up this play The plays positions Conservative welcomed by the SOS bulls Buy shares Short and simple don t have to time anything can get in piecemeal if you re worried it ll go down a bit more from here before it goes up Moderate Month out or even quarterly out calls probably 5 or 6 with hopes it will go to 6 8 in the next month Would save you from having to time it like FDs and could be more lucrative than shares Risky what I m doing currently 40x about to add 60 more depending on if it dips more or not 4 50c 5 7 currently ATM leg into spreads when it goes up or just get spreads straightaway with selling 5c 5 7 for a nickel to a dime and just hope for it to be above 5 by the end of the week I think this will have an EOD AH PM lift once word gets out so I am playing the extreme short term It s been moving at a snail s pace lately so even with today s boost options are relatively cheap considering this at one point in the past 6 months exploded up past 10 Retarded 5c 5 7 or 5 14 FDs Here and there you ll get the 5 7s for a nickel and if it has one of its explosions and goes to 5 or beyond by tomorrow you d be sitting pretty anything else and you d be lighting money on fire so caveat emptor I don t have the guts for doing that but feel free if you like tl dr Message in a Bottle is The Police s best song and sending out an SOS is in the lyrics so calls on SOS

moment I m not sold on their premium price valuation appears to primarily be from securing prime contractor status on two thirds of the Nuclear Triad program No major concerns defense spending isn t going anywhere Although unlikely at the very worst I anticipate flat growth for FY 21 Disappointed to see OmegA heavy lift rocket is dead in the water but I understand why i e there is already market saturation in the heavy lift rocket space 12 month price target 370 slightly lower than analysts consensus price target of 378 The reasoning for my slightly lower 12 month price target is because of the political and public push back commentary on ICBMs we are starting to see from certain people groups additionally the land based portion of Triad is probably the least useful from a strategic standpoint the sea portion is more survivable the air portion is more flexible My sentiment is that NOC will see modest growth during FY 2021 there are plenty of ongoing awards contracts that are already on the books that will lead to this modest single digit growth during FY 2021 Beyond FY 21 growth can ramp up as the ICBM and B 21 projects become accretive and the Space Systems segment expands At this time the biggest bear case for NOC is the political social scrutinization of the ICBMs BA potentially contesting the ICBM contract award I don t think this is likely and loss of market expansion into Space due to competition not likely Additionally I always question the bear impact ESG investing investors will have on this industry Boeing BA What a colossal piece of shit this company is Wendy herself wouldn t even be caught with BA shares I d rather wipe a bobcat s ass with sandpaper in a phone booth than buy BA Dry amp Drab overview of BA I m not even going to dive into a BA DD I m just going to list why they suck harder than a 2 whore in church Air Force Secretary accused BA of being overly focused on its commercial cash cows to the detriment of its defense projects To be fairer than a mythical maiden Defense and Space only make up 25 of their total sales and Commercial accounts for 60 The KC 46 Pegasus tanker BA has compromised this project from start to half assed finish In the early 2000s the Pentagon proposed leasing tankers based on Boeing s 767 commercial design but a congressional investigation revealed corruption leading up to that decision The leasing plans were canceled and there was an executive overhaul at Boeing upper management was so rotten it d knock a buzzard off a shit wagon In 2008 the 767 design lost out to a modified Airbus A330 designed by Airbus and Northrop Grumman but the decision was overturned Why Because as usual Boeing bitched and moaned louder than your wife s boyfriend The eventual contract with Boeing capped the Air Force s spending on the KC 46 project at 4 9B and required BA to pay for overages Now let me tell ya if brains were leather BA management wouldn t have enough to saddle a junebug these cucks have spent 5B in pre tax charges due to fines and cost overruns as of January 2021 This means BA has paid as much in cost overruns for the KC 46 program as the Air Force invested in the tanker s development these guys are dumber than a sack of rocks at a water factory So initial delivery was slated for August 2017 but the first plane didn t show up until January 2019 Then about a month later the fleet was grounded because inspectors found tools and construction debris inside the completed aircraft The pilots even came out and said they were not flying the planes due to debris issues and lack of confidence in the plane The Air Force in 2018 noted several deficiencies that Boeing needs to work out before deliveries can begin Notably issues with the tanker s remote vision system have caused the process of extending the boom used to refuel jets mid flight to be inconsistent leading to the probe scratching the jet s outer surface That s both dangerous for in flight operations and could potentially rub the stealth coating off fighters making them more vulnerable in combat Boeing believes software refinements and not a design overhaul can solve most of the issues As of 2021 the KC 46 has four remaining category 1 deficiencies two involving the Remote Vision System that are expected to be resolved when a new version of the system is rolled out in 2023 a problem with the stiffness of the air refueling boom that keeps it from being able to refuel some of the planes in the service s inventory and an issue with fuel leaks fucking fuel leaks in a tanker are you serious Although issues with the boom may be on the Air Force s dime Pentagon and Military Branch officials management have issues with BA s shoddy military products Some of its most high profile military platforms mainstays like the AH 64 Apache helicopter the F 18 Super Hornet fighter and the F 15 Strike Eagle were developed outside of Boeing and came to the company via acquisition not internal development Don t get me wrong BA was been awarded some very nice i e contracts recently 9B Air Force trainer jets probably low margin due to BA s aggressively low bid 2 4B Air Force helicopter competition 800M Navy carrier based drones 43M Navy unmanned subs United Launch Alliance ULA joint venture between LMT and BA However until BA can show better strength via contract awards in size and number and novel designs I do not consider them a good play for the Aerospace Sector in regards to defense spending not even as a value play furthermore I don t even consider BA a buy when factoring

Disclaimer I have a long position in VVNT This is not financial advice and I am not receiving any compensation whatsoever from anyone for this post I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving any compensation for it I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article amp x200B Intro I want to bring your attention to Vivint Smart Home VVNT The stock has been getting absolutely hammered year to date around 50 because it was spun out of a former SPAC and everyone is selling SPACs now While some SPACs and resultant companies are insanely stupid this one is not It now trades at 10 77 per share which is barely off the price it listed at last year 10 or 7 75x Adj CY20 EV EBITDA I think fair value today is more like 25 10x Adj CY22 EV EBITDA and has the potential to double or triple that over the next few years The cap is small 2 5bn the float is extremely low 20 of total and short interest is around 5 11 days to cover meaning when the stock moves the stock moves big amp x200B Background and Market Overview Vivint Smart Home is a player in the smart home industry They earn money on subscriptions recurring revenue and equipment sales You may have seen one of their recent commercials with Snoop Dogg link https www youtube com watch v xTnFHCNLrAE It s one of the most respected players in the industry and is differentiated by handling the whole stack themselves installation technology maintenance services etc like an Apple product for smart homes In terms of competition there isn t anyone else that provides full service do it for me DIFM installation for smart home technologies They obviously compete with DIY suppliers Amazon Google Alarm com but in all likelihood market will move towards DIFM as the preferred solution as the technology becomes more complex and integrated Other traditional security vendors are trying to break into the space think ADT which partnered with Google recently but their solutions don t appear to be as fully integrated and comprehensive as Vivint s This is an attractive market that Vivint has first mover advantage in and that is likely to take off over the next decade as IoT adoption accelerates amp x200B Why was the Stock Trading at 10 after the SPAC and Why is the Stock Stupid Cheap Today The 2020 SPAC and Solvency Risk When the company de SPAC d in 2020 nobody had any clue if their business model transition would allow them to be solvent The company had been bleeding cash for years because they used to finance the smart home equipment themselves and therefore had to raise debt on their own balance sheet In 2017 2018 with the help of Blackstone as their PE sponsor they made a transition to allow the consumer to finance the equipment sale and the financing company would give them the cash upfront Ever since the company has been beating and generating lots of cash flow every quarter Solvency is no longer an issue I repeat despite the negative shareholder s equity which Buffett admits is not that important this company is no longer a going concern How the New Operating Model Revitalized its Unit Economics The other concern regarding Vivint was that its operating model was just not that attractive At the time subscriber acquisition costs SAC were way too high due in large part because they had to finance the equipment for them So even though lifetime value LTV looked attractive LTV SAC looked weak Over the course of 2020 we saw the success of their new business model SAC per new subscriber fell 86 from 1018 to 139 Subscriber growth is now meaningfully accretive to the business amp x200B amp x200B Processing img bweb9mqqddx61 Isn t the Smart Home Market Mature The home security market definitely is ADT hasn t seen net subscriber growth in years It probably matured at around 25 penetration But what simpletons don t realize is that security is just one vertical in the smart home market which will all be consolidated into players like Vivint The smart home market is expected to grow almost 13 CAGR through 2025 to reach 47bn in the US And this company has only 330mm in revenue and 1 8mm subscribers Very underpenetrated And the CEO thinks household penetration can reach upwards of 80 over the next 5 10 years So we re in the early innings After all Vivint s subscriber base has been growing high single digits for many years now and next year guidance reaffirms that this trend should remain in place They are building the brand and they are growing And yet the company trades on the same multiple as ADT which isn t growing at all and Verizon AT amp T which are also barely growing and are exposed to a mature market with extreme competition amp x200B amp x200B https preview redd it dsle3jvoddx61 png width 1946 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3d80c4a9eac3875176ece92de53b14eb79a20da7 Adjacent Verticals Give Vivint Opportunities to Expand TAM In the same way Tesla is in a perfect position to sell auto insurance given it has all the data on the driver the same can be said for home insurance and Vivint And similarly Vivint is a prime candidate to enter the ageing in place market i e smart home for old people who need monitoring While the insurance vertical is probably not too far away there has been no commentary on when ageing in place business might take off But either way the market currently gives no credit to Vivint for these potential adjacencies Big revenue and TAM expansion opportunities amp x200B What About the Capital Structure It s true that public float is low 20 and Blackstone holds a huge ownership in the company which risks them dumping it into the market But lockups expired a long time ago and Blackstone is holding on Some of the other venture funds have all reduced their positions now In addition management has been buying in The negative shareholder s equity and leverage are concerns but given their new ability to generate and scale free cash flow Vivint should have no trouble balancing investment and paying debt down amp x200B So why is the stock trading as if we never learned this information Because the market is freaking out And when the market is afraid I ll be buying
