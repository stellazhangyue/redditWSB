Shift Technologies is a San Francisco based online automotive dealership that allows consumers to purchase their vehicles completely hassle free and online Shift s online platform concentrates on peer to peer transactions and integrates a streamline of services that regulates the detailing of the cars test drives which they bring to you vehicle purchase documentation auto coverage and more To date Shift is backed by 26 investors and 4 lead investment firms Lithium Motors BMW iVentures Goldman Sachs and DN Capital The total funding capital accrued is 299M of which 40M was collected in April 2019 in a series D funding Despite falling short of revenue and EPS expectations in the previous quarter Shift has demonstrated resilience as a smaller but growing competitor in the automotive space In October 2020 Shift IPO ed in Q3 following a reverse merger with Insurance Acquisition and s p a c This was a fair play to mitigate the expense of a traditional IPO filing and a strategic step to increase early exposure in the market and to increase liquidity As part of the merger agreements Insurance Acquisition will acquire 6M Class A shares of Shift when the underlying reaches a specific price that is undisclosed Since its IPO at 9 85 the underlying has fluctuated between 14 91 highs and 6 40 lows As of today January 25 2021 the share price sits at 8 85 Retail investors and stock exchange media outlets scrutinized Shift for its untimely decision to go public in the midst of a pandemic but CEO George Arison explained that the s p a c route is an inexpensive more deregulated and shortcut to tap into the public market Arison also wanted to take advantage of the increased liquidity potential via the s p a c route as funding opportunities are more accessible than the standard seed company scouting for investors The 299M funded to date can cover Shift for an extended period of time and to ride out the pandemic shortcomings As reported in the balance sheet Shift has net annual liabilities of 44M and while not yet profitable as it is still in its early stages of breaking into this tough industry against major competitors it can sustain for at least another 2 3 years assuming expenditures and revenues stabilize at these pandemic levels My opinion is that Shift has grown out of its speculative phase as a seedling private automotive company and into a company that is making notable gains in market share and consumer awareness One fascinating statistic about Shift is their high EBITDA profit margins 15 20 for buying selling respectively For comparison Carvana brings in 7 7 Vroom 4 9 depreciation from 2018 2019 and 6 7 for the average online automotive company This may be associated with the brand reputation that Shift has established over a number of years through effective advertisements on diversified social platforms through its excellent user experience and user interface and the accessibility and usability of its mobile application and website Apart from this the user demographics on Shift is centralized around the younger generation of car buyers that value convenience streamlined application services and its assisted technologies to make the process of car buying simple easy and stress free I think the greatest thing that sets Shift apart from its competitors is really in its under appreciated market capitalization and its attractive price to sales ratio floating at 4 56 Shift continues to show that it can stay in business despite pandemic conditions and is expected to see increases in revenue EPS and margins This makes sense because in person dealership transactions have plummeted between 15 45 in most areas creating a stagnated situation on site with lower demand all while redirecting traffic towards online sales and third party insurance companies All in all Shift is a great prospective investment with high yield opportunities Its 8 92 price tag is especially attractive to small time retail traders with lower investment capital of course this is just a psychological effect of diluted shares My price target for Shift in 2021 contingent on the company achieving some or any level of growth conservatively is 18 19 This valuation is based on a price to sales ratio of 8 which aligns well with some of the smaller cap competitions in this space Another noteworthy mention is that Shift is still largely undetected by the market only driving in 1 25M in volume With a share price below 10 these volumes are significantly lower than stocks within this category price cohort Short interest as of 12 31 20 sits at 4 78M shares which is 4x the average daily volume Should this stock become widely traded and associated with its counterpart competition i e Carvana Vroom etc we may see a compelling case of short squeeze If you check the reviews online they blow both Carvana and Carmax out of the water On the contrary I think Shift needs to expand its inventory by partnering with companies that have great synergies such as an EBay Motors Autotempest Cars com etc Partnerships with insurance companies are also viable options as insurance companies are also seeking out opportunities to reach wfh professionals Even an Uber deal to subsidize some of the cost of owning a pre owned vehicle strictly for Ubering would be ideal I will have greater insight into this company in the coming weeks and will be happy to share my findings Happy trading and let s get this money TL DR An incredibly undervalued and streamlined platform for buying and selling used cars that is way ahead of the competitors Offers the perfect alternative to in person dealerships with free test drives that they bring it to you and 150 point inspections Great margins on every car Loads of funding Has some growing pains to get through but likely won t be an underdog for much longer STRAP IN

date Shift is backed by 26 investors and 4 lead investment firms Lithium Motors BMW iVentures Goldman Sachs and DN Capital The total funding capital accrued is 299M of which 40M was collected in April 2019 in a series D funding Despite falling short of revenue and EPS expectations in the previous quarter Shift has demonstrated resilience as a smaller but growing competitor in the automotive space In October 2020 Shift IPO ed in Q3 following a reverse merger with Insurance Acquisition and s p a c This was a fair play to mitigate the expense of a traditional IPO filing and a strategic step to increase early exposure in the market and to increase liquidity As part of the merger agreements Insurance Acquisition will acquire 6M Class A shares of Shift when the underlying reaches a specific price that is undisclosed Since its IPO at 9 85 the underlying has fluctuated between 14 91 highs and 6 40 lows As of today January 25 2021 the share price sits at 8 85 Retail investors and stock exchange media outlets scrutinized Shift for its untimely decision to go public in the midst of a pandemic but CEO George Arison explained that the s p a c route is an inexpensive more deregulated and shortcut to tap into the public market Arison also wanted to take advantage of the increased liquidity potential via the s p a c route as funding opportunities are more accessible than the standard seed company scouting for investors The 299M funded to date can cover Shift for an extended period of time and to ride out the pandemic shortcomings As reported in the balance sheet Shift has net annual liabilities of 44M and while not yet profitable as it is still in its early stages of breaking into this tough industry against major competitors it can sustain for at least another 2 3 years assuming expenditures and revenues stabilize at these pandemic levels My opinion is that Shift has grown out of its speculative phase as a seedling private automotive company and into a company that is making notable gains in market share and consumer awareness One fascinating statistic about Shift is their high EBITDA profit margins 15 20 for buying selling respectively For comparison Carvana brings in 7 7 Vroom 4 9 depreciation from 2018 2019 and 6 7 for the average online automotive company This may be associated with the brand reputation that Shift has established over a number of years through effective advertisements on diversified social platforms through its excellent user experience and user interface and the accessibility and usability of its mobile application and website Apart from this the user demographics on Shift is centralized around the younger generation of car buyers that value convenience streamlined application services and its assisted technologies to make the process of car buying simple easy and stress free I think the greatest thing that sets Shift apart from its competitors is really in its under appreciated market capitalization and its attractive price to sales ratio floating at 4 56 Shift continues to show that it can stay in business despite pandemic conditions and is expected to see increases in revenue EPS and margins This makes sense because in person dealership transactions have plummeted between 15 45 in most areas creating a stagnated situation on site with lower demand all while redirecting traffic towards online sales and third party insurance companies All in all Shift is a great prospective investment with high yield opportunities Its 8 92 price tag is especially attractive to small time retail traders with lower investment capital of course this is just a psychological effect of diluted shares My price target for Shift in 2021 contingent on the company achieving some or any level of growth conservatively is 18 19 This valuation is based on a price to sales ratio of 8 which aligns well with some of the smaller cap competitions in this space Another noteworthy mention is that Shift is still largely undetected by the market only driving in 1 25M in volume With a share price below 10 these volumes are significantly lower than stocks within this category price cohort Short interest as of 12 31 20 sits at 4 78M shares which is 4x the average daily volume Should this stock become widely traded and associated with its counterpart competition i e Carvana Vroom etc we may see a compelling case of short squeeze If you check the reviews online they blow both Carvana and Carmax out of the water On the contrary I think Shift needs to expand its inventory by partnering with companies that have great synergies such as an EBay Motors Autotempest Cars com etc Partnerships with insurance companies are also viable options as insurance companies are also seeking out opportunities to reach wfh professionals Even an Uber deal to subsidize some of the cost of owning a pre owned vehicle strictly for Ubering would be ideal I will have greater insight into this company in the coming weeks and will be happy to share my findings Happy trading and let s get this money TL DR An incredibly undervalued and streamlined platform for buying and selling used cars that is way ahead of the competitors Offers the perfect alternative to in person dealerships with free test drives that they bring it to you and 150 point inspections Great margins on every car Loads of funding Has some growing pains to get through but likely won t be an underdog for much longer STRAP IN

extension of my DD series on GME If you haven t read them and have time they will provide some background on my previous predictions some of which have already come true Previous Important Posts EndGame Part 1 https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kwb827 gme endgame dtc infinity DTC Infinity covered the short positions the float and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven t closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close EndGame Part 2 https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l0czgs gme endgame part 2 cohen market cap potential covered Cohen fair market cap analysis and potential investors in which I talked about the amazing mid to long term potential for GME After the Citron tweet I shared this fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l1tg88 gme how shorts manipulated you and how you can be on the day of the tweet and offered some education on strengthening your position This one got buried and is worth reading What s happened thus far Why did GME go up on Friday The story here is more complex than paid media articles would like you to believe GME has been driven up by 3 different forces Organic buying There is a mixture of growing positive sentiment in the investor world not just WSB about GME s future There s been a lot of good due diligence shared not just on WSB but even outside for example see gmedd com The Citron Backfire Shorts were on the ropes and kept looking for hail mary s They went to Citron and coordinated a dump https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l1tg88 gme how shorts manipulated you and how you can be to try to bring the price down However this backfired Citron is so disliked in the industry that new wealth poured into GME in the face of Andrew Left s pleas Even when Benzinga brought Andrew Left on air minutes after he left they bought shares live on their show https youtu be mFiFWBrE5DE t 5104 The next day our very on u Uberkikz11 was on Benzinga https youtu be GLzTU87MJMM t 837 and more shares were bought Larger investors piling in In my EndGame Part 2 https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l0czgs gme endgame part 2 cohen market cap potential I hypothesized that we d soon see larger investors pile in Then on WSB we saw posts from a venture capitalist https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l0yzb5 a venture capital perspective on gme as well as a hedge fund investor https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l2zk5e a hedge fund managers perspective on gme Gamma squeeze Once the organic buying started we rolled into a gamma squeeze Many people written about the gamma squeeze so I won t repeat see this post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l2t9bf gme i think this is a gamma squeeze where dealers for an example Ultra low liquidity In EndGame part 1 I talked about how the actual actively traded shares are much lower than the reported float and share availability has been reducing driven by lots of diamond hands not just among smaller guys like us but the larger folks too I believe there were some short covers on Friday but Ortex was still estimating 71M shares short at the eod However not many people have talked about why it went down Why did GME come down Here s where things got interesting for me and something I think happened again today Monday when GME climbed up over 100 but then had a rapid reversal closing 20 above yesterday but closing below open So Friday looked like a slam dunk gamma squeeze no shorts available to short puts were getting exceedingly expensive as a short tactic What happened This is my fan fiction based on what I saw I believe market makers https www nyse com markets nyse membership took a non neutral stance and began actively shorting the stock after the second halt Market makers are responsible for maintaining liquidity and functioning in the stock market but they also have abilities that others don t for example they are legally allowed to naked short for liquidity purposes They also have the ability to halt trading There were two halts in the day on Friday First when GME was up 69 heh heh and then a few minutes later when it kept climbing after the first halt was relaxed Note that at the time of the first halt the bid ask spread was 10 on the underlying a huge signal that there just were not enough shares to buy However after the second halt something strange happened Whereas a few minutes prior there were no sellers willing to sell their shares below 75 within 15 minutes after the halt there were sellers at 70 65 60 and 56 Where did these sellers come from amp x200B Processing img tt5zodp6pkd61 My speculation This was a coordinated naked short ladder attack In this type of attack short seller A sells to short seller B who then turns around to short seller A at a lower price etc and with a very small amount of capital you can wreck the momentum of a stock and make people think that others are running for the exits Notice how the stock dropped from a high of 75 on Friday to below 60 the highest expiring SP for the 1 22 options and stayed tight in range for the rest of the day Now for compliance reasons MM are required to be neutral by EOD so 20 minutes before close MMs had to buy back all their short positions which led to the strong close above 60 All this led me to believe that the real fair market price for GME was above 65 Without the market makers interference GME would have closed higher A repeat on Monday The short ladder attack repeated on Monday GME opened strong above 90 and quickly climbed to a high above 155 before it was halted immediately after the halt a short ladder attack again drove the price down amp x200B Processing img qm81rd0dpkd61 Both days there were rapid and significant reversals in momentum Now I kept wondering why would MM s take the side of the shorts What s in it for them One theory was that they were not adequately hedged with the low liquidity of the stock meaning that the price was moving up too fast for them to acquire the shares they needed to But then the news hit today A new opponent enters the ring amp x200B Processing img 8htb0scgpkd61 That s right the same Citadel listed by the NYSE as one of their designated market makers https www nyse com markets nyse membership is now invested in Melvin s hedge fund and has a financial interest in the direction of GME s share price Hey media you want a manipulation story You re missing the big one Now what Shorts have pulled new dirty tactics each time they ve been pushed to the edge Paid media attacks Citron s fluff tweet coordinated shorting and now they ve got the actual people who get all the order flow on their side On the other hand GME is still up over 20 and now trading at 88 00 after hours which is well above the previous day s high amp x200B Processing img rr5qet4ipkd61 What this tells me is that GME s true price is still being suppressed They are using every tactic possible even changing the bid ask spread rules https thefly com permalinks entry php id3233043 GME IRBT NYSE changes bidask differentials on options for GameStop iRobot on options to specifically target retail s buying of options We re now playing the game against the folks who write the rules of the game Some shorts may have covered today with prices below 60 at one point they had some great opportunities to However there is no way all of the shorts who need to exit covered today The short position still lost 20 from yesterday They ve got more fingers in the dam but it s definitely cracking Also every call option purchased prior to 1 25 is ITM and profitable while every put option purchased prior to 1 25 is OTM And for some reason the SEC still doesn t want to enforce the threshold securities list for GME where it s now been on for more than 30 days in a highly covered short squeeze amp x200B https preview redd it rbrf6khjpkd61 png width 936 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 7e4f432ff02dbf475a03cc68c54a5a0f5f0de429 Margin impacts Note that at this point most brokers have increased margin on GME This means that people that are long or short on margin will need to put up capital to hold their positions This also means puts will get more expensive as people who sell puts will have to maintain 100 of the notional in their accounts to secure the put so MMs will have fewer retail sellers of puts to absorb the demand That means it s not a bad idea to sell puts to acquire shares if you re aiming for the long term and not the squeeze but keep in mind you ll need the exact same capital as if you d bought the shares so it s up to you on this For shorts a margin increase while the price is moving against you even with retracements is no good My speculation Cohen and the GME board have been strangely silent this entire run It s possible they can t say anything at all during the pre earnings quiet period but I m sure they can see what s happening MMs will continue to play dirty but at the same time they will need to continue to need to buy GME shares to delta hedge 1 29 and later ITM options as we get closer to expiry Things to be careful about As you can see this is no easy win I ve been in GME for a few months but I ve seen almost every trick in the book In addition to the suggestions I wrote about in this post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l1tg88 gme how shorts manipulated you and how you can be here s some things to be careful about Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls it can be tempting to trade up your options for higher return but be mindful of the delta impact You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don t mean to For example if you sell a 5 delta call for 2 2 delta calls that s net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage Be careful about being short any calls this week Not only do you limit your upside which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze you could end up in a nightmare scenario A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn t sell it and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play I m not specifically going to share them here because I don t want to give the ideas circulation but Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points Don t copy others and don t try to be memey Make your own decisions Stop sharing your positions publicly I know this is anti wsb and I think sharing them is great for this community but in the case of GME it s an attack vector for you Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration Remember the multiple trading halts What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn t resume for the rest of the day All your 1 29 calls would expire worthless Depending on your broker and your cash positions maybe even your ITM ones Roll or sell if you re taking profits your weeklies well before expiration Be careful about buying on margin Brokers are rapidly increasing margins If you bought on margin with 2 1 leverage and the stock went up 100 you d be in margin call even without a margin change If the broker moves margin against you you ll get to margin call faster Don t bet more than you can afford to lose I ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing remember last Monday with the short sale restriction you can be surprised by a new trick If you bet it all on weeklies all at once you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out I ve held through multiple 30 40 drawdowns in the underlying and held through a 50 drawdown today so you need to be ready for the volatility Watch out for stop loss hunts It s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares If you ve set a stop loss be really sure about it This is not financial advice do your own DD I m holding over 1M in shares and calls

a long time because it was too easy Cohen u deepfuckingvalue and Dr Burry showed that retail investors aren t going to get pegged anymore though GME is being traded at 2x their market cap Tech companies are traded at 6x on average GME pivoting to an e commerce tech company means they re now way under valued Even better On Friday 1 29 90 of the short sellers have contracts expiring at a strike price of 38 45 share Wednesday we will get updated reports on how many shares are being shorted versus outstanding shares 20 of shares are owned by insiders and can t be traded since earnings just came out So many boomers and institutions have sold naked shorts that 109 400 of outstanding shares are under contract WTF DOES THAT MEAN Basically GME has issued 68 5M total shares but dipshits decided not to buy them and sell short contracts anyways As GME higher every day smooth brains get sweatier scrambling to figure out how they can acquire real shares to cover their bullshit options plays THERE ARE MORE OPTIONS THAN STOCKS AVAILABLE THAT MEANS WHEN CONTRACTS EXPIRE OUT OF THE MONEY OTM THE ISSUER LEGALLY HAS TO GIVE THE BUYER THEIR SHARES IF THE SELLER DOESN T HAVE SHARES THEY HAVE TO BUY THEM TO COVER THEIR ASS OTHERWISE THEY MADE BIG BOY CRIME AND GO TO JAIL PEOPLE WHO OWN SHARES CAN DEMAND WHATEVER FUCKING SELL PRICE THEY WANT AND THE SHORT SELLERS WILL HAVE TO PAY THIS IS KNOWN AS A SHORT SQUEEZE AS EACH SELLER SAYS FUCK IT AND TRIES TO MINIMIZE LOSSES THEY BUY SHARES DRIVING THE PRICE UP THIS WILL CAUSE AN EXPONENTIAL INCREASE IN PRICE AKA INFINITE SHORT SQUEEZE LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO VW IN 2008 FOR REFERENCE THIS COULD BE EVEN BIGGER 1 000 SHARE IS A REALITY TL DR and ride the to infinity and beyond Wednesday the large firms will start panicking as the clock

fellow tards This is the most boring post you will never read We are now entering a potentially dangerous phase for WSB I won t repeat or cover all the various reasons why people are looking at this sub nor what they are saying This shit is out there The issue is making sure we don t tank this sub and tank our tendies Its pretty simple people who are used to making the rules and making money of the ignorance of others are on the wrong side of the trade and they don t like it and they won t take it laying down They have extremely deep pockets and can throw insane amounts of money lobbying getting talking heads on tv or lawyering up if they haven t already The narrative is pretty clear WSB is acting like a mob they are distorting the market this isn t allowed We are playing into their hands somewhat We are helping fuel their arguments If you don t want to lose this sub here s what you can do 1 Don t do dumb shit that will allow people to make legitimate complaints Simple examples a Doxxing or harrassing people e g Citron or Melvin Capital b Trying to get people to buy particular shares of one stock in a concerted effort e g Lets all buy 10 100 shares of GME at 1000 EST c Creating a Twitter account to I m not sure what the point is was 2 Don t give Reddit a reason to shut this down a Chances of SEC investigating WSB are reasonable actually taking action very small in my view For one it would be hard to show intent and prove who was doing what to the price Regulators only like to take on slam dunk cases they dont have enough resources or political capital to waste on potentially losing hands The exception is if there is a big public interest in doing so this is another reason to observe point 1 above This is not to say they won t give Reddit a call to say we think you need to sort out A B C b SEC chat misses the point The threshold for a company disowning a small part of itself is very small Reddit has 330M users WSB has 2M You do the math Never mind trying to work out how much revenue Reddit makes from people who produce our quality of meme c Any company who is aware that part of its users are breaking the law or potentially breaking the law will not hesitate to cut off the gangrene thumb No one is going to go in for bat for us for some ideals or whatever They are worried about bringing attention to the company as a whole getting regulated or civil or criminal exposure as they should be this is just normal and good governance 3 Follow the rules for the sub There are four parts here a Mods needs to tighten the rules to make it clear which conduct is not acceptable I recommend including a small banner on each thread that states something like WSB does not tolerate any market manipulation or other breaches of law and those who do so will be instantly permabanned This can be hyperlinkED link to the rules or even SEC website b But then and this is important the rules must be enforced Whenever you have a compliance program in place a regulator wants to see the compliance program was reasonable to achieve its required outcome e g Not breaking the law and that it was enforced in fact If you have rules that are not enforced its almost worse than having no rules c For us users don t break the fucking rules Simples d And if you see other users breaking the rules report it Sounds like some Gestapo shit but at the end of the day you either like this sub and want to protect it or you are going to miss the Tendieman We have to collectively weed out shittiness and the mods are not going to be able to do this on their own they are simply to retarded 4 Think about a serious plan B platform if this does get shut down Can t be Reddit if the powers that be decide we are done just calling it r saulbeatwets or r mallmeatnets won t fool them for long CRAZY I KNOW 5 Think about putting some tendie money aside to kick in for the mother of all lawsuits If this does go south we should think about hiring the same law firms these dudes hire and get our guys to point out every known act of manipulation and let the SEC decide who the real problem is This is how you really fight back and win 6 While I have your attention can we please try not to fuck over other retards here Its a big bad world and I can watch my own six and yep everyone needs to learn the hard way But I don t think we should be out here bitching about Melvin etc while we are trying to shaft each other If you see this shit e g false news posts on both sides of the trade etc call it out and we ll gather our pitchforks In return newbies please fucking read some shit on here before you ask the same question ad nauseum the answer is the same anyway No its defo not too late to FOMO everything you or your whole tribe owns into an extremely volatile YOLO play TL DR They are coming for this sub Don t make it easy for them follow the rules and mods enforce them Positions GME to Melvin s uranus

tards This is the most boring post you will never read was just deleted We are now entering a potentially dangerous phase for WSB I won t repeat or cover all the various reasons why people are looking at this sub nor what they are saying This shit is out there The issue is making sure we don t tank this sub and tank our tendies Its pretty simple people who are used to making the rules and making money of the ignorance of others are on the wrong side of the trade and they don t like it and they won t take it laying down They have extremely deep pockets and can throw insane amounts of money lobbying getting talking heads on tv or lawyering up if they haven t already The narrative is pretty clear WSB is acting like a mob they are distorting the market this isn t allowed We are playing into their hands somewhat We are helping fuel their arguments If you don t want to lose this sub here s what you can do 1 Don t do dumb shit that will allow people to make legitimate complaints Simple examples a Doxxing or harrassing people e g Citron or Melvin Capital b Trying to get people to buy particular shares of one stock in a concerted effort e g Lets all buy 10 100 shares of GME at 1000 EST c Creating a Twitter account to I m not sure what the point is was 2 Don t give Reddit a reason to shut this down a Chances of SEC investigating WSB are reasonable actually taking action very small in my view For one it would be hard to show intent and prove who was doing what to the price Regulators only like to take on slam dunk cases they dont have enough resources or political capital to waste on potentially losing hands The exception is if there is a big public interest in doing so this is another reason to observe point 1 above This is not to say they won t give Reddit a call to say we think you need to sort out A B C b SEC chat misses the point The threshold for a company disowning a small part of itself is very small Reddit has 330M users WSB has 2M You do the math Never mind trying to work out how much revenue Reddit makes from people who produce our quality of meme c Any company who is aware that part of its users are breaking the law or potentially breaking the law will not hesitate to cut off the gangrene thumb No one is going to go in for bat for us for some ideals or whatever They are worried about bringing attention to the company as a whole getting regulated or civil or criminal exposure as they should be this is just normal and good governance 3 Follow the rules for the sub There are four parts here a Mods needs to tighten the rules to make it clear which conduct is not acceptable I recommend including a small banner on each thread that states something like WSB does not tolerate any market manipulation or other breaches of law and those who do so will be instantly permabanned This can be hyperlinkED link to the rules or even SEC website b But then and this is important the rules must be enforced Whenever you have a compliance program in place a regulator wants to see the compliance program was reasonable to achieve its required outcome e g Not breaking the law and that it was enforced in fact If you have rules that are not enforced its almost worse than having no rules c For us users don t break the fucking rules Simples d And if you see other users breaking the rules report it Sounds like some Gestapo shit but at the end of the day you either like this sub and want to protect it or you are going to miss the Tendieman We have to collectively weed out shittiness and the mods are not going to be able to do this on their own they are simply to retarded 4 Think about a serious plan B platform if this does get shut down Can t be Reddit if the powers that be decide we are done just calling it r saulbeatwets https www reddit com r saulbeatwets or r mallmeatnets https www reddit com r mallmeatnets won t fool them for long CRAZY I KNOW 5 Think about putting some tendie money aside to kick in for the mother of all lawsuits If this does go south we should think about hiring the same law firms these dudes hire and get our guys to point out every known act of manipulation and let the SEC decide who the real problem is This is how you really fight back and win 6 While I have your attention can we please try not to fuck over other retards here Its a big bad world and I can watch my own six and yep everyone needs to learn the hard way But I don t think we should be out here bitching about Melvin etc while we are trying to shaft each other If you see this shit e g false news posts on both sides of the trade etc call it out and we ll gather our pitchforks In return newbies please fucking read some shit on here before you ask the same question ad nauseum the answer is the same anyway No its defo not too late to FOMO everything you or your whole tribe owns into an extremely volatile YOLO play TL DR They are coming for this sub Don t make it easy for them follow the rules and mods enforce them Positions GME to Melvin s uranus

mandatory rockets will be added to punctuate all of our yeah it took 2 of us to put this together 2 smooth brains is better than 1 points and make it easier to follow Reminder to everyone that we are not financial advisors and that none of this is to be considered financial advice First off big ups to u PlatNoFeatures for getting more people to notice this gem He really got the ball rolling and brought a lot of attention to the Topgolf acquisition and we thought it would be helpful to flesh out some other points in greater detail on the off chance some of you know how to read This particular post will discuss the short term bull thesis for ELY and why we think it has room to run through earnings and continue ripping up through Q1 once the Topgolf acquisition is finalized From there we hope to discuss the long term thesis for Callaway and if we see more than a passing interest in these DD s we will likely end up making this a 3 parter What Callaway Does and Owns Callaway in a sentence is a golf equipment manufacturer with strong complimentary apparel offerings They are arguably the most aggressive company in the industry fighting to gain market share as everyone in the past 3 quarters has seemed to struggle to maintain what they had Recent years have seen them become more and more of a lifestyle brand and one that is accommodative of multiple demographics unlike a Titleist Acushnet Holdings Their brands Callaway OGIO Travis Mathew Jack Wolfskin Topgolf pending Q1 2020 OGIO acquired Jan 11 2017 first foray into have a piece of the entire golf ecosystem Acquired a leader in the bag segment From golf bags to business bags to travel bags they do em all Travis Mathew acquired August 3 2017 Embodies the spirit of Southern California through progressive apparel for both work and leisure seeing strong growth recently and poised for more of it with catalysts such as signing of phenom John Rahm will have him repping the brand Jack Wolfskin Acquired November 30 2018 German apparel company that helps round out Callaway s soft goods segment by offering more intensive outdoor gear for activities ranging from hiking to biking to skiing Key note here is this was their biggest foray into the European markets and Jack Wolfskin also allows the company to expand reach into the burgeoning Chinese middle class as they also have a presence there This acquisition effectively rounds out their apparel offerings by giving them reach outside of golf Callaway Current Positioning 2 75 B Market Cap company floating around ATH having closed at 28 90 today Of the 10 analysts reporting on the stock 9 have a BUY rating and 1 has a HOLD Mean PT is 28 80 with many upward adjustments likely coming More on this later The golf club and ball industry is approximately 4 8 B as of 2019 and is expanding at roughly a 2 6 CAGR through 2025 stitched numbers together from Grandview Research In this particular segment Callaway has expanded at around 7 45 annually pulled from several 10 K Filings outpacing the industry growth and growing market share Imgur https i imgur com PKKK8k5 png Most recent PT adjustment came on 1 20 21 when Jefferies analyst raised his target to 40 citing factors such as growing demand for the sport underappreciated opportunities with the Topgolf merger and conservative estimates for Callaway itself Market Now let s take a look at just how much golf has blown up thanks to covid helping an already aggressive company take market share in a suddenly high growth industry Golf is popping note how much national golf rounds played in Q3 of 2020 went up compared to Q3 of 2019 Imgur https i imgur com TbkjezY png Piggybacking off of that 21 93 growth Callaway managed to increase golf equipment sales by 27 compared to Q3 19 to 267 3M for the quarter Obviously this is an optimistic projection but it will show wiggle room Looking at Q4 golf rounds played data we can see that there is roughly a 49 73 increase indicating if the trend holds that Callaway will increase golf equipment sales by 61 2 to 246 2 M compared to Q4 19 where they sold 152 7 M This is obviously optimistic but what it indicates is that for this segment of their quarterly business we can expect a strong beat realistically ranging from 30 60M Did I mention golf is having a great year The increase in national rounds played this year is shaping up to be 2nd on a Year over Year basis only to 96 97 when Tiger Woods brought an absurd surge of new entrants to the scene Similar to that time management in their Q3 earnings transcript said that the demographics of the new entrants are varied which means it isn t just boomers getting more time out on the green Insider Activity As you all know insider activity is one of the best tell tale signs of management confidence regarding near mid term prospects for the company BB and GME have both seen insider sales go through as stocks reached old heights with minority portions being taken off the table while the times are good For the most part their level of activity is not concerning but this is where Callaway is really looking good even compared to them ELY has rebounded from its covid lows of 7 8 per share and has now started testing new heights after announcing the Topgolf merger So the natural question you may ask is Are insiders taking their profits off the table NO In fact only one insider has sold ANY shares in 2020 according to Nasdaq data Glenn Hickey took about 40k shares off the table potentially signaling an impending retirement given his age and the lack of movement by others on the board Insider shares have gone up by a net amount of 600 000 and nobody is budging despite having lots of sweet tendies up for grabs at the current stock price Perhaps the juiciest tidbit of information we found helping to explain why insiders are HOLDING for dear life to their shares comes from the Q3 transcript Regarding the impending Topgolf merger Brian Lynch CFO And the best part is that these synergies provide upside to the financial model we provided The financial returns of this transaction are so compelling we did not need the synergies to justify the transaction That is about as bold and bullish of a statement as you will find on an earnings call Basically management thinks that this merger has so much upside on the merits of Topgolf s strength alone that they would do it even if there were no synergies to be had between the two organizations Basic Notes on Financials Keeping it quick and snappy feel free to ask more questions in the comments below 108 increase in ecommerce sales YoY Management guidance on this discusses strengthening gross margins for both the hard equipment and Soft goods amp apparel segments With their ball factory resuming operation in Q4 hard equipment gross margins are apt to also increase once the startup inefficiencies are smoothed out Multiple non recurring costs will be off the balance sheet in Q4 namely the capital intensive distribution center in Texas We can infer that their net operating expenses will see a reduction in Q4 due to the money printer going BRRR leading to a weaker dollar Likely to see positive net currency exchange rates from their operations in Europe and the rest of the world Due to some serious trimming in their budgets in response to COVID their CAPEX will likely be down about 20 M for the year Available liquidity including cash on hand as well as credit facilities increased to 630 M in Q3 2020 compared to 340 M in Q3 of 2019 We can attribute their net sales decrease as of Q3 2020 relative to as of Q3 2019 in large part to material underperformance by Jack Wolfskin being down 16 and comprising roughly a quarter of total sales On the Q3 earnings call Callaway management appeared pleased with the bounce that the apparel company had shown in Q3 and expects this to only improve going forward CEO Oliver Brewer also made sure to mention that relative to their immediate competitors Wolfskin was leading the market in the bounceback Summing it up Callaway is on a tear rebounding from the Q1 and Q2 setback they suffered at a rapid pace The competitive landscape seems to be much more defensive than Callaway in the way they are approaching the market In the short term the stock has not appeared to have priced in the merger with Topgolf even if we just look at the merits of the Topgolfs anticipated financials With the apparel segment of the business also rebounding in Q3 we can expect a strong earnings report next week to send this stock to new heights All it needs is more volume not enough eyeballs on this one at this time Stay tuned for our long term thesis and speculation on how Callaway and Topgolf getting hitched is the best thing that could happen to either

HOW WE PREVENT THAT DIRTY LAWYER TALK , Fellow tards and mod tards This is the most boring post you will never read We are now entering a potentially dangerous phase for WSB I won t repeat or cover all the various reasons why people are looking at this sub nor what they are saying The goal must be to ensure we don t tank this sub and tank our tendies Its pretty simple people who are used to making the rules and making money of the ignorance of others are on the wrong side of the trade and they don t like it and they won t take it laying down They have extremely deep pockets and can throw insane amounts of money lobbying getting talking heads on tv or lawyering up if they haven t already The narrative is pretty clear WSB is acting like a mob they are distorting the market this isn t allowed We are playing into their hands somewhat We are helping fuel their arguments If you don t want to lose this sub here s what you can do 1 Don t do dumb shit that will allow people to make legitimate complaints Simple examples a Doxxing or harrassing people e g Citron or Melvin Capital b Trying to get people to buy particular shares of one stock in a concerted effort e g Lets all buy 10 100 shares of GME at 1000 EST c Publicly representing that we are in any way an organised singular entity 2 Don t give Reddit a reason to shut this down a Chances of the SEC investigating WSB based on complaints are reasonably high actually taking action though the chance is v small in my view For one it would be hard to show intent and prove who was doing what to the price Regulators only like to take on slam dunk cases they dont have enough resources or political capital to waste on potentially losing hands The exception is if there is a big public interest in doing so this is another reason to observe point 1 above This is not to say they won t give Reddit a call to say we think you need to sort out A B C but this is v different from an enforcement action b Focuses on what the SEC might do misses the point The threshold for a company disowning a small part of itself to protect the whole is very small Reddit has 330M users WSB has 2M You do the math Never mind trying to work out how much revenue Reddit makes from people who produce our quality of meme c Any company who is aware that part of its users are breaking the law or potentially breaking the law will not hesitate to cut off the gangrene thumb No one is going to go in for bat for us for some ideals or whatever They are worried about bringing attention to the company as a whole getting regulated or civil or criminal exposure as they should be this is just normal and good governance 3 Follow the rules for the sub There are four elements here a Mods needs to tighten the rules to make it clear which conduct is not acceptable I recommend including a small banner on each thread that states something like WSB does not tolerate any market manipulation or other breaches of law and those who do so will be instantly permabanned This can be hyperlink link to the rules or even SEC website b But then and this is important the rules must be enforced Whenever you have a compliance program in place a regulator wants to see the compliance program was reasonable to achieve its required outcome e g Not breaking the law and that it was enforced in fact If you have rules that are not enforced its almost worse than having no rules c For us users don t break the rules Simples d And if you see other users breaking the rules report it Sounds like some Gestapo shit but at the end of the day you either like this sub and want to protect it or you are going to miss the Tendieman We have to collectively weed out shittiness and the mods are not going to be able to do this on their own they are simply to retarded 4 Think about a serious plan B platform if this does get shut down Can t be Reddit if the powers that be decide we are done just calling it saulbeatwets or mallmeatnets won t fool them for long 5 Think about putting some tendie money aside to kick in for the mother of all lawsuits If this does go south we should consider kickstarting a fund to hire the same law firms these dudes hire and get our guys to point out every known act of manipulation and let the SEC decide who the real problem is This is how you really fight back and win 6 While I have your attention can we please try not to take out fellow retards here Its a big bad world and I can watch my own six and yep everyone needs to learn the hard way But I don t think we should be out here bitching about Melvin etc while we are trying to shaft each other If you see this shit call it out and we ll gather our pitchforks In return newbies please f ing read some shit on here before you ask the same question ad nauseum the answer is the same anyway No its defo not too late to FOMO everything your or your tribe owns into an extremely volatile YOLO play TL DR They are coming for this sub Don t make it easy for them follow the rules and mods enforce them Positions GME to Melvin s uranus

Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom built PC systems and console controllers markets respectively and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market Corsair went public on September 23 2020 with its IPO priced at 17 valuing the company at about 1 3B Understanding the Business Value Proposition Corsair provides specialized high performance gear for gamers and streamers Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming high quality content for streamers and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly Revenue Streams Currently Corsair groups its product offering into two segments gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems Gamer and Creator Peripherals which represents around 25 of net revenue includes gaming mice keyboards and headsets streaming gear and high performance console controllers Gaming Components Systems which represents around 75 of net revenue includes computer cases power supply units PSU high performance memory products 40 of net revenue and custom built gaming systems Acquisitions and Partnerships During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei a gaming coaching platform EpocCam an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam and partnered with Pipeline a course based education platform for streamers Industry Market Size According to Jon Peddie Research the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach 40B by the end of 2020 Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1 05 CAGR until 2022 However during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10 year over year Additionally DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video game coaching market surpasses 1B Industry Fundamentals Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals Popularity of gaming is increasing According to Newzoo there are an estimated 2 7B gamers worldwide which are expected to spend 159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8 3 CAGR to exceed 200B by 2023 PC and console gaming represents 51 of the total market and mobile gaming 49 Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market Tech driven improvements in game quality Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences This in turn places increased demand on high performance computing hardware Increasing gaming and streaming engagement Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include On average video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games More than 38 of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming missed sleep is the most pervasive Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18 25 year olds The eSports and streaming flywheel The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers sponsors advertisers team owners and leagues to the eSports industry Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high performance gameplay which in turn brings more viewers Competitive Landscape amp Risks Competition The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition constant price pressure and rapid change Competition across Corsair s product offering includes Gaming keyboards and mice Logitech and Razer Headsets and related audio products Logitech Razer and HyperX Streaming gear Logitech and AVerMedia Performance controllers Microsoft and Logitech PSUs cooling solutions and computer cases Cooler Master NZXT EVGA Seasonic and Thermaltake High performance memory G Skill HyperX and Micron Pre built and custom built gaming PCs Alienware Dell Omen HP Asus Razer iBuypower and Cyberpower Competitive Strategy The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality high value added features and superior brand recognition Market Share According to NPD Group by 2020 Corsair had 1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42 of the market share from 26 in 2015 Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders however the company increased its market share in that segment from 5 in 2013 to 18 by 2020 in the US Growth Strategy Move into the Asia Pacific region The Asia Pacific Region represents a long term growth opportunity According to Newzoo they represent 54 of the global gaming community Complimentary acquisitions Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming Origin PC SCUF and Gamer Sensei They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position New Markets Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including podcasting video blogging interactive fitness remote learning and work from home which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment Threat of New Entrants Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets increased competition from well established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment e g use of Audio technica microphones by streamers Threat of Substitution A significant medium to long term risk for Corsair s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented virtual reality entertainment Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third party servers and accessed by end users over the internet requiring minimal processing power from the end user s system Through cloud computing gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high performance PC systems and components According to Grand View Research the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48 from 2020 to reach 7 2B by 2027 Additionally Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented virtual reality industry Moats There does not seem to be any relevant structural moats that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair s market share across their product offering Other Relevant Risks Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes Financial Summary Proforma Balance Sheet https postimg

eSports and streaming Company Overview Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom built PC systems and console controllers markets respectively and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market Corsair went public on September 23 2020 with its IPO priced at 17 valuing the company at about 1 3B Understanding the Business Value Proposition Corsair provides specialized high performance gear for gamers and streamers Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming high quality content for streamers and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly Revenue Streams Currently Corsair groups its product offering into two segments gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems Gamer and Creator Peripherals which represents around 25 of net revenue includes gaming mice keyboards and headsets streaming gear and high performance console controllers Gaming Components Systems which represents around 75 of net revenue includes computer cases power supply units PSU high performance memory products 40 of net revenue and custom built gaming systems Acquisitions and Partnerships During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei a gaming coaching platform EpocCam an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam and partnered with Pipeline a course based education platform for streamers Industry Market Size According to Jon Peddie Research the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach 40B by the end of 2020 Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1 05 CAGR until 2022 However during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10 year over year Additionally DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video game coaching market surpasses 1B Industry Fundamentals Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals Popularity of gaming is increasing According to Newzoo there are an estimated 2 7B gamers worldwide which are expected to spend 159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8 3 CAGR to exceed 200B by 2023 PC and console gaming represents 51 of the total market and mobile gaming 49 Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market Tech driven improvements in game quality Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences This in turn places increased demand on high performance computing hardware Increasing gaming and streaming engagement Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include On average video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games More than 38 of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming missed sleep is the most pervasive Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18 25 year olds The eSports and streaming flywheel The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers sponsors advertisers team owners and leagues to the eSports industry Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high performance gameplay which in turn brings more viewers Competitive Landscape amp Risks Competition The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition constant price pressure and rapid change Competition across Corsair s product offering includes Gaming keyboards and mice Logitech and Razer Headsets and related audio products Logitech Razer and HyperX Streaming gear Logitech and AVerMedia Performance controllers Microsoft and Logitech PSUs cooling solutions and computer cases Cooler Master NZXT EVGA Seasonic and Thermaltake High performance memory G Skill HyperX and Micron Pre built and custom built gaming PCs Alienware Dell Omen HP Asus Razer iBuypower and Cyberpower Competitive Strategy The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality high value added features and superior brand recognition Market Share According to NPD Group by 2020 Corsair had 1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42 of the market share from 26 in 2015 Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders however the company increased its market share in that segment from 5 in 2013 to 18 by 2020 in the US Growth Strategy Move into the Asia Pacific region The Asia Pacific Region represents a long term growth opportunity According to Newzoo they represent 54 of the global gaming community Complimentary acquisitions Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming Origin PC SCUF and Gamer Sensei They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position New Markets Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including podcasting video blogging interactive fitness remote learning and work from home which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment Threat of New Entrants Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets increased competition from well established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment e g use of Audio technica microphones by streamers Threat of Substitution A significant medium to long term risk for Corsair s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented virtual reality entertainment Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third party servers and accessed by end users over the internet requiring minimal processing power from the end user s system Through cloud computing gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high performance PC systems and components According to Grand View Research the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48 from 2020 to reach 7 2B by 2027 Additionally Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented virtual reality industry Moats There does not seem to be any relevant structural moats that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair s market share across their product offering Other Relevant Risks Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes Financial Summary

q flair name 3A 22Discussion 22 amp restrict sr 1 Corsair Gaming CRSR Redefining gaming eSports and streaming Company Overview Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom built PC systems and console controllers markets respectively and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market Corsair went public on September 23 2020 with its IPO priced at 17 valuing the company at about 1 3B Understanding the Business Value Proposition Corsair provides specialized high performance gear for gamers and streamers Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming high quality content for streamers and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly Revenue Streams Currently Corsair groups its product offering into two segments gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems Gamer and Creator Peripherals which represents around 25 of net revenue includes gaming mice keyboards and headsets streaming gear and high performance console controllers Gaming Components Systems which represents around 75 of net revenue includes computer cases power supply units PSU high performance memory products 40 of net revenue and custom built gaming systems Acquisitions and Partnerships During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei a gaming coaching platform EpocCam an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam and partnered with Pipeline a course based education platform for streamers Industry Market Size According to Jon Peddie Research the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach 40B by the end of 2020 Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1 05 CAGR until 2022 However during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10 year over year Additionally DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video game coaching market surpasses 1B Industry Fundamentals Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals Popularity of gaming is increasing According to Newzoo there are an estimated 2 7B gamers worldwide which are expected to spend 159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8 3 CAGR to exceed 200B by 2023 PC and console gaming represents 51 of the total market and mobile gaming 49 Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market Tech driven improvements in game quality Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences This in turn places increased demand on high performance computing hardware Increasing gaming and streaming engagement Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include On average video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games More than 38 of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming missed sleep is the most pervasive Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18 25 year olds The eSports and streaming flywheel The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers sponsors advertisers team owners and leagues to the eSports industry Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high performance gameplay which in turn brings more viewers Competitive Landscape amp Risks Competition The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition constant price pressure and rapid change Competition across Corsair s product offering includes Gaming keyboards and mice Logitech and Razer Headsets and related audio products Logitech Razer and HyperX Streaming gear Logitech and AVerMedia Performance controllers Microsoft and Logitech PSUs cooling solutions and computer cases Cooler Master NZXT EVGA Seasonic and Thermaltake High performance memory G Skill HyperX and Micron Pre built and custom built gaming PCs Alienware Dell Omen HP Asus Razer iBuypower and Cyberpower Competitive Strategy The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality high value added features and superior brand recognition Market Share According to NPD Group by 2020 Corsair had 1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42 of the market share from 26 in 2015 Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders however the company increased its market share in that segment from 5 in 2013 to 18 by 2020 in the US Growth Strategy Move into the Asia Pacific region The Asia Pacific Region represents a long term growth opportunity According to Newzoo they represent 54 of the global gaming community Complimentary acquisitions Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming Origin PC SCUF and Gamer Sensei They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position New Markets Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including podcasting video blogging interactive fitness remote learning and work from home which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment Threat of New Entrants Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets increased competition from well established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment e g use of Audio technica microphones by streamers Threat of Substitution A significant medium to long term risk for Corsair s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented virtual reality entertainment Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third party servers and accessed by end users over the internet requiring minimal processing power from the end user s system Through cloud computing gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high performance PC systems and components According to Grand View Research the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48 from 2020 to reach 7 2B by 2027 Additionally Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented virtual reality industry Moats There does not seem to be any relevant structural moats that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair s market share across their product offering Other Relevant Risks Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes Financial Summary Proforma Balance Sheet https postimg cc QHgY1ZxL https postimg cc QHgY1ZxL Income Statement https postimg cc

going to get a bunch of downvotes because it s not bullish But someone else recently posted on here that they werent seeing two sided conversations anymore and it seemed as though there were at least some people who upvoted him I have enjoyed the actual DD posts I ve found on here and thought that this was a good read so I thought I would pass along I emailed one of my best friends who runs software for his HF and asked what he thought about BB whether I should hold onto my shares I edited redacted some lines to help protect his identity and bolded a few for emphasis His fund was up almost 100 last year and as you ll see in his comments they were are long a number of other WSB stocks which I thought definitely added some credibility Anyways take it for whatever it s worth but thought I d pass along I am going to sell my BB shares at open and buy more GME the other names he recommended to me which I m going to start doing some reading on Hey man you should take whatever I say with a grain of salt as nothing I say should be considered investment advice But to give you a sense our biggest winners last year as a fund were TSLA CRWD and two companies who sell vertical software into the auto ecosystem so I d say we know both the security and auto tech space very well We also currently own GME shares which I think this still have room to run But from my vantage point the BB move is all hype and the fair value of that stock is materially lower ie somewhere in the 7 range and most likely lower Yes BB is a cyber security company now not a mobile phone company But that s nothing new You can think of the company as having 3 parts 1 non auto security endpoint management endpoint security 2 QNX autos and 3 IP licensing 1 Non auto security UEM unified endpoint management and endpoint security Cylance what competes with CRWD These businesses are getting absolutely smoked This year was the first year that BB did not appear in the top right Gartner quartile and MSFT has been eating their lunch bc their offering InTune is basically free Churn in this segment is probably 20 year and has been declining in revenue for multiple years now Meanwhile endpoint Cyclance has been a disaster This last year while the big endpoint companies Crowdstrike Carbon Black Sentinel One grew close to 100 Cylance was flat slightly down y y during the biggest endpoint boom in history Everyone from that team left post acquisition https www crn com news security cylance founder ceo stuart mcclure exits months after blackberry deal itc refresh https www crn com news security cylance founder ceo stuart mcclure exits months after blackberry deal itc refresh and they are falling way behind competitors This blended segment is going to continue to fall in revenue y y 2 QNX this is probably the best situated segment on a relative basis but still struggling The hype around the AWS announcement is way overblown QNX is not going to be on 100 of cars because of this MSFT and GOOG both have auto OEM offerings that do the same thing There is no way AWS is going to get 100 market share because no one ever gets 100 market share in anything And in particular auto OEMs are never going to want a single supplier to have 100 market share their entire supply chain is built around ensuring that doesnt happen The only reason AWS partnered with them is because they needed someone who already sold to auto OEM s to get their foot in the door GOOG already has auto relationships from Android Automotive while MSFT has a number of auto partners already signed on to their platform https azure microsoft com en us blog microsoft connected vehicle platform trends and investment areas https azure microsoft com en us blog microsoft connected vehicle platform trends and investment areas So this lets AMZN cross sell with someone and gives BB a reason to choose them Right now BB has about 30 market share of cars that on the road Even if that doubles in 6 years you d only be up to 8 10 in value because as they add ADAS customers they are losing all their infotainment customers that make up current base Also AMZN is not going to share any of the recurring revenue with BB BB has said they hope to cross sell their own new services as part of IVY and when we talk to auto customers about this they laugh at the idea that they d rather buy those services from BB over AMZN Finally QNX will not be needed on every single EV as some people claim I think the bigger market there is rather than have the security built into a proprietary OS like QNX you ll see cars start to include endpoint agents themselves ie from Crowdstrike or Sentinel One CRWD is piloting this program today with a few OEMs 3 IP Licensing this is effectively their mobile division that has transitioned from being in house to sold to 3P s Mgmt has said this is going to be flat on a forward basis and will start declining in a few years avg patent life of 10 yrs no new R amp D If you assume this is currently a 90 gross margin business then IP currently makes up 100 of the firms profits software is not yet profitable Two final notes BB s business does not generate recurring revenue This is pretty easy to tell bc every quarter the recurring ARR goes down and quarterly revenue is not at least 25 of the disclosed recurring revenue amount Also this is no longer a company at the cutting edge of technology despite what people are saying Again easy way to tell this is that R amp D has been falling every quarter since they made the Cylance acquisition two years ago How many co s do you know that are investing for the cloud new products that are spending less on R amp D every quarter So at the end of the day you have a software business that has declining revenue and is not yet profitable an auto product that is losing share on its legacy infotainment business and an IP business that is going to fall off a cliff in a couple of years Aggregate revenue is going to be rising low single digits and EBITDA growth after next year will be flat In terms of valuation dont forget to dilute the share count by 60mm shares for the convert they just issued last quarter If you give the company a generous 20x fwd EBITDA on out year bullish numbers the upside case is 10 sh while the base case is more like 5 7 If you really believed the upside case then I could see rationale for buying at 6 to play for the 10 of upside That s fair But The idea that this is a 100bn or even 20bn mkt cap is ludicrous We arent short the name bc we dont like shorting things while they are in these sort of non rational vortexes but I would strongly advise you not to put a significant portion of your money in the stock It very well may go up because it s currently a pump and dump and there s no telling how high those can go but at some point the guy stuck holding the bag is going to get screwed and I dont want it to be you Stock s can only maintain their value in the multi billion valuation range at the end of these runs if there is institutional demand to buy the next share which is what happened in TSLA and I can tell you that doesnt exist for BB north of 10 I would tell you there are much better things to put your money into We still own GME which I know is a a favorite among your friends which I think has a much better setup If you want security software exposure I would tell you we re bullish on PANW CRWD and ZS If you want auto tech exposure I d say you should look at LPRO which recently SPAC d and isn t yet followed understood by the street A couple other random longs I like right now are BABA and PENN Feel free to lmk if you have any follow up questions Glad to see you re focused on the fundamentals

first time I posted it I think it was due to some language that I have tried to remove in edit I think this is going to get a bunch of downvotes because it s not bullish But someone else recently posted on here that they werent seeing two sided conversations anymore and it seemed as though there were at least some people who upvoted him I have enjoyed the actual DD posts I ve found on here and thought that this was a good read so I thought I would pass along I emailed one of my best friends who runs software for his HF and asked what he thought about BB whether I should hold onto my shares I edited redacted some lines to help protect his identity and bolded a few for emphasis His fund was up almost 100 last year and as you ll see in his comments they were are long a number of other WSB stocks which I thought definitely added some credibility Anyways take it for whatever it s worth but thought I d pass along I am going to sell my BB shares at open and buy more GME the other names he recommended to me which I m going to start doing some reading on Hey man you should take whatever I say with a grain of salt as nothing I say should be considered investment advice But to give you a sense our biggest winners last year as a fund were TSLA CRWD and two companies who sell vertical software into the auto ecosystem so I d say we know both the security and auto tech space very well We also currently own GME shares which I think this still have room to run But from my vantage point the BB move does not reflect fundamentals and the fair value of that stock is materially lower ie somewhere in the 7 range and most likely lower Yes BB is a cyber security company now not a mobile phone company But that s nothing new You can think of the company as having 3 parts 1 non auto security endpoint management endpoint security 2 QNX autos and 3 IP licensing 1 Non auto security UEM unified endpoint management and endpoint security Cylance what competes with CRWD These businesses are getting absolutely smoked This year was the first year that BB did not appear in the top right Gartner quartile and MSFT has been eating their lunch bc their offering InTune is basically free Churn in this segment is probably 20 year and has been declining in revenue for multiple years now Meanwhile endpoint Cyclance has been a disaster This last year while the big endpoint companies Crowdstrike Carbon Black Sentinel One grew close to 100 Cylance was flat slightly down y y during the biggest endpoint boom in history Everyone from that team left post acquisition https www crn com news security cylance founder ceo stuart mcclure exits months after blackberry deal itc refresh https www crn com news security cylance founder ceo stuart mcclure exits months after blackberry deal itc refresh and they are falling way behind competitors This blended segment is going to continue to fall in revenue y y 2 QNX this is probably the best situated segment on a relative basis but still struggling The hype around the AWS announcement is way overblown QNX is not going to be on 100 of cars because of this MSFT and GOOG both have auto OEM offerings that do the same thing There is no way AWS is going to get 100 market share because no one ever gets 100 market share in anything And in particular auto OEMs are never going to want a single supplier to have 100 market share their entire supply chain is built around ensuring that doesnt happen The only reason AWS partnered with them is because they needed someone who already sold to auto OEM s to get their foot in the door GOOG already has auto relationships from Android Automotive while MSFT has a number of auto partners already signed on to their platform https azure microsoft com en us blog microsoft connected vehicle platform trends and investment areas https azure microsoft com en us blog microsoft connected vehicle platform trends and investment areas So this lets AMZN cross sell with someone and gives BB a reason to choose them Right now BB has about 30 market share of cars that on the road Even if that doubles in 6 years you d only be up to 8 10 in value because as they add ADAS customers they are losing all their infotainment customers that make up current base Also AMZN is not going to share any of the recurring revenue with BB BB has said they hope to cross sell their own new services as part of IVY and when we talk to auto customers about this they laugh at the idea that they d rather buy those services from BB over AMZN Finally QNX will not be needed on every single EV as some people claim I think the bigger market there is rather than have the security built into a proprietary OS like QNX you ll see cars start to include endpoint agents themselves ie from Crowdstrike or Sentinel One CRWD is piloting this program today with a few OEMs 3 IP Licensing this is effectively their mobile division that has transitioned from being in house to sold to 3P s Mgmt has said this is going to be flat on a forward basis and will start declining in a few years avg patent life of 10 yrs no new R amp D If you assume this is currently a 90 gross margin business then IP currently makes up 100 of the firms profits software is not yet profitable Two final notes BB s business does not generate recurring revenue This is pretty easy to tell bc every quarter the recurring ARR goes down and quarterly revenue is not at least 25 of the disclosed recurring revenue amount Also this is no longer a company at the cutting edge of technology despite what people are saying Again easy way to tell this is that R amp D has been falling every quarter since they made the Cylance acquisition two years ago How many co s do you know that are investing for the cloud new products that are spending less on R amp D every quarter So at the end of the day you have a software business that has declining revenue and is not yet profitable an auto product that is losing share on its legacy infotainment business and an IP business that is going to fall off a cliff in a couple of years Aggregate revenue is going to be rising low single digits and EBITDA growth after next year will be flat In terms of valuation dont forget to dilute the share count by 60mm shares for the convert they just issued last quarter If you give the company a generous 20x fwd EBITDA on out year bullish numbers the upside case is 10 sh while the base case is more like 5 7 If you really believed the upside case then I could see rationale for buying at 6 to play for the 10 of upside That s fair But The idea that this is a 100bn or even 20bn mkt cap is ludicrous We arent short the name but I would strongly advise you not to put a significant portion of your money in the stock It very well may go up bc there s no telling how high stocks on these momentum moves can go but at some point you have to be the one holding the stock and I dont want it to be you Stock s can only maintain their value in the multi billion valuation range at the end of these runs if there is institutional demand to buy the next share which is what happened in TSLA and I dont think that exists for BB north of 10 I think there are much better things to put your money into We still own GME which I know is a a favorite among your friends which I think has a much better setup If you want security software exposure I would tell you we re bullish on PANW CRWD and ZS If you want auto tech exposure I d say you should look at LPRO which recently SPAC d and isn t yet followed understood by the street A couple other random longs I like right now are BABA and PENN Feel free to lmk if you have any follow up questions Glad to see you re focused on the fundamentals

mine ,I think people are a little taken in by the current volatility especially people who haven t been trading for very long like myself and are feeling the nerves of losing money Maybe that s why I m writing this out I don t know Though I ve been lurking for a long time this was the first stock I actually acted on Before I jumped into this stock I tried to read everything I could about the situation and have been trying to devour as much information as I could about the vocabulary surrounding all the talk and trying to form a bigger picture of what s going on It feels like especially with that dip yesterday that short sellers are trying to cause a panic in the market especially for those who bought at the top and lost money to trigger a sell off which would trigger stop limits and trigger further selloffs down the line driving the price lower and lower Luckily this sub doesn t do that kind of stuff But remember short positions aren t covering they are reloading their positions The number of short positions hasn t changed 2 https finance yahoo com news gamestop short sellers reload bearish 175645685 html This means the underlying condition that is priming the short squeeze isn t really changing at all even when the market dips Bears continue to hold the position that the stock is overvalued but the retards retail investors who have been holding long term believe that this is actually closer to the fair valuation of the current stock and its potential It s starting to feel like a staring contest to see who blinks first Luckily we have some tailwind on our side If you haven t read the due diligence https www gmedd com 1 post keeping in mind all the other confirmation bias caveats that come with reading a report written by someone who likely holds positions in the stock a fair value price of 80 is in the baseline case while the price reaches upwards of 160 in the bull case which the DD identifies as the more likely scenario of the two The new shorts coming in are going to find themselves in exactly the same situation they are betting against the current price so they expect prices to be lower than 80 Simply put as as long as the individual retail investor s use of the market doesn t change simply buying shares as they become available and holding them while shorts maintain their overleveraged position Remember the shorts are the ones behaving irresponsibly especially those coming in now I mean the price to borrow is upwards of 80 at the time of writing of which about a million shares are available Who in their right minds would take that loan Retail investors like myself learning of this through public records and then utilizing modern technology to buy up shares to support the company and show that we like the stock Well that just sounds like a market correction The things to keep in mind and why I m optimistic 1 Even if you bought at 150 the short positions have not changed and shorts will continue to lose money even the new shorts that have come in to replace the old ones This feels like less of a musket line replacing its soldiers and more like a roman commander getting out of an extended battle to cut their losses by handing off the work to another legion like handing off a bomb because they already got burned So just buy and hold 2 As long as that overleveraged position remains the squeeze must happen If it doesn t spike by tomorrow or even the end of the week it doesn t mean that the losing position suddenly flips into a winning position It just means that the squeeze will take longer and maybe won t look so dramatic Even if you bought at 150 the price has no choice but to go up so long as the total short positions haven t changed So just buy and hold 3 We have totally forgotten about Gamestop and what is going on behind the scenes there They ve been completely silent during all of this All Gamestop has to do is come out and show some mild improvements Then public sentiment along with the primary driver of prices of stock the willingness of buyers to buy and the unwillingness to sell at a loss will simply support the stock at this level And short positions will continue to lose The squeeze could happen tomorrow It could happen over the course of a bunch of days and weeks and maybe months but as long as we re not seeing short positions covering we just have to wait If shorts cover slowly we ll see that and will be able to respond But the longer it takes the greater the loss due to interest payments So just hold Don t forget that GME is in a really good situation The post discussing stock reflexivity 3 https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l2zk5e a hedge fund managers perspective on gme talks about how the current rise in price puts GME in a good position to make improvements to their fundamentals which can further improve the stock s performance Not to mention the current publicity and the strange circumstance that has placed Gamestop in the protagonist s role in a David vs Goliath story These can provide further growth opportunities for Gamestop Basically If you just fucking buy and hold and believe that the company will do better the company will do better This is the magic of the free market We didn t make the rules that buying stock can be a way to support a company So here you are Just buy and hold amp x200B This is not investment advice GME

who has benefited greatly from the wisdom and wisdom on this sub Throwaway ish account Use your relative advantages to impose out of proportion costs on the opposition and complicate his problem of competing with you Good Strategy Bad Strategy Whether or not you have a position in it you are invested in this whole GME situation The outcome of this will determine the ceiling on your lifetime potential income It is in your interest to pay close attention STOCHASTIC ACTIVISM There have always been individual activist investors but their attacks were predictable and contained The decentralized chaotic and unpredictable threat that retail investors represent now is fundamentally different GME is manageable and in the big picture is an inconvenient blip what Wall Street is actually afraid of is the next GME The next stock that the retail hivemind decides to fixate on seemingly arbitrarily waylaying their well laid plans Their fear is a market where such a concerted attack is the new normal It could be on any ticker at any time suddenly surging on a whim and dissipating just as fast leaving in its wake shell shocked fund managers and depleted cash reserves From Wall Street s point of view this is that existential threat and the fear of imminent inevitable attack is paralysing It is in their interest to contain this problem and we are the problem In the short term that involves bailing out Melvin done because letting it fail would embolden the attackers and be chum to even more sharks In long term the real defense is changing the rules of the game to make it more onerous for retail investors to participate to dampen volatility when inconvenient and in general to systematically dismantle our ability to make a profit without access Imagine the PDT on steroids Eventually all the entryways will be sealed and all us retail vermin will be barred putting the ceiling on the income we could earn over our lifetimes We are fighting not for GME but our financial future and the life we can give our families That is what is at stake OPENING OTHER FRONTS U S doctrine calls for maintaining sufficient force to fight two major wars or three limited conflicts Every front opened in a war is a division of resources and attention and increases the difficulty exponentially We can rapidly make Wall Street s problem of defending against the hordes much more complicated by adding new fronts to the war in ways that are easy for us to arrange and costly for them to counter The FIRST FRONT is of course the market itself Hold Also find out if and how you can prevent your brokerage from lending out your shares For the hundredth time this can happen even if you did not buy on margin The only way to prevent it is to have a cash account instead of a margin account The SECOND FRONT I recommend opening is the political one If you are American and going by Reddit s demographics a majority of us are then call your representative I m not joking Actually call your representative An email is still better than nothing but so few people phone anymore a phone call has gained extra value Here is where we enjoy asymmetry against Wall Street A hundred thousand of us can make a hundred thousand phone calls with a few minutes of spare time each If that translates into an interest from Congress Wall Street suddenly has a more complicated and more public problem Here is where the message has to be focussed and specific Simply being against Wall Street can be dismissed as the vent of someone who gambled and lost Wall Street already has the suits and the sales voice well two million can play at that game The specific abuse to target is the NYSE permitting Citadel to both participate in the markets as an MM and actually influence the rules that determine its profits Acknowledge that MMs have a role then cast this as an example of abuse of power that is causing losses to real people Wall Street Bets has a reputation partly manufactured and partly from mistranslation Best keep it out of the conversation Identify yourself as a retail investor who invested into GME out of your savings in response to the exceedingly high short interest and your legitimate optimism about RC Remember to include depending on your rep s colour market manipulation consumer protection unchecked abuse of power free market or why the heck not financial elite 1 or hedge fund billionaires Democrats are newly in power and want to show their work Republicans want to embarrass the administration Whichever way your rep s interests and prejudice are lean into it It s an election campaign in reverse A THIRD FRONT is the media We have started behind because all media must remain on reasonably good terms with their subjects or they will lose out on access Political journalists must be careful not to alienate politicians late night hosts can t afford to antagonise celebrities and financial media have a major incentive to take Wall Street s side That is why so much of the coverage so far has been unfavourable to retail investors because it has all been in the financial media Broaden the front beyond the business pages Bring attention to the story in letters to the editor yes those still matter a surprising amount story drop boxes and Twitter In particular target journalists and writers who have a history of going after exactly this sort of criminality Michael Lewis comes to mind Keep it succinct and polite Twitter or not this is not the time for WSB Tourette s Remember they are just itching to paint us as foul mouthed morons who lucked into where we do not belong because then we can be conveniently dismissed and steamrolled Just because it s true doesn t mean it s right BONUS Combine the above and consider tweeting at politicians particularly those who have made a name standing up to Wall Street and or making a menace of themselves On the Democratic side I immediately think of Elizabeth Warren and then AOC On the Republican side the now Libertarian Justin Amash comes to mind These names are off the top of my head and I am sure we will hear better ideas Getting on their thread is also free exposure and sets off a flywheel of coverage Retail investors tweet at Congress en masse is news if we make it so Tl dr 1 Call your broker and make sure they can t lend your shares out 2 Call your rep 3 Make a noise in the media Try journalists writers politicians who benefit from being anti Wall Street Be polite concise and have your talking points If you must be a ranting degenerate do what I m doing and post on WSB SUMMARY If you strike the king you must kill him And if we can t well let s just make this as expensive and unpleasant as we can They want to limit what we can earn by law and that is worth making a bitter drawn out fight

buying call options gt gt But buying call options decreases the float and the only tightens the squeeze It s like fighting against quicksand for the shorters gt gt This GME squeeze is going to be historic because of the compounding effect of options and short interest gt gt This could be bigger than the VW Porsche infinity squeeze But it s completely different from VW so don t draw too many comparisons amp x200B Okay I ve asked my wife s girlfriend nicely and now have 1k Buy fucking shares No legit support your random internet brethren who don t know each other and buy shares of GameStop Every share you buy bleeds money from Citron and Melvin Here s an explanation from u robert1032010 https www reddit com u robert1032010 a Hedge Fund Manager on the current short position within GME A hedge fund managers perspective on GME https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l2zk5e a hedge fund managers perspective on gme gt The short positions of this issue appears although I can t be certain to exceed 100 with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well Although I don t yet have the current data on todays short position I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter perhaps more so now than at any previous time Today I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the hard to borrow desk No borrowable shares are available at any broker anywhere at this time even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers This extreme short against a small common float made more extreme no doubt by naked shorting could end very poorly for those short this issue As they are forced to close out their positions the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues amp x200B Lastly this is not financial advice do your own DD I m holding 20k at 100 share and yes I still fucking believe that the tendieman will come and rain tendies Oblig
