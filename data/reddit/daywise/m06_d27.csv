is a network of physical objects things that connect and transmit data to other physical objects via the internet Sensors software and other technologies are embedded within said physical objects to

Iridium relies on single source suppliers for the manufacture of most of the subscriber equipment and purchases parts that are periodically subject to shortages There is a large reliance on a few significant customers particularly U S government agencies meaning a loss of that business will significantly impact revenue Moreover Iridium relies on a single primary commercial gateway and primary satellite network operations center Last but not least Iridium is in debt Specifically 1 39B as of March 2021 Iridium also has liabilities of 88 3M falling due within a year and liabilities of 1 81B due beyond that which outweigh the cash and short term receivables by 1 62B Debt in March 2021 is about the same as it was in March 2020 https preview redd it ydpi2b0j1q771 png width 722 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3eadbeb02390e2f73675bd5b946b15b37c7f8668 CONCLUSION I m bullish on Iridium and I only see good things coming from them in the future short medium and long term Although in debt I think Iridium can handle the current debt levels They continue to be the front runner for government contracts and are the only provider that covers the entire globe From December 2019 to December 2020 Iridium saw an increase of 176K subscribers 14 and I believe this will continue to grow Voice and data and Internet of Things revenues have historically generated higher margins than subscriber equipment revenue and this trend will likely continue The diverse customer base including end users in land mobile Internet of Things maritime aviation and government will continue to grow overtime I am not a financial advisor Current positions none yet

Overview WISH controls the most popular shopping mobile application in the world In short the company is a direct to consumer online retailer However a few key features differentiate it from its competition WISH does not operate any brick and mortar locations WISH does not target popular branded items in its offerings WISH oftentimes works directly with the manufacturers or independent sellers instead of the wholesaler Let s go through this list to understand why this is a significant differentiation WISH not operating any brick and mortar locations allows it to maintain low capital expenditures CAPEX and frees up its cash flows WISH s focus on unbranded items allows it to compete in a more niche market that has not been taken over by other e commerce giants This is a space that WISH dominates WISH s decision to work directly with manufacturers rather than wholesalers allows it to procure its product catalog at a much cheaper price point than any competitor which it then passes on to its customers With independent sellers WISH offers a more unique product catalog than its competitors These three features combined defines how it interacts with its customer base WISH targets mostly younger low to middle income households It offers cheap and unbranded products an area that was historically ignored by larger e commerce companies Even their strategy to be a mobile app reflects this According to Pew Research lower income shoppers accessed the internet solely through their smartphone at a rate double the other income brackets The Future of E commerce is Mobile E commerce is not a new term Years ago a CEO at Sears might have argued that people prefer an in store experience Today that same CEO would finally admit that he was incorrect in underestimating the prominence of e commerce However what most people do not know is that e commerce is still in its growth phase Although due to COVID 2021 represented one of the highest growth years ever for e commerce Its growth in Q1 2020 over tripled the growth in Q3 and Q4 of 2019 In 2020 online spending represented 21 of the total retail sales while in 2019 online spending represented only 16 https preview redd

especially useful for WISH as over 80 of its global sales is coming from these two regions A few macro trends are expected to drive e commerce for the next decade Mobile shopping COVID 19 accelerated the shift to online shopping by over 5 years Mobile commerce or m commerce is expected to continue breaking out over the next few years rising at a rate of 25 5 compounded annual growth rate Its

advertisements data is the new gold for e commerce companies Increasingly the ability to personalize the shopping experience per user is becoming a crucial differentiator BCG reports that proper personalization can increase sales by over 25 WISH More than Just a Retailer WISH has a few main product lines Online retail store the Wish mobile application ProductBoost a marketing service on the Wish mobile application WishLocal a digital presence service for smaller brick and mortar retailers Wish Express a logistics service for customer delivery 1 WISH as an online retail store As an online retail store WISH is growing quickly in all areas As of 2021 its revenue per active user increased 76 YOY led by an increase in orders over 20 which increased over 50 in Q1 2021 However total monthly active users declined 7 YOY which may indicate some saturation in their market As stated before the key differentiator in the future of online retail is going to be personalization through big data and AI WISH is uniquely positioned to capture this core advantage At its very inception WISH has always recognized the value of data As of 2020 WISH catalogued the following data points 100M monthly active users their age gender location etc 150M activities on Wish clicks scrolls items sold etc 500K merchant data refund rates ship times etc 640M items shipped ratings pictures etc Through this enormous warehouse of data WISH was able to build one of the most effective recommendation engines in the world WISH sees 70 of their sales coming from purchases not involved with a search query This speaks volume on the effectiveness of their data science platform and their ability to understand their customer which in turn enables 2 ProductBoost the AdWords for Shopping By proving out a deep knowledge of their customer base WISH can show relevant targeted ads to its user base In 2020 30 of all merchants on WISH used this service to increase their sales which represented 140M of revenue for WISH The company is very focused in growing this area as it represents a scalable high margin service offering for them As of Q1 of 2021 they are already seeing a 14 increase in sales in this area compared to Q4 of 2019 3 WishLocal Helping those Behind the Curve WishLocal is a service that brick and mortar retailers sign up for Through WishLocal they agree to become a drop point for WISH products in return for a fee They will both earn the fee as well as can cross sell to the customer This also serves as an incentive point for them to sign onto Wish as a merchant While WishLocal is not a revenue generating feature it is a point of differentiation that allows Wish to have a physical presence without the need for heavy investment in brick and mortar stores 4 Wish Express Driving Business Forward Wish Express is the global logistics service at WISH They contract out other delivery services from local vendors and stitch it all together into a single product Like this they can both improve their own delivery services shipping related refunds were down 40 in 2021 as well as to offer another revenue generating service to their merchants and partners In 2021 their logistics revenue was 250M which represented a 338 increase from the previous year Strong Balance Sheet Weak Income Statement WISH is a risky company and this is reflected in their finances They have a cash reserve of 2B which is balanced out with nearly 900M in current liabilities In 2020 they issued 1B in new stock whose funds were used to absorb a 750M net operating loss This represents a major risk for the company as an operating loss of this magnitude will not be sustainable for more than 2 years The 750M operating loss was mostly made up of an extremely high marketing expense and a reduction in their gross margins The SG amp A primarily driven by marketing expense went up by 40 which corresponds to a 33 increase in sales indicating an inefficient usage of resources https preview redd it erjzrtqqts771 png width 1160 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5c34dd891a3104e2fc3228d1ea78efcbb142e1f5 amp x200B While the marketing expense can be easily controlled it s a little worrisome to see their gross margins reduced from 80 in 2019 to 64 in 2020 especially as they have a long term goal of 75 margins If WISH cannot get their margins back and maintains current levels of spending another share dilution will be necessary next year as well to sustain its balance sheet health In 2020 WISH did 2 54 billion in revenue a 33 7 increase from 2019 revenues Their trailing twelve month TTM gross margin is roughly 60 which is very good for the e commerce industry where it is usually closer to the 40 range Like mentioned above WISH s SG amp A expense is absolutely huge and one of the main factors of why they are burning through cash In their most recent earnings report WISH management guided revenues of 715 730 million revenue for Q2 2021 What s concerning is that it s only 2 4 growth when looking YoY however management noted that this is mainly due to the incredible growth they experience the year prior as lockdowns became normalized around the world This ties back to the debate of whether or not their target market is seeing saturation The Bottom Line In many ways WISH reminds me of an early Amazon Perhaps their story will end similarly to Amazon as well where they become a global tech giant valued well past where they were as an online retail store After all they have many things going for them The most downloaded shopping app in the world High market share in the niche unbranded sales space Expansion into high margin services However there are some warning signs to recognize as to how WISH may not be the next Amazon Amazon already exists and it competes against WISH It lost monthly active users in the year it spent the most in marketing Its gross margins declined in 2020 though its been steadily rising beforehand For me I see a company with 1B of extra cash above its current liabilities and revenues of 2B being valued at 8 5B I believe the 8 5B valuation reflects the risk that WISH incurs burning through 750M of cash in a year it only happened once 2019 was much better If WISH can figure out a way to stem the bleeding of cash or to raise funds without a share dilution their stock price should rise as a result With their focus on data their considerable market share and some core high margin products already underway I believe that WISH is poised for growth in 2021 TLDR 1 WISH is in the e commerce space and they are what I would call a flea market in your pocket that gives you access to thousands of products directly from their mobile app They do not operate brick and mortar locations and they do not target branded items which allows them to work directly with manufacturers instead of wholesalers cutting out the middle man and saving on expenses 2 WISH is able to dominate this very niche space because the big e commerce players simply do not care about selling discount items of this type WISH s customer base is targeted toward the low to middle class which is evident if you go to their site Many products are under 5 and in unusual categories to say the least 3 One advantage in WISH s business model is the fact that they create a bridge between the customer and the manufacturer cutting out the middle man while maintaining low capital expenditures CapEx which free s up their cash flow to spend on things like customer acquisition 4 When it comes to their fundamentals WISH is a risky company They aren t overly indebted but still hold roughly 900m liabilities compared to their 2B cash reserve Most of their expenses are marketing expenses and they burn through a significant amount of money on customer acquisition This might present the risk of new share issuance and dilution should the stock price out perform in a short period of time 5 Having said all that their gross margin 60 is quite healthy For a company that trades at only 3x sales they have the potential to out perform the market should they figure out a way to retain customers without spending billions on SG amp A expenses In short they are doing just under 3 billion in sales and have a market cap of 8 7 billion dollars Positions Long shares of stock

Losing Money Like A Complete Tard, Introduction For those of you that are living underneath a rock options represent the contractual right to purchase or sell blocks of 100 shares in the underlying security Because each option represents 100 shares they often provide volatile leveraged like returns and are often used by either professional investors as part of a sophisticated investment strategy or by retail gamblers investors as a way to potentially gain massive amounts of money while putting up a relatively small amount In this post I will walk you through the pricing fundamentals the Greeks and common option strategies Hopefully by the end of this post you will stop losing all your money like a bunch of half wits Well you probably still lose money but at least you can act like a smartass about it Pricing Fundamentals This section is going to be focused on the fundamentals and theoretical aspects behind what gives an option value Aka that boomer shit There are two types of options American and European American options give the holder the right to exercise the option at any given time prior to the expiration date cause freedom that s why These options are the ones you typically buy from your broker European options on the other hand are fucking gay because they only let you exercise at the expiry date and since none of you cucks ever bought an option from a Europoor before I will focus solely on American options for this DD post Value Breakdown Every option regardless if it s a chad call or a gay put has two pricing components that justify it s current market value the intrinsic value and the speculative value Let me explain via this equation Value Intrinsic Speculative Value Intrinsic value is how ITM an option is and the speculative value is the chances of it becoming even more ITM by the time to expiry For example assume a call option has a strike of 10 and the current price of the stock is 12 That would mean the intrinsic value is 2 However the option expires in let s say 3 months and is being traded at 3 That would mean the additional 1 dollar difference above the 2 is the speculative value of the option That 1 represents investors speculating the option will become even more ITM within that three months time frame Taking that logic further we can derive the fundamental value for a call and put option as Call stock price strike speculative Put strike stock price speculative Leverage Now that you know that a single option grants you exposure to multiple shares and the returns are therefore leveraged you might be thinking to yourself oh gosh I hope there is a way for me to calculate exactly how leveraged this option will be Don t worry there is You can calculate exactly how leveraged an option is via this equation Option Delta x Share Price Option price Volatility This is the big one If the market is a casino then this is the bookie playing around with the odds on the board So if you want to leave the casino with money and not another man s dick in your hand you need to know volatility cold For options trading there are two kinds of volatility realized and unrealized Realized All you need to know is that realized volatility is the historic price movement of the stock It is measured as the standard deviation or deviation from average price from the average price of a stock in a given time frame Unrealized Or Implied Volatility This is the most important of the two To put it in simplest terms IV is the expected magnitude of a stock s future price changes expressed as an annual percentage This expected yearly price change can be expressed as the following 1 Year Expected Range stock price stock price x IV What is important with this formula is that it shows the riskier stocks usually have the higher IVs which will result in a larger annual expected range Taking this a step further we can also visualize the expected stock price changes via standard deviations Assuming most of you passed high school a fair amount of you must be somewhat familiar with the normal distribution graph We can demonstrate this with a graph of a normal distribution that shows a 1 standard deviation of the price movement of a stock that is trading at 100 with an IV of 25 This means that with a standard deviation of 1 there is a 68 the stock will trade within the range of 75 125 amp x200B https preview

representation of a stock s fluctuation with a 95 confidence interval In the chart below still assuming a stock price of 100 and an IV of 25 the range has doubled to 50 150 Remember in statistics we can go all the way to 3 standard deviations which is a confidence interval of 99 7 and that will mean a range of 25 175 amp x200B https preview redd it 6mg3o4xf4t771 png width 675 amp format png amp

stock s expected move over any period via this equation amp x200B https preview redd it 6pf729pg4t771 png width 325 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 7f73cbe0ad10dfbfc42b4dedca03f75b8d4d93c1 19 1 is the square root of 365 or the days in a year For Simplicity s sake I simplified the denominator This way whenever you buy an option that doesn t expire in one year exactly you can still map out the expected price range as stated by option traders That way you know what you are getting into and be all surprised when a dick is shoved up your ass unless you re in to that then call me Greeks What you all need to know is that within the premiums of every option that you buy there are certain assumptions that are priced in much like there are certain assumptions that are priced into a stock price These assumptions are often represented by certain Greek letters and by understanding what they are and how they influence the option s value you can better understand what you are betting on and whether or not the risks are tilted in your favor In this part I am going to talk about the four Greeks every last one of you degenerates must know by heart Vega Delta Gamma and Theta And no they aren t the name of the fraternity your girlfriend goes to so that she can blow half the chads on campus These guys are the ones that will determine whether you make actual life changing money or move back to your mother s basement while your new stepdad subtly judges you Vega V This represents the change in option price per change in the option s implied volatility Vega is highest when the stock price is at the strike price and when the option is farther out from the expiration date Ex Let s assume the premium of an option is 7 5 IV is at 20 and vega at 0 12 If the IV moves up from 20 to 21 5 that is a 1 5 increase The option price will increase by 1 5 x 0 12 0 18 0 18 7 5 7 68 Delta Delta is a change in the option s price due to a change in underlying stock price Assuming we have a delta of 0 5 that means per every dollar the stock price goes up by the option premium will go up by 50 of that change Delta is often highest the farther ITM the option is and will often be the most volatile the closer the strike price is to the stock price Call options have a delta of 0 1 while Puts have a negative delta of 0 1 The absolute delta of an option also tells you the probability that the option will finish in the money Gamma T Gamma is the rate of change in an option s delta per 1 point move in the underlying s share price It is essentially the first derivative of delta and is used to gauge the price movement of an option relative to how far OTM or ITM it is Taking this further gamma is also the second derivative of an option s price with respect to the underlying share s price This is because the delta is the first derivative of share price and since gamma is the first derivative of the delta it is therefore the second derivative of the share price Whenever you long an option you have positive gamma exposure and when you short you have negative gamma exposure It is also important to note that gamma approaches 0 the farther an option becomes OTM or ITM Gamma is also at its highest when the strike is ATM Theta O This Greek is probably the easiest to understand Theta is the time decay of an option as it approaches its expiration date This means that theta measures the constant and steady decrease in an intrinsic value for an option on a daily basis Delta Curve For those of you that don t know the delta of an option is not stagnant and its rate of change in accordance with share price changes is represented by the option s gamma You can actually map out the expected change in an option s delta in accordance with the underlying share price via the delta curve Let me show you the delta curve for a call option amp x200B https preview redd it dxzwnvwh4t771 png width 566 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 2dd06ce979c5d1be575cab96f5f73342519a129c Note that the delta becomes more volatile as the option becomes ATM as the stock price rises before slowing that rate of change as the delta approaches 1 the deeper the option goes ITM The delta will approach 1 because the absolute value of a delta represents the market s expectation that the option will expire ITM so it makes sense that the more ITM an option becomes the higher that percentage will be as it approaches 100 When you look at the delta curve for a put option you will find a lot of similarities with the call option delta amp x200B https

becomes ATM however remember that put options have a negative delta and because it becomes more ITM the lower the stock price is a rising stock price will result in a delta approaching 0 Equations I got these equations from my CFA textbooks so the nomenclature for these option strategies might be different than what you are seeing on your brokerage page Either way you can just look at the descriptions I have made and figure out which strategies I am talking about To wrap this up I am going to go through some popular options strategies that are often mentioned in investing subreddits These descriptions will include what the option strategies entail what will be their value at expiration how much profit you can make your maximum possible gain how much money you can lose and what price you need to be at in order to break even First here is a list of the variables I will be using and what they represent S0 stock price at open ST stock price at close X strike price Co call premium Po put premium XH higher strike CL PL premium on call put with a lower strike CH PH premium on call put with a higher strike Covered Call This is longing for a stock and selling an OTM call option on it People often do this in order to increase the yield on investment meaning they get to haul in some additional cash flow on their stock holdings Benefits to this strategy include the cash flow you receive from selling calls and its ability to reduce the overall volatility in your portfolio The downside is that because you sold calls you limit your upside potential because if the stock price goes over the strike price it would be assumed that the option you sold will be exercised therefore there is a ceiling on how much money you can earn Expiration value ST Max ST X 0 Profit at expiration ST Max ST X 0 So Co Max Gain X So Co Max Loss So Co Breakeven Price So Co Protective Put This is longing a stock and a put option on the stock that is usually OTM The idea here is that the put option serve as a kind of insurance on your stock holdings By purchasing puts you limit yourself on how much money you can possibly lose which will serve you well whenever the market decides to hit the shitter and enters a correction Another benefit to this strategy is that unlike covered calls you still have unlimited upside potential on your stock holdings The downside is the money you have to spend in order to insure your positions Expiration value ST Max X ST 0 Profit at expiration ST Max X ST 0 So Po Max Gain ST So Po Max Loss So X Po B E price So Po Bull Call Spread This is a directional play with options Meaning in this case you are betting that the stock will go up Bull Calls is longing for a call option with a lower strike and at the same time selling a call option on the same stock with the same expiry date at a higher strike Here you are trying to profit off the deltas in which the positive delta for the option with the lower strike will be greater than the delta for the option with the higher strike and as the stock price goes up you can profit from the delta difference A benefit to this strategy is that because you are selling an option as well as buying one you can limit your cash outflow A downside is that you also limit the amount of money you can gain with this strategy You can also do this strategy with put options in which you sell puts with the higher strike and buy puts with the lower strikes For simplicity s sake I will just list the equations for the strategy with call options Profit at expiration Max 0 ST XL Max 0 ST XH CL CH Max Profit XH XL CL CH Max Loss CL CH BE XL CL CH Bear Put Spread Similar direction play just like Bull Calls but in this case you are betting the stock is going down Here you are longing put options with the higher strike and selling puts with a lower strike The expiration date must be the same for both options The rationale of profiting off the Greeks and the pros and cons remain similar to Bull Calls Profit at expiration Max 0 XH ST Max 0 XL ST PH PL Max Profit XH XL PH PL Max loss PH PL Breakeven XH PL PH Collar This strategy is used when you think a stock is going to trade in a certain range Here you are longing the stock longing an ITM protective put and selling an OTM call The idea is that the put will provide downside protection while the call provides a ceiling on how much money you can earn The main benefit is that it allows you to buy protection while limiting your cash outflow since you sold a call The downside is that upside is limited just like a covered call strategy Profit at expiration ST So XL ST ST XH Po Co Max profit XH So Po Co Max loss So XL Po Co Breakeven So Po Co Straddle This is a directional play except over here you have no idea what the direction is This strategy is ideal when betting on the general volatility of the stock without any idea on where the direction of the stock will go Here you are longing both a call and a put on the same stock at the same expiration and at the same strike The idea is that as the stock goes up or down the delta of one option will slowly go to 1 while the other goes to 0 and you can profit off the gamma The benefit to this is that you don t need to bet as much in a certain direction the downside however is that you are longing volatility and if the volatility does not reach high enough to what is priced into the premium then you will lose money on both the call and the put as they both expire to 0 Profit Max 0 ST X Max profit Co Po Max loss Co Po Breakeven X Co Po and X Co Po

Action, This DD serves as mainly a bull case for Canoo and is not intended to be a bear case for Fisker Introduction Fisker and Canoo are both EV companies that completed mergers with special purpose acquisition companies to go public and immediately gain access to capital This was the route of choice for many other EV companies as well since the automotive business is naturally capital intensive and this was the quickest avenue for them to get funding I chose to compare Fisker with Canoo because they are both legitimate EV startups on similar timelines and were compatible for comparable company analysis Current Valuations Fisker has 295 24 million shares outstanding and with a closing stock price of 19 30 is valued at 5 7 billion Canoo has 237 5 million shares outstanding and with a closing stock price of 9 67 is valued at 2 3 billion Models amp x200B Fisker s Ocean SUV https preview redd it piv2ehs05u771 png width 1260 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

7d77153f52d1d954f8c3660306e92a21ada8999f These are the two models Fisker and Canoo chose to begin production with Clearly Fisker s Ocean SUV looks like something we are used to while Canoo s Lifestyle Vehicle is a modern reinvented minivan The most used bear case against Canoo is the bold design of the minivan However what is overlooked is that the fully electric minvan market is 100 untapped and Canoo is the only EV maker with plans to release one Fisker s SUV is nice but the electric SUV market is going to be one of the most competitive in the industry with Tesla already having the Model X and Model Y GM releasing it s electric Bolt SUV and Ford releasing the Mach E SUV Canoo will have no direct competitors with their Lifestyle Vehicle While it has a bold design it s extra interior space will make it desirable regardless of it s look who wouldn t want to take a Lyft Uber in that The ocean starts at 37 499 while the lifestyle vehicle starts at 34 750 Canoo has 3 trims other than the base model Delivery Premium and Adventure seen here https www canoo com canoo that will run more than that Fisker likely will too but hasn t released any Canoo already has released two other models a Pickup truck and Delivery Vehicle that they plan on producing in 2023 It s clear they are targeting the areas that have been untapped by EV s practically guaranteeing themselves adequate demand Fisker has not released it s future models Production Both companies plan to have production begin in Q4 of 2022 both doing so with the help of outside contract manufacturers Fisker has a

hand on March 31st based on there last 10K Fisker had 985 million cash on hand on March 31st based on there last 10K Canoo recently stated they have enough cash on hand to last them through their first production phase Q4 of 2022 We can assume Fisker does as well but they have not given a specific estimate Bearish Cases The biggest bear cases for Canoo earlier this year was their pivoting away from the subscription model engineering services and the departure of their former CEO Ulrich Kranz However both go hand in hand and make perfect sense In order to have their subscription model work they would have to pay the cost of all the vehicles they planned on using upfront before generating any revenue Their CAPEX is already going to be high enough and this plan made 0 sense Helping other companies engineer their own electric vehicles also seemed counterintuitive That would be like Burger King helping McDonalds create a new healthier burger These ideas were made by Ulrich Kranz a famous engineer clearly not a businessman The board of directors realized this and Ulrich decided to mutually part ways It was not a hostile event and he still is holding over 1 million shares in the company Fisker s biggest bear case is probably it s CEO s Henrik Fisker previous failed attempt at starting an automotive business His first company was also named Fisker and went upside down after a first product launch riddled with problems and a failed attempt to retool a factory which is why he is probably sticking with the contract manufacturer route Both are often called pre revenue duds bubble stocks However EV is the biggest business opportunity in the automotive industry since 1903 when the first Ford was made With an estimated 2 trillion dollar automotive market up for grabs with gas prices soaring and green energy trending I believe high EV valuations are warranted Back to Valuation After all this why is Fisker currently worth 2 5 times more than Canoo This type of discrepancy is not warranted You can argue it s hard to value pre revenue companies it is but by that large of a margin When they both have accomplished the same milestones and are on the same production timeline I think it s more fishy than that Canoo has had 2 months full of positive news and is still trading down pinned under it s original NAV price of 10 Whenever it has broken it 2 times the past 3 weeks it has quickly and sharply retreated back under 10 Potential Explanation After March when the news of the CEO departure and business model changed were released GOEV shares were heavily shorted Ever since then it seems the price has been actively manipulated Here is a chart with the share price of GOEV orange and GME red the past 6 months https preview redd it 0lwvqv6l9u771 png width 1916 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 79be0b0a77caf2a00ad6c7659be5627b837cae85 As you can see before March GME and GOEV movement were completely unrelated But after March they became very similar Canoo could have gained hedge fund interest similar to that of GME Otherwise it should easily be trading much closer to Fisker s valuation Short interest has steadily risen and is now almost 40 see my last post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments o7pl8h goev the best way to play russel reconstitution utm source share amp utm medium web2x amp context 3 for exact data Conclusion TLDR Canoo and Fisker are the most promising companies out of the EV startups However they are trading at valuations nowhere near each other Canoo is severely undervalued in comparison to Fisker Could be the result of short manipulation Due to Russell 3000 Inclusion volume should be up this week and things could get interesting Positions https preview redd it mzb63hq0au771 png width 2880 amp format

just keep issuing shares until the stock capitulates back down to something more reasonable getting as much of retails money as possible And after everyone has given up and sold for a loss way down

9895a3f81a108bbe95b71cfad293c6f234242ce0 amp x200B Boring speculative hopium driven BS It looks to me like the various meme stocks are following a general pattern They are spiking out of breakout levels Launch Levels for short lived volatile upward moves gamma wizards casting the Lv 8 Lambo Spell coming back down to find support at those same breakout levels fueling up and then launching again Subsequent breakouts are occurring at predictable levels namely mid move or immediate post move resistance levels from the previous spike The mechanism underlying the action is almost certainly Gamma Magic plus Diamond Handing With each successive spike in price aided greatly by gamma wizards of course more people are attracted to the stock as expected and while most are paper handed pussies also expected the major difference between these moves and a run of the mill pump amp dump is that with each move the number of shares in diamond hands keeps growing Let s call this the Diamond Ratio D D N F where N is the number of Diamond Handed Shares and F is the float With each massive gamma spike N grows while F remains the same thus D gets closer 1 And the closer to D 1 the stock gets the higher the new price floor gets Note at D 1 the price of the stock should be both infinity and zero at the same time Having broken the laws of physics the universe will come to sudden end and we ll ascend to a paradise where there are lambos cocaine and victoria secret models for all The only thing that will fuck this up is if 1 the company keeps issuing new shares cough AMC cough or 2 the MM s stop selling options Nobody should be surprised that share dilution drops the price Even if the retards buy up the whole issuance the macaques only have so much capital and the company can issue infinite shares As for 2 doesn t seem likely that they re going to go that far to stop these gamma spikes But then again TD Schwab amp RH stopped share buying by retail others as well I think They haven t done it since that one event but if they have that power rest assured the options writers can just stop offering contracts on big moves thereby alleviating their need to buy the stock to hedge the option they just wrote But they probably make plenty of money either way so I can t seem them doing this unless forced to by a higher power amp x200B Obligatory List of BS Others have posted about the elements for a meme stock but they all seem to boil down to 1 It s meme able Straightforward If you make the idiots laugh they ll feel good about the company and the rose tinted glasses thicken until it looks like the next Google 2 It s perceived to be heavily shorted Even more straightforward Every single person on planet fucking Earth is looking to get rich quick If they can take it out of the pockets of Wallstreet fat cats that s just icing on the cake Due to gamma action I don t think the actual SI matters As in not even a little bit But the perception of being shorted does because it feeds into the stick to the man narrative bolstering retail interest way out of proportion to what it should be 3 Gamma Magic Someone has to buy call options LOTS OF THEM Buying FD s way OTM doesn t matter the market maker doesn t need to hedge that shit until the last min and likely not at all But when the price starts climbing and retail starts pouring in those massive call options purchases have to be hedged Thus the MMs are forced to buy further driving up the price This pulls in more retail further raising the price which causes more hedge buying which causes more option buying which causes you get it Moon 4 Diamond Hands for life 1 3 can give you a pump amp dump It s here the real magic happens The dump end of the pump is supposed to fuck the retail traders back down to the basement from whence they came Except now everyone has decided yea naw fuck that I ll die holding these fucking shares This results in price stabilization at the higher level priming the stock for the next cycle higher amp x200B Other BS In order for the pattern to be proven we ll have to see some more examples On the flip side the more meme stock candidates there are the less power each has as the eyeballs cumshots are not sufficiently focused for bukake Also retail capital exhaustion is a real thing The apes got fat stacks if you add it all up but not infinite stacks and if they re diamond handing that s capital not available for the next big thing We ll see what happens but it looks like some good gambling material to me You do you At this point it s hard to say when a particular meme stock will die GME was supposed to die months and months ago Yet it very much is still alive My own opinion is that when the price of the stock gets too damn high the monkeys will refuse to bite and the moves will get smaller and smaller The long time holders will start taking second looks at their gains and cashing out will eventually take place But as long as it looks like there s a chance for mooning the HODLing will continue amp x200B Disclaimer BS When I was in elementary school I sniffed the rubber cement in art class when the teacher wasn t looking Did you guys ever do that I feel like everyone did but maybe it was just me

Shares Revenue It s a speculative stock as of now so the numbers are not very pleasing In 2020 their total revenue was just 3 4 million with 48 49 million in losses In pre covid times 2019 their revenue was 7 million Flash forward two years with a bunch of cash on hand explained below and hopefully as COVID subsides I m expecting to see higher revenues and hopefully in a few years positive earnings Most recently they released Q1 2021 Earnings They reported revenue of 811 000 in the first quarter and a net loss of 9 314 000 Wow they are losing a lot of money gt The Company ended the quarter with a cash and deposits balance of 1 471 014 000 including short and long term unrestricted bank deposits lt As stated on their most recent earnings call no guidance was given Cash on hand Every time the stock spiked they did an offering Their most recent offering on February 16th was for 12 80 And it raised 500 MILLION As of two weeks ago they had just about 1 5 BILLION cash on hand After two acquisitions already explained below they have just under 1 4 BILLION Yes that means a bunch of people bought shares at high prices and you can buy it now cheaper then they did Yes stock offerings are not good but Yoav Stern CEO made it very clear on the investors phone call they hosted last week that they have enough cash on hand to do what they envision and no more share offerings will happen To put this into perspective they have 1 4 billion in cash their market cap as of today is just under 2 billion Roughly their current cash values them alone at around 6 a share This doesn t include patents they own the newly acquired companies their technology and just the valuation itself Acquisitions The company plans to use its money on acquiring companies No NNDM is NOT a SPAC So far they ve acquired two companies this year and these are very tiny acquisitions bigger ones are expected DeepCube AI Company their technology will be used in the currently DragonFly Machine 70 Million TOTAL 40 Million Cash 30 Million Shares NanoFabrica 3D Printing the company had a investment lead by Microsoft 59 Million TOTAL 27 Million Cash 32 Million Shares The final numbers are not confirmed So they ve only burned through roughly 70 million They still have around 1 4 Billion Their plan is to acquire companies listed as Type A Type B and Type C Type A Existing companies in PCB business Companies with revenue between 40 150 million Type B Technologies they think their machines need Type C Companies that have machines that cater to the same customers that Nano Dimension does

they have a NEW DragonFly they are expecting to release in the near future Any further acquisitions Already had 2 this year The CEO on their May earnings call said starting in June they can tour

protect themselves and their families after the MOASS Most of us are going have more money than we ve ever seen in our lives It s going to be insane Obligatory disclaimer Not financial advice Don t be stupid with your money Seriously When you get your tendies let s say you make 100 million dollars here s a few things you want to do first 1 Get a good lawyer and accountant for your taxes Taxes are going to be around 50 of your earnings That s a huge chunk of money Say what you will about taxes but 90 of our tax money goes to corrupt bureaucrats and money laundering while our roads remain dilapidated Generations ago people didn t even pay income tax because they were already charged tax in other ways You pay income tax property tax sales tax capital gains tax there s double taxation when you want to give your family money all sorts of theft that they ll use to squeeze every single penny out of you If people like Mitt Romney and Jeff Bezos can get away with only paying 10 in taxes or not paying taxes at all why should we pay 50 Hire a lawyer to sort out the legal loopholes take advantage of the opportunities at your disposal and pay as little taxes as you can with these loopholes Now with that extra money saved from taxes you can use that money to actually be a real help in your community instead of being complicit in a corrupt system and letting your tax money get wasted by the frivolous Bourgeoisie 2 Look into hiring a PR firm to clean up your digital footprint We are going to piss off a lot of billionaires after all is said and done I know a lot of us treat it as a joke but the elite are vindictive Remember the panama papers that exposed an elitist criminal conspiracy to hoard stolen wealth in offshore accounts Yeah the journalist that exposed it was assassinated You think they won t try to trace each of us after this and make us pay Even if you don t believe you did anything wrong they can easily get the media to paint us as the bad guys and come after us If you feel you left a big digital footprint here are the MOASS consider hiring a firm to erase it for you make it harder for a billionaire to quench his vendetta against us That s especially why I don t advocate anyone posting personal pictures of themselves and their families in this sub 3 DO NOT BRAG ABOUT YOUR WEALTH KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT Don t be that douche that goes around telling people oh man I made 50 million Look at me haha You will attract unwanted attention Don t believe me Take a look at Exhibit A amp x200B https preview redd it 93fm5m503w771 jpg width 827 amp format

300 million in the PowerBall He said it ruined his life Want to know why Everyone knew about it in his town He showed his money around so they all came after him demanding and expecting he solve all their problems and give them money Every day his mailbox was flooded with requests for money He was robbed several times His friends sued him strangers took him to court for even the smallest grievances hoping to get a few million out of him It s kind of a nightmare when you think about it I pretty much lost everything I held dear in my life Jack Whittaker told ABC News I don t like the hard heart I ve got I just don t like what I ve become Jack gave his daughter so much money she didn t know what to do with it She bought drugs and died of an overdose Jack s wife divorced him and just last year Jack was pronounced dead This is only one example There s many more where these came from Stories from lotto winners getting assassinated by family to getting their lives destroyed by gold diggers and smear campaigns to losing it all from corrupt financial advisors with malintent Be smart with your money be quiet you don t want unwanted attention Do it for yourself and your family 4 Don t be a slave Ignore those that try to control you and your finances People will come after you they will use all forms of psychological manipulation to get you to give them money They will claim that you don t deserve that money and that you must give it to them or give it away Employers employees that see you have money might out of envy or greedy opportunism apply price discrimination and raise the prices of their services only to you because you have more money They will demand you give them more higher tips higher donations pay higher prices than normal higher expectations They ll demand that if you don t use that money to solve their problems that you re a greedy selfish money hungry parasite or say something to make you feel guilty so they can subjugate you Remember You are not a slave Your whole life you may have been a pushover a wage slave someone that was used and taken advantage of and never got to experience personal financial freedom This money is yours it belongs to you You are not God You are not responsible for solving every single person s problems You might have millions of dollars but your resources are still finite you can t help everyone You decide what visions you want to pursue with your resources You decide the select causes you are interested in helping allocate your resources towards DO NOT LET ANYONE tell you what you can or can t do with your money If someone tries to guilt trip you into paying their rent or buying them a car or any of that they are not your friend They are trying to exploit your emotions for personal gain which is a manipulative tactic and makes them a toxic person you want to avoid Again you are in control of yourself Take care of yourself first then your family friends and finally respective communities and causes you re interested in There s countless causes and people out there You need to be frugal and decide which select causes you re interested in allocating distributing your resources towards You are not a slave to anyone so don t let anyone make you feel forced into giving anyone money If you feel comfortable giving a random person in the parking lot money do it If not don t do it It s that simple You re not a bad person if you choose not to What these people say are not what define you You know the type of person you are by your goals and your own history 5 Be frugal Don t waste your generational wealth on frivolous desires The vast majority of lottery winners go broke within a few years 50 80 Why do you think that is Because they just got so much money that they don t know what to do with it Keep most of it invested in multiple accounts after the crash Blockchain Swiss Frank Index funds with high dividend yields so that you re still consistently growing your money and taking care of your family Some people may think I will buy 5 mansions across the country Have you factored in all the finances and laws that come with that property taxes utility bills property laws such as law of adverse possession that can allow squatters to steal your home in you leave it vacant for too long There s tons of variables you need to take into consideration before you go off on frivolous expenditures Don t be wasteful Sure get a financial advisor if you want but look into the person you re trusting to manage your assets and cash flow Is this financial advisor trustworthy There s been many reports of people hiring corrupt financial advisors that siphon off their wealth via embezzlement misappropriation or other means and their clients never notice until it s too late Again be frugal take all variables into account when considering significant expenditures keep an accountant to manage your balance sheet and think of your family s long term economic future as well as the opportunity costs related to your decisions Please take these 5 points into deep consideration after the MOASS It s ultimately your choice to decide whether or not you d like to follow these points Again not financial advice I m simply an Ape that wants to help make sure his brother and sister Apes don t get taken advantage of after the MOASS and that they have the long term financial stability needed to reshape their lives and in doing so the future around them Feel free to share this with an Ape you believe this post will help See you on the moon

post was created and posted by the brainiacs at r investing link below The creator would love to hear everyone s opinion https www reddit com r investing comments o3a7ng lzb lazboy inc deep dive a great business that https www reddit com r investing comments o3a7ng lzb lazboy inc deep dive a great business that amp x200B WHAT DOES LA Z BOY DO La Z Boy is one of the largest furniture manufactures in the United States They are based in Monroe Michigan and they make home furniture including upholstered recliners sofas stationary chairs lift chairs and sleeper sofas La Z Boy furniture is sold in thousands of retail residential outlets in the United States and Canada and is manufactured and distributed under license in other countries including the United Kingdom Australia Germany Indonesia Italy Japan Mexico New Zealand Turkey and South Africa La Z Boy holds US and international patents on more than 200 different styles and mechanisms They employ approximately 9400 workers at this time La Z Boy Incorporated is divided into three reportable operating segments the Upholstery Group the Casegoods Group and the Retail Group The Upholstery Group primarily manufactures and sells upholstered furniture to furniture retailers and proprietary stores This includes recliners and motion furniture sofas lift chairs loveseats chairs ottomans and sleeper sofas The Casegoods Group primarily sells manufactured or imported wood furniture to furniture retailers including tables chairs entertainment centers headboards dressers accent pieces and some coordinated upholstered furniture The Retail Group consists of 70 company owned stores in the US The Retail Group sells mainly upholstered furniture to end consumers through the retail network In July 2018 La Z Boy also acquired online furniture company Joybird for an undisclosed amount amp x200B THE BULL CASE Reason 1 Oversold It is trading well below fair value after being dumped over the past 2 days Nasdaq com https www nasdaq com articles an intrinsic calculation for la z boy incorporated nyse 3Alzb suggests its 21 undervalued published an article 2 days ago saying the stock was trading 21 below value when it was trading at 42 Now it is at 36 the long term support which makes it approximately 33 below fair value What is the reason for the selloff In their earnings call they issued a warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short term due to raw material price increases right now However they also said these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year So basically the selloff is an overreaction as their earnings report came out the same day Chairman Powell did his press conference and caused the whole market to dump Reason 2 The stock will recover soon because it does this Because this stock has a relatively low market cap any negative news causes a dump that soon recovers Simply looking at the chart over the past 6 months will show other such instances including the last major dump to this support level on February 1 and the subsequent recovery by 10 in only 8 days and a 20 recovery in just over a month after that Reason 3 Never before seen boom in home furnishings Warren Shoulberg a senior editor at Forbes noted that LZB is the poster child for the boom in home furnishings sales r investing https www reddit com r investing does not allow linking to Forbes due to blog style articles being published there so I will simply point out some salient points from the story gt If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer all you have to do is ask La Z Boy By one measurement that the company uses written same store sales for the entire Galleries network doubled increasing 100 for the quarter For the year those sales were up 31 Their CEO noted the following in the earnings call also covered at Forbes gt For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter record sales led to all time record profits driven by increased production capacity excellent performance by our company owned La Z Boy Furniture Galleries stores and continued growth and profitability at Joybird Fiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead Reason 4 LZB beat on all important metrics including EPS and revenue as per their June 15 earnings report https www marketbeat com stocks NYSE LZB earnings https www marketbeat com stocks NYSE LZB earnings Reason 5 Despite LZB being an iconic furniture brand it is currently cheaper than the furniture industry average thanks to the recent selloff https www zacks com stock chart LZB fundamental pe ratio ttm https www zacks com stock chart LZB fundamental pe ratio ttm Reason 6 Dividend paying stock LZB suspended their dividend last year due to the pandemic but it has been reinstated as of this quarter Part of the recent selloff was possibly also because the dividend was just paid this month If they follow the same trend as they always have in years prior to COVID they should be expected to announce their next dividend in late August with dividend payment in early mid September Here is their dividend history https www streetinsider com dividend history php q lzb https www streetinsider com dividend history php q lzb amp x200B THE CASE Reason 1 Continued global supply chain issues Raw material prices skyrocket even higher The primary reason for the selloff appears to be management s warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short term due to raw material price increases LZB s problems could be exacerbated if inflation continues to run hot and raw material prices skyrocket even higher Reason 2 Suspension of dividends again LZB management suspended their dividend for 4 quarters due to Covid and only recently reinstated it last quarter A major supply chain disruption or other internal issues could cause them to suspend it again amp x200B WHAT ARE THE TRANSIENT FACTORS THAT HAVE AFFECTIVE THE PRICE OF THE STOCK I am adding this section to clarify this point I will quote directly from the earnings call which can be read in its entirety here https www fool com earnings call transcripts 2021 06 16 la z boy incorporated lzb q4 2021 earnings call tr https www fool com earnings call transcripts 2021 06 16 la z boy incorporated lzb q4 2021 earnings call tr This is what caused the selloff gt Regarding production capacity demand trends remained strong across the business with backlog at record levels providing for a long tail We anticipate ongoing incremental increases in capacity through fiscal 2022 as new assembly cells are added and efficiencies improve which will result in continued incremental progress on delivered sales However we expect temporary significant pressures on profit margins in the first half of fiscal 22 compared to the very strong profit margin of this Q4 We expect to face ongoing global supply chain disruptions and escalating raw material and freight costs which will cause volatility in results and will eventually be offset by our already announced pricing actions in the back half of the year as we work through our backlog Analysts clarified this point further during the call amp x200B LZB Price Targets and Consensus Ratings https preview redd it q21evgvp2w771 png width 623 amp format png amp auto webp amp s d163345d0478ba66738271cc693f49473737a46e gt Bobby Griffin Raymond James amp Associates Inc Analyst So Bob I just want to circle right back quickly to your comments about the 300 bps of margin pressure just to make sure we re all on the same page of what s that referencing in kind of what timeframe So is that in reference to the 10 EBIT margin that was posted in 4Q And are you saying that 1Q and 2Q of 2021 should be down about 300 bps at the highest level possible versus first at 10 if raw material headwinds were as strong as they could be Robert Lucian Chief Financial Officer That s correct Bobby Griffin Raymond James amp Associates Inc Analyst Okay And then so for both quarters kind of the same type of trajectory off the 10 I mean that would put 2Q though below where kind of it was in the October of 19 quarter which was 7 5 Is that all just raw material related or mix of business or could we end up at 7 EBIT margins below than kind of where we were two years ago even Robert Lucian Chief Financial Officer It s mostly the raw material impacts that we re seeing And again we ve taken pricing and it s taking a while for that pricing to work its way through So it will work its way through by toward the end of Q2 into Q3 and that s when our margins will start improving Bobby Griffin Raymond James amp Associates Inc Analyst Okay All right that s helpful And then trying to usually 1Q is the seasonally weak quarter but with this large of a backlog that you have I think in the 10 K it was 617 million or something called out I mean is the right way to think about the potential revenue side of things here in 1Q basically 12 13 of what you delivered in 4Q or is there something wrong with kind of using that as an estimate Robert Lucian Chief Financial Officer I don t think there s anything wrong using that as an estimate

prices continue to be as high as they ve been but they ve already taken actions that will cause this pressure to lift by the end of Q2 going into Q3 and while margins may be lower the actual revenue and profits will again beat records thanks to the immense backlog in orders that they re now fulfilling thanks to the additional capacity they have added amp x200B FINANCIALS AND VALUATION LZB balance

UPDATE market close 6 18 Despite the Dow dumping more than 500 points LZB held firm at the support of 35 36 and in fact gained a tiny bit day to day People are asking for my position screenshot so here you go Best of luck to everyone who s already jumped in Spread the good word about LZB as far wide as you can Let s make next week LZB week on Wall Street Hello everyone I just made an options play yesterday on LZB La Z Boy that I think is very exciting so I ll share it here I bought 45 call options exp July 21 Current stock price is 37 85 TL DR Reasons Market cap 1 66B Same as GME and AMC in January 2021 Down nearly 15 over the last 2 days despite earnings beat on all metrics simply due to current global supply chain issues Now trading 33 below fair value of 53 39 as per Nasdaq com Last time stock traded near current 36 support level was after last major dump on February 1 Stock recovered to 41 10 by February 8 and hit 45 20 by March 12 As per June 15 earnings report orders are currently backlogged at record levels for all products due to record demand Trailing 12 months P E ratio 14 31 Now cheaper than furniture industry average of 17 67 for this iconic brand Long version full DD After the 10 bagger successes of GME amp AMC I think Reddit is ready for a new 10 bagger I have looked long and hard for that opportunity and I think it is LZB Why This stock has everything Reddit needs 1 LZB has extremely low market cap so it is easy to trade up the ticker LZB market cap is about the same as GME and AMC in January of this year before the mega pumps in price Even without Reddit involvement this stock is pretty much guaranteed to go up from here as per Entrepreneur com https www entrepreneur com article 374743 but if Redditors start buying this up this is EASILY the next ten bagger due to the low market cap 2 It is trading well below fair value after being dumped over the past 2 days Nasdaq com https www nasdaq com articles an intrinsic calculation for la z boy incorporated nyse 3Alzb suggests its 21 undervalued published an article yesterday saying the stock was trading 21 below value when it was trading at 42 Now it is at 36 the long term support which makes it 33 below fair value Why did it dump In their earnings call they issued a warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short term due to raw material price increases right now However they also said these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year So basically the dump is a super overreaction as their earnings report came out the same day J Powell did his press conference and caused the whole market to dump 3 The stock will recover soon because it does this Because this stock has low market cap any news causes a dump that soon recovers Simply looking at the chart over the past 6 months will show other such instances including the last major dump to this support level on February 1 and the subsequent recovery by 10 in only 8 days and a 20 recovery in just over a month after that amp x200B 4 Forbes com https www forbes com sites warrenshoulberg 2021 06 15 la z boy q4 proves home is where the money is notes that LZB is the poster child for the boom in home furnishings sales Some quotes for those that don t want to click through to the Forbes story gt If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer all you have to do is ask La Z Boy By one measurement that the company uses written same store sales for the entire Galleries network doubled increasing 100 for the quarter For the year those sales were up 31 Their CEO noted the following in the earnings call also covered at Forbes gt For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter record sales led to all time record profits driven by increased production capacity excellent performance by our company owned La Z Boy Furniture Galleries stores and continued growth and profitability at Joybird Fiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead 5 LZB beat on all important metrics including EPS and revenue as per their June 15 earnings report 6 And yet this iconic king of furniture brands is currently cheaper than the furniture industry average thanks to this dump amp x200B If Reddit gets interested in this low cap stock I expect it to go to the moon I recommend getting in like I did Best of luck and don t forget to buy one of these with your tendies Lastly I want to add that the analysts covering LZB have all maintained and or raised their price targets into the 50s The lowest price target is 46 which would still be a nice gain from where we are now LZB has strong potential in the short and long term in my opinion For a fantastic earnings beat the drop in price was an overreaction I think it will bounce As always do your own DD and see you all on the damn moon
