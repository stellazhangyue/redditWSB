never failed to return the tendies took advantage of this predictable chaos and earned his claim to fame by correctly predicting that Regeneron would dump What does this have to do with MRNA I don t desire his fame the Wu Tang or the subsequent jail but Moderna MRNA is going to dump I ll begin with the fundamentals then point out the obvious TA MRNA current price 195 all time high as of right now MRNA price on Jan 1 6 mo ago 104 47 MRNA price 15 mo ago March 13 2020 20 On this last date the MRNA market cap was 7 5 billion These dates prices are chosen very intentionally and paint a simple 0th order picture Before the covid hype MRNA was valued at 20 The total market has grown 40 since then comparing total market index then and now which all else equal would suggest a price today for MRNA of 28 not bad But clearly we re not factoring in vaccine profits Moderna was approved in the U S in mid December 1 and EU approval was expected soon after so vaccine profits were priced in by the Jan 1 date at 104 47 https preview redd it hxk4bnccz5371 png width 1380 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e52b8630105ef485d7c8d79aed55dc7233a8fb12 This price already seems too high though depending on the sale the Moderna vaccine sells for 15 to 20 per dose 2 They reached a deal to sell the U S 300 million and the EU 150 million doses generously totaling 10 billion A one time sale yet their market cap has increased 10x from 7 5 bil to 75 bil read overbought 3 The only way this makes ANY sense is if they re counting on a significant mass of the global population gt 1 billion people note they have plans to make 1 4 bil doses in 2022 2 to purchase booster shots every year To their credit they announced a deal with UNICEF this morning to be a long term supplier and supply 45 million vaccines to them in 2022 but this is a far cry from their required numbers this deal is why MRNA is at ATH right now Do we really think MRNA is going to be able to bring gt 1 billion doses to market and find enough willing buyers https preview redd it 0k9d5e9yz5371 png width 925 amp format png amp auto webp amp s c30953d953707e0c4f3246a131f7afb165a4a26f I don t think so and I think the market reflects my uncertainty First Moderna s main competitor Pfizer has been shown to be more user friendly and have less side effects now that some 150 million have tried the two 4 5 Furthermore with Pfizer J amp J Jensen and others the covid vaccine market is actually showing up to be fairly competitive Lastly and very importantly a large fraction of the people who haven t YET got the vaccine never intend to nearly 40 of Americans say they will definitely not or probably not get the COVID 19 vaccine when it becomes available to them 6 This information combined with the fact that MRNA stock is severely overbought looks to me like a ticking time bomb MRNA s boosted position seems incredibly fragile and has already tried to dump recently on three occasions 1 yr chart dec 11 feb 19 may 4th Processing img pefvvc6q06371 ended trading day today with high volume amp momentum to gap down https preview redd it pn92crhs06371 png width 1451 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 39150b42e8324b77def00dce980999d28ccf357c And the reason it s going to dump is because the current bullish valuation requires MRNA to hold a practical monopoly over the vaccine market for years to come The facts are unraveling and this is very much showing not to be the case If they maintain their current market share at 500 million vaccines per yr unlikely as we will see this translates to an adjusted market cap of 45 billion and about the 104 price we saw in January So the base prediction given information here to now is that MRNA will dump to 110 a 40 decrease due the fact that the MRNA vaccine production monopoly was a pipe dream all along And furthermore it seems the covid treatment prevention market may be open to even more competitors outside of vaccines Discovered by Satoshi Omura who received a Nobel Prize for the work Ivermectin is a cheap not under patent common drug that s been used for forty years as a common anti parasitic In Latin America where the U S fancy MRNA tech is nary to be found the people and the market have settled on a different solution The drug has been so in demand that in May health care workers passed out some 350 000 doses to residents in northern Bolivia That same month the Peruvian police seized around 20 000 bottles of animal grade ivermectin that was sold on the black market as a treatment for human coronavirus infections And in July a university in Peru announced that it would produce 30 000 doses to bolster the country s supply 7 This article advocates caution because at the time data is scant But that was many months ago oct 2020 now the data is in https preview redd it hjcnlbdrz5371 png width 503 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 242931c1cb76e0e32e5e51ce305f8b5887a09f41 What started the rush was a demonstration that Ivermectin completely stopped covid19 replication in a petri dish 8 but would it do the same to covid in the human body Well what was the result of the mass buying in Peru For the 24 peruvian states that implemented IVM treatment and Lima excess deaths quickly dropped by 75 after only 45 days 9 Extraneous causes of mortality reductions were ruled out At higher doses Ivermectin could be 80 to 99 effective at preventing Covid19 if taken preemptively One trial done in Argentina had 1 200 healthcare workers 400 did not take Ivermectin and the other 800 did Of the 400 people who did not take Ivermectin over half of them fell sick with covid Of the 800 who did take it 0 ZERO fell ill 10 11 And lastly meta analysis studies 98 of the 52 studies to date report positive effects Random effects meta analysis for early treatment and pooled effects shows an 81 reduction RR 0 19 0 09 0 39 and prophylactic use shows 85 improvement RR 0 15 0 09 0 25 Mortality results show 76 lower mortality RR 0 24 0 14 0 42 for all treatment delays and 84 lower RR 0 16 0 04 0 63 for early treatment 12 13 Also India is improving just as many Indian states offered Ivermectin to every single adult 14 What about Africa Didn t analysts predict Africa would be a huge covid disaster Well a lot of people in Africa actually already take regular doses of Ivermectin for parasitic diseases and these populations show much lower incidents and mortality from sars covid 19 15 How do you think the covid vaccine market will fare if it has to compete against an over the counter prophylaxis drugs You do know that the vaccine Emergency Use Authorization for the MRNA vaccine is contingent upon there being no known alternatives to preventing or treating the disease right 16 That being said they have applied for full authorization along with Pfizer and will probably get it so this specific point is mostly moot but still relevant So what do you guys think Seems to me like MRNA is in a bubble and will pop and the burst could be accentuated by an increasingly competitive market Love to here some people who disagree https preview redd it m2qn07t516371 png width 1074 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

suggest specific positive price action next week, amp x200B Processing img pk0j22pa56371 This DD is in regards to the Stonk that must not be named on WSB Lets go with The Gamer Stonk I ll start with the usual I am not a financial advisor I do not provide financial advice Everything following this is opinion observation I m not one to buy into the echoed phrases of this sub but I am in fact JaCKeD tO tHe TiTs A few authors and their inspired DD that helped get me to this point of jacked tits The below DD s are a must read if you have not already I will attempt to summarize these briefly below u Criand https www reddit com u Criand 1 The flurry of rules before the storm The Gamer Stonk might be hitting T 35 and T 21 next week 2 Things are shockingly similar to the February 24th and March 10th runup u myplayprofile https www reddit com user myplayprofile I Got What You Quant this is just one of the authors DD s but it goes into linear correlation which is now shifting to logarithmic correlation between The Gamer Stonk amp AMC prices AND he explains how there is the possibility that AMC is being used by hedgefucks to hedge their The Gamer Stonk losses This post is focused on u Criand https www reddit com u Criand s DD which enlightened me and many others as to what the fuck has been going on with the 21 day 31 day FTD cycles and prompted me to buy some highly profitable call options for next Friday besides the point Basically his DD 1 is the most accurate hypothesis that we have to date regarding the FTD cycles and DD 2 shows how this theory is now supported by the price action seen on May 25th and in the following days Key Points He clarifies the confusion around why the standalone T 21 day FTD cycles which have been shown to cause price surges do not act the same way as they did during the 480 run and the 350 run Explains how the Feb March 350 run was caused by a dual event of T 35 amp T 21 day FTD cycles occurring in close proximity to one another back to back trading days Notes that the Feb 24th initiation of the run up to 350 was exactly 10 days before we peaked at 350 He references u yelyah2 https www reddit com u yelyah2 s DD which shows how gamma neutral spikes on day 1 of the 480 and 350 price run ups returns to normal for about a week and then spikes up massively again initiating the January and February Gamma Squeezes Below is my furtherment of u Criand https www reddit com u Criand s work all in one concise graphic which feels oddly like a child to me right now Not sure if that is just because I have not really written any DD s before Please click the image to view it blown up and actually take in what is being laid out for you with my lovely computer crayons which I swear to god I don t eat EVER Processing img pk0j22pa56371 Notes I am not sure why I called the 480 and 350 price run ups in the visual Micro Squeezes but thats what came to mind Perhaps gamma squeeze is more appropriate given u yelyah2 https www reddit com u yelyah2 s recent DD Yellow is micro squeeze 1 Blue is micro squeeze 2 Pink is the past 6 days Alright folks I have talked a lot about other peoples work and given you a graphic Now comes my value add Key observations Not only was it a 10 trading day ramp up from the February 24th initiation to 350 on March 10th but it was also EXACTLY 10 TRADING DAYS between the January 13th initiation to the 480 peak on January 29th My reason for calling this out specifically is that it strengthens the theory surrounding the combined T 35 T 21 day price movements and helps us further establish that we could potentially go PARABOLIC AGAIN 10 trading days from 5 25 on JUNE 9th Will they be able to stop us this time Maybe it doesn t even matter if the do See my next points In the aftermath of the January micro squeeze the Dec Jan price floor of 20 DOUBLED and the new price floor was set at 40 between Feb 5th 25th In the aftermath of the Feb 24th Mar 10th micro squeeze the price floor of 40 TRIPLED and the new price floor was set at 120 between Feb 5 25 Given that the price floor doubled and then tripled after these two events could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X 120 That would be a price floor of 360 for those of you who needed help there The MACD line has literally only had significant crossovers golden cross https www investopedia com terms g goldencross asp text What 20does 20a 20golden 20cross 20indicate 3F under 20a 20short 2Dterm 20MA 3 times this year Event 1 Yellow 480 run Event 2 Blue 350 run Event 3 Pink May 17th today Additionally I have plotted trend lines for each of the events Event 1 Yellow we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 1 733 Event 2 Blue we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 770 770 1733 44 or a 56 reduction in 10 day price increase although the price was starting from a floor of 40 instead of 20 44 of 770 would be 338 starting from 120 which would mean a peak price of 405 in event 3 IF this short pattern continues exactly the same THIS PATTERN WILL NOT CONTINUE EXACTLY THE SAME I am only observing the trend of the current pattern The sample size here is literally 2 events albeit 2 very unlikely coincidental events And I don t believe in coincidence The pattern will break for many reasons but the main reason is that hedge fund manipulation literally cannot continue forever Once they get margin called its off to the races and hopefully this event is the straw that quite literally breaks the camels back Kenny G you are the camel Oh yeah forgot about this one LOOK AT THE VOLUME ITS LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE MEDIA IS PUSHING AMC KOSS ANYTHING OTHER THAN The Gamer Stonk AND YET WE HAVE RUN UP FROM 132 April 13th TO 290 WITHOUT A SINGLE TRADING DAY VOLUME GREATER THAN 21 MILLION WE SAW VOLUMES OF MORE THAN 150 MILLION IN JANUARY WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK Alright guys To summarize We could be looking at going parabolic again on June 9th based on the pattern identified by the authors I mentioned above The price action and technical signals are bullish as fuck I fucking love all you mother fuckers who are holding this thing and I will be holding till we can change the world Trust the process Apes See you in the far reaches of space

,PLEASE DO NOT COMMENT THE TICKER ANYTHING WITH those letters getting taken down immediately Ask yourself why This DD is in regards to the Stonk that must not be named on WSB Lets go with The G a ME r Stonk I ll start with the usual I am not a financial advisor I do not provide financial advice Everything following this is opinion observation I m not one to buy into the echoed phrases of this sub but I am in fact JaCKeD tO tHe TiTs A few authors and their inspired DD that helped get me to this point of jacked tits The below DD s are a must read if you have not already I will attempt to summarize these briefly below u Criand https www reddit com u Criand 1 The flurry of rules before the storm The Gamer Stonk might be hitting T 35 and T 21 next week 2 Things are shockingly similar to the February 24th and March 10th runup u myplayprofile https www reddit com user myplayprofile I Got What You Quant this is just one of the authors DD s but it goes into linear correlation which is now shifting to logarithmic correlation between The Gamer Stonk amp AMC prices AND he explains how there is the possibility that AMC is being used by hedgefucks to hedge their The Gamer Stonk losses This post is focused on u Criand https www reddit com u Criand s DD which enlightened me and many others as to what the fuck has been going on with the 21 day 31 day FTD cycles and prompted me to buy some highly profitable call options for next Friday besides the point Basically his DD 1 is the most accurate hypothesis that we have to date regarding the FTD cycles and DD 2 shows how this theory is now supported by the price action seen on May 25th and in the following days Key Points He clarifies the confusion around why the standalone T 21 day FTD cycles which have been shown to cause price surges do not act the same way as they did during the 480 run and the 350 run Explains how the Feb March 350 run was caused by a dual event of T 35 amp T 21 day FTD cycles occurring in close proximity to one another back to back trading days Notes that the Feb 24th initiation of the run up to 350 was exactly 10 days before we peaked at 350 He references u yelyah2 https www reddit com u yelyah2 s DD which shows how gamma neutral spikes on day 1 of the 480 and 350 price run ups returns to normal for about a week and then spikes up massively again initiating the January and February Gamma Squeezes Below is my furtherment of u Criand https www reddit com u Criand s work all in one concise graphic which feels oddly like a child to me right now Not sure if that is just because I have not really written any DD s before Please click the image to view it blown up and actually take in what is being laid out for you with my lovely computer crayons which I swear to god I don t eat EVER Transparent boxes represent the initiation of the combined T 35 T 21 day price movements 6 days because it has only been 6 trading days since https preview redd it sd74jbf5d6371 jpg width 1286 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 208e081544186575e94bc7981a2bb5c52763343b Notes I am not sure why I called the 480 and 350 price run ups in the visual Micro Squeezes but thats what came to mind Perhaps gamma squeeze is more appropriate given u yelyah2 https www reddit com u yelyah2 s recent DD Yellow is micro squeeze 1 Blue is micro squeeze 2 Pink is the past 6 days Alright folks I have talked a lot about other peoples work and given you a graphic Now comes my value add Key observations Not only was it a 10 trading day ramp up from the February 24th initiation to 350 on March 10th but it was also EXACTLY 10 TRADING DAYS between the January 13th initiation to the 480 peak on January 29th My reason for calling this out specifically is that it strengthens the theory surrounding the combined T 35 T 21 day price movements and helps us further establish that we could potentially go PARABOLIC AGAIN 10 trading days from 5 25 on JUNE 9th Will they be able to stop us this time Maybe it doesn t even matter if the do See my next points In the aftermath of the January micro squeeze the Dec Jan price floor of 20 DOUBLED and the new price floor was set at 40 between Feb 5th 25th In the aftermath of the Feb 24th Mar 10th micro squeeze the price floor of 40 TRIPLED and the new price floor was set at 120 between Feb 5 25 Given that the price floor doubled and then tripled after these two events could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X 120 That would be a price floor of 360 for those of you who needed help there The MACD line has literally only had significant crossovers golden cross https www investopedia com terms g goldencross asp text What 20does 20a 20golden 20cross 20indicate 3F under 20a 20short 2Dterm 20MA 3 times this year Event 1 Yellow 480 run Event 2 Blue 350 run Event 3 Pink May 17th today Additionally I have plotted trend lines for each of the events Event 1 Yellow we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 1 733 Event 2 Blue we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 770 770 1733 44 or a 56 reduction in 10 day price increase although the price was starting from a floor of 40 instead of 20 44 of 770 would be 338 starting from 120 which would mean a peak price of 405 in event 3 IF this short pattern continues exactly the same THIS PATTERN WILL NOT CONTINUE EXACTLY THE SAME I am only observing the trend of the current pattern The sample size here is literally 2 events albeit 2 very unlikely coincidental events And I don t believe in coincidence The pattern will break for many reasons but the main reason is that hedge fund manipulation literally cannot continue forever Once they get margin called its off to the races and hopefully this event is the straw that quite literally breaks the camels back Kenny G you are the camel Oh yeah forgot about this one LOOK AT THE VOLUME ITS LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE MEDIA IS PUSHING ANYTHING OTHER THAN The Gamer Stonk AND YET WE HAVE RUN UP FROM 132 April 13th TO 290 WITHOUT A SINGLE TRADING DAY VOLUME GREATER THAN 21 MILLION WE SAW VOLUMES OF MORE THAN 150 MILLION IN JANUARY WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK Alright guys To summarize We could be looking at going parabolic again on June 9th based on the pattern identified by the authors I mentioned above The price action and technical signals are bullish as fuck I fucking love all you mother fuckers who are holding this thing and I will be holding till we can change the world Trust the process Apes See you in the far reaches of space

am exhausted and trying to write this quickly as I expect approval will come today or Monday at the latest per the deadline it has to be made on Monday so nothing too bold here I have worked in the drug industry for over 10 years and have taken compounds from phase III trials to full on market approval This ain t my first rodeo Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor and these opinions are that of my own and not much better then random guessing Chances are some of you here have the memory span of a Goldfish You know who else does Your Grandma who forgot where she placed her 12 000 shares of Union Pacific she scooped up during the Nixon Administration This is because she like millions of others suffer from Alzheimer s known to you retards as old timers So what you say Why is this important Keep reading There has been no new treatment for this in over 20 years https www marketwatch com story biogens pivotal moment will the fda approve the experimental and controversial alzheimers disease drug aducanumab 11622654675 And Biogen might have a drug that works This is up for debate but what isn t up for the debate is the FDA approval Here is why 1 The FDA appears to be in bed with Biogen a FDA personal leak just prior to panel meeting back in November https www statnews com 2020 11 04 fda scientists appear to offer major endorsement of biogens controversial alzheimers treatment https www statnews com 2020 11 04 fda scientists appear to offer major endorsement of biogens controversial alzheimers treatment b I have never heard such positive sediment come out of the FDA before a drug was approved let alone reviewed by the committee Keep in mind even though the committee trashed the data the FDA does NOT have to fall in line with the committee And while in the meeting the panelists tussled with the nature of each of the questions during the voting periods c During the panel meeting many of the experts were disappointed with how Biogen and the FDA s presentation was virtually a joint presentation This is RARE Normally the FDA and the sponsor do separate presentations But this presentation went hand in hand d I really feel that if the questions had been phrased differently there may have been a better outcome e The stock jumped to over 350 on this single leak 2 The PDUFA Date was pushed back 3 months to June 7th a This is HUGE This drug was submitted under a priority review voucher to the FDA This means the FDA has until 6 months to give an approval or disapproval to the IP The interesting thing with these is Sponsors can sell these to other sponsors for 100 million Here is a recent example https www globenewswire com news release 2021 01 05 2153459 0 en Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Announces Sale of Priority Review Voucher for 100M html text Nasdaq 3ARYTM 2C 20a PRV 20for 20 24100M https www globenewswire com news release 2021 01 05 2153459 0 en Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Announces Sale of Priority Review Voucher for 100M html text Nasdaq 3ARYTM 2C 20a PRV 20for 20 24100M This is the first time that I have seen the FDA PUSH a priority review timeline back 3 months It may have happened in the past but not that I can recall Idk about you all but I would be furious if the FDA extended a timeline on something by 50 that is worth 100 million on the open market because they wanted more data if they are going to simply give a thumbs down to the therapy anyway after the data was provided Not going to happen The CEO even thanked the FDA in the article Keep in mind the FDA has three types of meetings it can have with the sponsor Type A B and C meetings I promise the applicable meetings have been taking place regularly Think about it b Or you could think of this as a jury deliberating on a court case IF they come back with a verdict after a couple of hours bad news bears for the defendant But if it takes them several days or weeks like we see here with the FDA I ll let you fill in the rest c Source https www fiercebiotech com biotech biogen shares jump fda delay for its alzheimer s hopeful aducanumab d The stock jumped 10 on this news 3 Three Members of the FDA Committee Posted Their Objections to The Drugs Approval on JAMA a First NEVER under estimate a MD s ego I work with them day and night They are amazing people and do the Lord s work HOWEVER God forbid they do not get their name published on some journal And while they do save lives the published ones are treated as demi gods on campus large institutions Their word is Bible and if the FDA runs counter to this they will make their voice heard b I have never seen this in all my years of clinical trials Normally these committees give their opinion vote and that s it Why are they so vocal BECAUSE THEY KNOW GOOD AND WELL THIS WILL LIKELY BE APPROVED AND THEY WANT TO GO ON RECORD LOUD AND CLEAR and to inflate their egos incase efficacy turns out to be negligible c Source https www biospace com article biogen s alzheimer s hopeful takes another body blow https www biospace com article biogen s alzheimer s hopeful takes another body blow 4 There has not been an advance in this field for nearly 20 years a See the link posted earlier Between this and the pressure from patient advocacy groups I think it will be enough to sway the FDA and gain approval 5 The question is not about safety but EFFICACY a No one is widely arguing that this drug is unsafe That is key here The committee is arguing about the efficacy and need for additional trials Sometimes something is better than nothing b In other words the patients will be safe to take the drug but rather it works or not is another question entirely and outside the purview of this post In summary I think the FDA will offer a conditional approval and request Biogen to conduct an additional phase 3 trial in parallel to address some of the committee s concerns This would effectively be the same as a full on approval and I expect the stock will soar above 350 Position 37 Shares at 263 70 happy to post proof if required Mods If this does not get approved BAN ME See you all on the other side TL DR The FDA has made up their mind on Biogen s latest drug candidate The committee that trashed the drug know this and are going on record in any way possible But there has not been a new therapy approved in over two decades and the pressure to approval is just too high Ignore the noise this will be approved and hopefully help thousands of patients

decisions do not use anyone else s opinions or decisions as your own ,This will probably be buried maybe deleted as I am a lurker and could be taken wrong and accused of spreading FUD as I don t contribute to discussions here and only lurk I am just so frustrated with what happened today and the discussions I have been seeing that I sent a few comments and now honestly just need to vent maybe someone can get something out of this retard s ramblings or we can have a discussion about any of what is below without attacking one another maybe it will only help one person and that is fine it is better than saying nothing at all People who have been here for awhile probably will find little value in this post but who knows maybe you will Hell newer people probably wont either but it could be useful to think about some of what I have to say who knows I did too much brick red shit is getting weird Keep in mind obviously I am retarded and my opinion is terrible do not read further I sniff glue and none of this is financial advice all it is meant to do is engage your brain to think about things before picking sides or spreading information that could cause harm Also Excuse my grammar its worse than my investment strategy I am generally curious to hear thoughts about the current situation in both what happened to AMC today or anything related to it and I guess just general thoughts surrounding both BB and AMC without shitting on the other with misinformation and FUD It is starting to look like a BB vs AMC brawl at the moment with AMC getting shit on for a terrible misguided reason I don t know how many people are actually contributing to said shit but ignorance breeds FUD I am not going to attack people investing in BB or anyone talking bad about AMC or vice versa because everyone is entitled to their own opinion and can say and invest in whatever they want to I just hope you can think about both sides and research into it yourself before doing so at the least Honestly I believe that both companies have potential I lean more toward AMC because I know more about it which is not much because again I am retarded not because BB is terrible or a dumb investment I just do not know much about it so I will not have a strong opinion on it I will however be looking into it tonight because more knowledge is always a positive The more we educate ourselves the better decisions we can make That being said I think AMC is being shit on a little harder because of the FUD that happened today with AMC price and the media s pushing of BB and spreading AMC FUD as well Paperhands more than likely contributed heavily today with short attacks to suppress AMC gainz but this is just speculation AMC s sold shares to Murdock 2 days ago and also some to the market today and it is being blown way out of proportion in a negative fashion which in all honesty it could very well be very advantageous to retail s gainz On the surface that statement sounds insane to most people who do not know much about the stock market or business operations in general If you look up information directly from AMC and try to understand what was actually done and why it was done and logically think about it instead of trusting others 100 Today could have played out very differently I m not saying it was a terrible day by any means just stating that it possibly could have been better if FUD could have been spotted and stamped out by retail more efficiently by thinking for themselves and not relying on others most of the time Retail needs to be VERY cautious when reading about ANY news they hear about the market retail has completely flipped the market upside down and media will be a huge factor in trying to get retail back in line we have seen it happening for months There is and will also be more retail to flock to these stocks that will drive volatility higher which means retail must not accidently spread FUD and learn to think for themselves based on data and facts given If we do not think for ourselves a little more and be more skeptical about what we hear less tendies will be had The 20m shares that got issued were going to go into the Outstanding shares regardless if they sold them to the market The shares were going to be given to the executives of AMC for their personal benefit instead they used these shares to secure capital to be used in the future benefit of AMC and thus retail the shareholders They gave up personal gain to have more capital infused into AMC this to me is very good news The only way shorts do not have to cover is AMC going bankrupt which capital they gained from those shares helps to avoid These shares were basically going to be a bonus that AMC executives refused in order to give it to the company Think about all that has happened to AMC then think about what you hear happen at failing companies and what their executives do before said company goes tits up Ill give you a hint they usually dont try to decline bonuses to help the company Granted you could argue they are nowhere near close to claiming bankruptcy but even so more than anything I think it proves that they actually give a shit and are grateful to retail for saving their ass then I must have ate too many crayons About the dilution problem think about it logically Do you think that roughly 20m shares that were added on two different days with 480M and 590m volume on the days in question to a share count that is already somewhere around 500M that is roughly 80 owned by retail already is fucking us over If you think it does is it really enough to jump ship spread FUD It could be who knows but my retarded brain thinks otherwise I am not telling you what to think but rather to actually think about it research it and come to your own conclusion Even if you have no interest in investing in AMC spreading negative things about it only hurts the other so called meme stocks that directly correlate to it AMC no longer has any shares to sell they have 46k shares left which means retail will have the final say on any vote in shareholder meetings as they own the majority of shares and AMC can not dilute the outstanding shares if you believe that is actually what they have been doing with ill intent They want to have the ability to issue 25m shares and given the circumstances that AMC just survived I think it is a good idea to have that option in their back pocket as they literally don t have to use them unless needed I am not telling you that you should believe what I believe I know a majority of retail might not agree with my opinion and that is completely fine I just want some thought to be put into it think about it and research it yourself If you come to the same conclusion then vote against it in the meeting Retail will have final say in the deal so we must be educated about any matter like this that may come to a vote This deal might be completely irrelevant in fact it probably is but who knows it is better to be prepared so an informed decision can take place Retail literally has final say in decisions that can effect an entire multi billion dollar company What Retail decides in any vote will effect the company and in turn each of the individual investments in it Give it some effort We all know what happened today with AMC price 6 3 2021 I Don t think it was the best day ever by any means but it was not all that bad Considering the circumstances with the confusion that happened throughout the day with shares being sold by AMC especially when you factor in new investors who are not yet

800,nrxupf,t2_ea4kn,1622785929,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrxupf/amc_and_bb_both_have_potential_research_and_put/,1,AMC and BB both have potential Research and put your own thoughts into your decisions do not use anyone else s opinions or decisions as your own ,This will probably be buried maybe deleted as I am a lurker and could be taken wrong and accused of spreading FUD as I don t contribute to discussions here and only lurk I am just so frustrated with what happened today and the discussions I have been seeing that I sent a few comments and now honestly just need to vent maybe someone can get something out of this retard s ramblings or we can have a discussion about any of what is below without attacking one another maybe it will only help one person and that is fine it is better than saying nothing at all People who have been here for awhile probably will find little value in this post but who knows maybe you will Hell newer people probably wont either but it could be useful to think about some of what I have to say who knows I did too much brick red shit is getting weird Keep in mind obviously I am retarded and my opinion is terrible do not read further I sniff glue and none of this is financial advice all it is meant to do is engage your brain to think about things before picking sides or spreading information that could cause harm Also Excuse my grammar its worse than my investment strategy I am generally curious to hear thoughts about the current situation in both what happened to AMC today or anything related to it and I guess just general thoughts surrounding both BB and AMC without shitting on the other with misinformation and FUD It is starting to look like a BB vs AMC brawl at the moment with AMC getting shit on for a terrible misguided reason I don t know how many people are actually contributing to said shit but ignorance breeds FUD I am not going to attack people investing in BB or anyone talking bad about AMC or vice versa because everyone is entitled to their own opinion and can say and invest in whatever they want to I just hope you can think about both sides and research into it yourself before doing so at the least Honestly I believe that both companies have potential I lean more toward AMC because I know more about it which is not much because again I am retarded not because BB is terrible or a dumb investment I just do not know much about it so I will not have a strong opinion on it I will however be looking into it tonight because more knowledge is always a positive The more we educate ourselves the better decisions we can make That being said I think AMC is being shit on a little harder because of the FUD that happened today with AMC price and the media s pushing of BB and spreading AMC FUD as well Paperhands more than likely contributed heavily today with short attacks to suppress AMC gainz but this is just speculation AMC s sold shares to Murdock 2 days ago and also some to the market today and it is being blown way out of proportion in a negative fashion which in all honesty it could very well be very advantageous to retail s gainz On the surface that statement sounds insane to most people who do not know much about the stock market or business operations in general If you look up information directly from AMC and try to understand what was actually done and why it was done and logically think about it instead of trusting others 100 Today could have played out very differently I m not saying it was a terrible day by any means just stating that it possibly could have been better if FUD could have been spotted and stamped out by retail more efficiently by thinking for themselves and not relying on others most of the time Retail needs to be VERY cautious when reading about ANY news they hear about the market retail has completely flipped the market upside down and media will be a huge factor in trying to get retail back in line we have seen it happening for months There is and will also be more retail to flock to these stocks that will drive volatility higher which means retail must not accidently spread FUD and learn to think for themselves based on data and facts given If we do not think for ourselves a little more and be more skeptical about what we hear less tendies will be had The 20m shares that got issued were going to go into the Outstanding shares regardless if they sold them to the market The shares were going to be given to the executives of AMC for their personal benefit instead they used these shares to secure capital to be used in the future benefit of AMC and thus retail the shareholders They gave up personal gain to have more capital infused into AMC this to me is very good news The only way shorts do not have to cover is AMC going bankrupt which capital they gained from those shares helps to avoid These shares were basically going to be a bonus that AMC executives refused in order to give it to the company Think about all that has happened to AMC then think about what you hear happen at failing companies and what their executives do before said company goes tits up Ill give you a hint they usually dont try to decline bonuses to help the company Granted you could argue they are nowhere near close to claiming bankruptcy but even so more than anything I think it proves that they actually give a shit and are grateful to retail for saving their ass then I must have ate too many crayons About the dilution problem think about it logically Do you think that roughly 20m shares that were added on two different days with 480M and 590m volume on the days in question to a share count that is already somewhere around 500M that is roughly 80 owned by retail already is fucking us over If you think it does is it really enough to jump ship spread FUD It could be who knows but my retarded brain thinks otherwise I am not telling you what to think but rather to actually think about it research it and come to your own conclusion Even if you have no interest in investing in AMC spreading negative things about it only hurts the other so called meme stocks that directly correlate to it AMC no longer has any shares to sell they have 46k shares left which means retail will have the final say on any vote in shareholder meetings as they own the majority of shares and AMC can not dilute the outstanding shares if you believe that is actually what they have been doing with ill intent They want to have the ability to issue 25m shares and given the circumstances that AMC just survived I think it is a good idea to have that option in their back pocket as they literally don t have to use them unless needed I am not telling you that you should believe what I believe I know a majority of retail might not agree with my opinion and that is completely fine I just want some thought to be put into it think about it and research it yourself If you come to the same conclusion then vote against it in the meeting Retail will have final say in the deal so we must be educated about any matter like this that may come to a vote This deal might be completely irrelevant in fact it probably is but who knows it is better to be prepared so an informed decision can take place Retail literally has final say in decisions that can effect an entire multi billion dollar company What Retail decides in any vote will effect the company and in turn each of the individual investments in it Give it some effort We all know what happened today with AMC price 6 3 2021 I Don t think it was the best day ever by any means but it was not all that bad Considering the circumstances with the confusion that happened throughout the day with shares being sold by AMC especially when you factor in new investors who are not yet accustomed to the FUD seen everyday Midday was was one fucking hell of a ride We should think about the positives of today as well as the negatives instead of focusing mainly on the latter I think

overvalued AA says the media was either misrepresenting an anonymous source or lying as you ll never find a statement from Mudrick to that effect on the record Also says the reports about how much Mudrick made or could have made were inaccurate reports 2 What Mudrick did was good for AMC as a company Says Mudrick gave AMC 239 million in cash at a sky high price for the shares 3 Regarding the 11 5 million share FUD from today AA says the straight scoop is that the 11 5 million were sold directly from the pockets of management Management at AMC decided to use their own allocated shares to raise money for AMC as a collective 4 The management will no longer have any shares allocated specifically for them in the future vote They have decided to allow shares allocated for them to instead be used for the growth of AMC s coffers 5 AA says the 11 5 8 million shares would have been used either way whether for management or for sale They chose for sale to benefit AMC as a whole and raised over 500 million in cash for the company 6 AA We made these sales when the trading volumes of AMC were sky high 8 5 million shares or 11 5 million shares in a week when we are trading 500 million shares normally but that s during a normal week We have been trading 500 million shares A DAY 7 AA WE ARE DONE WE ARE OUT THERE ARE NO MORE SHARES LEFT Says there are technically only 46 000 shares remaining in total 8 AA We cannot do anymore shares unless the shareholders approve But he says he believes in his opinion that the shareholders should issue more shares because it would help grow the company 9 AMC will ask the shareholders to authorize a 25 million shares that absolutely cannot be used in 2021 Says the shares may not even be used in 2022 AA notes that the last time shares were authorized was 9 years ago and it took them 9 years to slowly trickle them out 10 We would only use them if there were really good opportunities for AMC For example if a new wave of COVID comes and the company needs a bit more cash or to deleverage the debt of the company 11 AA says there is merger and acquisition opportunities for AMC namely of competitors that are not surviving the pandemic One that they are looking at is the third most visited movie theatre in Los Angeles 12 AA says they want to create genuine value for AMC shareholders 13 AA reiterates that any additional shares MUST go to vote with the shareholders and that even if the shares were approved none of the shares would be used in 2021 14 AA I m an AMC shareholder I ve run AMC for 5 years Other than gifting some shares to my children I have never sold any AMC shares and I have no plans to 15 AMC has approx 6 billion in debt 2 billion in cash AMC has very few maturities meaning AMC doesn t have much debt to pay until 2025 and 2026 AMC has many years to earn the money to pay down the debt and many financial options to handle that debt regardless of timeline 16 Between 501 7 501 8 million shares have been stated as outstanding this includes international shares About 27 million of those are held outside the US and Canada 17 AA explains the abnormal volume Says machine trading is resulting in the same share being traded multiple times in a single trading day A single share may go back and forth between a machine and a human zillions of times in a day AA says there are also other reasons the volume is so abnormal but cannot go into detail 18 AA says that on June 2 AMC shares represented 11 of all options trading in the USA 19 Somebody out there in the world of Reddit was trying to speculate that AMC was going to split or reverse split our stock I can tell you I ve never given any serious thought to splitting our stock We have absolutely no plans to split out stock We cannot split out stock without shareholder approval so even if we wanted to do that and we don t we d have to go to the shareholders 20 I have an enormous amount of respect for the owners of our business I work for you The shareholders are king You are in charge 21 Says he actively reads Twitter replies and DMs from the Apes 22 Regarding dividends AA says he cannot discuss it due to securities laws He says that he would point out that AMC did pay a dividend up until 2 years ago but they chose to end it in order to utilize the cash better Says that is part of the reason AMC survived the pandemic 23 AA s final message to the short sellers This is the fifth company I have run since 1993 I d like to think that AMC is going to be a proud chapter in American business history It annoys me to no end that people bet against us I spend every waking moment trying to make AMC a stronger company so that the people who bet with us are the ones who succeed 24 AA In Adam Aron you get what you see I m not a spring chicken My word has always been my bond I m a high integrity guy I ve always been a high integrity guy Just give us the benefit of the doubt once in a while Trust us to make the best decisions we can 25 AA I hope you are shareholders of this company for years to come 26 AA I hope what we do and how we conduct ourselves I hope we make all of you proud END NOTES Guys I want to reiterate something very important AMC nor Adam Aron would EVER be able to confirm the existence of synthetics in an interview like this Legally that would be a nightmare especially if the SEC was involved This is simply not the forum for it I was seeing a lot of comments in the live chat and in the chatroom here on this subreddit claiming he was denying the existence of synthetics or people that were expecting him to confirm them That is simply untrue and would have never been able to happen Overall I think Adam did a very good job with this interview He addressed a lot of the concerns we had across the board and I am glad he said only as much as he did for the safety of the squeeze and the stock Let me know your thoughts fellow apes

have been complaining about people doing DDs only when they have gone up over 9000 I m here to bring you a stock that I really like 1 have been beaten up UNFAIRLY recently but 2 will MOON can t say you weren t invited on this ride With that out of the way to cater to the level of evolution in this civilisation the post will be split into the following 3 levels Read them as how you would categorise yourself don t cheat you bastards L1 You re a primitive ape probably can t tell what green and red drawings on your trading dashboard L2 You re a functioning ape probably asking what shares and have very strong opinions on the hedgies gt And if you don t even consider yourself an ape go to the bottom for the tl dr So what s BEKE Effectively a real estate transactions platform matching of demand and supply of residential properties new existing as well as renovations MAIN POINT OF BUYING BEKE Also owns an offline brokerage brand Lianjia which drives some of transaction value by the platform Currently books 8 of housing market in China So what s going for it Rising tide floats all boats Chinese residential real estate market is expected to continue growing steadily over the short medium and long term structurally favourable growing pie L1 Real estate market will continue to go up steadily good for BEKE and competitors revenues L2 Gross transaction value GTV of the market addressed by BEKE faces tailwinds in terms of demand and supply drivers GTV increase Continued urbanisation to drive housing transactions increased demand Consumer demand for housing upgrades increased demand Guaranteed supply of new houses by the Chinese government increased supply Continued dependence on middlemen brokerages to facilitate transactions in the opaque market maintained penetration Unrivalled proposition BEKE owns a disruptive best and sole in class country serving as the broker of brokerages and self compounding business model allowing it to snatch market share and become the dominant industry player L1 BEKE Only Shopify of real estate transactions in China BEKE revenues gt Competitor s revenues L2 BEKE will continually grab market share from a growing pie because of the flywheel effect within its business model enabled by its Housing Dictionary and best in class infrastructure to support the real estate transaction lifecycle Housing Dictionary Largest and most accurate listing of properties in China providing a superior transaction experience for all brokers and housing customers The company sees this as a prized asset and dedicates resources to ensure the authenticity of listings and have even offered cash rewards for every listing found to be untrue Best in class infrastructure Software suite and services provided to external partner real estate brokerages and ability to link different participants across the workflow within a real estate brokerage has not been replicated and have already formed a moat by being the first mover within the industry Self compounding business model vs rest of industry By using the Housing Dictionary to provide a superior experience for customers and brokers and the ability to onboard and improve the operating efficiency of brokerages which then further supplements the Housing Dictionary and thus providing a much superior experience again for customers and brokers BEKE effectively outshine competitors who are typically advertising companies who have a transactional relationship with brokerages and customers Attractive valuation Street valuation does not account for BEKE s growth through network of other brokerage brands the recent passing of the founder antitrust rumours L1 BEKE growth gt Wall Street estimates growth Founder have relinquished management duties to co founder before death antitrust so Look at the inconsequential fines given to BABA lol L2 BEKE will outperform in growth in revenues and profits oh look they are already profitable as a growth company against the concerns Partner brokerage network based on Wall Street estimates assume that revenues from that segment will stall by 2023 what a joke based on the value proposition of the company this will continue

my thoughts and hope this helps all of you all make informed decisions Dear Apes Your increased chatter on CLNE over the past 2 days is great and very welcomed by long term shareholders Investor motivations of course are allowed to differ and a lot of you are focused on options gamma which is a perfectly reasonable driver of your investment thesis Some of you are referring to hedge funds who have shorted the stock down to 7 and potential for short squeeze All that seems fair too But let me present the underlying fundamental stock thesis on this stock The business prospects are healthy and this should give all investor types including the ape crowd that this is a real company with a very valuable underlying business Background CLNE has been at it for many years singularly driving forward the idea that natgas can and should be a transportation fuel All this time they were shat on and discounted But as the company started to shift from CNG to RNG things have started to change because RNG s low negative carbon footprint has started to resonate with trucking fleets Call it ESG awareness or the Greta effect or just general wokeness But we all have grown up and realized we need to transition our transportation system onto cleaner fuels and RNG is ONE not the only way to do this Early adopters have used RNG to showcase their commitment to the environment 2020 2021 Has been full of News The past few months have been massive for CLNE because the business model had been validated Lots of attention naturally was given to the big commitments from Total BP Chevron to co invest big alongside CLNE as strategic partners in an effort to ramp up RNG production Awesome But CLNE is really an integrated RNG infrastructure play On the upstream side of things they partner with big boys Total BP Chevron to produce RNG basically methane from landfills and diaries and sewage plants On the downstream side they have quietly built and now own 550 fueling stations conveniently located in ports and on the main routes using by commercial trucking fleets So they make RNG and then they sell that RNG through their own natgas gas stations And by providing this integrated commercial grade solution they have become the go to partner of choice for big corps that need to manage the carbon footprint of their trucking fleets Enter AMZN the word partner is the key word here Big corps partner with CLNE because they need certainty when switching portions of their trucking fleet to RNG Simply put AMZN and others want to make sure that their long term carbon reduction targets can be met and their financial investment in RNG trucks will pay off They want to make sure the fueling stations are in place where their trucks need them check They want to make sure the supply of RNG is readily available at those fueling stations check They want to make sure that as their switch to RNG is a success for their businesses and does not create unexpected issues CLNE is the only credible partner in the RNG space that can give this certainty to AMZN and other partners And with that moat in place additional customer wins only solidifies their role as RNG infrastructure partner of choice What happened to the stock YTD To be honest its hard to fully explain the drop to 7 because it was fast and violent and seems overdone The company has been doing great good Q but just lost its mojo after the AMZN announcement Also as we all know interest rates spiked causing an indiscriminate sell down in growth stocks But some blame must also be placed on misinformation spread by a wall street analyst around the terms of the AMZN deal Even though this has been clarified and corrected the damage was done negative mo took over and the stock has been in correction since The issue for those who care was around the warrants that AMZN was issued by CLNE Those warrants are obviously dilutive but their vesting and exercise is dependent on a massive commitment by AMZN to purchase tons of RNG Specifically warrants only vest once AMZN has purchased 500mm of RNG from CLNE excluding payments related to pass through costs These pass through costs can be significant so the aggregate revenue value is probably more like 800 850mm These numbers are from Credit Suisse Under these terms the dilution is offset by a big positive impact in EBITDA plus proceeds from the warrant exercise go to CLNEs balance sheet to fund future growth credit Suisse estimates that the EBITDA contribution from AMZN deal will eventually be north of 100mm This will help accelerate CLNEs drive towards being break even and profitable in the near future Biden whatever your political stripes we can agree that its best for us humans apes to reduce our carbon emissions where we can And we can through capture of methane and conversion into RNG so why fight that Biden agrees and the new admin announced a war on methane earlier this year That is a tailwind for RNG and CLNE We now have the federal government recognizing that methane is bad and we need to take measures to control methane emissions including its capture and conversion into a productive fuel source We cant expect to stop producing methane as a civilization that would entail closing dairy farms shutting down landills forcing people and animals to stop farting but we can capture it and put it into productive use Regulation to control methane emissions is our friend on this one Where are we today with the stock Stock got crushed to 7 in the past month for above reasons and consolidated around 8 Yesterday the stock peeped over 9 and here we are Whether the apes get involved or not CLNE has a bright business future and it has a bright future because it is genuinely providing a solution that we need to save our planet That might be the single best reason to support CLNE as a shareholder we need this company to help transition us off fossil fuels while earning a fair return for investors

and micro squeezes Also T 35 T 21 elaboration ,I ll start with the usual I am not a financial advisor I do not provide financial advice Everything following this is opinion observation Much of my knowledge of the markets has been acquired through reading countless hours of DD posted by others OBLIGATORY BuY amp HoDl Now that that is out of the way I would like to reference a few authors and their inspired DD that helped get me to this point The below have DD s that are a must read if you have not already please visit their profiles and read their posts I will attempt to summarize the main points briefly below u Criand https www reddit com user Criand submitted 1 The flurry of rules before the storm GME might be hitting T 35 and T 21 next week 2 Things are shockingly similar to the February 24th and March 10th runup u myplayprofile https www reddit com user myplayprofile I am highlighting just one of their posts but it goes into linear correlation which is now shifting to logarithmic correlation between GME amp AMC prices AND he explains how there is the possibility that AMC is being used by hedgefucks to hedge their GME losses This post is focused on u Criand s DD https www reddit com user Criand submitted sort new which enlightened me and many others as to what the fuck has been going on with the 21 day 31 day FTD cycles Basically his DD over the last few weeks is the most accurate hypothesis that we have to date regarding the FTD cycles and one of his most recent posts shows how this theory is now supported by the price action seen on May 25th and in the following days Key Points He clarifies the confusion around why the standalone T 21 day FTD cycles which have been shown to cause price surges do not act the same way as they did during the 480 run and the 350 run Explains how the Feb March 350 run was caused by a dual event of T 35 amp T 21 day FTD cycles occurring in close proximity to one another back to back trading days Notes that the Feb 24th initiation of the run up to 350 was exactly 10 days before we peaked at 350 He references u yelyah2 https www reddit com user yelyah2 submitted DD which shows how gamma neutral spikes on day 1 of the 480 and 350 price run ups returns to normal for about a week and then spikes up massively again initiating the January and February Gamma Squeezes Below is my furtherment of u Criand s work all in one concise graphic which feels oddly like a child to me right now Not sure if that is just because I have not really written any DD s before Please click the image to view it blown up and actually take in what is being laid out for you with my lovely computer crayons which I swear to god I don t eat EVER Transparent boxes represent the initiation of the combined T 35 T 21 day price movements 6 days because it has only been 6 trading days since https preview redd it v8tmo6hdi5371 png width 1287 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 9a7e70813852641f29b2e57d8fc64ea7f7b83f77 Notes I am not sure why I called the 480 and 350 price run ups in the visual Micro Squeezes but thats what came to mind Perhaps gamma squeeze is more appropriate given u yelyah2 recent DD Yellow is micro squeeze 1 Blue is micro squeeze 2 Pink is the past 6 days Alright folks I have talked a lot about other peoples work and given you a graphic Now comes my value add Key observations Not only was it a 10 trading day ramp up from the February 24th initiation to 350 on March 10th but it was also EXACTLY 10 TRADING DAYS between the January 13th initiation to the 480 peak on January 29th My reason for calling this out specifically is that it strengthens the theory surrounding the combined T 35 T 21 day price movements and helps us further establish that we could potentially go PARABOLIC AGAIN 10 trading days from 5 25 on JUNE 9th Will they be able to stop us this time Maybe it doesn t even matter if the do See my next points In the aftermath of the January micro squeeze the Dec Jan price floor of 20 DOUBLED and the new price floor was set at 40 between Feb 5th 25th In the aftermath of the Feb 24th Mar 10th micro squeeze the price floor of 40 TRIPLED and the new price floor was set at 120 between Feb 5 25 Given that the price floor doubled and then tripled after these two events could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X 120 That would be a price floor of 360 for those of you who needed help there Edit to previous bullet someone makes a fair point that We can t assume that since it doubled in January from 20 to 40 and tripled in March from 40 to 120 that therefore the next floor must be more than 3x 120 What if the rule in the sequence is 20 gt 80 gt 140 Or what if 20 gt 80 gt 20 gt 80 I have included this just to explicitly state that my question could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X 120 by no means is intended to say the price floor WILL triple again I feel like this is a good point to say that this is speculation and theorization based on observation and nothing more The MACD line has literally only had significant crossovers golden cross https www investopedia com terms g goldencross asp text What 20does 20a 20golden 20cross 20indicate 3F under 20a 20short 2Dterm 20MA 3 times this year Event 1 Yellow 480 run Event 2 Blue 350 run Event 3 Pink May 17th today Additionally I have plotted trend lines for each of the events Event 1 Yellow we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 1 733 Event 2 Blue we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 770 770 1733 44 or a 56 reduction in 10 day price increase although the price was starting from a floor of 40 instead of 20 44 of 770 would be 338 starting from 120 which would mean a peak price of 405 in event 3 IF this short pattern continues exactly the same THIS PATTERN WILL NOT CONTINUE EXACTLY THE SAME I am only observing the trend of the current pattern The sample size here is literally 2 events albeit 2 very unlikely coincidental events And I don t believe in coincidence The pattern will break for many reasons but the main reason is that hedge fund manipulation literally cannot continue forever Once they get margin called its off to the races and hopefully this event is the straw that quite literally breaks the camels back Kenny G you are the camel Oh yeah forgot about this one LOOK AT THE VOLUME ITS LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE MEDIA IS PUSHING AMC KOSS ANYTHING OTHER THAN GME AND YET IT HAS RUN UP FROM 132 April 13th TO 290 WITHOUT A SINGLE TRADING DAY VOLUME GREATER THAN 21 MILLION WE SAW VOLUMES OF MORE THAN 150 MILLION IN JANUARY Alright guys To summarize We could be looking at going parabolic again on June 9th based on the pattern identified by the authors I mentioned above The price action and technical signals are bullish as fuck Last note

knowledge of the markets has been acquired through reading countless hours of DD posted by others OBLIGATORY BuY amp HoDl Now that that is out of the way I would like to reference a few authors and their inspired DD that helped get me to this point The below have DD s that are a must read if you have not already please visit their profiles and read their posts I will attempt to summarize the main points briefly below u Criand 1 The flurry of rules before the storm GME might be hitting T 35 and T 21 next week 2 Things are shockingly similar to the February 24th and March 10th runup u myplayprofile I am highlighting just one of their posts but it goes into linear correlation which is now shifting to logarithmic correlation between GME amp AMC prices AND he explains how there is the possibility that AMC is being used by hedgefucks to hedge their GME losses This post is focused on u Criand s DD which enlightened me and many others as to what the fuck has been going on with the 21 day 31 day FTD cycles Basically his DD over the last few weeks is the most accurate hypothesis that we have to date regarding the FTD cycles and one of his most recent posts shows how this theory is now supported by the price action seen on May 25th and in the following days Key Points He clarifies the confusion around why the standalone T 21 day FTD cycles which have been shown to cause price surges do not act the same way as they did during the 480 run and the 350 run Explains how the Feb March 350 run was caused by a dual event of T 35 amp T 21 day FTD cycles occurring in close proximity to one another back to back trading days Notes that the Feb 24th initiation of the run up to 350 was exactly 10 days before we peaked at 350 He references u yelyah2 DD which shows how gamma neutral spikes on day 1 of the 480 and 350 price run ups returns to normal for about a week and then spikes up massively again initiating the January and February Gamma Squeezes Below is my furtherment of u Criand s work all in one concise graphic which feels oddly like a child to me right now Not sure if that is just because I have not really written any DD s before Please click the image to view it blown up and actually take in what is being laid out for you with my lovely computer crayons which I swear to god I don t eat EVER Transparent boxes represent the initiation of the combined T 35 T 21 day price movements 6 days because it has only been 6 trading days since https preview redd it v8tmo6hdi5371 png width 1287 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 9a7e70813852641f29b2e57d8fc64ea7f7b83f77 Notes I am not sure why I called the 480 and 350 price run ups in the visual Micro Squeezes but thats what came to mind Perhaps gamma squeeze is more appropriate given u yelyah2 recent DD Yellow is micro squeeze 1 Blue is micro squeeze 2 Pink is the past 6 days Alright folks I have talked a lot about other peoples work and given you a graphic Now comes my value add Key observations Not only was it a 10 trading day ramp up from the February 24th initiation to 350 on March 10th but it was also EXACTLY 10 TRADING DAYS between the January 13th initiation to the 480 peak on January 29th My reason for calling this out specifically is that it strengthens the theory surrounding the combined T 35 T 21 day price movements and helps us further establish that we could potentially go PARABOLIC AGAIN 10 trading days from 5 25 on JUNE 9th Will they be able to stop us this time Maybe it doesn t even matter if the do See my next points In the aftermath of the January micro squeeze the Dec Jan price floor of 20 DOUBLED and the new price floor was set at 40 between Feb 5th 25th In the aftermath of the Feb 24th Mar 10th micro squeeze the price floor of 40 TRIPLED and the new price floor was set at 120 between Feb 5 25 Given that the price floor doubled and then tripled after these two events could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X 120 That would be a price floor of 360 for those of you who needed help there Edit to previous bullet someone makes a fair point that We can t assume that since it doubled in January from 20 to 40 and tripled in March from 40 to 120 that therefore the next floor must be more than 3x 120 What if the rule in the sequence is 20 gt 80 gt 140 Or what if 20 gt 80 gt 20 gt 80 I have included this just to explicitly state that my question could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X 120 by no means is intended to say the price floor WILL triple again I feel like this is a good point to say that this is speculation and theorization based on observation and nothing more The MACD line has literally only had significant crossovers golden cross 3 times this year Event 1 Yellow 480 run Event 2 Blue 350 run Event 3 Pink May 17th today Additionally I have plotted trend lines for each of the events Event 1 Yellow we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 1 733 Event 2 Blue we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 770 770 1733 44 or a 56 reduction in 10 day price increase although the price was starting from a floor of 40 instead of 20 44 of 770 would be 338 starting from 120 which would mean a peak price of 405 in event 3 IF this short pattern continues exactly the same THIS PATTERN WILL NOT CONTINUE EXACTLY THE SAME I am only observing the trend of the current pattern The sample size here is literally 2 events albeit 2 very unlikely coincidental events And I don t believe in coincidence The pattern will break for many reasons but the main reason is that hedge fund manipulation literally cannot continue forever Once they get margin called its off to the races and hopefully this event is the straw that quite literally breaks the camels back Kenny G you are the camel Oh yeah forgot about this one LOOK AT THE VOLUME ITS LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE MEDIA IS PUSHING AMC KOSS ANYTHING OTHER THAN GME AND YET IT HAS RUN UP FROM 132 April 13th TO 290 WITHOUT A SINGLE TRADING DAY VOLUME GREATER THAN 21 MILLION WE SAW VOLUMES OF MORE THAN 150 MILLION IN JANUARY Alright guys To summarize We could be looking at going parabolic again on June 9th based on the pattern identified by the authors I mentioned above The price action and technical signals are bullish as fuck This is not my original post

continue this meme high and one stood out above the rest mostly because it has something that gets me all hot and bothered but may frighten and baffle my fellow primates A goddamn date I know you re not used to getting them gt gt gt gt June 18th lt lt lt lt There s also shit involved which is just a bonus THE SHIT Clean Energy Fuels CLNE specializes in renewable natural gas Like all good RNG renewable natural gas is about taking a bunch of random and literal bullshit and turning it into beautiful loot In this case they are grinding for methane From all the It s poot loot This is the most natural ha step for the juggernaut initiative that is Green Energy which is coming nation wide circa 2030 one way or another even if the rest of the industry is still trying to work out an actual plan CLNE is ahead of the game While and co are trying to decide how much of the country can actually run on all electric CLNE is securing deals with a little company called AMZN and securing some huge long term revenue THE GAMMA SQUEEZE I can t believe you made it all the way through that last section on only five emoji Good boy Here s some treats before I go on So what is special about this stock and why the date Well some rubes went and built a Goldberg machine out of options expiring on 6 18 If this thing goes off there will be so much gamma squeezed out that your new green dildo will make Bruce Banner feel inadequate CLNE has a float of 145 million and had been sitting flatter than your wife s boyfriend s abs at around 8 for the past month consolidating and getting all pent up like you when the missus goes on her weeklong trips to the grocery store Prior to yesterday s open it had an open interest of 47 000 in 6 18 calls with strikes between 9 and 15 As of typing that range now has almost 56 000 OI 51 000 OTM which means the squeeze potential has only increases with yesterday s activity The most striking HA of these numbers is the 29 000 calls aimed at a share price of 13 Sure seems like someone knows or is planning something I don t know about Either way it is set to go off like you when the missus Even before hitting that lucky number 13 calls representing 22 million shares 15 of the float and 433 of the last 10 day average volume should be hedged When it hits 13 29 million more shares in calls become ITM and the volume beast will begin shitting out green dildos that it will consume to shit more in a shit ouroboros that will fuel the ape shit ship back to the moon Yesterday was just a preview of what will happen as more of those strikes are reached The daily volume exceeded 600 of the previous 10 day average and that resulted of a share price high of 9 74 19 higher than previous close THE PLAY Okay fair warning this part pains me to write a bit because it almost doesn t seem like a bet but the most safe method and what will fuel the squeeze is to buy and HODL shares You should know the drill by now The reason shares won t quite scratch the gambling itch is because CLNE s ATH of 19 happened just back in February and it hasn t dipped far below its current level in five months It also has a price target of somewhere between 17 to 18 depending on the analyst https finance yahoo com research stock forecast CLNE symbols CLNE amp ncid qsprelated bl1fruji100 This means that even with its recent rise there is not much downside and the upside is huge even if the gamma squeeze does not play out The feeling of holding is not quite the same when there is no apparent risk of your bags being 50 for a quarter of a year before you can break even I know but hopefully you can find a way to adjust to all the green in your portfolio Shares also benefit from a possible raincheck of the scheduled event should 6 18 fail to deliver While not quite as ideal 9 17 calls have a whopping 20 881 open interest at the 20 strike which could grow into a similar situation should lower strike interest grow There is currently an OI of about 29 000 in the run up range from 10 19 but it is not so nice and evenly distributed as it is on our magic date Worth watching though Overall shares should securely keep your tits below you if that is how you like them Options are where the biggest upside is going to be and boy is there a lot of potential Thanks to CLNE s month long power nap premiums are were stupidly low for calls 6 18 strikes 13 and above A light breeze is all it took to make some of those ten baggers yesterday They still have plenty of room to run and premiums are still somewhat modest all things considered Triggering the squeeze would send these to high heaven TL DR Gamma squeeze CLNE 6 18 Be in before there or be in shares POSITIONS 128 shares 8 98 13x 6 18 15c 10x 9 17 10c

few subs as I m not sure if this will pass mods quality assurance so keep this in mind when you come along this more than once And if mess up the English never mind as I m from another country across the pond amp x200B I assume a few of you already have came across CLNE a while ago here Perhaps even due to the massive DD brought to us by u NrdRage a genius and 4D chess player when it comes down to writing If you haven t yet definitely check out his DD as I won t be repeating the fundamentals https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lye7st nrdrages friday dd ok one of you apes needs to utm

gas tanks of trucks busses and other special vehicles So you little retards most likely should thank CLNE already that they re doing the job for you in recycling that waste you leave behind Hell if this already isn t worth buying in Well let s move on amp x200B So why bother with gas when EV is where the money is First a quick info aside I work for a big ass company 4th largest in the world in its segment We move a lot of goods as a daily business and when I m saying a lot I really mean A LOT talking about millions of pallets per year Hell even that fat ass Evergiven Ship which got stuck in the Suez had 80 containers of ours on it Oh by the way is the petition for putting the boat back still up and running Anyhow when it comes to logistic costs it gets as tight as it can be Ask your wife s boyfriend for how tight things can be he knows Keeping the costs on logistics low is key for selling goods to consumers at a low price and therefore sell high volumes and make money So talking about high volumes logistics only work out if the utilization of your vehicles is as high as possible Keeping them trucks and goods in movement is the only way of preventing money to be burned Ask Amazon or even those Irish Ebenezer Scrooge s from low cost carrier Ryanair As long as planes trucks passengers and packages are in movement and the infrastructure is in use they make money OK I guess even the most simple minded brains of you must have understood this point by now So therefore let s move over to the initial part and why gas should play a role anyhow Well have you ever experienced how long it takes to recharge your shitty Korean EV to then move along on 60 of your capacity because you were fed up waiting Exactly recharging batteries asks for patience And now imagine a commercial long haul truck to be recharged for hours and not to be moved THIS is the main reason why Electric Trucks won t work out It simply burns your money when you can t move your goods because your EV truck with a design from outer space is busy sucking off the energy grid Logistic operations are reliant on fast moving vehicles and short breaks when they needed to be refilled amp x200B Renewable natural gas as the green alternative to petrol and other fossil based fuels The American Gas Association states Renewable Natural Gas RNG is the term that is used to describe pipeline quality biomethane produced from biomass It is interchangeable with natural gas It is carbon neutral extremely versatile and fully compatible with the U S pipeline infrastructure It can be used in homes and businesses in manufacturing and heavy industries for electricity production and as an alternative fuel for transportation https www aga org research reports renewable natural gas rng https www aga org research reports renewable natural gas rng from 2010 Furthermore it says that RNG has several more benefits amp x200B Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions From a greenhouse gas emissions perspective RNG demonstrates tremendous benefits That is because when captured for conversion into RNG methane from animal waste and other biomass sources that otherwise would have entered directly into Earth s atmosphere is instead combusted as RNG This results in the release of greenhouse gases that are approximately 21 times less potent than methane released directly into the atmosphere The use of RNG represents the recycling of carbon that is already circulating in the environment whereas burning a fossil fuel represents the release of new carbon emissions that were previously sequestered in the earth Increased Domestic Energy Production Provides security by increasing the domestic production of renewable non fossil fuel energy that could supplement foreign produced transportation fuels such as oil Improved Waste Management Collecting and processing animal waste from agricultural activities prevents run off into local waterways and reduces groundwater contamination New Revenue Source for American Farmers Creates an opportunity for dairy hog and poultry farmers to convert a waste problem into a valuable supplementary revenue source Innovative Domestic Job Creation As the RNG industry continues to grow increasing production will lead to the development and deployment of new technologies while creating new green jobs that cannot be exported amp x200B To sum things up quickly CLNE turns natural gas into fuel gt companies need fuel not electricity to run their fleet on gt companies buy the fuel gt CLNE has a running business I m pretty sure Greta Thunberg Al Gore and friends love this business model amp x200B What else do you need to know Look four yourself Theses stats were provided by the EIA U S Energy Information Administration in April 2021 Natural gas incl the Liquefied LNG etc is on the rise for the last years https preview redd it 81oh2wqf09371 png width 1185 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 83944b001711b81827df0dc0f13ba1094aeee2ea Natural gas is no

from 2019 you can just as sure bet your left nut that RNG will become present in this same sector TLDR CLNE is a great chance to make some money The future outlook will reward early movers and CLNE

TRYING TO PUSH THIS BELOW 9 The 200 000 DC members are the number of Medicare Part B patients they have access to through the 1 800 providers using their software They still have access to all those patients and will enroll them over time They set forecasts at 70 000 to 100 000 by end of 2021 They already have 65 000 enrolled in April They intentionally set expectations extremely low to absorb the negative market reaction upfront and then outperform going forward To understand what CLOV should be worth today look at OSH and AGL All three companies are Direct Contracting Entities DCE

patient depends on each company s model which drives profit rates OSH 14 3B market cap OSH is obviously liked the most by the market probably because they employ the clinicians so they can keep more

www wsj com market data quotes CLOV research ratings GREEDY SHORTS ARE JUST TRYING TO STICK IT TO CHAMATH BY TRYING TO PUSH THIS BELOW 9 The 200 000 DC members are the number of Medicare Part B patients they have access to through the 1 800 providers using their software They still have access to all those patients and will enroll them over time They set forecasts at 70 000 to 100 000 by end of 2021 They already have 65 000 enrolled in April They intentionally set expectations extremely low to absorb the negative market reaction upfront and then outperform going forward To understand what CLOV should be worth today look at OSH and AGL All three companies are Direct Contracting Entities DCE competing for risk bearing Medicare patients They all should be valued based on the number of risk based patients they have and how fast they re growing that number The value of each risk based patient depends on each company s model which drives profit rates OSH 14 3B market cap OSH is

Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor BCX9930 is a great challenge and we are happy we have one My only concern is I have no concerns Pipeline in a Molecule My aim

be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases we reach to the following conclusion The potential market size BCX9930 will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to 28 56B 51B year This numbers are explained below 1 2 Due to COVID 19 the market for PNH and aHUS was anticipated to grow from US 4855 million in 2020 to US 7023 million by 2026 it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5 89 during 2021 2026 3 Anca vasculitis prevalence in the USA rounds 10 20 per million 3300 6600 patients Using Soliris which costs 500 000 year We would aim for 1 65B 3 3B market size as of now Expected to grow by 2025 4 The global systemic lupus erythematosus market size is expected to reach USD 3 08 billion by 2025 according to a new report by Grand View Research Inc 5 8 IgAN The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone Prevalence rounds 45 million meaning 14 850 patients or a potential 7 25B market size using Soliris s yearly price 6 C3G Prevalence in the USA round 14 140 per 1M people 4620 46 200 patients If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs 500 000 year the potential market size we aim for rounds 2 31B 23 1B 7 PMN prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN so we would potentially aim for a similar market size meaning 7 25B amp x200B amp x200B V VI Alexion Buy Out amp x200B On December the 12th 2020 Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B More than 90 of their revenue come from their C5 inhibitor being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen You might think why does this matter Well remember we have the best in class Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion s and is able to treat x4 times more diseases than they do aswell This buy out reflects how undervalued BCX9930 is Apart from the buy out I think it s essential to mention that Alexion bought Achillion s Factor D when it was in Ph2 for 930MM In 2020 Alexion s SOLIRIS eculizumab ULTOMORIS Ravulizumab net product sales were 5 13B Treatments that are currently approved to treat PNH and aHUS As a quick example using the average biotech mid cap x7 revenue multiplier and the revenue Soliris managed to generate in 2019 5 13B 35 91B It would mean a SP value of 203 90 for BCRX I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in class treatment and it s able to treat x4 times more diseases therefore aims for a bigger TAM amp x200B amp x200B V VII Soliris Ultomoris patients survey amp x200B BCRX recently did a survey with 23 PNH patients 12 of them using Ultomiris and the other 11 Soliris The survey showed that 91 of the patients were interested in switching due to the reasons explained in the pic below amp x200B https preview redd it

amp x200B Processing img bys1evc749371 amp x200B amp x200B V VIII BCX9930 Valuation amp x200B Having in mind BCX9930 is a the B est in class treatment that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their C5 inhibitor and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the 40B mark BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a 30 of Alexion s buy out price this is 11 7B meaning 66 44 Same thing as with Orladeyo happens here BCX9930 is an Orally taken treatment the other approved treatments out there requiere usage of Needles so we shoud expect BCX9930 to follow Orladeyo s steps or perhaps perform even better now that the company has gained valuable experince with the launch of Orladeyo amp x200B Processing img h6n8n6p849371 amp x200B amp x200B 5 Strong BO Buy Out candidate amp x200B As we have explained in the Institutional section before all good bio tech investors do know who Alexander J Denner founder of Sarissa Capital is After recently increasing his stake in BCRX along with BlackRock he now owns a 5 of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc Denner has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning 789 in the last 3 quarters showing strong conviction in the company Since Denner opened his position in Alexion it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal as shown in the picture below amp x200B Processing img 1p9pdhea49371 After this exhaustive analysis of the company we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a strong BO candidate A Buy Out coming from Biogen BIIB company where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors would make total sense in the following 1 2 years once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled BIIB s financial position in the last year has notoriously worsened the profitability has gone down a 71 25 in the last year They need new revenue sources and BCRX s excellent pipeline could change so Takeda TAK could be another excellent suitor for the BO considering how Orladeyo is stealing its HAE patients market share It also is important to mention that Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M amp A candidates Mergers and Acquisitions as of October 30th 2020 Stating how they believe BCRX will have a strong revenue

with Soliris amp x200B Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we should expect from Biocryst in the upcoming years From 2007 to 2014 Alexion s SP grew a 1777 Being valued at 10 5 in 2007 and 186 6 in 2014 Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their C5 inhibitor was approved to treat additional diseases firstly PNH then aHUS as the market size it captured became wider and the amount of patients it treated slowly scored up Biocryst Pharmaceutical s SP managing to do the SP move Alexion s stock did is more than doable considering the unique pipeline it possess Having in mind Alexion made 66 4 MM revenue the first year 2007 while BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo apart from it additional revenues generated by Rapivab Galidesivir stockpillings may come amp x200B Processing img rxim71qc49371 amp x200B amp x200B 7 De risked company amp x200B Last December the 7th 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management With this agreement BCRX was funded with 325 000 000 in order to support Orladeyo launch Jon Stonehouse CEO confirmed that the company will not need to do

severely undervalued and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline it should be valued around 180 PT will keep growing as we get new data updates from the on going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing potentially making it have the Best Risk Reward ratio in the Bio Sector I naturally do have a position in this company my average entry price being around the 4 range I plan to hold my shares

as I m not sure if this will pass mods quality assurance so keep this in mind when you come along this more than once And if mess up the English never mind as I m from another country across the pond I assume a few of you already have came across CLNE a while ago here Perhaps even due to the massive DD brought to us by u NrdRage https www reddit com u NrdRage a genius and 4D chess player when it comes down to writing If you haven t yet definitely check out his DD as I won t be repeating the fundamentals https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lye7st nrdrages friday dd ok one of you

medium ios app amp utm name iossmf So what does CLNE do They turn your waste into energy simple as that CLNE has specialized in gaining natural gas methane from landfills etc and turning it into money by filling up the gas tanks of trucks busses and other special vehicles So you most likely should thank CLNE already that they re doing the job for you in recycling that waste you leave behind Hell if this already isn t worth buying in Well let s move on So why bother with gas when EV is where the money is First a quick info aside I work for a big company 4th largest in the world in its segment We move a lot of goods as a daily business and when I m saying a lot I really mean A LOT talking about millions of pallets per year Hell even that Evergiven Ship which got stuck in the Suez had 80 containers of ours on it Oh by the way is the petition for putting the boat back still up and running Anyhow when it comes to logistic costs it gets as tight as it can be Keeping the costs on logistics low is key for selling goods to consumers at a low price and therefore sell high volumes and make money So talking about high volumes logistics only work out if the utilization of your vehicles is as high as possible Keeping them trucks and goods in movement is the only way of preventing money to be burned Ask Amazon or even the Irish low cost carrier Ryanair As long as planes trucks passengers and packages are in movement and the infrastructure is in use they make money OK I guess even the most of you must have understood this point by now So therefore let s move over to the initial part and why gas should play a role anyhow Well have you ever experienced how long it takes to recharge your EV to then move along on 60 of your capacity because you were fed up waiting Exactly recharging batteries asks for patience And now imagine a commercial long haul truck to be recharged for hours and not to be moved THIS is the main reason why Electric Trucks won t work out It simply burns your money when you can t move your goods because your EV truck with a design from outer space is busy sucking off the energy grid Logistic operations are reliant on fast moving vehicles and short breaks when they needed to be refilled Renewable natural gas as the green alternative to petrol and other fossil based fuels The American Gas Association states Renewable Natural Gas RNG is the term that is used to describe pipeline quality biomethane produced from biomass It is interchangeable with natural gas It is carbon neutral extremely versatile and fully compatible with the U S pipeline infrastructure It can be used in homes and businesses in manufacturing and heavy industries for electricity production and as an alternative fuel for transportation https www aga org research reports renewable natural gas rng https www aga org research reports renewable natural gas rng from 2010 amp x200B Furthermore it says that RNG has several more benefits Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions From a greenhouse gas emissions perspective RNG demonstrates tremendous benefits That is because when captured for conversion into RNG methane from animal waste and other biomass sources that otherwise would have entered directly into Earth s atmosphere is instead combusted as RNG This results in the release of greenhouse gases that are approximately 21 times less potent than methane released directly into the atmosphere The use of RNG represents the recycling of carbon that is already circulating in the environment whereas burning a fossil fuel represents the release of new carbon emissions that were previously sequestered in the earth Increased Domestic Energy Production Provides security by increasing the domestic production of renewable non fossil fuel energy that could supplement foreign produced transportation fuels such as oil Improved Waste Management Collecting and processing animal waste from agricultural activities prevents run off into local waterways and reduces groundwater contamination New Revenue Source for American Farmers Creates an opportunity for dairy hog and poultry farmers to convert a waste problem into a valuable supplementary revenue source Innovative Domestic Job Creation As the RNG industry continues to grow increasing production will lead to the development and deployment of new technologies while creating new green jobs that cannot be exported To sum things up quickly CLNE turns natural gas into fuel gt companies need fuel not electricity to run their fleet on gt companies buy the fuel gt CLNE has a running business I m pretty sure Greta Thunberg Al Gore and friends love this business model What else do you need to know Look four yourself Theses stats were provided by the EIA U S Energy Information Administration in

become present in this same sector TLDR CLNE is a great chance to make some money The future outlook will reward early movers and CLNE definitely belongs to them with a fully operational running

,I do about 20 hours of research on the stock a week I went straight to the filings and found the following information that makes RKT insanely Bullish play and investors wet dream Not financial advice The best part about this DD is that the news wasn t shared to retail and kept quiet so you know it s legitimate stuff One of the requirements of being inducted into the SP 500 is having 10 of the company shares available to the free float Right now it s 7 and just recently grew at the end of May Which I just found out https www spglobal com spdji en documents additional material sp 500 brochure pdf Here is the filing just happened https doc morningstar com Document 045ec7d96db807790e6ffacc2db8cf35 msdoc original clientid globaldocuments amp key 52dbc583e1012395 RKT was also just ranked 194 in the fortune 500 recently and also ranked 5th in the best places to work by the Fortune 500 The company also makes billions of dollars a quarter and netted 2 billion in q1 One of the reasons why RKT is trading at its current price is because the float availability is so small There is no other reason than that because you can t be ranked the 194th richest company in America and have a market cap of less than 40 billion when the average company on the SP 500 is trading at an average PE ratio of 30 to 40 ARKT is sitting at four Obviously it can be undervalued but it doesn t make sense to anybody unless you read this post or do any research whatsoever Not only that but they are continuing to grow and aggressively successful in doing so Here s the funny part and makes a ton of sense If you look at the filing Dan Gilbert sold his shares at 16 83 a share Wonder why he would do that Well if you read the filing you ll see that he is transferring his shares to class D shares which is used for employees and typically employees get a discount on a stock plan Being that it s one of the best places to work according to fortune 500 it s reasonable to assume that they have a great benefits plan Now the shares are sitting as class D shares waiting to be distributed either as gifts awards or acquired by employees through their stock purchase plan on a discount of current market price He literally sold shares way below valuation to provide employees with amazing benefits Funny part is now the stock is sitting around 20 a share If the employee gets I don t know a dollar discount They now get it at 19 Selling at 16 83 gives Gilbert wiggle room when his employees purchase shares This means it s very unlikely the stock will ever fall below 18 again due to the fact that Gilbert will now possibly be taking a loss on the shares that he sold He won t have any shares below 16 83 available in his class D So if an employee wants to purchase the stock at a discount and the stock sitting sitting at 17 there are no shares available to buy at 16 Get my drift Maybe this is another reason why he sold shares at 25 because he knew he needed to transfer shares lower and wanted his employees to accumulate at a very awesome price because the man is selfless When you re a billionaire typically you don t really care about money anymore you care about people and your business Now as far as the market goes investors know exactly that this is happening trust me they have been around the block They also now see how much a philanthropist the owner actually is and that they actually achieve the results that they speak of You re not one of the richest people in the world and don t know how to work the market especially when you own a multi billion dollar mortgage company which frequently involved the market This is amazing in so many ways because investors are not going to let retail buy below 18 for a very long time or ever and if they do you better load the F up Once he transfers remaining 3 needed to be in the S amp P 500 the stock will soar even higher but I think there s going to be investors pushing up the price at a premium prior to this happening I don t think it ll take any longer I m hoping that some stupid hedge fund associate read this post and tells his boss to gig is up so that it just happens already but maybe that s wishful thinking Honestly if it gets inducted into the S amp P 500 and they actually achieve the results they want to achieve as they verbally stated in multiple earnings calls 1k 2k a share is actually possible for a company ATH They have shown that they continue to grow and innovate at any cost My PT is 80 by November 2021 Pos 15k in January 2023 calls Looking to retire on this one If you want something shorter there is a cup and handle for me on the daily chart with the gap to fill about 15 up from here TLDR RKT will eventually be inducted into the as the owner continues to transfer class a shares to class D shares for employee plans They were sold at 16 83 and I am assuming the reason is because the employees get the stock at a discounted price This is just a theory but holy shit it makes a ton of fucking sense and I cannot wait to be a millionaire

in Europe we call it biomethane makes sense for the transport sector Still the sector has not yet received the attention it deserves from major Investment Banks and Wall Streets brokers while hydrogen companies and batteries are covered by everyone CLNE is covered only by Credit Suisse but further brokers may come in the next months these are the bullet points to take into consideration for Natural Gas Vehicles trends GHG BALANCE In order to get it you need to collect methane that would have alternatively leaked into the atmosphere thus you immensely decrease the GHG emission balance of your activity as methane has a 30x worse effect than CO2 This is why according to the Low Carbon fuel standard system RNG has a negative carbon intensity if you burn what you collected you will always have a minor impact on the environment in terms of GHG emissions This is also why in some organizations and states natural gas vehicles fueled with RNG will be considered like ZERO EMISSION Vehicles despite the tailpipe emission of their combustion engines as a reminder a natural gas combustion engine compared to a diesel one emits 99 less SOx 80 less NOx 95 less PM2 5 Particulate 20 less CO2

amp BATTERIES and Wall Street brokers and Investments Banks are not paying enough attention yet ,Hello everyone Here a top down policy and regulatory analysis on the reasons why Renewable Natural Gas in Europe we call it biomethane makes sense for the transport sector Still the sector has not yet received the attention it deserves from major Investment Banks and Wall Streets brokers while hydrogen companies and batteries are covered by everyone CLNE is covered only by Credit Suisse but further brokers may come in the next months these are the bullet points to take into consideration for Natural Gas Vehicles trends GHG BALANCE In order to get it you need to collect methane that would have alternatively leaked into the atmosphere thus you immensely decrease the GHG emission balance of your activity as methane has a 30x worse effect than CO2 This is why according to the Low Carbon fuel standard system RNG has a negative carbon intensity if you burn what you collected you will always have a minor impact on the environment in terms of GHG emissions This is also why in some organizations and states natural gas vehicles fueled with RNG will be considered like ZERO EMISSION Vehicles despite the tailpipe emission of their combustion engines as a reminder a natural gas combustion engine compared to a diesel one emits 99 less SOx 80 less NOx 95 less PM2 5 Particulate 20 less CO2

early golden age was nothing related to the environment Nobody cared about it in 2010 2015 Natural gas price was favorable if compared with diesel and the companies were able to raise capital substantially What went wrong the spread differential became not favorable and the companies entered in a spiral of negative events and mismanagement Today natural gas is still cheaper and thanks to

retard ape who has been following the now NASDAQ public company SoFi for some time since pre merger and have found it to be insanely prospective on both long term fundamentals AND short squeeze potential Yet there isn t a lot exposure on it This is my humble dump of relative retail accessible news DD and TA that I ve come across for the SoFi bull case gathered here so all my fellow apes can yell at it In the last 3 1 2 weeks SOFI went from 15 to 23 on an entirely steady upwards climb yet it STILL maintained high and growing short positions at VERY HIGH borrowing rates Weeks ago at 15 it was at 30 SI with 230 borrow fees and as of yesterday it was still maintaining around 25 35 SI and 80 99 borrowing fees hourly with short positions still flowing in amp x200B This short activity has continued DESPITE many bullish indicators Analyst buy recommendation book value target of 25 share minimum book value from Oppenheimer Home run Q1 earnings report 2 5 Billion cash raised from public SPAC merger Big moves in FinTech space w acquisition of national bank charter and opening IPO access for retail investors amp x200B All this is top of its already well developed and pioneered online banking model as well as its strong and still growing customer base SoFi provides and is continually innovating on great financial products for average retail finance customers in an up to date modern online banking format Loans fractional shares cryptocurrencies IPO access and many others services that are usually segregated to different sources As the CEO Anthony Noto recently mentioned on CNBC SoFi is the ONLY one stop shop for modern financial and banking needs This poises it to be a big player in the coming years OR be a huge acquisition target by any big players wanting to get into the FinTech space This company is fantastic undervalued strong with the fundamentals and float is SHORTED 25 35 Note As of this post June 4th around 1 30pm EST the SOFI stock has been taking hits into the 20 50 range yet it recovers and maintains a strong support floor to stay above 20 This after a dip in the previous day all coincided with decreases in the borrow rates amp increases in borrowing see Dan s TA video on the metrics below amp x200B I smell blood in the water amp x200B Here is some of the news and DD to look at Oppenheimer buy recommendation and 25 book value price target https www smarteranalyst com new blurbs sofi technologies sofi initiated with a buy at oppenheimer amp x200B InvestorSpace article on prospects and a conservative 50 fundamental price speculation https investorplace com 2021 06 what happens to sofi technologies and sofi stock now that its public Important note I cannot find any documented or recorded source but according to a few market watchers I follow there has be some whispers on the street that SoFi has the high potential to reach well into the 200 400 in years to come with its current growth rate business model and competitive prospects in its field This is worth noting because it does fall in line with what SoFi has been up to and the current growth momentum and speed continues unimpeded against competitors 3yr 200 target is modest Of course this is entirely speculation based on an assumption they have the same of growth every year amp x200B In depth grounded and honest TA on the short movements implications and outlook https youtu be 5HAw1bMbhgQ This Youtube channel Walkabouts with Dan follows a variety of stocks movements and implications SoFi is one of the low radar squeeze potentials he watches with almost daily video updates on its movements and order metrics Great quality analysis that isn t exaggerated using in depth DD with day by day short reporting as well as chart analysis and some speculation as to what the days movements might indicate realistically for better or worse in the future You can watch all the previous videos to see what the progression has been with SoFi as well as the videos to come that he posts almost daily amp x200B Article on merger value points 2 4B raised acquisition of Gold Pacific national bank charter https www pymnts com news ipo 2021 sofi will go public june 1 following spac merger amp x200B NASDAQ Article on SoFi destroying Q1 earnings predictions https www nasdaq com articles sofi reports blowout results ahead of spac merger 2021 05 22 Here s the actual full report if you like that sort of thing https www sec gov Archives edgar data 0001818874 000110465921069505 tm2116935d1 425 htm amp x200B It is also worth noting the possible origin of the shorting This is speculation but if had to guess I would think the dislike of Chamath who led the merger with SoFi fueled a lot of the shorting interest on the IPOE SPAC initially Chamath has been controversial with fair reason recently Which leads me to believe a lot of people shorted this thing pre merger believing Chamath s name would be a death sentence If this is in any way the case it is a major mistake that helps a squeeze case Personally I don t care for him But whats so nice about SoFi and Chamath s merge is that hate him or love him he is inconsequential to the big things SoFi will be doing The growth and incentive of this stock is there from the company not Chamath Merger is done SoFi is public They got the 2 4B in raised funds and are still above public opening prices in the first week no heavy sell off commonly associated with going public Chamath doesn t make or break much anymore especially considering the insider trade restrictions in place No one inside is selling off anything for a bit of time It can t be stressed enough that this company was is already a great fundamental FinTech prospect with what they have created the moves they re making and the goals they have set on towards The potential of this squeeze now just adds even more incentive to the stock and it s not on many peoples radars I m certain there s much more out there to dig into with this stock This is just the surface level of the bull case for SoFi and the chatter about it Obviously research more to whatever levels you find acceptable I am but a humble retard ape with average access to data and news NOT a financial advisor giving financial advice I just like the stock TL DR SOFI GO BBBRRRRRRRRRR

utility sector directly influences the growth of Array Solar been quickly rising over the last decade as cost of solar technology decreased significantly over that time period Solar energy is now cheaper to produce than coal natural gas and nuclear as of 2020 Energy production and utility companies will follow the money and continue to build solar plants to capitalize on this opportunity US Solar Production from Utility GWh 2011 1 800 2012 4 300 138 2013 9 200 114 2014 18 300 99 2015 26 500 45 2016 36 700 38 2017 53 000 44 2018 66 600 26 2019 72 200 9 2020 90 900 26 Source United States Department of Energy Solar accounted for 2 3 of total energy production in 2020 Obviously plenty of room to grow Coal Natural gas and Nuclear combined for 80 of total US electricity production in 2020 Now that solar is the cheapest energy source I expect it to take a large portion of that pie maybe 25 or more in the next 10 15 years would be my guess The only thing holding solar back is that the power grids in the US are build only to directly transport electricity from the source to its destination So there is no element of the grid designed to store electricity This has not been an issue in the past bc coal nuclear natural gas and even hydro produce energy 24 7 Obviously Solar can only produce in the day The solution to this issue is large utility scale electric storage The exact kind provided by Tesla These storage systems will provide necessary liquidity and versatility to the grid with solar production The Lithium Ion batteries in these storage systems are rapidly decreasing in price Prices of Li Ion batteries have dropped 90 in the last decade As it becomes more appealing for Tesla and other companies to construct these storage systems and start providing more utility scale electricity storage more utility companies will invest in solar rigs It will be more profitable to produce and won t be held back by the limitations of old grid infrastructure Good video by CNBC on the Grid Storage systems and the growth of solar utility production https m youtube com watch v x3aqWJO4Rso https m youtube com watch v x3aqWJO4Rso UNDERVALUED In the first few months after IPO Array s price held around the low 40 s hitting a high of 53 99 In late January until now the stock has sold off significantly There are 3 main reasons for this and why the concerns are irrelevant in the long term 1 Broader market tech growth sell off due to inflation FUD I m not going to try to predict if inflation will stay shoot up or go back down to relatively normal levels but there is one think I know for sure Tech growth is cheaper now Barring hyperinflation and or a depression this dip gives long term investors a good buying opportunity 2 Tax credit changes hurt YoY revenue ITC is a federal tax credit that allows people or businesses to right off x of the cost they spent on solar and directly related related systems expenses on their income tax This was 30 up to the end of 2019 Then it is lowered to 26 from 2020 2022 then to 22 in 2023 then 2024 to 0 for residential and 10 for commercial utility and scale The fact that there is still a 10 tax creditor the foreseeable future is great And it doesn t matter that residential dropped to 0 because Array doesn t operate in that market So why would this Tax Credit be bad Well going back to the top of the post under Quarterly net income I said I would get to later Q1 2020 was a great Q for array and their revenue Revenue or that quarter was 438M compared to the total yearly revenue in 2019 of 650M Sense that great quarter Revenue has dropped significantly And now because YoY of the last Q report is compared to that breakout Q it makes this Q and YoY growth look really bad I believe that Q1 2020 revenue was drastically and temporary inflated because of an element of the ITC tax credit There is a way that constructing solar systems can grab on and hold on to the higher 30 credit from 2019 even if they don t finish construction before 2020 It is called safe haven Basically if construction is started and there is a continuous effort made to complete construction and as long as that construction is finished within 4 years the business will receive the 30 tax credit In this quarters earnings report when referring to the 44 decrease in YoY revenue Array s CEO said Results were lower to last year because of the unseasonably high high volume of shipments we had in the first Q 2020 to consumers that were safe harboring tracker systems in connection with the ITC step down So it seems clear that Array was flooded with orders late 2019 to take advantage of the safe harbor and those revenues showed up on Q1 2020 financials So even though the YoY revenue from last earnings was bad I believe that the order flow Array is getting was inflated in Q1 2020 and is now deflated because of all the businesses that would be buying trackers now but bought them earlier because they wanted the better tax credits I can see this cycle of inflated and deflated order flow revenue relative to the decreases in ITC tax credits continue until 2024 when the credit stabilizes at 10 I believe bad YoY data is just a distraction from great long term growth and creates a great buying opportunity 3 Supply chain FUD and one time stock based compensation hurt profits Rapid increase in the price of raw materials goods and even cost of transporting those goods going up Supply chain FUD has stacked on top of inflation FUD sense late February until last earnings and has caused a substantial sell off in Array stock This Supply chain FUD was realized in last quarters earnings Q1 2021 when profitably margins sank because cost of goods shot through the roof This industry solar tracking is contending with increase in steel and shipping costs that are unprecedented in both magnitude and the rate of change Jim Fusaro Array CEO in Q1 2021 report YoY the cost of steel has more than doubled Steel represents the almost half of Array s cost of goods sold so it s extreme increase in price has an large impact on the bottom line Shipping costs have also shot up significantly and have the same effect on the bottom line Even though revenue in Q1 2020 was 438M and revenue Q1 2021 was 246M operating costs were higher in this Q large due to one time expense that come with becoming a public company This includes increase in equity based compensation and costs related to common stock This is simply a short term expense that negatively impacted this Q earnings and will have no further impact on profits margins Array is taking action to secure long term contracts with freight providers and fixing commodity prices with suppliers This action from array combined with the fact that ridiculous prices of shipping and materials will drop in the next year or two as supply meets demand thanks to capitalism This Supply chain FUD and bad profitability margin data from last quarter I believe will also have no impact on future growth long term and only creates a good buying opportunity Position ARRY 20c 6 18
