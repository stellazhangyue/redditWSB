Inc OSTK has two separate business sectors that are of interest to investors Firstly and foremost it is an online retailer of home decor items and furniture such as rugs couches beds blankets curtains and etc as well as a jewelry dealer It operates in a similar fashion to Amazon with suppliers able to sell their home decor products and jewelry directly on the Overstock site while taking advantage of the Overstock shipping network Advertising services are also optionally provided by Overstock to its partners within the site To the extent that it operates in this industry it is a consumer discretionary stock in the internet retail and direct marketing business Its most similar competitor seems to be Wayfair W another online furniture retailer Overview Subsidiaries tZero However Overstock also has a private subsidiary Medici Ventures which is in quite a different business Medici focuses on the application of blockchain technologies NOT the supposed currencies derived therefrom but the technology itself and other software to the world of finance and the subsidiary in turn owns several different companies 19 by my count each of which deals with a different financial application of blockchain Chief among these is tZero which aims to create an online exchange of tokenized securities i e stocks options futures bonds etc represented in the form of blockchain tokens that are legally classified as securities to facilitate instant settlement of trades rather than the present system of t 2 days hence tZero This instant settlement is appealing to regulators who would like to resolve inefficiencies and clerical errors of the t 2 system but also allows for e g continuous access to markets 24 7 the ability to sell private equity as tokens to the public etc Overview Other Subsidiaries One could do a DD into each subsidiary independently if they so chose I will list the remaining companies and provide a short description of the focus of each It should be noted that most of these to my understanding are insignificant in terms of performance and resources and some are something closer to ideas than actual businesses Furthermore Medici may own a varying percent of each that I do not care to dig into due to the aforementioned fact tZero and perhaps Bitt are really the most important subsidiaries and are largely owned by Overstock Bitt Central bank digital currencies CBDCs Medici Land Governance Data storage systems relating to land governance land titles etc GrainChain Various farming software including smart contracts but also non blockchain software applications such as farm logistics applications Voatz Voting system with verifiable publicly accessible paper trail PeerNova Management data services idk FinClusive Digital banking system focused on regions underserved by banking Netki Business compliance software ID validation software biometric data storage Minds Monetized anti censorship social media outlet Vincent Wine futures and wine sales direct from wineries Symbiont Idk seems like tZero but for institutions I might not be smart enough or it may be bullshit Factom Data storage Votem Seems to be the same as Voatz but perhaps different marketing Vital Chain Data storage focused on birth and death records Chainstone Labs Seems kind of like Symbiont if it were made on a shitty Wordpress site and did not have a marketing team Profitability amp Solvency Overstock including subsidiaries and minority interest had been operating at a net loss since 2017 up until a year ago at an average of 122 7 m per quarter previously having net income of around 10m per quarter going back several years though I don t care to trace this all the way back to its inception in 1999 As of recently in Q3 2020 net income was 16 4m rising to 56m and 88 4m in the respective following quarters This is possibly as a result of pandemic induced online retail purchases and the development of the company therefrom EPS has risen consistently since Q3 2018 from then 8 98 to now 1 96 Gross profit is up 124 YoY Despite its years of losses the current solvency of the company is alright As of this quarter Debt equity 13 4 Debt Capital 11 8 Liabilities Assets 49 8 Altman Score Non Manufacturing 6 34 Financial Comparison to Wayfair Wayfair W is the most similar entity that I can identify to Overstock selling furniture and home decor items online since 2002 though it does not have any exposure to blockchain or tech in general It is similarly well known and indeed more popular and much larger than Overstock as a place to buy home furnishing goods Here I will compare various financials of Overstock to Wayfair in the format OSTK W I will also provide a judgement of better worse for each from the point of view of Overstock for the low IQ apes Net Income 88 4m 489 1m worse Net Profit Margin 3 08 3 20 worse Shares Outstanding 41 9m 98m better I guess Basic EPS 1 96 4 99 worse Quick Ratio 1 5 1 3 better Price as of today 97 54 308 40 N A Price YTD 103 3 36 7 better P E 45 8 66 7 better EV Sales 1 3 2 2 possibly better Total Assets 893 7m 4 8b N A Total Liabilities 444 8m 6 2b N A Total Liabilities Assets 49 130 much better Net Debt EBITDA 4 2 1 3 much better already more than enough to pay off net debt It is also important to note the overall trend in income of each company Both W and OSTK underwent the same period of continued losses during approximately the same time period However W started taking losses about a year earlier on than OSTK and in larger amounts in proportion to the fact that it is a larger company with more expenses Both companies have experienced a high level of growth in gross profit YoY with OSTK at 124 and W at 101 Overall it appears that Wayfair is a much larger company and perhaps for now a better value strictly in EPS terms but otherwise Overstock is in a much better position in terms of solvency and its ability to finance itself going forward has made greater increases in revenue better P E etc that suggest it has great potential relative to Wayfair in the future Performance of Medici amp tZero The performance advancements of the blockchain companies as a whole are not to be considered at length since there are so many of them and most of them do not seem to be making much progress or if they are it is not much publicized and thus outside of the scope of my DD writing effort threshold However there is something to be said for Medici as a whole and tZero in particular As it relatives to Medici Overstock has recently converted Medici into a limited partnership with a venture capital firm Pelion Venture Partners who will act as general partner in the arrangement while Overstock provided the vast majority of the financing Aside from increasing funding to the Medici partnership the idea is that this will allow Overstock to focus more on retail while Medici is managed by Pelion which has more experience in investing in and managing the technology sector And as for tZero tZero as of very recently had been something closer to a concept It had a website where you could trade like 3 tokenized securities but of course next to nobody used it However it has since then taken some tangible steps to advancing itself perhaps as a result of the advantages of the aforementioned partnership It is launching a new app on which such trades can be made More importantly it has partnered with Wazuzu Inc which creates the sort of tokenized securities tZero has aspired to create Wazuzu has agreed to make tZero the exclusive exchange of its securities from now on thus we should see the amount of tradable securities on tZero increase soon Conclusion Overstock is a solid retail business that has grown much in both revenues and valuation as of recently yet is still undervalued relative to its competitor Along with the retail business one gets the chance of either substantial growth or continued useless exposure to the attendant blockchain enterprises Most of these will probably come to nothing or at least are worth nothing at present but some of them and tZero in particular show some promise The investors of Overstock are not fickle and it has a sort of cult following among certain people who see great potential in it

144,oanljk,t2_rs8bsg6,1625020386,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oanljk/overstock_ostk_promising_online_retail_business/,1,Overstock OSTK Promising Online Retail Business, Overview Retail Business Overstock com Inc OSTK has two separate business sectors that are of interest to investors Firstly and foremost it is an online retailer of home decor items and furniture such as rugs couches beds blankets curtains and etc as well as a jewelry dealer It operates in a similar fashion to Amazon with suppliers able to sell their home decor products and jewelry directly on the Overstock site while taking advantage of the Overstock shipping network Advertising services are also optionally provided by Overstock to its partners within the site To the extent that it operates in this industry it is a consumer discretionary stock in the internet retail and direct marketing business Its most similar competitor seems to be Wayfair W another online furniture retailer Overview Subsidiaries tZero However Overstock also has a private subsidiary Medici Ventures which is in quite a different business Medici focuses on the application of blockchain technologies NOT the supposed currencies derived therefrom but the technology itself to the world of finance and the subsidiary in turn owns several different companies 19 by my count each of which deals with a different financial application of blockchain Chief among these is tZero which aims to create an online exchange of tokenized securities i e stocks options futures bonds etc represented in the form of tokens that are legally classified as securities to facilitate instant settlement of trades rather than the present system of t 2 days hence tZero This instant settlement is appealing to regulators who would like to resolve inefficiencies and clerical errors of the t 2 system but also allows for e g continuous access to markets 24 7 the ability to sell private equity as tokens to the public etc Overview Other Subsidiaries One could do a DD into each subsidiary independently if they so chose I will list the remaining companies and provide a short description of the focus of each It should be noted that most of these to my understanding are insignificant in terms of performance and resources and some are something closer to ideas than actual businesses Furthermore Medici may own a varying percent of each that I do not care to dig into due to the aforementioned fact tZero and perhaps Bitt are really the most important subsidiaries and are largely owned by Overstock Bitt Central bank digital currencies CBDCs Medici Land Governance Data storage systems relating to land governance land titles etc GrainChain Various farming software including blockchain smart contracts but also software applications such as farm logistics applications Voatz Voting system with verifiable publicly accessible paper trail PeerNova Management data services idk FinClusive Digital based banking system focused on regions underserved by banking Netki Business compliance software ID validation software biometric data storage Minds Monetized anti censorship social media outlet Vincent Wine futures and wine sales direct from wineries Symbiont Idk seems like tZero but for institutions I might not be smart enough or it may be nonsense Factom Data storage Votem Seems to be the same as Voatz but perhaps different marketing Vital Chain Blockchain data storage focused on birth and death records Chainstone Labs Seems kind of like Symbiont if it were made on a bad Wordpress site and did not have a marketing team Profitability amp Solvency Overstock including subsidiaries and minority interest had been operating at a net loss since 2017 up until a year ago at an average of 122 7 m per quarter previously having net income of around 10m per quarter going back several years though I don t care to trace this all the way back to its inception in 1999 As of recently in Q3 2020 net income was 16 4m rising to 56m and 88 4m in the respective following quarters This is possibly as a result of pandemic induced online retail purchases and the development of the company therefrom EPS has risen consistently since Q3 2018 from then 8 98 to now 1 96 Gross profit is up 124 YoY Despite its years of losses the current solvency of the company is alright As of this quarter Debt equity 13 4 Debt Capital 11 8 Liabilities Assets 49 8 Altman Score Non Manufacturing 6 34 Financial Comparison to Wayfair Wayfair W is the most similar entity that I can identify to Overstock selling furniture and home decor items online since 2002 though it does not have any exposure to tech in general It is similarly well known and indeed more popular and much larger than Overstock as a place to buy home furnishing goods Here I will compare various financials of Overstock to Wayfair in the format OSTK W I will also provide a judgement of better worse for each from the point of view of Overstock for the low IQ apes Net Income 88 4m 489 1m worse Net Profit Margin 3 08 3 20 worse Shares Outstanding 41 9m 98m better I guess Basic EPS 1 96 4 99 worse Quick Ratio 1 5 1 3 better Price as of today 97 54 308 40 N A Price YTD 103 3 36 7 better P E 45 8 66 7 better EV Sales 1 3 2 2 possibly better Total Assets 893 7m 4 8b N A Total Liabilities 444 8m 6 2b N A Total Liabilities Assets 49 130 much better Net Debt EBITDA 4 2 1 3 much better already more than enough to pay off net debt It is also important to note the overall trend in income of each company Both W and OSTK underwent the same period of continued losses during approximately the same time period However W started taking losses about a year earlier on than OSTK and in larger amounts in proportion to the fact that it is a larger company with more expenses Both companies have experienced a high level of growth in gross profit YoY with OSTK at 124 and W at 101 Overall it appears that Wayfair is a much larger company and perhaps for now a better value strictly in EPS terms but otherwise Overstock is in a much better position in terms of solvency and its ability to finance itself going forward has made greater increases in revenue better P E etc that suggest it has great potential relative to Wayfair in the future Performance of Medici amp tZero The performance advancements of these companies as a whole are not to be considered at length since there are so many of them and most of them do not seem to be making much progress or if they are it is not much publicized and thus outside of the scope of my DD writing effort threshold However there is something to be said for Medici as a whole and tZero in particular As it relatives to Medici Overstock has recently converted Medici into a limited partnership with a venture capital firm Pelion

Wazuzu Inc which creates the sort of tokenized securities tZero has aspired to create Wazuzu has agreed to make tZero the exclusive exchange of its securities from now on thus we should see the amount of tradable securities on tZero increase soon Conclusion Overstock is a solid retail business that has grown much in both revenues and valuation as of recently yet is still undervalued relative to its competitor Along with the retail business one gets the chance of either substantial growth or continued useless exposure to the attendant enterprises Most of these will probably come to nothing or at least are worth nothing at present but some of them and tZero in particular show some promise The investors of Overstock are not fickle and it has a sort of cult following among certain people who see great potential in it

term PT of 13 97 and a high squeeze potential Even if the squeeze doesn t come through it s a goos investment opportunity amp x200B We should be trading at 13 97 right now IMO This is my first DCF model many assumptions calculations may be wrong And commas and dots should be the other way around but I use this format usually so yeah sorry US xd What I tried to do was justify most predictions with analyst s expectations our own expectations compare it to ILMN s past growth when they had similar revenue levels so that we can get a more accurate PT Wanted to do a slightly different one from the one that Ragnaros did a while ago with different projections for the Revenue Cost of revenue OPEX Tax expense WACC and Terminal Growth Rate I did not assume or take into account any cases for more dillution since we have plenty of cash available and we have recently paid of all our debt The end result does not differ that much from the one Ragnaros did what is important though is for how long we assume bionano will be able to maintain this assumptions in growth for all the above For instance if this model ends at 2030 the intrinsic value for the company right now would be 13 97 On the other hand if we finish the Cash Flow model in 2029 the present value would be 7 53 interestingly that s 0 01 off of friday s close I believe BNGO can maintain this growth rate until 2029 AT LEAST Looking at the very conservative estimates our management has on our market around a 1 93B revenue for 2029 is more than achievable Our market opportunity is definitely higher than the low single digit billion dollars as Erik our CEO said in Q4 2020 ER correct me if wrong This is much higher than the expected by the management on this image amp x200B https preview redd it 6t2yj93see871 jpg

which would give us a 7 45 PT Do not be discouraged if this price target leaves you bag holding haha as I said this is just our guaranteed floor IMO and taking into account our CEO s comments

and COGS to see what a reasonable CAGR would be for each parameter CAGR for the revenue when ILMN had a similar revenue to what we have now is 70 CAGR for OPEX which I calculated from the sec fillings for each quarter deducting Cost of Revenue from the other costs is 40 NOTE I deducted 300M costs which were used for R amp D and did not fall into de usual cost curve When it comes to the COGS it was hard for me to establish a more accurate relation between Sales and COGS I tried looking for a relation between increase in sales and the subsequent increase in COGS so that I could maybe see a reduction in costs per sale produced from economies of scale don t know whether that even makes sense or not lol However I could not find any relation and I decided it would be enough with just calculating the COGS and using a CAGR I ended up getting a 58 39 which is lower than the one Ragnaros got but quite similar which gave me confidence this could be somewhat accurate amp x200B https

CAGR my 79 61 CAGR average for each case scenario with probabilities factored in does not seem too high specially taking into account our 179 Q Q growth in revenue for Q1 2021 and our EOY 16M expectations COGS The averag CAGR for COGS is 52 27 which I think is very realistic looking at ILMN s CAGR of 58 39 and the 45 CAGR from the Chartmill s model that Ragnaros also added on his post amp

tax rate for BNGO usually marginal tax rate is higher but to be conservative I used a 21 rate very conservative IMO WACC Got a bit higher one than Ragnaros with my calculations I believe the WACC I got is accurate but it does not differ that much from Ragnaros WACC Terminal Growth Rate 2 5 I believe is a decent prediction The enterprise value share gives us a PT of 13 97 or a 84 74 upside

predicted a crash and how many times he turned out to be right Here are the results , Preamble Michael Burry is definitely a controversial figure He rose to fame betting against the subprime mortgage market and making a 489 return for his investors between Nov 00 and Jun 08 SP500 returned just 3 in the same period But I recently observed that in every news article tweet he always talks about an impending crash As recently as last week he issued another warning stating that there would a mother of all crashes soon due to the meme stock and currency rally that will approach the size of countries Basically what I wanted to analyze was Whether Michael Burry always predicts a crash and gets lucky when there is an actual crash or does his prediction actually turns out to be true most of the time Analysis The various news articles spanning over the last 15 years were obtained from Google News 1 I flagged the date of each crash prediction and then analyzed the performance of the market stock over the a Next 1 Month b Next 1 Quarter c Till Date I will not be including the subprime mortgage crash prediction in this analysis as we all know how that turned out and how that made him famous Also there are no news reports covering Burry before that The performance figures are calculated based on the prediction If Burry specifies a stock then I am using that particular stock as the benchmark If its broader prediction relating to the overall market then the benchmark used is S amp P 500 Results https preview redd it y2bct7sphe871 png width 1028 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0dd6d0b6163ad7ed0bfc917af373ce9f65bce71d There was a long gap of 9 years after the 2008 crash where Burry stayed out of the public view and did not make any warnings or predictions about the market His first verifiable prediction after the 2008 crisis came in May 2017 https www lombardiletter com michael burry stock market crash 10895 where he warned that we can expect a global financial meltdown and World War 3 In his exact words gt I didn t go out looking for this I just did the math Every bit of my logic is telling me the global financial system is going to collapse But it s been 4 years since the prediction and the market is chugging along just fine S amp P500 has returned a respectable 93 to date and there is no imminent threat https thebulletin org doomsday clock timeline of a World War happening Burry s next prediction was in Sep 2019 https www bnnbloomberg ca the big short s michael burry explains why index funds are like subprime cdos 1 1310874 where he said that index funds are the next market bubble and are comparable to subprime CDOs He said that index fund inflows are now distorting prices for stocks and bonds in the same way that CDO purchases did for subprime mortgages more than a decade ago He said the flows will reverse at some point and it will be ugly when they do This prediction also did not pan out as S amp P500 has returned 50 to date over the last two years and the only crash that occurred during this period was the Covid 19 flash crash from which the market made a sudden recovery Burry s next target was on Tesla where he said that Tesla s

investor michael burry warns the stock market is dancing on a knifes edge and fears hes being ignored again articleshow 81154288 cms again on Feb 21 that the market is dancing on a knife s edge and he is being ignored again He felt the boom in day traders due to the meme stock mania and the increasing cash flow to the index trackers would cause a massive bubble This prediction also hasn t turned out to be right as the market has returned 11 to date over the last 4 months Burry s only prediction that we can say confidently was right after the 2008 mortgage crisis is that he called coin a speculative bubble https moguldom com 340499 michael burry who predicted 2008 mortgage crash says bitcoin is a speculative bubble sends prices lower in March 21 coin has since dropped 28 in around 3 months Even in this case we don t have enough data to showcase how this prediction would turn out over the next one two years Burry was most active in 2021 making the most number of predictions with the latest in Jun 21 stating that we are currently in the greatest speculative bubble of all time https moguldom com 358632 investor michael burry who predicted 2008 subprime mortgage crisis says this is greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things Only time will tell how this one will turn out Conclusion I have immense respect for Michael Burry and his skills He was a doctor and worked as a Stanford Hospital neurology resident and then left to start his own hedge fund that became extremely successful https en wikipedia org wiki Michael Burry But as you can see from the above analysis he is more often wrong than right with his predictions 2 But the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately 3 Out of the 100 predictions you make even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high The key point here is that if you believe in Michael Burry you will have to follow all of his recommendations 4 and not pick and choose what you feel comfortable with as most of the returns would be from an extremely unlikely scenario Footnotes 1 Google News has a nifty feature https researchbuzz me 2019 07 22 if youre

periods Also Google News seems to capture almost all the major publications other than the historical archives 2 The current analysis is done using all the publicly available records We are not considering the personal bets he made conversations he had with his friends family investors etc This can definitely alter the 3 Take the classic example of Keith Gill aka DFV He at one point had a 50MM return using a 50K call option Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of 45MM This phenomenon is known as black swan farming http www paulgraham com swan html 4 At that point if you are that confident in his predictions you can invest in his hedge fund https smartasset com financial advisor

starting a weekly series where I am looking at the top shorted biotech stocks in the world to try and find value I have worked in the clinic academia and for biotech startups before switching to investing full time My investment style and opinion is based on equal parts experience research and stalking C suite Coming in at the 15th most shorted stock in the world is Clovis Oncology CLVS with 30 24 stock shorted https www highshortinterest com as of the time of this writing Clovis Oncology is a classic example of what could have been if there was better leadership One of their main competitors with a similar drug Tesaro was bought by GSK for 5 1 Billion dollars As of this writing Clovis Oncology is worth about 620MM This is a company that was one of the first entrants to PARP inhibition poly adp ribose polymerase This company is cash flow negative has a low number of job postings and seems like it is contracting but not fast enough to have any meaningful difference They are trying to find value overseas which is a desperation play Quick Ape Translation Cancer is not one disease it is many diseases and there is usually a driver of disease All cancer is basically cells that won t die and won t stop growing If a cancer has only 1 or 2 pathways that drive it then we can cure this cancer by blocking those pathways like CML went from 95 dead to 5 dead after 5 years https ashpublications org blood article 124 4 511 33326 Prognosis for patients with CML and gt 10 BCR ABL1 once we discovered how to block BCR ABL pathway Pretty cool stuff So PARP inhibitors work by blocking PARP PARP is a DNA Handyman You are destroying your DNA like the dumb ape you are all the time Being in the sun genetics BRCA chemicals intentional like chemotherapy and unintentional like environmental exposure all cause damage to DNA Damage to DNA can result in cancer or cell death If your body had to replace the entire cell this happened then it would be a waste of resources so it is more efficient just to repair the DNA single strand or double strand breaks AKA use PARP If DNA is not repaired then the cell dies So PARP Inhibitors cause cell death indirectly to both cancer cells and normal healthy cells If your cancer is more likely to have DNA breaks especially double strand breaks then PARP inhibitors are more efficacious These are typically inherited germline cancers like BRCA1 BRCA2 ATM CHEK2 etc These can be found with simple tests but usually these tests are not done unless you have family history https www medicinenet com angelina jolie mastectomy views htm or have progressed through several lines of therapy where there is a higher likelihood of finding it These tests are not done frontline first diagnosed with cancer unless part of a trial or the above reasons so there is a limited patient population that is eligible for this type of therapy PARP inhibitors while taken orally act more like chemotherapy with their side effect profiles and patients don t typically tolerate them well C suite Honestly I hate their leadership because there is zero accountability to their shareholders and they re complacent For example the Founder President CEO Member of the Board of Directors is Patrick J Mahaffy https clovisoncology com about leadership management team patrick j mahaffy You see that big smile He s smiling because he lucked into another drug before a great product called Vidaza that he sold to Celgene for Billions https www reuters com article us pharmion celgene celgene to buy pharmion for 2 9 billion idUSWEN265020071119 This is his second company He doesn t need the money he s set He s not hungry but after he crashed this stock CLVS from 93 not once but twice he s still milking the company for 6 2MM to 8 7MM https www salary com tools executive compensation calculator patrick j mahaffy salary bonus stock options for clovis oncology inc year 2017 compensation per year Oh and did I mention how even though they are issuing Senior Convertible Notes https clovisoncology com about leadership management team patrick j mahaffy read get paid out before shareholders if this crashes and burns he s still collecting such a ridiculous compensation Compare that to true leaders who opt to not take compensation to make sure their company grows like Robert Duggan for 7 years of PCYC https web archive org web 20150724032141 http americasmarkets usatoday com 2015 03 24 the 3 55 billion man If the board really cared about the shareholders he would have been gone years ago when there was still hope for the company TL DR This company has an uphill battle to become cash flow positive and has to face much larger Pharma Companies with greater resources AstraZeneca https www lynparza com Pfizer https www pfizerpro com product talzenna hcp GSK https zejula com Janssen https www jnj com janssen announces u s fda breakthrough therapy designation granted for niraparib for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer without a superior product This company wasn t cash flow positive before https www nasdaq com market activity stocks clvs financials the space became crowded and has since become very very crowded with better competition Is a buyout possible Yes but by who and for how much Leadership doesn t know what they re doing the board is asleep at the wheel and not holding C suite accountable PARP inhibitors rupacarib their only approved product are inherently non selective so they are toxic and therefore patients won t be on them for long and Medical Oncologists are more likely to select other agents before PARPi Prognosis I really don t like the stock Disclosures I have no disclosures for this company don t own it not shorting just my thoughts after researching

potential the company holds and why it s currently an undervalued growth stock For more analyses feel free to give me a follow here https utradea com portfolio and be notified whenever I post Company Overview of Kintara Therapeutics Kintara Therapeutics NASDAQ KTRA is a clinical stage drug development company focused on the treatment of cancer Their mission is to benefit patients by developing and commercializing anti cancer therapies for patients whose solid tumors exhibit features that make them resistant or unlikely to respond to currently available therapies VAL 083 first in class small molecule DNA targeting chemotherapeutic that has been found to have anti0cancer activities against various cancers including brain tumors and ovarian cancers DNA targeting agents work by binding with a cancer cell s DNA and interferes with the process of protein production required for the growth and survival of cancer cells This treatment has been evaluated for more than 40 Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies by the U S National Cancer Institute In the initial development of this treatment KTRA will be focusing on patients whose tumors exhibit biological features that make them resistant to currently available therapies Kintara s corporate development strategy is to advance VAL 083 on an indication by indication basis and then to consider out licensing when it has matured enough to warrant proper licensing valuations These interim data updates at the AACR Annual Meeting continue to demonstrate VAL 083 s potential as a game changing treatment option for GBM patients Saiid Zarrabian Kintara s CEO on VAL 083 Phase 2 https preview redd it 6i0wvlsp0g871 png width 1263 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f211b49fff48ed5a2751dc8b180befbc13a3d3d4 REM 001 a photodynamic therapy PDT for the treatment of rare unmet medical needs particularly tumors that can be reached by its light delivery fibre device that this therapy uses This therapy is comprised of three parts the laser light source the light delivery device and the drug REM 001 By utilizing light sensitive compounds or photosensitizers that when exposed to specific wavelengths of light act as catalysts to produce a form of oxygen that induces local tumor cell death KTRA believes that REM 001 therapy is effective in the treatment of CMBC patients and has several advantages over other forms of treatment for this disease CMBC is cutaneous metastatic breast cancer a disease that affects individuals with advanced breast cancer https preview redd it rnd55k5r0g871 png width 867 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0c6e9e7e6e6d1ff1ef51d9d861497de1fe7bf85f Kintara s Recent Financials Revenue Kintara has not generated any revenues to date and don t expect to until the approval and marketing of the drug This is prevalent across many clinical stage companies that have not commercialized their product so I am not too concerned with this R amp D Expenses Kintara had a slight decrease in expenses to 3 63M for the year ended June 30 2020 from 3 66M for the same period in 2019 The decrease was attributed to the lower preclinical research personnel and intellectual property expenses and partially offset by higher clinical development costs Looking at the TTM the company s R amp D expenses were at 9 08M a drastic change from the previous year s value I think the increase can be interpreted as good since it signifies the clinical development and drug manufacturing of their therapies treatments We can expect R amp D expenses to increase as they move through their trials and they costs are incurred relating to their development of REM 001 and VAL 083 Liquidity Position From their recent 10 Q they reported 15 7M in its cash position for the nine months ending March 31 which has increased by drastically from their cash position at the beginning of the nine month period Increased cash came from a private placement in three closings for aggregate net proceeds of approx 21 6M in later 2020 Kintara reported current assets and liabilities of 16 6M and 2 5M respectively which puts them at a high current ratio and thus should be able to cover their short term obligations Debt For 3Q2021 2Q2021 1Q2021 and 4Q2020 Kintara had debt ratios of 0 145 0 142 0 11 and 0 910 respectively The expanding ratio can often mean that Kintara is making room to support future growth opportunities I m not too worried with these ratios since they re generally low and the company has a larger margin of total assets Target Markets for Kintara s Treatments VAL 083 1 Glioblastoma multiforme GBM is a fast growing and aggressive brain tumor and according to the Central brain Tumor Registry of the U S GBM occurs with an incidence of 3 20 per 100 000 persons Current treatment for patients with GMB include invasive brain surgery followed by radiation and oral chemotherapy Based on information GlobalData reported in 2018 there is a projected market opportunity for GMB of approx 800M and estimated to reach 1 8B by 2027 2 Ovarian cancer is the 5th most common cancer in women and is the leading cause of death among women diagnosed with gynecological malignancies Although they are still in pre clinical there are future plans for a phase 1 2 and multicentre study of VAL 083 in patients with Recurrent Platinum Resistant Ovarian Cancer ovarian cancer resistant to platinum based chemo Ovarian cancer projects global sales of approx 4 2B in 2024 REM 001 1 Cutaneous metastatic breast cancer CMBC presents an estimated market opportunity of approx 500M for the treatment according to 2018 assessment from Charles River Associates Given that there are no prospective clinical studies that have led to FDA approval for CMBC treatment and no anticipations of competitors in this niche market Kintara can really capture this market and capitalize on the limited treatment options available which is chemotherapy or radiotherapy 2 Basal cell carcinoma nervous system BCCNS is a rare and serious condition characterized by the formation of multiple and recurring cutaneous basal cell carcinoma lesions Cancer net reported in 2020 that approx 1 in 40 000 individuals in the U S have an underlying genetic condition that causes BCCNS Short Term and Long Term Catalysts to Look out for Previous Trading History Following the conclusion of their safety study of VAL 083 in patients with recurrent malignant glioma back in 2015 Kintara previously known as DelMar Pharmaceuticals gave insight into the results at the 2016 annual meeting of the society of clinical oncology ASCO Their overall data presented was positive which saw their stock open nearly 10 higher the following day A further look shows that the stock reached a high of 107 in a 2 week span representing a 66 increase since before the company presented their findings A key thing to note here is that the stock s volume was significantly lower than the volume it s trading at nowadays which can help with driving momentum upon positive news https preview redd it svqnvios0g871 png width 1107 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 1782e77f617d2464da36ec4f06195f4d5ec29828 These findings are meant to highlight what good news can do to a stock like KTRA 1 Safety Study of VAL 083 The purpose of this phase 2 study is to determine the safety and the maximally tolerated dose of VAL 083 in combination with a standard of care radiation regimen when used to treat newly diagnosed GBM patients After starting in December 2017 the study should be ending with the est primary completion date being June 2021 so we should be expecting news on this in the next month or so Similar to the study conducted in 2015 I think that when data of this study comes out we ll see the stock price pick up momentum 1 Study of VAL 083 in Patients with MGMT Unmethylated Bevacizumab na ve Glioblastoma The purpose of this phase 2 two arm biomarker driven study is to determine if treatment of O 6 methylguanine DNA methyltransferase MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma with VAL 083 improves overall survival OS compared to historical control in the adjuvant or recurrent setting The start date was in January 2017 and the est completion date is Sept 2021 1 GBM AGILE for VAL 083 Started in July 2019 the est primary completion date is set for December 2023 Phase II Phase III response adaptive trial designed to evaluate several treatment arms and allows for identification or disapproval or therapies more quickly GBM AGILE is a unique approach to clinical trials made possible by the partnership and collaboration of clinicians researchers governments etc Strategic partners for GMB AGILE include the National Brain Tumor Society National Foundation for Cancer Research and Asian Fund for Cancer Research This trial may help to accelerate VAL 083 s time to trial completion and is cost effective due to the expense sharing protocol A Major Risk Factor Investors Should Consider Kintara may never achieve commercialization of their products Given it s a clinical stage company they have not yet begun to market any of their products and have not generated any revenues from their products Their products will continue to require additional testing and investment before any commercialization If any of their product candidates fail then that will negatively impact their financials Even if all goes well it is not for years until commercialization and until we start seeing revenues What do the Analysts Say Based on ratings from 3 analysts they all hold a BUY recommendation and the median target price being 6 50 based on 4 analysts forecasts

Kintara s advancement on their VAL 083 pipeline and the conclusion of one of their clinical phases coming up I think this stock has already begun to gain momentum and will continue to Their news so far on their development shows the company s commitment to their corporate strategy and their strong balance sheet for a clinical stage company strengthens their position This stock can be a great play for both the short and long term and the overall stock sentiment has been positive thus far For those interested in a short term play I would look to build a position now and wait on the news that should be coming out soon This short term play is on the basis that news is positive and seeing what good news has done to this stock before I expect it to be the same Depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals I would set up an exit strategy by taking gains on the way up and setting stop losses Some key things to look for in a technical analysis of the stock is for it to

42 8m 24 8m 20 7m 3 1m 87 1m 225 0m if this is tricky to read on mobile they are forecasting hitting 3 1m in 2022 and then rocketing to 87m in 2023 and 225m in 2024 How good are the team behind it Full disclosure the below are all excerpts taken from MetroMile s website and not my words but they looks impressive CEO Dan Preston Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014 Under his leadership Metromile has experienced significant policy premium and employee growth The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal Prior to joining Metromile Dan was the co founder and CTO of AisleBuyer a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012 He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics remote sensing and computer vision Dan holds a master s degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor s degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science CTO Paw Andersen A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber s Advanced Technology group where he grew his team from 27 to 700 Beyond ride sharing and autonomous vehicles he s been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors including geographic information systems fintech and e commerce ranging from small startups to large established companies And then Founder amp Chairman David Friedberg the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki the NY Post and Linkedin Former Google employee The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years which he successfully lead to a 1B sale to Monsanto in 2013 The Climate Corporation now known as Climate Field View is a digital agriculture company that examines weather soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield limiting factors in their fields From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather to satellite imagery mapping out crop health amp vegetation maps it uses data science to make farming better This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data Expansion Opportunity and Catalysts They are currently operational in just 8 of 50 U S states Washington California Oregon Illinois Arizona Virginia Pennsylvania and New Jersey They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 with 49 states representing 160B in potential premiums seriously if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked jump to slide 30 The IPO transaction has provided an estimated 294 Million in cash to pursue growth opportunities They are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as Homeowners Renters Pet Warranties amp Maintenance through 2021 2022 They are licensing their leading AI claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider more on that below They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers 2 are already signed up and one of them is FORD they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements There are ambitions to go global In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations Source we should be due Q4 2020 final numbers soon NOT just an insurance provider FinTech LICENSING Growth This one is important and needs attention you know that leading sophisticated claims AI platform they ve built They are now LICENSING that through their MetroMile ENTERPRISE arm of the business and its built to work on top of standard claims management software This licensing delivered 5 6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY 12 4m in 2021 gt 21 7m 2022 gt 33 7m in 2023 gt 48 3m in 2024 you cannot just look at MILE as an insurance disruptor they are also a software technology company It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine a Top 10 US Carrier and a US Carrier They say they have 4 deployed 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline What about the competition On a technology level the closest form of competition I can see is Root however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up MetroMile does the opposite it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour it is per mile Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home rental vertical On a business model level Mile Wise from All State is the closest they are also using a pay per mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to MILE from what I can see The world and our habits have changed MILE are poised to grab that by the horns A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused myself included In the UK at the height of the pandemic last year only 22 of cars were on the road Source that s a whopping 78 decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22 on the road were likely driving less than usual YES I understand MILE is a U S company unfortunately I could not find any U S equivalent data but it s still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world A survey shows after the pandemic 25 of drivers plan to drive less Source sorry another UK source I know but I couldn t find similar for the U S this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees OK so as I was typing I found this which shows US mileage dropped by as much as 60 during the height of the pandemic last year Source the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends 22 7 of employed Americans were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management professional occupations that number rockets to over 40 Source When the world emerges from this office hours and behaviour will never be the same working from home and hybrid x days at home and x days in the office will become the norm the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home and that they have in many cases exceeded expectations Before the pandemic was a thing there was STILL a clear need for this in the market this was always going to be an appealing and great model COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to bring MILE to the forefront quicker Ready to expand Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions online grocery shopping at home spin peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre pandemic Some may but most will not People like convenience and ease of use New habits will stay Cons Watch Outs The move to hybrid or work from home models may not be adopted as much as we think post pandemic personally I don t think this will be an issue because 1 I just cannot see a world where businesses don t adapt to this it ultimately saves them money and 2 this business model is not built on a pandemic as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness The insurance goliaths i e Geico develop or market their own pay per mile model I am not based in the U S so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome let s make this a discussion I don t see this happening any time soon at least not to the same complexity that MILE are achieving it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what MILE have but you can t rule Buffet Geico out Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor pay per mile sector Root create a pay per mile model unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out Targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche For whatever reason they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire I will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there The forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up regardless I like what I see Wrap Up TLDR Buffet had Geico I choose MetroMile Chamath Palihapitiya Go and read Chamath s one pager here https twitter com chamath status 1331278297930428417 This is not a swing trade this is not that P amp D shit this is a buy early hold and ride the wave of a growing company built on great tech a great team and a great business model Here s your TLDR read it properly and actually make a decision for yourself because I feel this is a sleeping giant just waiting to explode INAQ s share price jumped from around 9 pre SPAC announcement in December to around 17 today However since completing the merger on Wed 10th Feb 2020 and the ticker renaming to MILE the price has barely moved dipping a dollar or so and maintaining pre merger completion levels I feel like the market are really sleeping on this and they are flying under the radar so I am getting in now before they reach their potential I like the stock I have a lot of confidence in it
