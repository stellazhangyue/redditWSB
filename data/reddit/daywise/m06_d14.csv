million Adjusted Earnings per Share 0 73 0 76 Potential June Short Squeeze The price has been artificially deflated by short sellers and Petco is now the 17th most shorted stock on the market It has more short interest than most meme stocks and it would take shorts more than 7 trading days to cover with average volume The price target for fair value is at least 6 from the current price so even without a squeeze there s some deep value here Remember DFV bought 12 calls and that small expected gain turned into a fortune There seems to be a similar set up here But the story gets really interesting when you look at the options flow There s a HUGE volume of 30 calls expiring 6 18 so someone has made a very large bet that the price will be at least 8 higher a week from now If the price manages to break above 30 before next Friday it will cause more forced buying and potentially trigger a mini squeeze Someone has taken a dim view of pet supply companies because another mini squeeze happened last week with PETS and no one noticed Timing and playing this stock I m playing it by getting calls in between the price and my 28 target long dated So far I have September but I ll keep accumulating longer expiry calls I m expecting a sharp decline in the market on Thursday 10 June 2021 so I ll add more then but I ve already got some calls just in case the wider sell off doesn t impact this stock 19 was the last support zone but it looks like 22 is supporting it now Anything below 22 is an instant buy for me 22 24 is an acceptable entry point Edit I forgot to mention the stock offering on the 28th of May It s also partly why the stock dropped at that time as they set a sell price of 24 which beat down the price below 24 and which lead to more declines last week But it looks like the new stock was absorbed by the market and WOOF has found it s new support at 22 Edit 2 this was at 22 30 when I posted Now 23 27 Edit 3 9 June full disclosure I took off about 75 of my risk with this one ahead of tomorrow s CPI print Too much uncertainty I ve left 25 of my position in case it moons in response Will check out tomorrow s price action and try to find a place to re enter Also more WOOF shares will be released 13 July 2021 so my time horizon with this play just got shortened

DD , tl dr OSCR will go the moon soon just so they can deny the man on the moon s insurance claim A distressed company Is the cure worse than the disease Oscar Health s core business is as old as the American Dream itself deny poor people medical care and then bill them for the privilege Oscar adds a fun twist to this winning formula by using technology to deny insurance requests faster and more frequently than traditional companies which require actual human representatives to decide whether deaf children are allowed to have hearing aids Founded in 2012 by current CEO Mario Schlosser Kevin Nazemi and Josh Kushner brother of sentient wax doll Jared Kushner Oscar Health provides health insurance with a particular technological emphasis Unlike other providers in the space OSCR cuts costs by emphasizing telemedicine automated referrals and remote prescriptions 1 2 OSCR IPO d at 39 in March and almost immediately plummeted to the mid 20 s where it s been fluctuating ever since OSCR s IPO went so poorly that at least one law firm is considering a class action suit for securities fraud on behalf of investors 3 Signs of life Like many early stage companies entering an entrenched industry Oscar initially burned money faster than a secret service agent at a luxury golf course in 2016 the company lost 204 9 million while in 2017 the company lost 83 million However as the company has expanded its subscriber base and adjusted its risk calculations it has begun to turn around in 2018 OSCR posted profits of 1 billion from 400 000 subscribers and in 2021 it is expected to bring in 2 billion 4 Moreover OSCR has relatively little competition in its space Similar startups like Collective Health and WSB s sweaty dakimakura Clover Health have substantially fewer subscribers and have struggled to turn a profit 5 Meanwhile larger players in the insurance industry like Anthem are full of polo shirt thumb typers leading to mishaps when they have tried to integrate new technology into their existing offerings 6 Moreover OSCR has a reputation for poaching top tech talent from companies like Microsoft and Amazon and Google has even invested in the company I am bullish because OSCR has several unique advantages over comparable companies The Bone Saw Gambit In 2021 companies throughout the world are reckoning with the ethical implications of taking on unscrupulous investment partners From severing ties to the Chinese government to removing board members with histories of harassment corporations worldwide are defining a new approach to vetting investors that will likely restructure the nature of the venture capital space for years to come But not Oscar Health These chads and chadtoinettes will take money from anyone who offers them a nickel and half kilo of Paradise White Just last year OSCR closed a 165 million financing round shortly after co founder Josh Kushner and Jared Kushner visited Saudi Arabia and met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman everyone s favorite journalist murdering oligarch 7 Daddy s Money The renowned Chicago school of economics is a neoclassical school of economic thought based on post Keynesian monetary theory Over the decades one guiding axiomatic principle has emerged from this storied institution RICH KIDS CAN T FAIL Due to co founder Josh Kushner s involvement OSCR has its own insurance policy I the form of being intimately intertwined with the Kushner family Patriarch Charles Kushner alone has an estimated net worth of 2 billion giving him plenty of runway to bail out his son as needed Earnings underwater because we blew all our VC money on coke and legal settlements Emergency cash injection from Papa Our machine learning algorithm stopped running because our Office 365 free trial expired Bailout from El Padre Service outages due to buildup of a strange powder in our server s ventilation ports Thanks for your credit card info Mr K Daddy Kush will stake anything and everything to make sure that little Josh s lemonade stand makes it Ten years from now when OSCR hits 1600 we can all watch Josh s TedX Talk on becoming a self made billionaire 1 https www investopedia com articles markets 100215

MOOOOON Ok now that we have gotten the basics out of the way time to take a look at Corsair and why I am mega bullish on this stock Gaming Market The gaming market is a strong growing market that has been expanding for the past two decades and is expected to keep growing Consumer spending in 2020 on PC gaming hardware and accessories reach 4 5 billion USD while accessories grew 81 YoY and hardware grew 57 https www gamesindustry biz articles 2021 02 16 pc hardware and accessories spending grew 62 percent in the us in 2020 Corsair manufactures hardware solutions such as fans RAM cooling units PC cases and many more that have profited from the recent increase in PC hardware sales Due to lockdowns many have been wanting to buy a PC which has shot up sales However this trend is not temporary as I will show Steam users https www statista com statistics 308330 number stream users a k a any gamer who has a PC and play video games have seen a very sharp growth in the past year due to the lockdown The trend fluctuates with the lockdowns easings around the world and is always and bottom in summer months From August 2019 to August 2020 there has been a 33 increase in steam users August of 2020 was a time when Europe had record low covid infections compared to winter months and beginning of pandemic as well as America Yet people were still playing video games at record rates This is a clear sign that this market has grown and the player base is hooked and not going anywhere Since then it had another 20 increase Bullish af The biggest nonsense I have ever heard is that now that lockdown is over gamers are going to stop gaming Have they ever even met a gamer Personally I was a hardcore gamer before lockdown and I will definitely continue to be one The lockdown accelerated the uptake of gaming and if anything people will be more committed to gaming Easing of lockdown would allow for social events e g LAN parties and gaming conventions to take place that will further encourage spending on gaming products Investors who believe that gaming is going to fade out or that the hype is over are completely in the wrong here Covid has only accelerated the trend and there might be a minor pullback in numbers as usually happens in the summer months but the YoY numbers indicate that there has been a strong increase in gaming and this trend is likely to continue You can buy the stock now at a lucrative price and when the investors realize that gaming is here to stay they will have to buy the stock at a much higher price down the line Streaming Market An excellent acquisition by Corsair has been buying Elgato and entering the streaming business The streaming market was 50 billion USD in 2020 and is expected to reach 59 billion USD in 2021 It is expected to continue growing to 2028 at an annual CAGR rate of 21 https www grandviewresearch com industry analysis video streaming market text The 20global 20video 20streaming 20market 20size 20was 20estimated 20at 20USD USD 2059 14 20billion 20in 202021 amp text The 20global 20video 20streaming 20market 20is 20expected 20to 20grow 20at USD 20223 98 20billion 20by 202028 This is a huge market with a wonderful growth rate not easy finding a market with such a growth rate and corsair is perfectly positioned to take advantage of it From buying the hardware to run your PC also with products such as the capture card to the elgato streaming deck that allows for easy streaming controls Corsair is in the perfect position to take advantage of this growing market and be at the forefront of the hardware space Financial performance Absolutely solid financial performance over the past year with stellar growth and very prospective in the future YoY revenue and profit margins have been growing at double digit rates Revenue grew 55 and 65 from 1 163 and 1 300 to 1 702 and 1 923 million USD from Dec 2019 and March 2020 to Dec 2020 and March 2021 Q1 is usually the worst quarter of the year but they managed to get their best ever quarter EBITDA margins and Net Income margins have gone from around 6 5 and 0 to 13 5 and 7 7 from March 2020 to March 2021 respectively This is showing stunning increase in operating margins which are very healthy and promise great further investment and growth EPS this year is expected to be 1 81 However the CFO is usually very conservative and it could be much higher by the end of the year I could go on more detail about earnings growth but in this case margins are more interesting because it shows better efficiency and last year they were barely doing a profit so the earnings growth is skewed With an EPS of 1 81 a fair value PE multiple of 20 would be 36 2 However if you consider this is a growth stock in a growth environment then comparable growth companies trade at 30 40 PE ratio which would indicate a price target of at least 54 3 72 4 Additionally they have been paying down debt from 505 million at end of the year 2019 to 321 million in 2020 Comparing Corsair with its closest competitor Logitech Lets look at Logitech valuation metrics amp x200B Last 12 months Next 12 months PE Ratio 23 4 30 1 EV Sales 3 8 3 8 EV EBITDA 15 9 22 6 amp x200B Corsair Last 12 months Next 12 months PE Ratio 20 4 18 8 EV Sales 1 7 1 5 EV EBITDA 11 5 12 9 amp x200B Now if Corsair was priced as Logitech it would indicate a price increase between 50 100 Additionally much of Logitech s offering has been focussed on working from home products whereas Corsair is more focussed on gaming Logitech too but not to the same extent The working from home trend has peaked and many companies like JP Morgan have announced that they will want all their staff to return back to the office within the next months There will still be people working from home but the trend will be declining from now Ownership There has been negative sentiment around IPOs recently as many of them have flooded the market resulting in extreme short term price movement which has led to investors staying shy of them and believing that they are more speculative Ownership currently sits at 62 with eagle tree capital and around 10 with other institutions Short interest is currently at around 19 of the float Overall great company with excellent financial performance actually makes a great profit and has super good growth ahead and I am mega bullish on them They also have super low valuation metrics which together make a rare combination TL DR Great company great products growing market and growing company Super low undervalued Moon

millionaire maker stock,Sup apes In my first DD last week https old reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nxhh7d crsr dd or why you should park all your cash in I gave a short rundown of why Corsair is incredibly undervalued and how it should be in everyone s portfolio With Part 2 I m addressing a lot of the comments I got as well as going a bit deeper into how Corsair will make this industry their bitch and reach ATH in 2021 Why is Corsair in a strong position to leverage the gaming and streaming industry Corsair didn t snooze but rather spend the last years hunting for good companies to acquire Being well funded profitable and raking in cash every year allowed them to expand in all directions with a core focus on the fastest growing niche Streaming Have a look at their investor relations page Corsair is a leading global provider and innovator of high performance gear for gamers and content creators Our industry leading gaming gear helps digital athletes from casual gamers to committed professionals to perform at their peak across PC or console platforms and our streaming gear enables creators to produce studio quality content to share with friends or to broadcast to millions of fans CORSAIR also includes subsidiary brands Elgato which provides premium studio equipment and accessories for content creators SCUF Gaming which builds custom designed controllers for competitive gamers and ORIGIN PC a builder of custom gaming and workstation desktop PCs and laptops With Elgato they positioned themselves years ago already to capitalize on one of the fastest growing entertainment subsegments Streaming While acquiring SCUF Gaming and ORIGIN PC allowed them to also expand and play in the console market as well as Pre Build PCs and laptops They basically moved up the ladder from RGB fans keyboards RAM sticks and Cases to EVERYTHING you need to play stream or game properly How much faster is Corsair really expanding I cannot stress this enough but their last quarter results really blew it completely out of the water Seeing how they raised guidance I think August will be even more brutal One for value 529 4 million in net revenue an increase of 71 6 year over year 175 9 million net revenue for Gamer and creator peripherals segment an increase of 131 9 year over year Gross profit was 160 3 million an increase of 103 9 year over year with a gross margin of 30 3 an improvement of 480 basis points year over year Operating income was 67 3 million an increase of 404 5 year over year Adjusted operating income was 80 4 million an increase of 221 4 year over year Do yourself a favor and whip up a site like FinViz punch in your favorite meme stock and have a look at their revenue number vs market cap There s a reason why GME got picked up by DFV Sales is still king and undervalued companies with aggressive growth have insane potential short and long term Why hasn t it blown up yet to 100 There is a good amount of chatter about two things One being market manipulation the other is that there is very little retail investor interest compared to the amount of net sellers The second point actually holds up the stock never really got picked up by retail investors or apes and a lot of the commenters that did buy it up mentioned how they were perfectly content with amassing shares every month while the price is still low Pure but selfish value investing Eagle What This one was also pointed out a lot Corsair is owned by a private equity firm called EagleTree They purchased the majority stake back in 2017 which in turn allowed Corsair to expand much more aggressively and now is obligated to reduce their share position over the next years until they only hold 10 of the company They currently hold 61 9 The shares sold are mostly picked up by Vanguard Blackrock and a few other small institutions plus retail of course Looking at insider transactions we can see that EagleTree usually sells shares twice a year with the last transaction happening June 3rd 2021 This point doesn t concern me too much personally as it s normal for private equity firms to reduce their stake after IPOs and Corsair is barely dipping 2 even with EagleTree selling 5 million shares Now having sold their shares just now it will probably be quiet for the next 6 months Back to 2021 and how you can make money They have a strong customer base which they ve built up over the last 20 years and thought f ck it let s go all in on this market Tits and streaming Amazing Controllers for consoles Let s do it RGB Spinners on your lambo Fuuckyea Instead of focusing on boring office peripherals that every Chinese company provides they instead decided to slap RGB on everything and are loved for it Now EagleTree is gonna continue doing what eagles do and we will continue doing what apes do I ll continue buying this company and watching their ER like a hawk while analysts jack themselves off over the sort of numbers Corsair hits out every quarter I said it once and I ll say it again If you don t hold Corsair shares you are pretty retarded But since that s half the sub already just do your wife s boyfriend a favour and pick up some shares while

LOSING ALL MY MONEY ON MEME STOCKS WHAT DO I DO Chill retard Go outside and get some sunlight for once all this stressing in your wife s boyfriend s basement isn t doing you any good Watching a ticker go up and down for 8 hours a day will make even the most sane apes go insane First and foremost stonks don t only go up especially meme stocks There s these things called fundamentals and here s why CLNE is actually a good company The 1 company in U S and Canada when it comes providing the cleanest fuel Renewable Natural Gas RNG Biden all about going green in the future so helps to have the government on its side The average analyst predictions have the stock worth around 20 and plenty of room to grow Partnership with Amazon that includes delivering 1000 RNG powered vehicles to them as well as them buying 53 million shares at a strike price of 13 49 by the end of the decade from CLNE Other deals with major players such as BP Total SE and Chevron Why will RNG be the leading fuel for heavy transportation in the future As stated RNG is the cleanest fuel in the world If going by GWP which stands for Global Warming Potential it has a GWP of 1 1 and that s technically carbon negative Note the higher the GWP the worse it is for the environment The methane that s created from landfills and treatment facilities comes in at a whopping 31 GWP but that s captured and turned into the natural gas all by yours truly For comparison electric has a GWP of 10 and hydrogen has a GWP averaging around 6 Note neither of these other competitions electric and hydrogen have the infrastructure going forward that RNG has Not to mention an electric truck would only be able to drive for around 4 hours before needing to be charged for 3 hours whereas RNG takes about 8 minutes to fully fuel up So if it s so undervalued why is the price staying low Well it s high of 19 79 which is a lot closer to its fair value than right now was back in February but all of EV s and green energy sold off back then and it never quite recovered due to no big news And the recent couple weeks haven t been helping https preview redd it 0w3ny5m0dw271 jpg width 714 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s ba581e2eb0e5b5e640224efe9634ad31d69b4d4f https imgur com a KoQCrnD Notice how the average volume shorted is around 500k and when the stock started going up starting 6 3 then it went into the MILLIONS And it s not just the volume either the actual change or ratio shorted went from around 8 to 30 On Wednesday 6 9 there were 43 MILLION SHARES SHORTED And on Thursday 6 10 19 135 301 shares were shorted out of a total of 58 606 642 shares traded So roughly 1 3 of ALL the trades were just straight up short ladder attacks Note it was 32 6 which is the highest it s ever been this year Then Friday 6 11 the volume went down but another 4 5 million shares were shorted which made up 24 of the volume that day before they even covered the ones from Thursday I DON T KNOW HOW TO READ WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN Big players didn t expect CLNE to gain traction on WSB and made a bet that the price would stay stagnant while they profit off of selling options The shorts have doubled down Or in their case quadrupled down As stated in my earlier DD there s a potential gamma ramp up that will send this stock to the 25 if it sits above 13 on 6 18 because of the open interest on calls The amount of calls that will be IN THE MONEY is in the millions and only keeps going up This means that these big guys will lose BILLIONS of dollars so they have to make sure that doesn t happen by shorting the shit out of the stock Because CLNE has a smaller float it s pretty easy to manipulate as can be seen in the price action last week This means that the MAJORITY of shareholders ARE NOT SELLING and the price action is due to the millions of shares shorted They have 2 days to cover and most start covering AH to not get fucked by calls and also reduce their chances of being pushed out Which of course explains why CLNE starts spiking up as soon as the market closes Every damn time What does Cramer think of all this That s a stupid question who cares what that old hag thinks It s worth noting though that he came out on twitter last week to bash on the stock saying Today s meme stock is Clean Energy Fuels Be careful while i have always liked the company b c i favor nat gas for short and long haul the company s had no real revenue growth and almost no profitability in a decade There will be sellers But then he interviewed 2 days later being very positive about the company and expecting lots of growth Anytime someone like him reverses his opinion so fast makes me BULLISH as hell Also the company is in more of a growth and research phase right now and could easily be profitable if they wanted to but choose to stay in this phase so that they can take over the whole game later So what s the play Pretty easy Buy shares and hold The fact that this stock was at 15 after hours on Thursday shows the buying pressure is there and the people on the other side are scared It would ve been an easy company to profit off of for them but unfortunately CLNE started trending on WSB and now some retarded apes are gonna make them pay TL DR Read the damn DD if you want some wrinkles it s not long Basically the shorts have QUADRUPLED down and want to ride this into this week causing negative sentiment and therefore selling off It s in the data The fact that this company is backed by actual fundamentals and reached 15 AH shows how undervalued it is currently Long term gains regardless of how the next few weeks play out although this week will be very interesting As always I m not a financial advisor and you must be retarded to take advice from me Positions 10x 13C 6 18 10x 14C 7 16 500 shares

now over 20 years old so it isn t a bullshit company based out of someone s garage cough CLOV cough and is one of the leading companies for supplying smart glasses and augmented reality technologies they re also on track to receiving several juicy military contracts from the US government these are like infinite money hacks since everyone knows that US defense contracting is OP as a revenue source as their company s origins are in military display solutions remember when the US government introduced these literal ESP wallhack goggles https www washingtonpost com technology 2021 05 24 army night vision goggles They make stuff like that and are rumored to be receiving more government contracts like this one https finance yahoo com news vuzix enters agreement leading u 145000753 html from a few months ago This is a huge revenue stream that is only going to continue growing over the next several years In addition they also sell computer display devices and software a market that will only continue to grow and provide an additional solid revenue stream as there s always going to be some chimp on WSB that needs a computer monitor to see their overnight millionaire gains But let s talk about what you all only give a shit about since no one actually cares what these companies do amp x200B DD Due Diligence Why This Stock WILL Moon VUZI is soon to be added to the Russell 2000 and 3000 indexes bringing more exposure and attention to this already great company Even Cathie Wood went 13 5m in on the company s stock dip a week back https markets businessinsider com news stocks cathie wood buys 13 5m in smart glasses supplier vuzix on dip 1030479660 Oh and their company s main point of interest the augmented reality market is expected to grow at a CAGR compound annual growth revenue of 43 8 YOY from 2021 to 2028 reaching a market size of 340 16 billion USD in 2028 That is 12 7x the current market size of 26 75 billion USD Boiled down augmented reality market will go to the moon Vuzix s current market cap is 1 2 billion or 4 5 of the total market If the company stays at a similar percentage of the total market cap by 2028 it ll reach a valuation of 15 3 billion That is nearly 15x its current size But it doesn t stop there the percentage of total shares shorted is at 17 08 For reference AMC has 20 of its total shares shorted and it FUCKING MOONED Though unlike other companies with high short interests this one has a solid structure and great future It IS a good company There is not only a short squeeze play here but the company is solid and has a small market cap with tons of room to grow at only 1 2 billion AMC has a market cap of 24 76 billion and if we see a squeeze even HALF the size of AMC s VUZI can stand to 10x its current valuation and reach a share price of 190 up from 19 that s a shit ton of gains to buy a whole lot of Wagyu steaks and tables at Nobu amp x200B But it still doesn t stop there Though bear in mind the next bit of DD is highly speculative I can see military contracts growing over the next 1 2 years And not just by a little but by a huge fucking amount Explosive some may even call it yes pun intended We may very well see ourselves in WWIII https www forbes com sites davidaxe 2021 06 07 anticipating war with china the us air force is spreading across the pacific by 2023 and with wars there are war dogs People that profiteer off governments hemorrhaging money into building bigger and better armies Playing companies that reside in the military industrial complex especially high growth military tech companies like VUZI can stand to make you all millionaires And as they say Never let a good crisis go to waste In the event that all hell breaks loose at least you ll all be enjoying your tendies from a multi million dollar home Be the war dogs and fight for your country financially amp x200B Finally it still isn t even close to ATH Sitting at 19 per share as I write this VUZI reached 31 per share on April 8 2021 That s a 63 difference from its current share price Or as I like to call it the potential to reach at least a 63 gain 12 if this stock receives the right exposure amp x200B Where I Can See It Headed Honestly who the fuck knows But if I had to place bets I can see it reaching 30 in the next 2 weeks if it receives the right exposure to retail investors In addition this price is not a pump and dump like AMC nearly striking 70 VUZI s price will hold strong regardless of where it ends up because VUZI is a solid company that has great growth potential over the next few years Even if it doesn t receive the attention it deserves I would urge anyone reading this to buy just a few shares to hold in your long term portfolios You won t regret it amp x200B Any comments questions concerns are appreciated I ll do my best to answer them But like any other human I cannot predict the future This is just one guy s opinion on a potentially huge play

about oH nO tHis Is A pUmp amp dUmP please take the time to actually read this I spent a lot of time finding this information and I do think WOOF is a good value play that is being HEAVILY shorted Also I m not the other guy who posted about WOOF earlier So with that From the degenerate behind TX Latin America s Balls of Steel https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nx74mo tx dd ternium it up latin americas balls of steel I introduce to you The WOOF of Wallstreet A Doggystyle DD What is WOOF PetCo This is their building its nice I guess https preview redd it wozz1n4269571 png width 485 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b88457d937c3f0e0f705601b3299ca1216c001eb So now that half of America got all sad and pouty during COVID and bought themselves pandemic pets to cure that hole that permanently exists pet goods are becoming more and more profitable On top of this most of you tards probably don t realize that just like people who have yearly physicals your pets need to go to the vet This is where the new Petco comes in Petco defines itself as a health and wellness company focused on improving the lives of pets pet parents and Petco partners They sell various products including pet food toys health products and live animals Most importantly they have started rapid expansion into veterinary services through their Thrive amp Vital Care brand s I will bring this up later in the DD and highlight why it is extremely important as a case against popular competitor Chewy Petco is also one of the only stores that actually takes a Think Adoption First philosophy They have never sold dogs or cats and ended the sale of birds several years back This adoption approach helps promote a more ethical way of bringing companions into people s lives Vets Expansions amp More Alright so you re probably wondering why the fuck would I want to go into Petco when Chewy is already booming and has a unhealthy cult like following Several reasons all of which will make your wife s boyfriend let you watch them go doggystyle Pandemic pet business exploded reaching a peak high near the end of 2020 in terms of ownership Muricans were buying dogs cats hamsters sex dolls pocket pussies and basically anything that could temporarily cure loneliness In 2020 the pet industry posted a record 103 6 billion in sales per the American Pet Products Association However this boom is not going aways anytime soon Your pet isn t just going to disappear once you re back in the office and no way in hell is Petco taking back that dog you just dressed up for fAmIlY pHoTos Recent discounts and shipment options https preview redd it yngwxqxq69571 png width 901 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 83c73b477d92c6d7e8f5c4e0dfde8fc00c111732 This means Petco is about to make BANK over the next two to three years solely on food and care supplies By having physical stores Petco is able to fulfill 83 of its online orders through both store shipment and curbside pickup This has allowed for same day delivery as well with many customers reporting deliveries within 3 4 hours Many pet owners also prefer getting fresh food which is much more expensive for Chewy to ship from distribution centers Petco gets to avoid extra packaging and costs by shipping directly from local stores that keep products en bulk Their CEO Ron Coughlin states Giving a personal example when my order of Just Food for Dogs fish and sweet potatoes comes from one of our Pet Care Centers two miles from my house it comes in a simple bag versus a pack box with cardboard with dry ice with foam packaging that online pure play competitors use for comparable products said Mr Coughlin Clearly we have an advantage here On top of training and grooming services in stores Petco is overwhelmed by the demand for these services as their CEO reports 11 million new pet adoptions in the past year In general pets are considered a recession proof industry since they need to be fed and kept healthy regardless of economic conditions to some extent Hahaha we re about to take away your balls dude Petco Vet Center https preview redd it r7dqe27379571 png width 577 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 4701682e5849ee599ad3466a001e1c4c1fac4d89 Vet Business The Petco brand Vital Care is their main veterinary business and added nearly 70 000 new members since its launch in October with each of these customers spending 2 5x more than the average customer Overall these services grew 63 year over year with another 40 increase over the next year All of these signs point towards a strengthening business model that competes in a space other companies like PetSmart and Chewy have not expanded into Petco s Vital Care offers an annual plan that includes vet services and grooming discounts for 19 m This comes out to about 228 a year On average appointments pet insurance and other emergencies raise traditional vet costs into the thousands Petco s plans show that even as a poor you can continue to live with your 12 cats without going broke They also just opened their 100th in store veterinary hospital with no signs of stopping expansion There have also been reports of some PetCo stores being renovated due the the company s rebranding as a pet health and wellness store The reason I find this very bullish is that only a company expecting future growth and having the funds to do so would invest in large renovation projects Essentially Petco has transformed itself to become a one stop shop for pet supplies grooming training and vet health services all while providing a digital platform to access these services This business model beats nearly every other pet company out there right now This serves extremely well for both short and long term investors looking for a possible run up in the next few weeks and those seeking to capture large gains across several months The S H A R T Play Self Explanatory https preview redd it cvjizmj679571 png width 738 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 76a63b0e33b4bf8ea6f659cba15ce15e0455cc86 This is what S H A R T stands for S Short Interest H Hype A Availability Demand R Really Memeable T Timing Shart Interest SHART INTEREST 36 amp 37 6th Most Shorted Stock https preview redd it se8qmn2u69571 jpg width 828 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 41b575fb9e21966c8655e4688e2e57d6478bda53 Several different sources are reporting different shart interest numbers on WOOF ranging from 9 to 100 Ideally I want to go with the 100 shart rate but I think it is around 36 since this is a fucking Bloomberg Terminal lol The float is low as well at around 16M Therefore shart interest is around 36 which is still significantly high amp x200B Hype We can see that WOOF already gained traction once before and continues to do so There are some reddit whales who have already bought into WOOF this past week as well IV is moderately high across the options chain hovering between 60 80 indicating that right now is still an okay time to buy in if this DD is convincing you of Petco s potential amp x200B Availability When I say availability it is meant to measure the demand of the goods and services provided by said company In the case of Petco I see demand sustaining throughout 2021 and into 2022 because as mentioned before pets aren t going anywhere If Petco is able to capitalize on this by continuing to bring better service features and different vet plans it could target niche pet markets such as salon care as well for more wealthy clients Currently demand is severely outpacing the availability of their services and as a result I believe they will have very strong earnings again amp x200B Really Memeable I think this one is self explanatory Petco memed itself because a It IPOd right when GME gaped up everyone s mom s buttholes b Its ticker is a fucking sound It s not even a real word lol With WSB already having some knowledge of this ticker and the fundamentals indicating it is a good value play for the year I have full confidence in this trade regardless of it being memed or not even more amp x200B Timing Somewhat covered in the previous points but this is the perfect entry point Looking at the price graph over the past 6 months even after beating the estimated Q1 EPS of 0 09 by nearly 100 Actual EPS of 0 17 the stock has continued to trade sideways for a majority of the year You could have bought in February and made 0 to date For this reason I think the timing for the play is great Financials As mentioned earlier the predicted EPS for Q1 of 2021 was 0 09 while the actual EPS ended up being 0 17 a 89 beat Meanwhile the stock tanked lower and has stayed bound between the 20 and 24 range for 5 months Within this quarter alone Petco got an additional 1 2 million customers and 28 increase in YoY sales Through DoorDash they are able to increase expected revenue up to 5 58B by continuously providing same day shipping I find this partnership a bit sketchy just because of how overvalued and trash DoorDash is Regarding its competitor CHEWY we can see that it leads with a forward P E of nearly 245 while Petco is only at 29 Although this is relatively high within its sector Petco is trading at a massive discount Petco is able to target those who want an in store experience or simply cheaper services but also caters to the online crowd in an easy to manage fashion The same cannot be said for Chewy Chewy did expand into telehealth services but so far these do not replace a traditional vet appointment In terms of debt WOOF just payed off nearly 1 7B of debt and is left with just 1 8B all due to the IPO funds they secured With a much more positive balance sheet I find this to be another reason that right now is a the right time to enter Petco Given all of this data future growth and the expansion of Petco as much more than a pet supply store it makes zero sense for this stock to have a 36 short interest rate or trade sideways for so long amp x200B Analyst ANALysis As of last week Citi brought back a Buy rating on WOOF with a price target of 31 indicating upside of nearly 30 from its current price point of 23 80 Bank of America jumped on this as well lol and is giving it a new Buy rating with increased EBITDA forecasts through 2023 On Nasdaq s overview based on 3 analysts WOOF is a strong buy with a PT of 29 40 Although ANALysts can be quite wrong the signs of it being a strong buy are evident across many firms making this seem like an even better play Case I think the main issues Petco faces is its customer service issues From accounts I ve read on grooming and vet experiences people either have an extremely good appointment or a very bad one Petco needs to fix this by bringing consistency in training across their stores before expanding too much and getting overwhelmed by growth without accounting for quality I also think that with the lockup period expiring around Mid July 180 days after Jan 14th there could be a small dip if the price runs up in the next few weeks One final thing I thought of is if Chewy manages to utilize a healthcare company s coaching and vet networks to tie into its telehealth services This is the biggest competitive move they could make as they would only be paying for a network plan as a single client and simply offset the costs across all of their customers Additionally many of the networks provided by big names like United Healthcare are multinational and include thousands of providers This would allow Chewy to give cheaper vet access to all of its customers in almost any location unlike Petco which is still in the expansion process in its limited stores Conclusion TL DR Despite the case above I strongly believe that WOOF is a very undervalued company with strong financials that get better each day Combining the 36 shart interest lower share value and high PTs I am convinced that WOOF is a great play If you want your wife to let you do it doggystyle then WOOF is the perfect play to make money and get turnt I am in already for 5 contracts of 9 17 30Cs and will continue to add to my position this week I may also play FDs in case this gains traction this week Please make trades responsibly and with your own understanding of the stock as I m not responsible for you being retarded or complaining that this is P amp D

with zero news except my one moderately successful WSB post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nvcyxf wwe can you smell what the stock is cooking WWE s IV of 35 implied a 2 2 stddev in daily price change so an 11 close represents a 5 sigma event My take is that WWE got pregnant after getting fucked by WSB wearing five condoms I think MMs got defensive by pumping up the ask and IVs during PM possibly due to seeing sentiment pop Unfortunately it didn t take WWE long to start showing pregnancy sickness she regurgitated some gains in the last couple of days WWE definitely came and so did I My FDs were up 2500 and Jan LEAPs up 250 However in an act of sheer horniness after spending all day furiously writing the DD I had posted it after close So only those able to get in at open

A Brief History of B amp G The full history https bgfoods com about history of this perverted company is actually quite interesting probably if you read it I didn t read it I just mostly looked at the pictures In 1822 some Englishman started a condiment business in Boston in 1822 most likely to pay for the most advanced oral cosmetics of the day He then sells canned goods to Union troops That guy dies but his freaky perverted goth sons takes over and make a deal with the devil to sell some unholy canned mixture of ground ham and special seasonings By 1889 two of these perverts become street walkers in Manhattan selling pickles by yelling get yer edible green dildos here from a horse and buggy In 1893 they they latch onto the BBC trend and offer the not so subtle Cream of Wheat While all this is going on Mama Ortega squeezes out 13 kids the 11th one establishes the Ortega brand I guess the freaky sons decided it a good idea to conglomerate a huge harem of the freakiest sounding brand names Something about bagel chips too The rest is history In short B amp G has a solid history of selling phallic foods and acquiring euphemistic memeable brands https bgfoods com brands to create

beauty is in the eye of the beholder One take is past company leadership hasn t been strong in developing and executing plans for growth or evolution of the company They paid an unnecessarily high dividend at times at various points it was a double digit dividend and prior management decided to accrue debt to complete deals even as it continued to pay high dividends They re also being shorted Their business is solid though From my perspective I see a librarian with some light acne but with deep set sexual perversions just waiting for the right chad to unleash her She s got nothing wrong with her but she can t really sexually express herself comfortably until now she s just been dating some lazy ass cuck that can t find the clit Basically It s easier to fix broken management decisions quickly than to fix a broken underlying business In BGS you have the former rather than the latter So how exactly will management get fixed New CEO Enter Kenneth Clit Killer Keller Announced May 11th just before the Q1 earnings call and starts this very day Mans can find the clit You can read the bio https bgfoods com investor relations news article 14091 or just get erect right now M amp A of a larger high growth business gt Most recently Mr Keller served as president and CEO of JDE Peet s NV a 7 billion global coffee and tea company with over 20 000 employees based in Amsterdam The Netherlands He led the merger of Jacobs Douwe Egberts JDE and Peet s Coffee Inc and the successful initial public offering of the combined company in May 2020 Has literally led a company to Mars Can deliver a turnaround gt Prior to that Mr Keller served as global president of the Wm Wrigley Jr Company a subsidiary of Mars Inc where he was responsible for delivering sales and profit growth across the global gum mints and candy business In the United States the company s largest global market Mr Keller led a turnaround of the Wrigley business delivering growth well above the industry average During the integration of Wrigley into Mars Mr Keller helped establish the global business units and strategy for the combined Mars Wrigley confectionery business Former overlord of tendies dipping sauces gt He also worked at the H J Heinz Company in both the United States and Europe leading the ketchup condiments and sauces division in the United States This guy has a solid track record of both turning around and growing companies that deal with packages that consumers put in their mouths packaged foods that is It s a great sign he chose BGS for his next gig Q1 earnings Q2 guidance First a reminder that this company absolutely crushed it during the start of COVID where doomsday prepping of canned and frozen goods took hold So YoY comparisons were tough to beat But beat them off it did Net sales in Q1 rose to 505 from 449m last year despite it being a tough comparison The Crisco acquisition and strong net sales in the Spices and Seasonings brand area of 24 6 47 5 Y Y growth more than offsetting reductions in Green Giant and other areas due to supply constraints demand substantially exceeded supply a problem we all wish we had E commerce pimpery of their products increased by 60 Q1 20 vs Q1 21 to 50m They expect it to grow to 250m for full year 21 and are focused on growing that aspect of the business They also have the option to put Skinny Girl on OF though it wasn t mentioned in the call The guidance for Q2 They re limited by supply costs have risen and last year s Q2 20 will be difficult to top due to people stuffing their panties pantries This is very likely priced in as management was quite conservative on their earnings call and transparent about the supply issues which aren t particularly severe to begin with It s a good problem to have Further evidence this is priced in https www barrons com articles campbell and b g foods have outperformed only one is a buy for this analyst 51616436465 gt By contrast he downgraded B amp G Foods BGS to Neutral from Overweight while maintaining a 31 price target Lavery writes that he finds it difficult to see upside to the stock s current valuation especially as commodity price inflation could lead to higher costs in the second half of this year and into 2022 That said the company does have some ability to counteract this like Campbell via moves like hedging and price increases even so he estimates that B amp G Foods could face between 15 and 25 earnings per share risk this year and next if current commodity prices hold Addressing Risks Analysts are treating BGS like it has ED but Green Giant is a grower not a shower BGS supply chain and sales are primarily integrated across US Canada and Mexico vs many peers more geographically dispersed sourcing and sales BGS is thus well insulated against global geopolitical market trends toward de globalization and global supply chain disruption risk and has less exposure to ongoing COVID disruption due to North America s head start on vaccination and reopening They also have a strong history and relationship sourcing their inputs which should give them an edge over private brands that will struggle to source competitively in a supply environment that s tighter than your wife s hot friends In short anything they can source is sold they re fuck buddies with COVID proof and reliable growers and as industry costs rise they can price better than the smaller off brand competitors Given the worst is priced in a good growing season is all it would take for a significant impact on the share price III Macro Tailwinds and Catalysts On COVID COVID lead to an unfortunate decline in eating out pun intended obviously The upside to that is now consumers are slightly more apt at throwing frozen vegetables in the microwave I expect that post COVID people will remain more self sufficient and thus the demand for packaged goods will hopefully not decline much Even if the above is wrong BGS s foodservice sales which took an ass pounding from COVID saw the beginnings of an uptick in March This corresponds to the start of general reopening across the US as vaccine availability accelerated Foodservice were still at pre COVID levels in Q1 so Q2 should capture much more of that recovery which might surprise in terms of speed and scale To the extent that people keep their COVID purchasing habits As mentioned before BGS e commerce purchasing of their products increased by 60 Q1 20 vs Q1 21 to 50m They expect it to grow to 250m for full year 21 and are focused on growing that aspect of the business On the Growth to Value rotation A further market shift from growth to value would be welcomed BGS had no performance anxiety during COVID and offers a 6 3 yield and has authorized a 50m stock repurchase program On the related subject of interest rates possibly rising While they do have debt they have limited exposure The majority of their long term debt 1 45b is fixed rate vs 906m variable rate Possible Catalysts As mentioned above growth to value swing would really butter the biscuit If we see early signs of persistent COVID outbreaks or vaccine resistant variants there will be another rush on BGS products Also as a stock BGS has proved resilient and a surprise upside performer so it will be high on the list of defensive stocks Q2 earnings Good crops of veggies throughout rest of year A short squeeze occurring from growth to value rotation A short squeeze occurring in meme stocks see below IV Technicals BGS SMELL Test You can read about my SMELL test here https www reddit com user pennyether comments nzd2zi whats that smell gt SMELL is my proprietary system scientifically engineered to maximize fear in the hearts of wall street I identify tickers that have low liquidity eg their price moves up a lot per unit of inflow but also have short interest and low implied volatility I theorize this maximizes the chance that a squeeze or defensive posture by MMs happens should a sustained inflow of capital occur The result is in theory that buying inflows will lead to faster share price movements and rapid increases in IVs basically that options print S hort Interest Exchange Reported

that the option chain seems pretty sparse I imagine more OI would extend this ramp significantly It s also nice that vanna 10 IV flux is currently positive My read is that short term movement to 35 00 is easily possible 2 75 of float currently deltahedged is a nothing burger It s not tying up much float and so I don t suspect the current option chain is subtracting from liquidity but I think liquidity is low to begin with Of course if OI blows up this number is likely to skyrocket as well What s exciting to me is the avg volume I d consider gt 4 00 to be pretty sizeable and we re waaaay past that If one were to believe that average volume were indicative of liquidity then deltahedging could certainly start pushing the share price around should it naturally move up or down For reference here are some other tickers current peak values Ticker DeltaHedged 1 price flux Float 1 price flux Avg Vol BGS 2 75 0 30 11 43 WWE before pop 19 19 0 14 5 75 BBBY 6 74 0 43 4 55 CLNE 11 10 0

with meme stocks like BBBY This is all without any significant coverage on WSB If near term rotation to value occurs there is likely some upside there as well Mid Term Q2 guidance was conservative and I believe the downside is priced in Given that a surprise Q2 is a major possibility A slower rotation from growth to value would also work BGS has a juicy dividend and is priced at a discount to its peers Long Term New CEO started today Proven track record For the foreseeable future BGS will be limited only by supply and not demand I have faith on their ability to execute great relationships with suppliers and competitive pricing Can reach price commensurate with its peers I think downside is priced in given some analysts did some scat play with it due to supply concerns Other things I like Passes the SMELL test Options are dirt cheap Green Giant Crisco Cream of Wheat Don t YOLO etc None of this is financial advice Don t go crazy with this and don t blame me if it doesn t moon If share

be posting this as a reply as I intended last week Hopefully this helps w everyone s DD and questions Here s the rundown for anyone wondering What does WKHS have going for it besides high SI Some additional color today 6 14 2021 for any value fundamental investors reading w the news that RIDE Lordstown Motors had their CEO and CFO step down WKHS has a 10 stake in RIDE and it was expected that RIDE could would help w production after winning the USPS contract but there were no official contracts Burns ex CEO founded WKHS before moving to RIDE so it s not a great look for there to be an association between the two RIDE is pretty much dead so WKHS will hopefully cash out their stake for run capital I doubt they would try to acquire RIDE and bail them out w o any sizable contract on deck or being negotiated In the spirit of WSB though this isn t really a big deal short term Just be aware of the new macro narrative if you re in this MT or LT I ve been trading WKHS since October 2020 amp x200B Broad Strokes Ohio is one of those states that gets money for projects in general because of its workforce and because politics If you look at WKHS videos it started as a cool project but the use case does have legs It s not some vaporware business trying to make a buck in the last year to take advantage of a crisis Current management checks all the boxes for being genuine and corporate contract interest is real The USPS contract is the most infamous one Trucks are practical drones are iterated on production has been having issues scaling because this is still a relatively new sector in the EV industry and it s a fresh manufacturing business Speaking as a Manufacturing Industrial Engineer w Emerson Electric back in the day who has a plant in Sidney OH it s not a quick easy process to update physical production lines processes training and inventory management especially if you re using JIT Just In Time systems to reduce WIP Work In Progress amp x200B Catalysts The big 3 catalysts that WKHS is working off of are 1 USPS contract review 2 FAA drone certification 3 large contracts for scaling and profitability based off economies of scale Will the USPS contract be reviewed by the new administration The hope is yes because of the EV push Biden outlined and the weird bs awarding of the contract to Oshkosh for various reasons you can look up FAA certification takes months was initiated in Oct 2020 and they re focusing on getting it in the USA versus globally first because it s the more difficult certification to get Once achieved it adds leverage and credibility if when WKHS decides to expand internationally in the future Large contracts aren t coming in period There s interest they ve named a part of a stadium in Cincinnati and integrated into their community but that won t move the stock or their margins amp x200B Current Reality lt USPS Contract gt The three USPS board members Biden has nominated are going to be accepted and seeing as how slow things progress in D C it s unsure how quickly they ll get DeJoy thrown out because he refuses to resign or rollback any initiatives he had going w the previous administration Politics aside meaning this isn t about DeJoy and what he has or hasn t done what WKHS investors are hoping for is DeJoy to get thrown out so that at the very least there is an appeal review of the USPS contract I personally doubt Biden would come down from on high to force a review to happen since he s focused on a European alliance against China the NS2 pipe and the infrastructure rhetoric Given that WKHS lost the contract earlier this year but has tried everything to appeal it in the meantime their move to invest in themselves based on what they said in the last EC and get their production manufacturing improved they re clearly trying to position themselves in a better light if when a review comes down and they can present an even STRONGER case for how and why they can and will satisfy the full USPS contract even a partial awarding of the contract would be fantastic recognition Timeline on this happening I can t even begin to say Now would be great but this might be one of those political footballs that gets thrown around and used for bargaining on larger issues to pass in Congress If a review happens you can absolutely expect a substantial pop in share price via short covering and speculation but again I can t even begin to say what that number wise would be I d go off TA macro and DIX GEX levels to get an idea of what would be realistic Could it be an instant 50 at the next day s Open Sure Current trading environment is its own machination of trading reality lt FAA Certification gt Workhorse Group Inc a company focused on providing drone integrated electric vehicles to the last mile delivery sector has submitted its formal Type Certification application to the Federal Aviation Administration FAA for the HorseFly Unmanned Aerial System UAS A type certificate signifies the airworthiness of a particular category of aircraft according to its manufacturing design From application to approval the certification process takes approximately 12 to 24 months Do the math this won t have a short term resolution especially if things go awry and get political for XYZ reasons that we can speculate about If the process proceeds in a non bias vacuum and some inkling of what the result will be after 12 months of review leaks it won t be until August September by my estimates lt Large Contracts gt This will be based off the results of the previous two catalysts Short of some miracle R amp D breakthrough logistics software or White Knight I wouldn t expect any substantial contract to materialize until the first two catalysts are resolved One hitting would help push this catalyst but both would be beyond stellar GL to all hope this helped answer some questions from investors at all levels

dr DCA every month into index LEAPs instead of index funds to outperform the markets Crazy right Disclaimer This isn t financial advice I am not a finance professional Who this is for This research is from the pov of salaried folks like me who are midway to FIRE who have fixed income guaranteed for at least 2 years and with the optionality to keep working for a bit longer if the strategy goes badly Our goal is to advance retirement by aiming for higher than market total returns not risk adjusted returns hate that term by the way or more correctly not volatility adjusted returns If this doesn t describe you this post won t be useful to you Dollar cost average into index funds is the most non controversial financial advice you can get It has long been the gospel of bogleheads and other hands off styles of investors and for a good reason Stocks follow a Weiner process with positive drift viz Over the long term markets go up and in the years when they go down they fall less than they gain in the years when they go up Then the question must be asked is there a way to leverage this loosely speaking guarantee of positive movement over the long term What is the safest way to do so I could think of 3 ways 1 Buy index funds on margin This is well studied and documented https www bogleheads org forum viewtopic php f 10 amp t 5934 I personally dislike this approach because of interest rate risk margin requirement change risk flash crash risk Besides the only broker which offers a reasonable margin rate that the dividends on SPY will sufficiently pay for is IBKR and it comes at the price of not doing margin calls They ll sell your investments at the worst possible time 110 long is the highest I am willing to go with this method 2 Levered ETFs I am not knowledgeable on this subject but from what I understand they re not meant to be held long term due to contango and rebalancing Please feel free to correct me or add color 3 Buy calls Control the upside on 100x shares for less that the price of 100x underlying This is the subject of this post Research methodology I backtested this approach with Quantconnect and found that buying 40 delta calls that expire at least 1 year out LEAPs every month and scaling in slowly over 2 years beats the market by 5 1 The approach is not without risks Options are a wasting asset The scenario in which it loses the entire capital invested is if the US stock markets behaved like Japan in the 90s Investing in stocks lump sum is preferable to DCA but it would be too risky with options So we scale in slowly over 24 months buying a fixed dollar amount worth of SPY LEAPs Leverage is set to 1 We won t be borrowing money to buy calls Margins calls are terrifying enough with equity Built in leverage is sufficient No stock picking no market timing no indicators no hedging Wake up once a month find the expiration that s closest to 380 days from today identify a 40 delta strike slightly out of money and buy a preset dollar amount worth Do this for 2 years Sell the call 2 weeks before expiry avoids assignment gamma risk accelerated theta decay After 2 years stop adding more principal just reinvest profits the same way as before For example on June 1st 2021 we would have bought SPY220617C00445000 194 Why 40 delta 2 weeks 2 years These were just common sense starting points I m sure you can fine tune them but I did not want to risk overfitting the algorithm with additional parameters OTM calls makes sense intuitively due to volatility skew and the fact that moves are bigger ITM calls are more expensive and if I wanted higher delta I d just buy shares without expiry risk SPY was chosen because it s as liquid as it gets The algorithm is buying at ask and selling at bid market orders In practice we can try bidding lower higher with a bit of patience but that s the least of our concerns Inb4 short term capital gain taxes we choose expiry 380 days out sell 2 weeks before expiry which means holding period always qualifies for LTCG treatment This makes our approach comparable with buy and hold index or dollar cost average index on a pre as well as post tax basis Finally because of the way the backtesting engine works I had to seed the algorithm with 500 000 paper money and make 500 000 24 21k worth of a purchase each month This means that in the first 2 years we re not fully invested This cash drag understates the returns a bit but that s okay If you calculate the TWR on invested capital by hand it will be even higher in practice so no harm done Backtest was conducted over last 5 years Jun 16 to Jun 21 Yes this method is empirical and the 5 years happened to be good for stockholders But I don t have a crystal ball for the next 5 years and this is as scientific as it can get The important question is whether this strategy has legs or are we paying too much premium to make money over a sufficiently large and flexible time period Results https ibb co r7wMfwY https ibb co r7wMfwY https ibb co frswZJn https ibb co frswZJn Total return for DCA into LEAPs 609 75 Total return for DCA into SPY shares 154 49 benchmark 1 Total return for lump sum SPY shares 421 190 1 121 57 benchmark 2 Worst drawdown surprisingly low 49 2 Sharpe ratio 1 23 PSR 50 4 We don t give a shit about the last 2 metrics We knew this was going to be volatile My takeaway Unless a calamity occurs and doesn t resolve itself for more than 5 years this strategy will propel me towards an early retirement I m keeping all my current savings invested in an all weather portfolio but the new money will buy LEAPs every month If this works well see you in walhalla If this goes tits up no biggie keeping my job for 2 more years won t kill me Biggest risk to implementing this strategy well is psychological Human nature is to equate high win rates with better strategies rather than ones with higher skewed expectancy I fully expect some of these monthly purchases to go to zero but hopefully the others will more than make up for the losses So long as I don t shit my pants and keep buying that is Future research Experiment with spreads calendar spreads diagonal spreads active stock picking Fine tuning deltas Timing the purchases with low IV Hedging with VIX gold bonds T bills

Hindenburg Report s challenges to the viability of Lordstown Motors technology and timeline to start of production are not accurate We are headed up high and fast amp x200B https i redd it g3su0uxnta571 gif Background The Hindenburg Report stated among other things that Lordstown Motors had made various misstatements about demand for its Endurance pick up truck the viability of the technology utilized in the Endurance and its ability to start production of the Endurance in September 2021 In response the Lordstown Motors Board of Directors established a Special Committee of independent directors to investigate the allegations made in the Hindenburg Report The members of the Special Committee are David T Hamamoto Jane Reiss and Dale Spencer The Special Committee engaged Sullivan amp Cromwell LLP a leading global law firm to conduct the investigation Sullivan amp Cromwell was assisted by technical experts from a leading automotive consulting firm The Special Committee s investigation concluded that the Hindenburg Report is in significant respects false and misleading In particular its challenges to the viability of Lordstown Motors technology and timeline to start of production are not accurate The investigation did however identify issues regarding the accuracy of certain statements regarding the Company s pre orders A summary of the Special Committee s findings is presented below Findings 1 September 2021 Start of Production Target The Hindenburg Report stated that Lordstown Motors plan to start production in September 2021 is unrealistic based on Hindenburg s allegations relating to recent design changes including to the composition of frames a failure to complete necessary testing a lack of battery pack manufacturing capability and a lack of hub motor manufacturing capability The Special Committee concluded that while various factors could lead to delays in the start of production the projected September 2021 start of production remains achievable with the expectation of delivery to customers in the first quarter of 2022 The Hindenburg Report cites a purported statement from an anonymous former Lordstown Motors employee that Lordstown Motors switched from plastic frames to aluminum frames earlier this year That is false While Lordstown Motors made certain changes to the materials to be used for the doors hoods and fenders there has been no change to its plan to manufacture the vehicle frame from steel Lordstown Motors has commenced and plans to complete required regulatory durability and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards FMVSS testing during 2021 While certain testing must be completed before Lordstown Motors can deliver the Endurance to customers none of the testing cited in the Hindenburg Report must be complete before the start of production Lordstown Motors has begun testing consistent on a timeline that anticipates delivery to customers in the first quarter of 2022 taking into account the potential adjusted production volumes discussed on the Company s May 24 2021 first quarter earnings conference call Lordstown Motors has sourced battery cells from suppliers and initial battery pack assembly equipment has been received and is being installed with remaining equipment due to arrive in advance of the projected start of production date Lordstown Motors currently expects to produce hub motors in part using manual processes while the automated hub motor production line is installed over the next few months It expects this process to provide sufficient hub motor production capacity to support expected production volumes in 2021 and 2022 2 Viability Of Hub Motor Technology The Hindenburg Report questioned the viability of the hub motor technology used in the Endurance stating that the hub motors are licensed from a Slovenian company Elaphe that hub motors present durability issues because of unsprung weight and that hub motors have not previously been commercialized at scale in the light vehicle market The Special Committee concluded that while hub motors have not previously been used at scale in commercially produced passenger vehicles the hub motor technology licensed from Elaphe is viable The Endurance was engineered to address the unsprung vehicle mass attributable to in wheel motors including through tuning of the suspension reinforcing the vehicle structure and utilizing a heavier truck chassis These measures are expected to alleviate any ride or durability issues that might otherwise arise 3 January 13 2021 Truck Fire The Hindenburg Report described a January 13 2021 incident in which a prototype of the Endurance caught fire during a test drive The Special Committee concluded that the incident was an isolated event rather than one reflecting a systemic problem Lordstown Motors conducted a technical investigation of the incident that identified the root cause of the fire to be non conforming parts on a battery pack that had been manually reworked for assembly on the prototype During a test drive the driver accelerated beyond the expected test parameters for that prototype As a result of the rapid acceleration the faulty connection point resulting from the manually reworked assembly experienced an overload of electric current which caused the battery to ignite Lordstown Motors reported the incident to the relevant regulator and has taken steps to address the isolated issues that contributed to this incident The production process now in place and the automation of battery pack assembly are intended to ensure that this type of issue does not recur 4 Pre Orders The Hindenburg Report raised various questions regarding the Company s practices and disclosures regarding pre orders Among other things the Hindenburg Report stated that Lordstown Motors pre orders i are non binding letters of intent ii require no reservation payment and in some instances were procured through the payment of sales commissions iii are from customers that generally do not operate fleets and iv include pre orders from customers that do not have the means to make the purchases indicated Lordstown Motors has repeatedly disclosed that its pre orders are non binding and it has highlighted the risk that pre orders may not be converted to actual orders In most instances Lordstown Motors pre orders did not require a reservation or similar payment though pre orders submitted through a website portal required a refundable 100 payment Lordstown Motors entered into an arrangement to pay one entity commissions for procuring pre orders That entity procured approximately 1 000 pre orders and also assisted Lordstown Motors into entering into an important commercial relationship with a leading fleet management company Lordstown Motors has obtained tens of thousands of pre orders from fleets fleet management companies or other end users If converted to orders this demand will comprise substantially all of the Company s expected production volume through 2022 Lordstown Motors made periodic disclosures regarding pre orders which were in certain respects inaccurate Lordstown Motors has stated on several occasions that its pre orders were from or primarily from commercial fleets In fact many pre orders were obtained from i fleet management companies or other end users that indicated interest in purchasing Endurance trucks similar to commercial fleets and ii so called influencers or other potential strategic partners that committed to attempt to secure pre orders from other entities but did not intend to purchase Endurance trucks directly One entity that provided a large number of pre orders does not appear to have the resources to complete large purchases of trucks Other entities provided commitments that appear too vague or infirm to be appropriately included in the total number of pre orders disclosed 5 Other Matters The Special Committee also reviewed certain other matters raised in the Hindenburg Report and made the following observations First although not in a position to assess ongoing litigation with Karma Motors the Special Committee notes that Lordstown Motors has denied the allegations against it and is contesting both liability and damages Second as described in various Form 4 filings in the months following the DiamondPeak transaction certain Lordstown Motors directors and executives have sold or transferred shares in the Company Each of those transactions were made for reasons unrelated to the performance of the company or viability of the Endurance and each such director and executive retained substantial Lordstown Motors equity holdings in the form of shares and options following the sales and transfers described in the Company s public filings

million addressable enabled TVs https www businesswire com news home 20210609005230 en VIZIO Surpasses 11 Million Addressable Enabled TVs in the US Why does this matter It s yet another income stream for the TV manufacturing god and one that has been insanely profitable for other companies For those of you who live under a rock almost all of these tech companies are competing for your data to sell to advertisers and Vizio is finally getting into the game We re only a few years away from lightspeed briefs ads being beamed into your dreams while you sleep so for Vizio to start carving out a market share in this space I think is pretty significant III Technicals Here s why I think VZIO can be a WWE junior Extremely low float The float on this is around 18 million shares which is less than half of the float on WWE And for you AMC and GME retards Vizio s float is only 4 of AMC s and less than half of GME s If you re still confused let me say it this way If everyone subscribed to wallstreetbets wanted 2 shares there wouldn t be enough shares to go around I ve been sniffing around and this is the lowest float non bullshit stocks I ve been able to find And by non bullshit I mean Vizio actually has a respectable market cap and actually makes money Volume is low Volume is extremely low and trending lower Average volume is only around 400k and has been trending downward ever since the IPO Options are cheap IV on this stock is only 54 For reference when CLNE popped the IV was around 80 If there is any kind of volume spike this IV will go up considerably It is crazy to me that the IV can be this low when the consensus price target has a 33 upside Moderate SI The SI is only moderate sitting at 7 but still enough to cause some heartburn And fuck it it s you know what season With the IV so low if the shorts were forced to cover we could see some serious tendies Huge Omega With the IV so low it won t take much movement for our options to print The Omega https www investopedia com terms o omega asp or elasticity is huge For example when Vizio went up 3 60 last Friday June 18 2021 Calls increased 84 or an Omega of 23 4 Plus not only is the Omega large the options chains are fucking scarce July FDs only go up to 30 strike and if you were paying attention to the Fundamentals section that s below their target price IV Conclusion This is my pick for a low risk high reward play Its got everything I looked for plus the options are cheap On the 3 6 move last Friday even my Nov 19 25 calls went up 12 It was fun riding the WWE tending train last week and I think we could have a similar situation here You could even play this stock like a boomer buy and hold can t go tits up and come out with some solid gains if we hit the consensus price target I think the July 25C have a great chance of printing I m personally holding shares June 18 22 5 C July 16 25 C and Nov 19 25 C and if this post gains traction here I ll probably add some 25C FDs Not financial advice buy some shares and options or don t I don t really give a fuck I just like the stock and the 32 Vizio my mommy got me for birthday so I thought I d share this post with you degenerates I sit in front of a computer for a living so I m probably actually autistic

The factors for the stocks that made it to today s list are 1 Chart looks decent and the stock hasn t already gone up 50 or more aka already missed the boat 2 Some bullish option flow came in today and the stock price was somewhat flat or down 3 Is short interest increasing or decreasing as the stock goes up or down If the stock is getting hit going down and SI is increasing it s quite possible
