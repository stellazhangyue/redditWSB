UWMC is ready to pop I was in UWMC for the value play It is a STEAL at 10 on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal Even above 10 has a strong long term argument Here is UWMC in a nutshell heavily shorted borrow costs skyrocketing mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback and shorts are QUAKING UP 6 in premarket following being up 1 2 Friday This puts at starting at 8 Monday with 9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS In truth this is not just a short squeeze its multiple plays rolled into one We have retail buying hype train going obviously look at all the WSB posts here posted below short squeeze due to high cost of borrow Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts an unfair post earnings plunge plus good ole company doing good things making money We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to 14 hey guys remember to take profit this time UWMC Short Squeeze Short borrow costs skyrocketed from 30 to over 93 in a few hours on Friday They cannot keep shorting at this price It is now cost prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less used Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93 is obviously unfeasible THEY WILL COVER Once one group starts covering and causes a spike other shorts will rush to do the same It s a prisoner s dilemma and HF s want to cut each other s throats just as much as ours Let s let them https iborrowdesk com report UWMC https iborrowdesk com report UWMC UWMC Gamma squeeze https www marketwatch com investing stock uwmc options https www marketwatch com investing stock uwmc options Many of these 7 50 9 10 and 12 are OTM or barely ITM and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM s to hedge to delta neutral further pushing 10c and 12 50 c into hedge terroitorry This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts Stock BuyBack Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback similar to RKT s special dividend for the same purpose The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted 13 and heavily held float pool Retail is gorging on the float institutions are holding the float and Ishbia is buying the free float up This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL WIth shorts paying 93 they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL not synthetic Make them buy real shares from us at 20 each UWMC UWMC is a good company not just a memestock UWMC is a good company that pays a good dividend has a good CEO and is the king of B2B mortgage refinance I am in UWMC for the long term VALUE PLAY and like the stock I like the company I like the CEO I like the market position I like the value I ilke the stock I am loading up on 6 18 8c options Options are important as we move up to force MM s to buy to remain market neutral Options do not pay unless we buy shares so I suggest splitting half half to each options can cause MM s to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk which means we need to buy stocks as well Options are good for Gamma Squeeze MM s balance buys and profit but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM MIX IT UP This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember Gravy costs extra TL DR UWMC TO THA MOON

239,neeinl,t2_eflst,1621253364,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/neeinl/market_review_a_look_at_recent_trends_performance/,1,Market Review A look at recent trends performance and some assumptions on where we go from here,Recently I ve been trying to put my thoughts and analysis down in writing instead of just living in my head as a way to fully think through what s rolling around in my head as I look at charts read articles listen to podcasts etc Every so often I start to see an opportunity to re assemble my view of the market and make some assertions and I think after last week this is one of those times amp nbsp So I want to start by giving some disclosure on my recent positioning and what I m trying to get out of this In mid late April I switched into short positions on all indices and got long a VIX all through longer dated options We were chopping around ATHs things looked stretched stocks were selling off on huge earnings beats and seasonality was something to consider So I took the viewpoint then that we d see some downside volatility sometime in May and I was anticipating a 5 10 pullback when all was said and done Well three weeks later we ve had a move to the downside but things kind of look different now and while I unwound some of my shorts last week I m trying to determine if this sell off is done or if we re due for a larger downside move Let s start with a look at overall market performance by sector Sector Performance 1y https imgur com LJ0t7jN Sector Performance 2021 YTD https imgur com lEBNPW2 I m using ARKK here as a proxy for high growth unprofitable companies since that s a lot of what they own Some notes Tech and in particular unprofitable tech has underperformed YTD since about mid Feb Financials Industrials and Energy have out performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart This reflation trade started in about mid February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year s growth trade has lagged and given back Now let s look at index performance SPY 1y https imgur com 6mXqqVF QQQ 1y https imgur com NVWss5e IWM 1y https imgur com SylCIJy I ve tried to highlight ranges pullbacks and bounces in these Take Aways QQQ IWM have been in this kind of chop zone since about mid Feb and technicals look somewhat bearish here SPY has maintained performance and along with the DOW not pictured has led the market higher Looking at the charts every pullback has been bought and we can t seem to get any meaningful breakdown Buy the dip has to continue to be the mantra Comparing these to our sector charts we can see we need to look at more than one thing to tell a story These indices due in part to how they are constructed do not highlight the rotation and churn that s been going on the rotation out of high growth stocks into value with the latter responsible for driving the market higher as of late To further illustrate that last point let s look at just one section of the market as an example Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value Selected Indices 1y https imgur com LJmHP8r Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post crash The Recent Pullback and What to do Next So I think a good place to start with respect to what next is to rehash this last week Starting off with a downside move this accelerated Wednesday as the market reacted to the CPI data I use quotes here because I don t fully buy the inflation narrative that the media is spinning and I think for the most part neither does the market Inflation is a whole separate post that I may do at some point Anyway we followed this sharp downside move with a sharp upside move and by the end of the week the damage wasn t all that bad However this snap back may be concerning in terms of legitimacy and at least as far as QQQ and IWM go we re still looking bearish To get an idea if the selling here might be done or not I thought it worth a look at some of QQQ s largest components individually AAPL 1y https imgur com Z0Bh0mD INTC 1y https imgur com VOwvNhH NVDA 1y https imgur com OmqYSET FB 1y https imgur com 4JgNVxl Along with some others not shown here these show a common pattern all sitting at some kind of support level If we see a breakdown below these levels watch out But I have a feeling we re largely done here Building a Thesis I m just gonna throw down some bullet points here based on the charts above market sentiment and some stuff I ve been reading Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way the reflation trade is the trend and no reason to fight it Tech growth seems to be at support and may indicate the recent selling here is done but that doesn t mean we re going to be seeing ATHs again here anytime soon Need to watch out for Fed tapering talk There is talk that the Fed will need to at least taper it s QE programs at some point and some expectation that could start to be communicated as early as June Market reaction here will be interesting Inflation reactions Along with the bond market and Fed I may believe that surprising inflation data will be temporary and normalize but we could see short term volatility around these events while the greater market digests it The leading sectors banks and industrials were looking pretty stretched at the beginning of this week Ending largely unchanged the volatility has helped reset some of those overbought indicators though they are still high I think weakness here could lead to a greater sell off and performance of these is something to closely watch Consider seasonality We re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall It s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short term trades going forward Buy The Fucking Dip I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have you can have a bearish view on this market given all the bullshit but there is no way in hell you can t be long right now Stay with the trend amp nbsp I think right now if you re long you need to be long banks industrials energy SPY I would stay away from growth and tech until we see these push ATHs e g IWM QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside stay out or short them

activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel It s the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator behind Rocket Companies It s CEO is Mat Ishbia who started as it s 12th employee and who s dad Jeff started the company as a side hustle Mat and his brother own 94 of the company in Class D shares The rest of the public float 100m Class A shares are what is available for the public to purchase What trends are pushing UWMC s stock down The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates About 75 of UWM income is related to refinance activity The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing Millions have done that leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket The strength of the broker channel UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans It doesn t have any direct to consumer lending operations like Rocket does Short Interest Sophisticated investors are seeing 75 of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products not all refi s are rate sensitive like cash out and are salivating They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock They have basically shorted all the shares they can Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93 borrow rate SPAC It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently It is very reasonable to assume UWMC is a part of that softening It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded Lots of other nice places to put institutional money Competitors Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce Rocket LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings LD statement This will compress loan sale margins in the short term What trends are pushing UWMC stock up Short term retail pressure there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC My post is about UWM s long term perspective so I ll let this post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments ndcm0p uwmc is a powderkeg low float high short huge take you further down that rabbit hole Broker Channel Growth Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the retail channel For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator Mat has targeted mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50 of that channel by 2025 26 Currently UWM owns 36 of the broker channel with brokers originating 20 of all mortgages Before the housing crisis in 2008 brokers were 58 of mortgage originations Per Mat amp Q1 2021 Earnings call so it isn t crazy to think they could get back to a third as the channel is growing source https www nationalmortgagenews com news why the mortgage broker channel has been gaining momentum I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for 4 5k cheaper in closing costs This is because Rocket s retail channel has 4 margins and it s partnership network includes wholesale realtors etc has 1 margins New Product Offerings UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan In earnings Mat said he expects 2b in volume from Jumbo They also added ARM s manufactured homes and expanded government programs Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM UWM All In Ultimatum Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels cause the margins are so much higher and trying to squeeze out brokers UWM said if you work with those two don t work for us The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway s partnership channel This may have kickstarted the pricing war Retail Attention UWM has been receiving a lot of attention online This brings retail investors but also institutional investors who are now tracking this stuff Think BUZZ ETF etc Aggressive Capital returns UWM pays an annual 40 dividend on its class A shares That only costs them 42m year Remember their Q1 net income was 800m So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet The board just approved a 300 million share buyback as well that will reduce share count Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks He just sold at 10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under 8 The man successfully shorted his own company What a legend Long Term Prediction I m invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn With a 5 dividend return share buyback and potentially growing market share UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years Price Target 14 share in 2023

to become the largest mortgage originator Mat has targeted mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50 of that channel by 2025 26 Currently UWM owns 36 of the broker channel with brokers originating 20 of all mortgages Before the housing crisis in 2008 brokers were 58 of mortgage originations Per Mat amp Q1 2021 Earnings call so it isn t crazy to think they could get back to as it is growing https www nationalmortgagenews com news why the mortgage broker channel has been gaining momentum https www nationalmortgagenews com news why the mortgage broker channel has been gaining momentum I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for 4 5k cheaper in closing costs This is because Rocket s retail channel has 4 margins and it s partnership network includes wholesale realtors etc has 1 margins New Product Offerings UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan In earnings Mat said he expects 2b in volume from Jumbo They also added ARM s manufactured homes and expanded government programs Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM UWM All In Ultimatum Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels cause the margins are so much higher and trying to squeeze out brokers UWM said if you work with those two don t work for us The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway s partnership channel This may have kickstarted the pricing war Aggressive Capital returns UWM pays an annual 40 dividend on its class A shares That only costs them 42m year Remember their Q1 net income was 800m So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet The board just approved a 300 million share buyback as well that will reduce share count Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks He just sold at 10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under 8 The man successfully shorted his own company What a legend Long Term Prediction I m invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn With a 5 dividend return share buyback and potentially growing market share UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years amp x200B Price Target 14 share in 2023

Patterns and Technical Analysis,What if you knew where prices would go and when they would get there It sounds like an impossibility but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns amp x200B Processing img fqzpk486qpz61 Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart They enable you to find the broader trend or overall direction prices are heading which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade Sticking with the trend going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend aligns you with the higher probability direction already setting yourself up for a probable trade They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a bounce where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball and heading into the opposite direction These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another this is an example of where edge comes from finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other and betting on it amp x200B Channel line pattern with

exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points or swings in the price chart When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band prices are trading within a channel amp x200B A trendline drawn off of the highs https preview redd it fcfpptc8qpz61 png width 615 amp format png amp auto webp amp s cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2 Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts support and resistance Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices slowing their momentum or causing a reversal In this way support and resistance are one and the same they are levels that support or resist keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power amp x200B gt Prices will often test support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold creating areas with a high probability of a bounce therefore creating trading opportunities How to Draw Channel Lines So trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum Channels are two parallel trendlines With that how can you draw a channel line on a price chart The first consideration is if there is a channel at all Often there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines straight lines connecting s r However it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with Thus a textbook channel with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find this actually makes the pattern more important as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability low risk trades To draw a channel first find a trendline Connect important swing lows or highs and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line amp x200B First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows

is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings while is broken by three other spikes Once you ve found the trendline either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn or if using a channel drawing tool simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement It takes a lot of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate future price movements is even more of a learned skill This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts Types of Channel Lines The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range amp x200B Uptrend

is the presence of swing highs and lows If prices are making higher swings high peaks and higher swings low troughs chances are they are in an uptrend If prices are making lower highs and lower lows

probability side Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines this can form the basis of a trading strategy In a ranging market where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal

drawing tools can display a midline or a line 50 away from both trendlines This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support resistance zone and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent but still significant way Additionally sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel When this happens the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing amp x200B Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout https preview redd it wz5gw1peqpz61 png width 1024 amp format png amp

breaks the lower or the upper line A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines When prices break the countertrend side the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend you can anticipate a reversal soon When prices break the with trend side the trend has accelerated and you may need to redraw your channel line This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal How to Trade With Channel Lines Because channel line patterns offer areas that have a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other trading strategies can be formed around the pattern After identifying a valid channel a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with trend channel line setting a stop loss level based on volatility Fibonacci extensions or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points A take profit level could be determined by a

believe it s time for Corsair to breakout I would really appreciate anyone s bearish sentiment to explain further downward price action Here is my DD thesis Using most recent closed price 31 39 From May 12th 1 Financials 2020 sales 1 7 billion with a GP of 465MM TTM 1 92 billion with a GP of 547MM The current market cap is 2 9Billion 2021 estimates As per Andy Paul CEO and Michael Potter CFO who have always been conservative with their estimates 2021 sales estimate 1 9 billion to 2 1 billion representing growth of 11 6 to 23 4 Adjusted operating income in the range of 235 million to 255 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of 245 million to 265 million Most recent quarter Q1 revenue of 529MM with an adjusted net income of 58 2MM EPS beat of 0 58 vs the 0 33 estimate a 75 beat They also paid down 10 of their debt which now stands at 300MM which means 1MM more is guaranteed next year 2 Growth WHAT Q1 beat Q4 They beat stay at home winter time holiday time holiday sales revenue which was 53MM What does this mean They are still selling and will continue to sell even though COVID gave them a nice boost Furthermore hardware and gaming peripherals quarters are their weakest in Q1 With growing quarters this year their EPS for 2021 will be a minimum of 2 5 giving Corsair a P E ratio of 12 5 for a company growing 100 YOY and expected to continue at 20 YOY They beat Q1 estimates of 75 This will continue this year Recession or not Ultimate growth DDR5 Corsair has the 1 market share in memory sales https www corsair com us en blog ddr5 primer We ll be adding significant resources to the company this year both in marketing and R amp D as well as infrastructure as we move towards a 2 billion revenue number Boom They re choosing to pay more for growth rather than just buying down debt They believe in themselves and so does EagleTree the majority shareholder They also just signed a new three year lease on a brand new campus with a lot more room Finally their Glassdoor reviews are finally bullish again they used to suck Yes I even look at Glassdoor reviews when going all in on a company I recommend you read MC s article 18 Words From Corsair Gaming CEO Could Spell Monster Returns for Investors Where Andy Paul said The vast majority of people that are playing video games have bought no specialist gaming gear at all 3 Technicals Okay they suck Triple MACD crossover lack of support but when has that ever stopped any of you retards Food for thought this stock is down 31 after it has had TWO quarterly earning beats It s been lumped in with other overpriced tech stocks and has been hit very hard We see 30 50 as a solid support level you cannot go wrong unless you put everything into call options 4 Insiders Trading Michael Potter CFO Sold 1 25 of his shares 7 500 shares of his 600 000 shares Good for him he made some tendies and I hope he buys a lambo Thi L La COO Purchased 100 000 shares at 32 64 He literally spent 3 25 million betting on the company he may know more about than anyone else It is only fair to note that he sold 100k shares at 35 in January in a public offering We can only assume it was to buy GME with us and jump back in later right 5 Institutions will start buying again Round 2 for institutions and ETFs When scratching my head and pondering why prices dropped and as new reports are emerging it is clear that many of the initial IPO investors like JP Morgan have sold I mean cmon they made 100 return on 10 s of millions in investments Meanwhile new institutions are tapping in from the ER beats some even increasing positions and going heavy on call options Finally 180 days have now passed which some institutions and ETFs consider a waiting period before buying into an equity 6 Analysts and Other Technical Articles Don t trust the random unknown guy from Reddit Trust every article published in the past three months Show me one negative or bearish article Finally analysts have an average PT of 46 67 with Barclays giving it a 47 Not one has it as a sell Screaming Buy some articles call it 39 return in 12 months How spoiled are you not to jump on near 40 return in a company that distributes products that you actually would like to own 7 Possibilities these depend on EagleTree Partners If anyone knows someone who works there hit me up Buyout EagleTree owns 67 of the shares That s funny because equity buyouts often exceed 60 ownership A big if but they could potentially sell to someone which would make some millionaires here Short Squeeze more like a hug The float is 88 13MM shares Meanwhile EagleTree owns 61 99MM of those shares Assuming EagleTree does not add more to the float there is a 17 2 SI based on the most recent SI report from Nasdaq However millions of shares were shorted from tech sell off as well as last earnings report could be as high as 21 Meanwhile days to cover IS OVER 7 No no not a short squeeze but it could cause some covers from the shorts that were taken back in the 40 s TDLR Financials are great Company is growing Analysts are all bullish Some possible moon scenarios Everyone here says Corsair will have its day but why not make that happen today not tomorrow Position I am shorting the fk out of it because it seems like the prices of every DD on a fundamentally solid company goes to shit

Compilation I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week cause it s time to do it all again Earnings season is slowly coming to an end so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks but that s alright there s still money to be made amp nbsp All that being said I fucking love earnings season It s an absolute battleground out there Insane volatility breaking announcements and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time What s not to love Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers roll the dice and amass a small fortune That being said the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders many find that they re one bad trade away from a complete blowout so you always need to think about each trade critically No shame in sitting it out altogether amp nbsp The Spreadsheet To aid us in planning our trades this week I ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week https docs google com spreadsheets d 1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A jJQKiQ edit usp sharing Using this spreadsheet we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker Obviously past performance isn t indicative of future success but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information If you re struggling to find a given stock click on the ticker symbol on the index page it should hyperlink you straight to the table If the above link isn t working for you refer to the link below amp nbsp Spreadsheet HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A jJQKiQ edit usp sharing amp nbsp Please note that scraping and compiling this data took hours If the sheet has helped you out in any way please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials It would mean alot to me Most websites also require you to pay for this data which I think is a load of shit amp nbsp Interesting Observations and Sample Plays Below I ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance If I missed anything feel free to bring it to my attention amp nbsp Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week Home Depot Lowe s Walmart and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves but will likely break trend this earnings Last quarter was fucking massive for these retail giants as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer to either the upside or downside amp nbsp Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week If you re looking for a fun little collateral play you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another If one beats they usually all beat and vice versa amp nbsp Don t fall for the Solar trap Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings and are likely primed for a reversal There isn t much farther for these stocks to go down and as a result a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in If they even match estimates or put up a beat they will likely move upwards This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers amp nbsp Obviously since I gave data on over 50 companies there s plenty that I ve missed Dive in have a look around and have some fun with it Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes and get the best risk reward possible Feel free to share your findings too I d love to see what you guys come up with amp nbsp Conclusion We ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week meaning there s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles Use the spreadsheet https docs google com spreadsheets d 1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A jJQKiQ edit usp sharing to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio and play accordingly If enough people found these useful I ll continue making them throughout the earnings season If the sheet has helped you out in any way please consider dropping an upvote or a comment and

an excellent company with a great subsidiaries portfolio Merging with High Wire Networks is a massive bonus for the company and will increase its value 10 fold Spectrum Global Solutions has a global presence that allows and will continue to allow them to reach global markets and clients Their potential for growth is limitless Their stock for investors at the moment is very attractive with the low outstanding shares and float With volume this stock will increase dramatically in my opinion Although their revenue is something that needs improvement as I mentioned with the global presence this is something that can be achieved This merger will bring a new board of management that can steer this company in the right direction to achieve those revenue targets High Wire Networks is a fantastic company that is well established and is producing revenue of 18 million dollars annually and has just been awarded a 2 8 million dollars contract to add to its current revenue The board of management will take over the management of Spectrum Global Solutions and rebrand the company As High Wire Networks is in the Cyber Security business cybersecurity has a 66 billion dollar market size thus giving the company a lot of room to grow https www globenewswire com news release 2020 11 05 2121251 0 en Cybersecurity Industry Overview Shows US To Account For The Largest Share Among Countries In The

NASDAQ they have to reach a minimum of a 3 bid price With how strong these companies look and with the merger this will definitely push them a long way in the right direction to achieving this goal with ease Therefore I believe this ticker is a strong buy at 0 2 and I believe my PT s low 3 Medium 4 50 High 6 are justified from all of the above mentioned

highwirenetworks com about https www highwirenetworks com about Conclusion Spectrum Global Solutions is an excellent company with a great subsidiaries portfolio Merging with High Wire Networks is a massive bonus for the company and will increase its value 10 fold Spectrum Global Solutions has a global presence that allows and will continue to allow them to reach global markets and clients Their potential for growth is limitless Their stock for investors at the moment is very attractive with the low outstanding shares and float With volume this stock will increase dramatically in my opinion Although their revenue is something that needs improvement as I mentioned with the global presence this is something that can be achieved This merger will bring a new board of management that can steer this company in the right direction to achieve those revenue targets High Wire Networks is a fantastic company that is well established and is producing revenue of 18 million dollars annually and has just been awarded a 2 8 million dollars contract to add to its current revenue The board of management will take over the management of Spectrum Global Solutions and rebrand the company As High Wire Networks is in the Cyber Security business cybersecurity has a 66 billion dollar market size thus giving the company a lot of room to grow https www globenewswire com news release 2020 11 05

Final Thoughts this company has highlighted that they want to list on the NASDAQ In order for them to list on the NASDAQ they have to reach a minimum of a 3 bid price With how strong these companies look and with the merger this will definitely push them a long way in the right direction to achieving this goal with ease Therefore I believe this ticker is a strong buy at 0 2 and I believe my PT s low 3 Medium 4 50 High 6 are justified from all of the above mentioned

again I think you guys may remember me after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations in anticipation of it s breakout moment You might even remember my YOLO and remembered I continuously added to it And that I eventually upped my margin to 13 5k on it Well I m here to tell you that I m not out I bought more calls to average down on earnings day and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop My only regret is that I didn t buy more then Back then I said the Theta Beta s would regret selling those calls and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn t be IV Crush I was right Their probably a little sour Sorry chaps you usually are the one s making money at our expense This time it s going to have to be the other way around Today I had the chance to exit my options for a 47 profit roughly Sell calls for a chunky profit after that I said no You know why Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6 26 dollars that s why The Fear the Uncertainty and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm So fuck them We re playing Pac Man people The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure We re buying up the stock to get the price to 9 10 because people bought options for 5 10 cents and they ll be in the money quite easily And because of the rising volume every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B The delta on the options is low and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge So no I won t sell my options for a 10 or a 50 profit I m going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me And so should you I understand people have taken profits but honestly at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn t worth the squeeze Good for them though Next time could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao And for those people on the fucking fence You jumped onto MVIS you jumped into GME and AMC and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence The fucking Eyy Lmaooo Boomer stock giving you a 4 87 dividend The one that if you somehow baghold can give you 10 15 cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you The 10 15 backboard cash that can fund all your yolo s That s the fucking stock you hesitate on El LMAO The companies margins will expand hard in a few months and it s still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks you re a dumb ape but yeah I m fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled or to a GUH No in between The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener Matt Daddy and I and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder as they skull fucked UWMC s share price They re going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox Fuck em I want me tendies well cooked a side of fries and a foot massage And their going to give it to me And to all of you who bought and are buying UWMC This is not financial

Never Tell Me The Odds It s Tendies or Guh on my options people , Hey Guys it s me again I think you guys may remember me after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations in anticipation of it s breakout moment You might even remember my YOLO and remembered I continuously added to it And that I eventually upped my margin to 13 5k on it Well I m here to tell you that I m not out I bought more calls to average down on earnings day and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop My only regret is that I didn t buy more then Though I threw a bit more cash into shares Back then I said the Theta Beta s would regret selling those calls and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn t be IV Crush I was right Their probably a little sour Sorry chaps you usually are the one s making money at our expense This time it s going to have to be the other way around Today I had the chance to exit my options for a 47 profit roughly Sell calls for a chunky profit after that I said no You know why Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6 26 dollars that s why The Fear the Uncertainty and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm So fuck them We re playing Pac Man people The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure We re buying up the stock to get the price to 9 10 because people bought options for 5 10 cents and they ll be in the money quite easily And because of the rising volume every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B The delta on the options is low and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge So no I won t sell my options for a 10 or a 50 profit I m going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me And so should you I understand people have taken profits but honestly at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn t worth the squeeze Good for them though Next time could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao And for those people on the fucking fence You jumped onto MVIS you jumped into GME and AMC and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence The fucking Eyy Lmaooo Boomer stock giving you a 4 87 dividend The one that if you somehow baghold can give you 10 15 cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you The 10 15 backboard cash that can fund all your yolo s That s the fucking stock you hesitate on El LMAO The companies margins will expand hard in a few months and it s still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks you re a dumb ape but yeah I m fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled or to a GUH No in between The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener Matt Daddy and I and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder as they skull fucked UWMC s share price They re going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox Fuck em I want me tendies well cooked a side of fries and a foot massage And their going to give it to me And to all of you who bought and are buying UWMC This is not financial advice this is a layup But seriously i m not a financial advisor and you do you
