1,kuqyaw,t2_5kwtdegi,1610324728,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuqyaw/time_to_sell_teslatesla_march_2021_convertible/,5,Time to Sell Tesla Tesla March 2021 CONVERTIBLE Senior Notes Due Add 30B shares to the markets,These days its all about Tesla to MARs but time to be careful With Tesla trading at 880 take your profits before a correction TLDR of the below Sell Tesla or and buy puts Lot of new shares liquidity of shares coming on to the market amp x200B Whats happening 1 2B of debt was issued in 2013 in relation to the 2021 convertibles Each at a face value of 1 000Therefore there are 1 2M NotesEach note can be converted by the unit holder to 13 8940 shares of Tesla Total shares 16 6728M shares At the closing price of 880 thats 14 672B in added liquidity these are non restricted shares that can be sold right away and therefore can encourage shorting by the holders Tesla also issued warrants for the amount of 19 2M additional shares These however are not dilutive as they entered into essentially an options contract to purchase those shares at the effective conversion price for the notes But these are still shares that were previously being held and will not be on the open markets The 19 2M additional shares are currently shares likely held by a hedge fund against the options contract written to Tesla This means that those 19 2M shares are essentially being added to the open markets upon exercise of the warrants Adding an additional 17B in liquidity Total 35 9M shares to be added to the open market or approximately 31 7B worth The equity dilution will be limited to about 15B but a total of 31 7B more shares will be available on open markets Note this is 6x each of the previous offerings still and could add significant downside pressure to the stock Add the above to natural profit taking at record highs well I would expect a big correction amp x200B Expecting lt 600 by March amp x200B From the Financials 2021 Notes 2022 Notes and 2024 NotesDuring the first quarter of 2020 we classified the carrying value of our 2021 Notes as current liabilities as the maturity date of the 2021 Notes is March 2021 During each of the quarters of 2020 through September 30 2020 the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130 of the applicable conversion price of each of our 2021 Notes 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter causing the 2021 Notes 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 As the settlement of conversion of the 2021 Notes would be in cash for the principal amount and if applicable cash and or shares of our common stock for any conversion premium at our election we reclassified 26 million representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our 2021 Notes and the carrying value as of September 30 2020 as mezzanine equity from permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30 2020 As we now expect to settle a portion of the 2022 and 2024 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2020 we reclassified 249 million and 32 million respectively of the carrying value of the 2022 and 2024 Notes from debt and finance leases net of current portion to current portion of debt and finance leases on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30 2020 Additionally we reclassified 13 million and 9 million respectively representing the difference between the current portion of aggregate principal of our 2022 and 2024 Notes and the current portion of the carrying value as of September 30 2020 as mezzanine equity from permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30 2020 As the settlement of conversion of the remainder of the 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes would be in cash shares of our common stock or a combination thereof is at our election the liability is classified as non current Should the closing price conditions be met in a future quarter for any of these notes such notes will be convertible at their holders option during the immediately following quarter The debt discounts recorded on the 2021 Notes the 2022 Notes and the 2024 Notes is recognized as interest expense through the respective maturity dates of each note and early conversions can result in the acceleration of such recognition As adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split each 1 000 of principal of the 2021 Notes 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes is now convertible into 13 8940 shares 15 2670 shares and 16 1380 shares respectively of our common stock which is equivalent to conversion prices of approximately 71 97 65 50 and 61 97 per share respectively Under the note hedge transactions we entered in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes we have the option to purchase 19 2 million shares 14 9 million shares and 29 7 million shares respectively for the 2021 Notes 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes at prices of approximately 71 97 65 50 and 61 97 per share respectively as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split Additionally in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 19 2 million shares 14 9 million shares and 29 7 million shares respectively for the 2021 Notes 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes at prices of approximately 112 13 131 00 and 121 50 per share respectively as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split Taken together the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2021 Notes 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from approximately 71 97 65 50 and 61 97 per share respectively to approximately 112 13 131 00 and 121 50 per share respectively amp x200B Transactions relating to our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock The conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes issued by us or our subsidiaries would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes by their holders and we may be required to deliver a significant number of shares Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect their prevailing market prices In addition the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions or the anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock Moreover in connection with certain of the convertible senior notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution and or offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable notes We also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties which could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates In addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may enter into various transactions with respect to their hedge positions which could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the convertible senior notes

stuff but there is a whole other dimension to the automobile industry other than cars that HAS NOT been electrified yet and that Lion Electric has a first strike advantage on just like NIO and TSLA the utility and transportation industry Let me preface by saying that Lion Electric https thelionelectric com en has been working on their vehicles battery technology and charging grids since 2010 and ALREADY HAS VEHICLES ON THE ROAD So no they are not some shambolic ponzi scheme of an EV company looking at you NKLA In fact it literally has the largest fleet of EV school buses https www prnewswire

why the fuck haven t you heard about this Lion Electric company Simple it s a Canadian based company located in Quebec No company outside of Murica or China can be of interest right Right Well the EV

News silently broke last week that Amazon has come to an agreement to purchase up to 500 of Lions class 6 and class 8 delivery trucks per year from 2021 2025 or up to 2500 over 5 years Emphasis on silently because this company unlike many EV rivals lets their results do the talking rather than a dishonest PR team Oh yeah I forgot to mention the possibility of Amazon purchasing at least 2500

Lion to Tesla in the process Unfortunately he said all of this in French which I m sure none of you idiots understand But once he regurgitates this shit in English on Wednesday the significant deal with Amazon and similarities to Tesla as an infant will send this shit to the moon and beyond Why pick Lion Electric over all the other trendy EV stocks Lion is more than just prototypes ideas and false hopes There are currently 7 different trucks and buses AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE They ALREADY have 300 vehicles on the road with over 6mil miles between them Multi year deal agreement for Amazon to

PSTH shot up late Friday To be clear this twit knows nothing and the only announcement that actually matters will come with an SEC 8 K filing The stock price is primed for the current AH price level but not because of rumors Let s talk valuation Valuing PSTH Intrinsic Value Unlike almost every other SPAC PSTH has two components to its intrinsic valuation Net Asset Value Tontine Warrants amp x200B Net Asset Value PSTH is holding just short of 20 per share in short term US treasuries That s as good as cash and given where US treasury rates are and the fact that PSTH holders can redeem shares for cash in about a year and a half if things go south this stock will never ever drop much below NAV before a merger announcement Tontine Warrants Every shareholder of PSTH will be granted at least 2 9 warrant per share shortly after the merger completes Go read the S 1 if you want details but this effectively adds another 2 in intrinsic value of the stock if the warrants are valued at 9 they closed Friday at 10 99 This creates an additional floor price for the valuation of the SPAC amp x200B Valuing PSTH Extrinsic Value PSTH like every other SPAC has some extrinsic value built into its price that comes from an option like premium in anticipation of its merger announcement There are several attributes of PSTH that are unique and justify more premium than comparable SPACs PSTH has options PSTH has a premium Shareholder Roster PSTH has an announcement date range amp x200B PSTH has options There are dozens of pre merger SPACs out there but only a select few have option trading enabled on them I hold positions on all of them for good reason I don t know the CBOE s selection criteria for pre merger options but it seems to be associated with well known and or proven SPAC sponsor management teams Many SPACs will get options after merger announcement but before merger Very few get them pre merger PSTH was one of the first to have this Option trading provides greater trading volume and therefore liquidity on the ticker itself which is worth some additional premium Here s the full list of pre merger SPACs currently trading options amp x200B Ticker Price at 1 8 Close Comments PSTH 29 32 This is the bulk of my account right now I will be shifting my gains into the other tickers below at the end of March IPOF 14 00 A 10 NAV SPAC that shot up this week because an affiliated SPAC IPOE announced a merger with SOFI The option like premium is appropriately adjusted for the consistent track record of the sponsors I m holding 200x short 12 5p 2 19 s here QELL 12 66 A 10 NAV SPAC that I think is trading in a normal range given the management team Still a great value here I m holding 300x short 12 5p 2 19 s here VGAC 11 80 A 10 NAV SPAC that is significantly undervalued IMO given who is behind it and its prospects for targets I m holding 500x short 12 5p 2 19 s here RBAC 10 78 A 10 NAV SPAC led by the Moneyball guy looking to acquire something in the sports space There is no better time to buy a sports team or venue at a depressed price than during COVID I think this is massively undervalued and should be trading closer to the 12 50 13 50 pre announcement which is why I m holding 1 550x calls here amp x200B PSTH has a premium Shareholder Roster Companies looking to go public know that they can command a better multiple over time on their stock if they can get some high visibility investors This is why they often knowingly choose to get raped in fees including hidden fees on investment bank driven IPOs The beauty of SPACs for companies going public is that you can avoid those fees avoid some IPO liability issues and get a guaranteed amount of cash at a set valuation The downside of SPACs is the warrant coverage for which PSTH is currently below market this helps PSTH get a better valuation from a target and a traditionally weak investor roster This is one of the biggest reasons why PSTH will get a great valuation from a target it s roster of investors is literally the who s who of the investment world It will be able to beat out any other comparable SPAC on this alone Bill Ackman is keenly aware of this and made it a core component of his SPAC s strategy From the last Pershing Square call on 11 19 And you can now see a 13 F list of our investors You can form your own view on the ones that have to file 13 Fs but there are many extraordinary investors that don t file 13 apps including sovereign wealth funds that own less than 5 of PSTH and the large number in the dozens of family offices globally kind of billionaire family offices that have that bought stakes in the IPO and we think this shareholder list will be and is actually will be an asset for us in finding a potential target amp x200B PSTH has an announcement date range Unlike most other SPACs Bill Ackman has given us reassurance of the expected timeframe for a merger and merger announcement From the last Pershing Square call again In terms of timing what we said at the time of the IPO is we said it would take us we thought about six months to identify a target that we would be in a position to hopefully announce a deal by sometime in Q1 and then close the transaction in the ordinary course thereafter Nothing that we have experienced to date suggests that we won t meet our expected timeframe This information was provided on a call on November 19th Investors like Bill Ackman don t say things like this trivially We have an extremely high probability of an announcement in Q1 If you look at the comparable SPACs above the better pre merger SPACs that trade options it wouldn t be unreasonable for the IV of the option like premium built into the stock price in anticipation of an announcement to cause any one of those 10 NAV SPACs to trade at 15 per share if we knew an announcement is coming in Q1 So PSTH a 20 NAV SPAC with an additional 2 in warrant value should be trading at at least 30 as we have reasonable assurance that an announcement is coming before the end of March I ve made my plays accordingly amp x200B Positions https preview redd it evjwwjoefma61 png width 1242 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

because it doesn t matter for this thesis to work Bill Ackman truly has structured the most target friendly and investor friendly SPAC to date Regardless of the target this is going to help him get a better valuation as he has already built a better investor roster Hype aside he will be getting a better valuation

TSLA Okay I need you guys to listen and listen good because I am going to go over a lot of already known public information about TSLA that somehow the gummy bears here keep forgetting or just are not accounting for TSLA is more than a car business it s more than a solar power company and it s more than a tech company TSLA has the absolute best long term solution for solar power roofing on the market right now when factoring in maintenance costs power bill savings and all installation Clean energy over the next few years is going to in general because of the movements the USA will make in order to promote clean energy as a country and the world as a whole will follow This means that there will be lots of new properties being built with solar panels and there will be lots of people who are doing roof repairs swapping to solar panels TSLA already has factories in multiple countries and has the infrastructure to quickly scale up to meet demand which we have seen back with their model 3 production ramp up and now with their massive funding they should be able to do so much more effectively this time than the last TSLA will make a lot of money this year next year and onward off of their solar panels alone and they will likely sell very well with the 25 year TSLA warranty in conseration Solar market recap summary TSLA has the best solution competitive pricing for premium roofing and long term performance because of the 25 year warranty TSLA has factories in most of the world already and is able to scale up really fast in order to meet rapid demand as the demonstrated with the model 3 Now that s just the beginning FSD will have a massive impact when they achieve it because they will no longer be taking market share just from the car industry but also from uber lyft grubhub etc Elon has said before that they want to eventually have enough cars in production to roll out FSD taxi s They said initially they will leave the steering wheel for user override with the intention of eventually having enough of the roads being self driving cars and the software being mature enough to remove the steering wheel we ll see about it I m not one to go against papa Elon but I don t know if people would be okay with that in the next 5 years Elon also said in the same conference that he wants to allow existing Tesla owners to be able to lend their cars back to Tesla to let them be a part of the FSD taxi service with all profits going to the owner of the car instead of Tesla which will give them a faster ramp up time in every area because Teslas are popular enough and the need for extra income is always there like you retards know So to summarize all of this Tesla isn t a car company or a solar company or whatever kind you can think of because Tesla is really just something we haven t seen before and it will continue to grow and amaze us in how much of the world they will be able to profit off of This is also why we don t need to worry so much about Tesla competitors in this sense because they are so far ahead of the curve that they aren t playing in a fair fight Tesla is done with cars papa Elon wants to get to a point where nobody owns a car and everyone uses the Tesla Express This will cripple the insurance business for individual car insurance since only people who own cars will need it This post is getting long and so I won t get into all the other upsides of their batteries and charging stations but I will say that the upside is just as massive Granted at a certain point papa Elon said this robo taxi would be ready in 2020 I would expect it to be ready numbers wise 2022 2023 and infrastructure and regulation hurdles in production 2024 2025 I am not saying that TSLA will be uphill constantly on this trip and that there is not a bubble but what I am saying is that all of those things accounted for the entire upside of the company in terms of it s impact to the world and how much the world will eventually rely on it the price is far under where it will be and this will be competing in the same scale as Amazon within no time relatively speaking TLDR TSLA has massive unaccounted for potential on their robo taxi and solar roofing future and even if we are in a bubble TSLA will eventually be a name everyone knows by name because they own or use one of their products TSLA amp x200B I will get better at writing these I need my IQ to drop a bit more from WSB before I can get some real quality out Thanks guys Sources https twitter com elonmusk status 1249210220200550405 ref src twsrc 5Etfw 7Ctwcamp 5Etweetembed 7Ctwterm 5E1249210220200550405

01 11 , Stocks finish at all time highs to close out the first trading week of 2021 What is my opinion on the NIO stock after their latest event DraftKings amp PENN soar after the latest New York developments let s talk about this and other stock market news Very Long Post Hello everyone and Good Morning So let s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the Nasdaq Composite https ibb co zr3x08Q leading the way up over 1 and finished the week 2 4 up the broad stock market SP500 https ibb co 9ghJQfk also gaining more than half a percent on Friday and 1 8 for the week while the Dow Jones https ibb co w4Xrnvk rose by 56 points and finished 1 6 higher in the first week of 2021 with all 3 big indexes finishing at new all time highs We also saw the VIX https ibb co vdYffjm dropping below 22 again despite a mid day spike as the volatility index dropped more than 23 since the high on Tuesday https ibb co C8xQvsN We saw an average DAY https ibb co VTPKM80 of trading to close out the week with average volume and an almost equal number of companies that were advancing compared to the declining ones as 7 of the 11 SECTORS https ibb co gDFHxLf finished in the green with consumer Discretionary amp Real Estate Leading the way while the more value heavy industries lagged For the week though Energy outperformed rising by more than 9 Technology finished flat despite a very bad start to the week after the Georgia election and Real Estate lagged behind losing 2 5 for the week as we saw Large Cap growth companies outperform on Friday https ibb co b24dvCn but in this fresh 2021 small amp mid caps have outperformed Here is the HEAT MAP https ibb co G0YW732 from Friday with big gainers coming mostly in the consumer cyclicals with Tesla Alibaba amp MercadoLibre posting big gains while the biggest losers were in the gold industry In THIS https ibb co MBH11mV short year though we can see the huge outperformance of the Energy Sector the Banks and some other names like Tesla amp TSM We also got some economic data with the latest Redfin report showing a 13 increase in home sale PRICES https ibb co HV9CqQg over 2020 as ACTIVE https ibb co 5nwRLMB listings of homes for sales keeps on dropping The listings have seen a 32 decrease since last year to a new all time low though the average sale to list PRICE https ibb co vcX1Jpw ratio finally declined to 99 3 as the housing market was red hot since June While December nonfarm payroll declined https ibb co GT72GvR by 140K worse than then 75k gains expected and is the first month since April that brings jobs losses with most of the JOBS https ibb co hKwgGqN losses coming from the leisure and hospitality business which has been hit hard again losing almost half a million jobs while the unemployment rate did inch lower to 6 7 So this week pretty much starts of the EARNINGS https ibb co 7GPMmkJ season again with the most interesting ones for me being Aphria as a read on the cannabis sector Delta Airlines for a read on how the Airlines are recovering and JP Morgan on Friday while on the economic front we will see a lot of interesting DATA https ibb co X5FVfBB mostly starting on Wednesday with the Consumer price index and the Federal Budget while we continue these with the jobless claims on Thursday and more numbers about the economy on Friday This week we will also have some IPOs https ibb co HKJXY8K with the most interesting coming from Affirm Holdings while I really expect to see what Biden SAYS https ibb co rpTRtKN on Thursday as this may be key to a further stimulus or fiscal package So NIO DAY https ibb co MBB053y came and left me with rather somewhat of a disappointment though I don t expect most investors to really look at this so they will probably jump on the stock again this week so here is a quick recap of what they announced and what is my opinion on NIO They announced the first flagship sedan mode the ET7 which will be AVAILABLE https ibb co 0jkgfTm in 2 trim levels with 70 or 100KW battery starting from around 70K and 78K but the good thing about NIO and their main competitive advantage is the battery as a service So they will make this new sedan available for the same price with either battery pack if you do use the BAAS model at a price of 58K They also announced the next gen battery swap stations that can do over 300swaps day more than 3x the capability of the current one as they also plan to build another 400 stations that would bring them to a total of almost 600 by the end of the year The new battery technology that they announced was the actual thing that disappointed me So they announced a 150KW battery with a claimed range of over 600miles but that should be in perfect conditions so expect the actual range to be somewhere in 400mile range pretty much in line with Tesla s current capabilities The Launch DATE https ibb co 9WK8dJW for the car is still only Q1 2022 while for the New Solid State battery the timeline is for it to be available by the end of 2022 So the bad thing is that everything is still at least 1 year away and we have to see if the claimed range for the new battery is real And there are a couple of big warning signs here with the new battery technology they actually avoided saying they designed created or engineered this new tech battery by saying they will ADOPT https ibb co dDDpkm5 this new technology So it seems they will adopt this new technology from their current battery supplier CATL This is an issue as this battery will be available to other manufacturers like Hyundai Mercedes BMW will get their hands on so this will not actually be something innovative ground breaking or a proprietary solution Also I don t know how big this new Sedan thing is because the Sedan market is really dying around the world This new ET7 isn t competition for TESLA 3 it s targeted for competition against the model S which is already a dying segment as you can see from Tesla s SALES https ibb co smr7vNN But on some more positive news they did announce something better in my opinion with their Self Driving Feature INCLUDING https ibb co ss65yw6 11 8megapixel cameras as their collaboration with Nvidia https ibb co C5bNBGK will produce a super computer that will generate up to 8Gigabyte s of data with the Nvidia CORE estimated to be 7x better than Tesla s current computer Though THIS https ibb co M61cLRm doesn t have an official release date and will probably come with the ET7 next year so another disappointment as this comp against Tesla will not be a huge advantage once Tesla does upgrade their computers as well So for short the main competitive advantages that NIO https ibb co 3c5Q80j has right now are that they use the subscription model for both the battery swap technology and for the full self driving feature which costs around 100 month This is are very good and smart recurring revenue streams as they make the entry price for the car much lower and also provide a stable flow of revenues But I am disappointed in the new battery technology and have to wait for more developments If this is a common technology that will be used by other car manufacturers this is effectively not that big of a deal but if somehow this is their own technology that would possibly have better implications for the company So guys I own both Tesla amp NIO and I think I might hold off right now on buying any more due to different factors I think that Tesla has a good future but this huge run up has made it a good target for 10 20 correction at any point in the short term future while for NIO I expect this to rise in the next couple of days and I am waiting for it to cool off a little before adding any more to my position So yeah short term I think both of them have some downside risk but in the long run I expect Tesla to trade at over 1000 and NIO to trade over 100 In some other stock market NEWS https ibb co zJwMGgq we saw gambling stocks like DraftKings and PENN rising on Friday after New York filed bills to legalize online betting in the state DraftKings https ibb co N2sDnH6 also just announced they will bring new stuff like drone racing betting which is mind blowing that they are extending into such things This is a continuing trend in the US and should be watched for future developments as gambling will be legalized pretty much all over the US in the near future I believe and I also expect this sector to be joined by the pot SECTOR https ibb co Sf97NmW even if it s really hard to believe there will be a nationwide bill to legalize it I expect there will be some improvements for the sector and companies like Aphria which are closer to profitability should benefit from this On some more sad new we also saw a 27 year old Boeing plane crash https ibb co dg9yW5j in Indonesia this is very sad news but as the stock market goes this issue seems to be unrelated to Boeing https ibb co bJwt3Lt right now Indonesia has seen the most deaths in the past decades with over 104 accidents as this country is known for bad maintenance pilot training and air traffic controls problems And don t forget as I said in my earlier posts don t jump on these high flying small cap stocks at all time highs this is a very good moment for this companies to raise cheap capital by issuing shares with the latest example being BLNK https ibb co pbG62F6 So let s hope for a good day in the markets and the US FUTURES https ibb co f9RV9NM are pointing to a bad open right now with all 3 big index futures down as the DOW futures are down over 200 points Thank you everyone for reading

phones the ones that were nearly indestructible right I have been watching Nokia off and on since March of last year trying to find a decent entry point This is an update to my original idea post here a few days ago linked below Due to Nokia s prior reputation I have for nearly a year had a very strong hunch that it is soon to have a major break upwards On Robinhood there is a 7 call leap contract that expires 1 21 2022 It is currently trading for 16 cents Around the end of October the leap contract hit a low of 12 cents then had a fairly impressive rebound to higher than 21 cents Currently I am holding the largest position I have ever had in stocks Specifically on Nokia after I saw that it bottomed yet again at 12 cents A lot of people would say going all in on one position is not smart but I m not a person that can pay attention to too many things assets at once Plus the feeling I have about this stock is next to unbreakable no matter what it does in the short term Fundamentals aside this is a chart analysis of why I believe Nokia is not just a sleeping giant but possibly the sleeping giant amp x200B q https preview redd it 2bbejdtojqa61 png width 1930 amp format png amp

the weeks of April 19th 2010 and April 26th 2010 Since then Nokia has failed to break above it for any significant amount of time until the week of May 22nd 2017 Unfortunately Nokia was unable to hold mid term support and on the week of October 23rd 2017 had a significant 20 drop Nokia has battled with breaking and staying above this trend line since then with every break below causing significant selling pressure Interestingly Nokia has an earnings report coming up on February 4th 2021 Almost 20 years to the day that this trend began I believe Nokia is fairly close to breaking above this trend

I check the RSI I immediately notice multiple trends The first one being Nokia significantly rejecting any value above 60 From the week of January 21st 2014 to April 17th 2017 Nokia did not stay above 60 RSI Even the April 2017 break above was short lived Also notice that break above 60 RSI was likely caused by Nokia testing support at first the 618 Fib then the 50 Fib It then proceeded to have a longer term triple top in price at the 6 4 resistance while the RSI was printing noticeably lower highs The failure in 2019 to break above this resistance then began another major downtrend amp x200B

cross here after being rejected on the first attempt Another key thing to note on this time frame in the MACD is the histogram which appears to be showing sell momentum waning Nokia attempted a

patterns signals presenting themselves After Nokia dropped from the 5 Fib retracement the price has been printing a potential bear flag Nokia did however catch strong buying support on the 0 886 Fib which is typically the absolute last stand for bulls to regain control That Fib also coincided with the Covid market wide selloff in March of 2020 After Nokia broke back above the 20 year trend line it was also able to break a mid term diagonal resistance This resistance has been tested successfully for sure once although most people would argue the gap was also potentially indicative of a successful support test Within this bear flag however there are 3 different price structures indicating potential bullish pressure building I do not hold much weight with price patterns anymore

I have outlined in this idea is strongly bias to the bullish side The fundamentals for Nokia are currently very neutral There is a new CEO who previously worked for Sony Ericsson who has outlined a new roadmap for the company as a whole They have positive cash flow and a low debt to asset ratio They did however have a drop in overall revenue Also the outstanding amount of shares for Nokia is very high Due to this a lot of traders believe it would take a seriously large catalyst for Nokia to break its current downtrend range I may be early on this trade but I do believe that within the next 6 months Nokia could make a serious turnaround amp x200B At this point I believe that anything below current share price is a strong buy The leap contracts for Nokia are also dirt cheap Time will

C F II merging with View Inc a sleeping giant for close to 2 months Many people do not realise this company is riding on the green energy wave which has rallied significantly over the past weeks Now here s a deep dive into this company detailed DD but if you are lazy to read the research I don t blame you just head to the potential plays at the bottom Since merger was announced on 30 Nov 2020 and now that we are in Q1 of 2021 and approaching the merger date in roughly 2 months time the share price has been steadily advancing I think that the current share price of 12 6 still presents a rather good risk return profile in the short term to enter mainly riding on the green energy wave I have presented 2 plays for this at the bottom of this DD Most have downplayed this company due to its high valuation of 1 6B for just being a window company non EV especially in a period where commercial real estate is taking a hit due to the pandemic But I think precisely this is a good time to invest for the long term before the next boom We might also have overlooked certain secular trends in motion that can provide some serious tailwind for this company Now taking a deep dive into the company The Product gt View is the market leader in next generation smart windows that use artificial intelligence and machine learning which will tint the glass to optimize natural light while controlling heat and glare effectively eliminating the need for blinds shades in the room The smart glass enhances mental and physical well being for occupants creating smart connected buildings which reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas GHG emissions Basically they are the next era windows maker for smart buildings Think of your standard run of the mill window glass panes If you live in a tropical climate or countries with high sunlight hours you would know that having a window seat in the noon is extremely uncomfortable and glaring Even if the the blinds shades were drawn down the air conditioning will still have to work extra hard to maintain the same room temp By doing so the building s energy consumption is higher higher green house emission AI enabled Window Glass Tinting Tracking Sun s trajectory https preview redd it t7oy4nncrqa61 png width 672 amp format png amp auto webp amp s cfc229aaa0f6adb9e7570cb39b7f0eeda8d2c62c What if you had a smart dynamic glass installed which will automatically tint the windows by tracking the Sun s trajectory Aside from the glare protection from the tinting the temperature in the room is also effectively maintained by blocking out solar heat so the HVAC does not have to work overtime What if this glass panel can also act as a transparent HD display for a suite of immersive work experiences The building window glass market is huge having a 120 billion TAM in North America alone and 1 2 trillion TAM in global glass consumption Smart buildings are perhaps the key to the future of urban planning due to the push for green innovation in smart cities that has gained momentum and will continue to do so under Biden s administration E S G Green Wave Biden administration clean energy plan to tackle climate change resulted in the rally of green energy stocks recently Tailwind can be expected from the green wave for View Inc since their dynamic glass will help buildings attain LEED certification to become more energy efficient with the growing requirements from regulators in US and rising importance of E S G globally View Inc can help buildings reduce overall energy consumption and green house emission through 20 reduction in HVAC amp lighting consumption with 10 overall peak energy reduction Analysis of Product 1 Suite of Services They are not just a smart windows maker but essentially a tech play as well They have launched their suite of services in 2020 to complement the Smart Glass comprising 1 View Net Provides bandwidth power and data network that is the backbone to an intelligent building platform 2 View Immersive Experience Transparent see through HD display on the window that is fully interactive with touchscreen capabilities 3 View Sense Modules that provide the ability to measure and optimise light humidity temperature air quality that cater to the well being of occupants inside the building Transparent HD Display with 5G Network https preview redd it 6j7ts22erqa61 png width 1256 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 954bb8d49c7d1df39a9739f05f4c2211d05bdf39 What I like about the product is that its very modular and customisable For the basic package you can just have the dynamic smart glass installed with just the tinting capabilities However the infrastructure for other capabilities is already installed after the initial set up which customers can choose to add on different modules e g sensors displays and customise it based on their needs This effectively sets up for repeat businesses 2 Longevity You may be wondering about the longevity of their smart windows since functionality will never be given due consideration if the product is shitty and fails to withstand the weather time pressure If the smart windows are treated like consumables with the need to replace maintain every few years it will never be scalable You may hear it from the CEO himself on how their team initially conceptualise the product and build it around a fundamental principle in mind longevity Therefore the lifespan is similar to standard window glass with over 40 50 years of lifespan Video https www youtube com watch v 9MaF21GtUcg amp ab channel GreenBiz https www youtube com watch v 9MaF21GtUcg amp ab channel GreenBiz watch from 12 30 onwards 3 Durability Another point about why View Inc glass is more durable than than other dynamic smart windows is because they are using an inorganic ceramic material as the nano coating layer instead of organic material which is the current industry norm Even though organic material is cheaper to engineer resulting in a cheaper product for their end clients but the coating will be degraded by the heat from the sun which will make it less durable over time 4 Market share Currently they are leading the market with over 80 market share In terms of economic moat they have over 1k patents 600 currently 300 filed This is a proprietary tech and after 12 years of R amp D I think that they will be able to fairly sustain a huge competitive advantage over many other competitors and effectively creating a high barrier to entry for new entrants due to the sheer amount of patents they possess 5 Pricing amp Revenue Current revenue as of 2020 stands at around 31m with over 560m in backlog orders LOI signed Although their dynamic window glasses cost upward of 50 more than standard window glasses I think it s a highly differentiated product in which building owners can eventually charge a premium on rental leases resulting in higher leasing revenues for them One success case story is Civica Cherry Creek an office building in Denver has managed to achieve the highest weighted average rental rates out of any office buildings in Denver city after switching to View s glass Of course I anticipate a huge inertia in the beginning where the mass market will put up resistance to adopt this product However overtime combining the economies of scale in their factories to bring down production costs higher gross margins and rising demand globally arising from a proven track record I can foresee exponential growth for this company in the long term They are expecting revenue growths to be around 127 CAGR over the next 5 years which I personally think it s possible but the exponential growth will not happen till 2023 onwards since they need the initial two years for market entry into more markets sectors 6 Investors Early prominent VC funding include Corning and Softbank However I wish to point out that in recent SEC filings GIC Investment Singapore state owned sovereign fund owned by the Government of Singapore initiated a 10 stake of 50 million in C F II last week and an additional 200 million PIPE investment today Let me tell you why I m so bullish about this Singapore is a highly developed and urbanised country located in South east Asia with a myriad of high rise buildings skyscrapers tropical climate with plenty of sun activity all year round Although N A market is huge but usually buildings in states with most sunlight activity e g California Arizona will constitute the main bulk of customers Let s imagine if the product is able to break into the Asia market or even into South east Asia with tropical climate zones the revenues would be insane GIC obviously conducted their DD as they won t screw around with state owned money They know the growth potential of this proprietary tech once this hits the market big time and perhaps even a business arrangement to bring this product into Singapore Other players will likely not stand a chance with the exception of China 7 Ability to scale Current projects are only in the commercial space which has taken a huge hit due to the pandemic With the ongoing trend in WFH the residential market is essentially a cash cow for milking especially against the backdrop of demand for healthy home working environment In light of this the CEO said in an interview that he has already completed 50 residential projects this wasn t published as it s still in the works and he is developing a product for residential market this year to target contemporary homes LINK https lookingbeyondwithmichaelsikand fireside fm view https lookingbeyondwithmichaelsikand fireside fm view from 10 45 onwards The convergence of WFH trend and smart homes will definitely be a huge play even more so than commercial Does it reminds you of Netflix s Black Mirror Transparent displays are certainly a sight to behold Touchscreen Capabilities https preview redd it 8hpryx7frqa61 png width 1240 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 14ba9afda332f5311a24744efd9376d8d5291043 Given the ubiquitous applications with glass possibilities are not limited to just smart buildings In fact one really strong partnership with great potential would be to license the proprietary tech to EV car makers Incredible synergy can be found in the future of electric vehicle glass display where car window panels can function as a smart display with vehicle integration auto tinting capabilities In fact the entire transportation industry could be disrupted by this tech think of your Buses Rails Subway Cruises and how smart glass display could reinvent the future of Advertisements in commercial transportation and how fast would they jump on this bandwagon if they are able to monetise this new piece of glass Other uses across different sectors include the hospitality industry airports hotels resorts and healthcare sector like hospital wards windows FYI they have piloted their product in 3 different US airports namely SFO Dallas Fort Worth and Boston airports After retrofitting their Smart Glass in the airports results were rather stellar with an actual increase in concessionary sales energy cost savings as well as longer dwell time in such areas Case study for DFO airport https view com sites default files documents dfw airport dynamic glass pilot research study 0 pdf https view com sites default files documents dfw airport dynamic glass pilot research study 0 pdf Bear Case Downsides Glassdoor rating of company seems poor with management woes at the executive level and there were reports of View Inc laying off their staff sometime in April 2020 I think that internal turmoil would be detrimental and could impede their growth in the future Current earnings of 31m in 2020 does not really justify the valuation of 1 6b much speculation is on future growth potential They have a current minimum order of 1M which will not sit well with smaller commercial buildings or residential market This will result in them losing market share gradually to their smaller competitors who can cater to such clientele The biggest risk to their Intellectual Property is that it is not universal i e it does not have an international protection Patents are territory rights so even though their tech is protected in US I expect proliferation of copy cats in other countries like coughs China They may register for IP in China as well but let s face it its not exactly fool proof and Chinese companies operate differently in China Although there will be imitations but I believe that View s level of R amp D is extremely strong after 12 years in operation Other copy cat Smart Glass companies would unlikely be able to achieve the same level of product as View thus ensuring levels of product differentiation The Play With the merger expected to complete by Q1 of 2021 2 months time I expect C F II to pop closer to merger date during March perhaps in the 15 16 range But once it reaches ATH right before merger it will probably be a good time to sell as once post merger happens and downside cap is removed it will most likely fall below 10 or even lower as the industry is very CAPEX intensive In addition I think that the commercial space is likely to remain sluggish in the near term which will push the price further down It will also likely burn more cash in the process since you have to bear in mind that any new futuristic tech adoption is an extremely long and arduous process Revolutionary tech like iPhones Tesla did not pick up from the get go after it was introduced to the market and it took several years before they saw some real results This is probably a good time to accumulate your positions while its being massively hated on and believe in the conviction that 1 they are the market leader with a wide economic moat gt 1k patents and ability to scale up while bringing down costs 2 secular E S G trend with Biden s green plan will provide good tailwind for the sector at least for the next 4 years in which their policies will likely benefit the industry 3 multiple uses applications are HUGE with amazing potential for licensing partnership plays in EV hospitality healthcare sectors I have strong conviction in the long term that it is going to be a multi bagger if you keep accumulating the dips post merger TLDR In short buy now for the pre merger pop and sell right before merger Following a post merger sell off accumulate on the dip and ride on for the long term in the next few years Positions Warrants 2 4 Link to investor presentation https view com sites default files

lost half its stock price after a single phase 2 study report Let me start off by giving a bit of background on the study that just gave us the sexiest dip of 2021 so far Currently Sarepta Therapeutics is engaged in several different drug and disease group projects with it s main other competitor being Daddy Pfizer Pfizer is currently competing against Sarepta to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy Both companies are developing several drugs to combat this disease which most affects boys around the age 3 and continues to quickly decrease their muscle tone until they are in their teens and presented with a complete loss of ambulation which eventually leads to heart and lung problems and eventually most of those diagnosed die within their 20 s to early 30 s Currently Sarepta is working in 3 main areas of pharmacology Gene Editing Gene Therapy and RNA Tech This study concerned Gene Therapy where a healthy genetic code is inserted into the body and starts producing whatever the subject s previously flawed genetic code wasn t able to produce For Duchenne s it is protein fibers that compose muscle The thing about gene therapy is its a single time medication a one and done Once these kids have a dose their DNA contains the appropriate genetics and can produce the proteins No long term therapies no daily medications just injection and improvement All parts of this paragraph are referring to the genetic therapy treatment called SRP 9001 So in Phase 1 of this study Trial 101 they found that the kids had a high rate of success of protein synthesis after injection and it was maintained years after injection a huge success but that is a highly controlled study without a placebo group and among a small group of kids The study that just dropped last week was Trial 102 Trial 102 was Phase 2 and looking for long term sustainability and safety with a larger group of kids the study did not find enough evidence to prove the therapy was more effective than a placebo however it was rated as safe something which Pfizer has had difficulty with in their treatment more on that later fuck you I m writing a lot and you re gonna read it Bitch The next study Trial 103 which began Fall of 2020 and will be releasing results primary results May 31st 2021 It is a phase 1 trial which means it has stronger controls and is more likely to show a positive result a result which will spike stock prices Trial 103 will be looking to establish efficacy and safety of this SRP 9001 something which Trial 101 already established but was contradicted by Trial 102 It is extremely likely Trial 103 will be successful in May They will also be working on dosage and beginning to create their commercial model for production with these tests They already are recruiting for Trials 301 and 303 following the completion of Trial 103 amp x200B As you can see one failed test hasn t slowed down their pipeline of development at all This is new technology and they are working to perfect it It can still be modified and it will be modified But what if something goes wrong with SRP 9001 or Pfizer completely captures the market Currently Sarepta has 43 different drug development programs going on 27 of which involve Gene Therapy In addition they have 2 treatments currently being produced commercially and another 8 therapies in their final phase of study and waiting for rollout Finally they have 14 more treatments that are in the preclinical planning phase amp x200B Sarepta isn t just a purely speculative company they have therapies in every part of their pipeline therapies that are life changing and will make the stock explode with any positive news News which is more than likely coming with the amount of trials they are running and the vast range of therapies they are developing One test dropped this stock 50 a negative test result that didn t have to do with dangers of the drug but difficulty presenting increase in protein synthesis vs the placebo group something that will quickly be rectified and has only been a speed bump in the development cycle 50 stock price drop when there are 7 other therapies in the final phases of study and are looking to release research in the coming months amp x200B Now to discuss the competition quickly Pfizer also has a gene therapy program and it is in phase 3 of study whereas Sarepta was in phase 2 However Sarepta was seen as being ahead in development as they began their placebo trial a whole year before Pfizer Pfizer s placebo trial started just before the new year Pfizer has now caught up in the race but they have had several severe side effects in their therapy and are a whole year behind in their placebo which could show more side effects and might not show strong results against the placebo in the same way Sarepta had difficulty Sarepta is well positioned against Pfizer and at this stock price you are well positioned to take advantage of their hard work amp x200B So you ve gotten this far I m guessing you ll want some positions amp x200B Jan 22nd 105 Call This is purely based on them rebounding from that unnecessary 50 drop May 21 135 Call Pre Trial buildup Price June 18 185 Call Post Trial success Price Jan 21 2022 210 Call EOY amp x200B Buy them stonks bb wishing you all the best and strongest diamond hands whatever you buy as long as it s not puts And wish these kids some big balls for dealing with a disease that is fucking brutal and unyielding Thanks for reading so far and
