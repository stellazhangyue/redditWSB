raked in 55 billion in terms of total revenue generated The F Series generated more revenue than the NFL MLB NBA and the NHL combined Just something to think about On May 19 Ford has unveiled its EV F 150 after Biden had driven it a week prior The EV s features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video It has all the features crucial for it s target buyers Construction workers Farmers Free lance delivery drivers Basically hardworking Blue collar Americans and it s a Truck which actually looks like a Truck Ford knows what pickup owners want IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said More importantly it s an F 150 first an EV second Ford didn t abandon the F 150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years The reservation now have exceeded 120 000 since it s debut An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that about 75 or 90 000 are new to Ford according to the company If anything this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition almost every car manufacturer can make an EV but only a few I can count on one hand can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality Now Ford s EVs are targeting middle class value buyers High quality cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales more on this on 5 The F 150 starts at 32 500 after Federal tax credit Cheaper than any of Potential because they don t exist yet competitors with superior car features It s relevant to mention that Ford s EV sales counting electric vehicles and hybrids increased 177 during June capping off 56 570 units sold so far in 2021 As Ford promised F 150 Lightning will deliver more features and cost less Don t forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year 2 Ford Rivian Partnership Ford Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September It s looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now Ford is 55 64B at 14 18 Ford has initially invested 500 million in Rivian but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with the most recent news being 902 million in Q1 of 2021 On Jul 23 it was announced that Rivian closed a 2 5 billion funding round led by existing investors Ford Amazon and T Prior to it they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U S States started submitting bids on it Farley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market As more companies continue to invest in Rivian Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares but that s not why we invested Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend Farley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV SUV market too with a Lincoln or Explorer Rivian car He understands that the first move is the most important one in the EV Game and with the Mach E and F 150 Ford executed it s moves perfectly Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices high quality while maintaining the demand something which Tesla still isn t able to Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1 3 amp x200B 3 Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands Prior to the release of the Bronco it had 190 000 reservations 66 of the reservations were converted to sales Additionally Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70 of the 125 000 orders it has are customers of other brands According to Ford dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of 15 days with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep People are killing to get their hands on one just go on Ebay and see for yourself Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K I would understand PS5 scalpers but that happening with Cars I never would ve imagined This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it s 2021 Revenue expectation from 3 5 billion to between 9 10 billion and they ll probably raise it again in the next quarter amp x200B 4 Ford s Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy Ford clearly has business and government fleets in mind Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said Ford revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F 150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday Called the Lightning Pro it s equipped with a standard battery that s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs 39 974 which is the base price for retail F 150 Lightnings Ford s vision to lead the EV market has a no brainer component Elon Musk lacks Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery powered trucks and vans Ford s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F 150 They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach 5 Valuation and Price target Yes I m crazy but hear me out It s obvious what argument I m going to bring up next Tesla valuation but it s not only about that and I ll expand more about what I mean to convey Ticker Market Cap TTM Revenue MM TTM EBITDA MM Revenue Multiple Ebitda Multiple Numbers referenced from JeffAmazon outdated TSLA 679 7B 31 54B 4 27B 21 1X 202X NIO 77 35B 12B 7B 7 6X NaN GM 74B 116B 18B 0 7X 4 3X F 47 17B 127 14B 10B 0 3X 4 4X Important part starts here As you can see this is crazy and retarded at the same time Take any of the stocks above and compare it to F it ll always come out undervalued relatively speaking For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations don t lie to yourselves Your business degree doesn t work in this market meta These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations In meme stocks retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks imo yet it s still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them If you are new to WSB TSLA and AMD were among our first great plays in here before GME We used to yolo deep OTM calls on TSLA when the Press mainly CNBC analysts on social media and boomers were all short TSLA When TSLA was 350 presplit people on here were buying 1000 Pre split calls When it reached 1000 pre split some yoloers in here bought 3000 calls We were the original adopters of TSLA and we rose it to what it is today Still not convinced put a side by side chart comparison between TSLA and GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event It s mind boggling At that valuation 110 it won t even be 50 of Tesla s 52 week high valuation It s a highly speculative valuation but I don t see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks Don t even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies Nio XPENG etc metaphorically speaking when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby F Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it s just

Favor,Hey guys it s me again Instead of gloating about how I was right about Homebuilders by making a gloat post I decided to be constructive by writing my greatest work yet Everyone has heard about Corsair and how great its products and growth are but I don t care about the product line when it comes to earnings plays I care about numbers the street cares about numbers and the numbers to note down here are 27 5 29 95 and 35 But we ll get to the why later Earnings plays are not necessarily as esoteric as people think In fact the efficient market hypothesis is such that you can figure out whether a stock will go up or down and even get your own estimate of earnings per share that is or can be relatively accurate to do so The Process Is Simple Identify a fundamentally strong company that has lagged its peers for no reason Vet this in terms of its current price to earnings ratio its analyst future price to earnings ratio relative to its sector or even especially historically Identify whether it has a bright future ahead of itself The reason for this is that the efficient market hypothesis operates under the assumptions that markets are forward looking I identified this with home builders generally and with CCS and M I homes respectively Identify the true earnings per share of the company for the upcoming quarter because with these kinds of companies analysts are usually wrong Don t bullshit yourself with pie in the sky fantasy Go as far out as a year with your estimates or at least FYE That way you can also analyze whether a company will raise guidance or even if the CEO and the executive team are playing the earnings beat game where they intentionally under promise and over deliver 1 Understand that if a company has good earnings but lowers guidance the stock will tank so it s important to note that you need to project future earnings per share for the full year 2 The way you can figure out what the true EPS will be in a company for the quarter and the year Which by the way is the lynchpin of this strategy is a process that takes hours of work That s the price you must pay for a high batting average You need to first read the latest earnings of the company you are investing in This can be done at their investor relations website or by finding their quarterly or annual on EDGAR Follow that up by sitting down and listening to their earnings call or by reading the earnings call transcript to add color 1 Follow that up by looking at sector peers who have reported for the latest quarter where your stock has not yet reported earnings Read their earnings release and delve deeper by looking at their Q s K depending on what time of the year it is Then listen in on their earnings call Don t forget to look at sector peers in foreign markets because they have different disclosure rules For example the Hong Kong Exchange lets has companies issue early warning profit alerts before earnings 2 Have you done your sector research Make sure you have Including sector numbers economic data If they aren t what the market likes question if there s a reason why For example CCS M I home and other home builders haven t been selling homes until they ve been mostly constructed and have been metering or effectively metering their home sales This is because they wanted to get fixed costs before they sell their home as opposed to getting a home pre ordered and having to deal with highly variable prices in commodities In short home builders wanted better visibility on their margins So the new home sales data for this month didn t look great but if you know what s going on you know that it was a head fake 3 Compare the current P E to your company s peers and then compare the future P E Is it woefully undervalued for no good reason I m talking a material impact here Is the projected analyst earnings expectations for the quarter and year just too low Doing this will allow you to make a more accurate projection of your specific company s earnings and forward earnings Even then your expectations can be blown even though they re higher than analysts as occurred to me with home builders I was in What is the market sentiment towards your stock If it s been red the last week month three months Then that means there is a strong negative sentiment But it doesn t need to be red for all three you just must recognize the sentiment If that s the case and you ve paired this with everything else the stock will go up So long as you identify that there will be a beat raise or bullish earnings call or a combination Be mindful of any obstacles such as the bear case If only to do like a persuasive argument where you acknowledge the argument then counter it In certain cases hedge by limiting your downside and protecting a large portion of your upside This can be paired with trimming on a as needed basis when you are up The process will take you a significant portion of time running in the hours This Corsair play took me 5 7 Hours of Research and I m not counting most of my Razer research hours in this It can be tedious but it s the price to pay for a high batting average I m lucky that I love doing this stuff How I Discovered The Play They way that I am going to describe this DD is by weaving the story of how I came to discover this play in bullet point format The story starts a month and a half ago with a Singaporean American company listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange I was incredibly bullish on what Razer s first half earnings would be because I was seeing them buy back their stock in real time every single day Hong Kong has different disclosure rules requiring a next day disclosure if the company did a buyback the previous day with how much shares had been bought how much they had retired and how much they had bought back so far but not retired They also require a monthly issuance of equity I had been seeing them buying their stock back every single day So I knew the first half for Razer would be gangbusters But another disclosure requirement is the inside information profit alert that the exchange requires them to do before earnings Looking through it I noticed a few things https doc irasia com listco hk razer announcement a210714 pdf https doc irasia com listco hk razer announcement a210714 pdf 1 There was higher than expected revenue growth Though I must remember that Q1 is included in the profit alert since the earnings are for H1 and H2 2 The operating margin was higher because of a higher gross margin product mix as well as organic improvement of hardware margins They had spoken of doing it in their investor presentation for their annual report in 2020 It can be found here https investor razer com pdf pre210324 pdf https investor razer com pdf pre210324 pdf Page 47 3 I expect something similar for Corsair where the higher gross margin products are a larger product of their revenue mix 4 There was also continued improvement in operating expenses management which I expect for Corsair as well That s not enough color for me so I move on to Logitech which has reported earnings They beat earnings expectations but they did not beat Q1 EPS sequentially Part of it is expected in that the area is seasonal with Q3 and Q4 having the best numbers but something tells me that s not why You see Logitech has a lot of segments of which only gaming is one of them and I expect their non gamer peripheral segment etcetera has decreased etcetera I wager that the gaming segment revenue increased sequentially I must look at their earnings to figure that out and compare their recent quarter to their last quarter 1 First I look at the earnings release for last quarter which can be found here Quarterly Factsheet F4Q21 xlsx q4cdn com https s1 q4cdn com 104539020 files doc financials 2021 q4 Logitech F4Q21 Quarterly Factsheet pdf It shows me that gaming revenue is 323M 2 I then look at the latest earnings release here https s1 q4cdn com 104539020 files doc financials 2022 q1 Logitech F1Q22 Quarterly Factsheet pdf https s1 q4cdn com 104539020 files doc financials 2022 q1 Logitech F1Q22 Quarterly Factsheet pdf I can see that gaming revenue stands at 336M 3 That equates to a 4 02 sales increase However by looking at the fabled Q instead of just the fact sheet itself I know that gaming doesn t represent video cameras for streaming or streaming accessories nor the microphone segment for streaming 1 On Page 8 of the latest earnings found here 0001032975 21 000034 d18rn0p25nwr6d cloudfront net https d18rn0p25nwr6d cloudfront net CIK 0001032975 d1c28ef6 b9ef 4a9a 974e f23b941b1689 pdf you can find the definition of gaming 2 Our gaming category comprises gaming mice keyboards headsets gamepads steering wheels simulation controllers console gaming headsets console gaming controllers and stream labs services 3 What it doesn t say is streaming webcams streaming accessories or microphones 4 This means I must go to the web cam section to find sequential gains as well as audio and wearables section This is to get a complete picture PC Webcams decelerated from 145 to 110 in terms of revenues That s a decrease of 31 8 However that s because of the WFH trends fading because as the segment states our PC Webcams category comprises PC based webcams targeted primarily at consumers including streaming cameras Furthermore they say that the 81 increase over a twelve month period in terms of sales was partly because of organizations adopting remote or hybrid work environments 1 I expect the gaming and higher margin portion of the webcam side to have increased However looking at their earnings transcript will give me some color 2 o While webcam growth has started to moderate after more than tripled in last year sales still grew 73 in the quarter and we have regained some of the share we lost last year due to supply shortages 3 That s interesting The gaming peripheral and streaming segment is hyper fragmented and so I suppose Corsair has been eating market share I m expecting the majors to continue doing so 4 Yeah I mean the streaming business has just been a really strong grower underneath these numbers has really kind of lives in different places in the in our different categories But generally speaking if you look at blue microphones over the past year it s really just grown tremendously And we think the long term there is very very strong And Streamlabs is also super exciting and it s beating all the expectations we had for in terms of growth and we re very optimistic ahead and we re learning so much from our service businesses it s a pure service play 5 o Alright I got that color on the product mix I m thinking that the streaming portion for webcams has continued to grow sequentially Ergo sales have increased from Q4 to Q1 6 o Corsair seems to be in the entire ecosystem while Logitech is not Elgato Gaming and 45 more pages Personal Microsoft Edge gyazo com https gyazo com 102f33504555d33bff5c7bed013ce6ee

77c0e5277ae29824d8e7a173ed47daa1 130 to 117 but a similar story regarding the consumer side dragging down the gamer side for audio and wearables Hopefully there will be more color in the earnings call transcript The NPD has been quite clear that Streaming as a segment is going to grow at a strong pace for the next few years 1 Yeah I mean the streaming business has just been a really strong grower underneath these numbers has really kind of lives in different places in the in our different categories But generally speaking if you look at blue microphones over the past year it s really just grown tremendously And we think the long term there is very very strong And Streamlabs is also super exciting and it s beating all the expectations we had for in terms of growth and we re very optimistic ahead and we re learning so much from our service businesses it s a pure service play 2 Well that sounds bullish for the streaming side of the audio s microphones Guess that means my thesis regarding this is correct Now I move on to Corsair I m just going to ignore looking at best sellers lists for pc component parts because I must take some chill and I think it s strong anyway I know that the graphics card shortage for high end graphics cards is leading to sales increases in pre built pcs Ergo Origin will do well sequentially 1 Going to focus instead on what I think earnings will be for Q2 and FYE I m going to use this and if I need to go to the Q I will fd9a3204 b129 4add 8f27 d92f22f17169 corsair com https ir corsair com static files fd9a3204 b129 4add 8f27 d92f22f17169 2 They raised adjusted operating income to be in the range of 235M to 255M from 205M to 220M Let s figure out how to get the net income from that at the top range 3 This is going to be more complicated than I initially thought since the Operating Income on a GAAP basis is 67 289M and there are some one time items I can strip out to adjust it For some reason Robinhood displays the Adjusted Non GAAP EPS of 57 Therefore my number might be lower but will be higher on an Adjusted non GAAP EPS basis The GAAP EPS is 47 4 Non deferred IPO and secondary offering costs 1 03M 5 Acquisition related and integration related costs 208M 6 Change in fair value of contingent consideration for business acquisition 072M 7 That gives us something to start with and the new tally is 68 6M in GAAP income after stripping out what I believe to be one time expenses 8 As a percentage of net revenue that is now 12 95 from 12 7 The adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenue is 15 2 9 Taking that operating income and deducting interest expense of 7 39M and then deducting the effective tax rate of 22 gives you 46 723M as your Net income Page 7 10 Corsair has debt at 294 3 million after debt repayment of 28M and they intend to extinguish 100M by the end of the year The interest payments as can be seen In Q1 can be material I expect EPS growth as more and more debt is repaid and the interest no longer has to be paid 11 We were able to convert our strong financial performance in the first quarter into an opportunity to further strengthen our balance sheet We reduced debt by an additional 28 million with outstanding principal now at 299 million and net debt at 177 3 million We did this while growing quickly and leaving sufficient resources to help us grow further We continue to evaluate growth opportunities while still expecting to further reduce our existing debt in 2021 said Michael G Potter Chief Financial Officer of Corsair 12 I expect that they will outpace the 100M goal they set for by the end of the year due to stronger revenues free cash flow and net income 13 No I refuse to check out the loan terms even though I could This is already 2451 words Okay now let s go with future projections okay I m expecting 5 8 in sales growth I don t expect it to be 1 1 as I expect there to be a higher product mix relative to other quarters Thank you Razer Therefore I probably expect 6 8 sales growth but 7 10 in revenue growth I m basing this off my review of Logitech and Razer That would mean net revenues of 582 36M 1 The operating income therefore should be 12 9 of that but I am expecting better Because of operating expense management primarily but also because of a higher margin mix Since I went topline on revenue growth sequentially I ll be somewhat conservative and say that I believe there will be a 100 BPS increase So 13 9 will be the operating income percentage of net revenue 2 That would give operating income of 80 95M 3 Then I am going to deduct interest by copy pasting the last quarter s interest expense minus what interest is saved As I m too lazy to dig for it my assumption will be 4 interest rate on the debt extinguished which means 280K in interest saved this quarter And 1 12M over a full year The new interest expense tally for the quarter is 4 666M That would turn the net income into 76 284M 4 Other Expense net line I ll just say will remain neutral which means the net income will turn into 73 86M in net income 5 Effective tax rate of 22 means 57 61M in actual net income free and clear and then divide that by 92 19M shares outstanding means basic EPS of 6249 for Q2 2021 6 IMPORTANT ALERT SO READ THIS For some reason MarketWatch and Robinhood report the adjusted EPS which is non GAAP and they do so for the analyst estimates as well I m just going to give you that number so you don t have to do the calculations and I can save time EPS under adjusted net income is 738 EPS 7 As the adjusted net income EPS is what is going to be reported and what has been reported I m just going to go with that The Price to earnings growth sequentially would be a 27 24 increase 8 Analyst estimates of a FY EPS of 1 76 are way too low and would value the company with a forward p e of 16 59 if matched However they will be easily surpassed as the first quarter had a EPS of 47 on a GAAP basis and 58 on its reported non GAAP basis 9 Q3 and Q4 are seasonally the best time for these stocks especially Q3 and I don t see how those changes They re going to have even stronger quarters sequentially 10 My EPS estimate on a GAAP basis for the full year is roughly 1 95 2 05 but roughly at or within a cent difference of 2 11 My EPS estimate of the adjusted GAP basis Which is what is reported on brokerages and finance sites would have me estimating a FY EPS 2 15 2 55 12 Every 28M of debt extinguished means that 12 month future earnings are boosted by 012 You can divide that by 4 as that EPS is divided over a full year There will be a snowball effect and you will start feeling it this quarter though it will be slight This estimate is assuming 4 interest on every dollar 13 This all means a beat and raise and a bullish earnings call or a combination of the three Corsair s trailing P E after earnings will be 12 14 1 Logitech s current P E ratio is 17 17 2 Turtle Beach is 10 49 3 Razer had turned a net profit of 8M last year and so the P E ratio is astronomical the forward P E for FY 2021 will be more reasonable Corsair s forward P E for FY 2021 according to analysts who expect 1 76 is 16 55 1 Turtle Beach s is almost 22 2 Razer is 22 under my model 3 Logitech s is 19 07 My estimate for forward P E 1 GAAP Basis The non reported one 14 57 2 EPS 2 Adjusted Basis The reported one 12 69 2 3 EPS There is strong negative sentiment because the street doesn t think the gaming boom in sales can sustain itself but I think that s wrong and I believe I ve done the research to prove that is so 1 The street if you see the share price is expecting complete catastrophe A miss of epic proportions if you look at the charts The short interest is higher than it should be because short sellers think Eagle Tree will unload at any time but that s not what is going on Eagle Tree is a rational player in the market and I do not think they will sell past 35 75 plus whatever value they assign the raised guidance My guess is that their new sell point will be 37 5 40 2 My reasoning for that is if you look here you can see when they sold and how much they sold CRSR Corsair Gaming Inc Profile MarketWatch https www marketwatch com investing stock crsr company profile mod mw quote tab 3 Aside from the IPO they only sold once Eight months later When the company was pumped to over 40 dollars They ended up selling all the way down to 35 and then stopped 35 was their stopping point 4 They didn t sell until the stock price had moved up 105 140 in the span of 8 months They are rational actors and they acted in that manner because they believed that at those price points they were taking money from you and putting it in their pockets They haven t sold below 35 before earnings because they believe that that would be the equivalent of taking money from their pockets and giving it to you 5 The executive team selling is because of RSU s recently If you know about RSU s you know that you are taxed the full value of the stock now it is issued at the market price and that is your cost basis even if you don t sell So most people just usually buy them and immediately sell them to pay the taxes and keep the rest as cash to diversify My Strategy I had bought 6 27 5 Calls and Sold 6 35 calls I added another pair today to make that 7 for each These are August 20 Calls and my debit spread means my cost basis is like 29 95 At the time I bought them yesterday to break even it would have had to go up 1 6 by August 20 The Delta was 70 versus 20 and Gamma favored me for the first dollar Thus the first dollar gain in the share price would have netted me 250 margin roughly Margin expansion would be there because of the extrinsic vs intrinsic effect thus the IV crush would be less for the 27 5 s than the 35 s Theta burn is lower on my 27 5 calls as opposed to the 35 s due to the same reason though I don t need to do that I understand an opportunity could come that makes Eagle Tree rationalize selling at prices they don t think is suitable for them so I ve protected the possibility Corsair reports pre market on Tuesday which means they only have today and Monday to sell before earnings come out Market sentiment is so low that anything positive is primed to ligjt a fuse in the company s earnings and I expect a 3 7 raise and an outside chance of a 10 raise in the share price on earnings At minimum I expect there to be parity between Logitech s future P E and Corsairs Even if it stays flat I have a week and a half after earnings to see it go up the equivalent of 1 6 It s roughly 2 now but you get the idea There is intrinsic value unless it goes down below 27 5 Which means if it ends above 27 5 but below my cost basis I can exercise those calls and become a theta beta by wheeling it for September 17 s at a price of 27 5 30 or 32 5 and get past break even and into positive territory as the extra two weeks of theta will outweigh my losses The chances of it going below 27 5 are Slim to be honest I can either sell on earnings runup or keep them and see if there is a pop for the next few days I will likely hedge my gains by trimming on a as needed basis TLDR Do you ask for ketchup on your spaghetti when you re ordering in Italy Do you go to the Louvre and ask what that funny picture is when you look at the Mona Lisa No Then why would you ask for a TLDR of the financial write up equivalent of the Odyssey on a earnings play with a 2 week condom

lends itself to the acronym MARs which we might also reach by the end of the decade Future Bro ism will be the impetus for this coming melt up that s going to get us all fantastically rich Among the list of buzzwords tossed about I m predicting AI and machine learning will the ones underpinning this epic once in a generation event While EV and the general move away from fossil fuels looks good on paper from a market perspective it is mostly shifting money from one area to another currently less efficient area Powering everything with nuclear helps with the efficiency and I expect there to be some sweet nuclear plays just around the corner e g Gates new test reactor in Wyoming However unless and until nuclear fusion reactors become a thing I don t think energy is much more than the stable dividend paying play its been for so very long now On the other hand AI and machine learning have limitless upward potential in the minds of the masses The actual potential is certainly overblown and the actual progress is not nearly as far enough along to support the wildest claims However from the market s perspective that doesn t matter The only important thing is Can I envision this fundamentally changing the human condition If the answer to this question is Yes then you have the potential for a massive speculative rally With AI machine learning the answer is a definitive yes Because the topic is so far beyond the average person s ability to understand they will fill that bucket of what could be with all their joys and hopes and dreams which will in turn lead to mindless buying of everything associated with this concept We are already seeing this and I do not expect it to stop To the contrary I m calling out a considerable acceleration of the speculation Further like the Dot Com bubble I expect a massive spillover from the core names in this space into any and everything conceivable Again we re already seeing the signs of this with the tags AI and machine learning being slapped onto all manner of companies just like dotcom got tagged onto random shit back in the day amp x200B Part 2 The Charts But everything is overvalued already First even if that s true it

for that If you adjust it so the 08 crash is under the channel then this too is around the mid line amp x200B Indulging in some fantasy for a moment let s predict where the Nasdaq would be with a

adc04b09a8cca96e483fa7f7b9577bb0c30ef6b3 So I added a sixty percent to the mid line to top rally because America and also this lands us nicely at 120 000 points We re likely to intercept the top of the channel somewhere around 30 000 to 40 000 depending on how long this next phase is but I think we get to at least there I have the rally lasting until 2030 but as George Lucas says it rhymes like

the Dot Com rally This puts the target at about 7 800 Again by the end of the decade Like last time we had a breakout I don t think the S amp P is going to benefit as much as the Nasdaq amp x200B Part 3 Burry Pooh Bear amp the Taper Tantrum Straight out of the gate Michael Burry was inevitable There was always going to be a Michael Burry and there will again be another Michael Burry Why you might ask Answer Because every day there is someone somewhere predicting the stock market is on the brink of a collapse Many of them have good reasons too Indeed I m willing to bet that every single year someone makes a well reasoned case for why the stock market is due for a crash with good data to back it up There is always a bear case and there always will be a bear case But one cursory look at the long term charts should tell you the true answer these guys are wrong way more often than they are right But because one of them will eventually be right people keep listening And the things you spend time listening to are going to affect your outlook on life If you spend all day browsing bear porn you ll get to thinking you should be holding nothing but cash or gold or silver or gourd futures Worse than that once one of these bears is inevitably correct that person is elevated to sainthood and his continued predictions of doom are feasted upon by the masses compounding the missed opportunities and future regret of those poor bastards that bought into yet another Profit of Doom amp x200B There are of course some choppy waters ahead I m not talking about evictions or student debt or government debt or any of that nonsense The market is going to steamroll through that shit like it doesn t exist China however could be a real problem If the Pooh Bear decides to do something unexpected then we re going to get a crash and a bad one But he s not going to do shit I promise you he won t He likes money and not being incinerated by nuclear fire The Chinese stock sector is going to be rough waters for the traders and risky for the holders but the rest of the market will just move on The taper tantrum is the next real threat and it is going to happen But it s not going to lead to the Mother of All Crashes rather I m thinking it ll be a great dip buying opportunity The priced in joke is probably getting a bit worn at this point but the TT is priced in for the most part We all know it s coming because it s being telegraphed hard That means as we approach it there will be pull backs and some flat trading that are indicative of the market taking the big event into consideration You can already see this with each Fed meeting Nevertheless when it starts to happen is announced I still expect a sizable correction and I m going to scrounge up some cash for that dip buy The other side of the TT will be a ripper amp x200B Part 4 Blizzards of Cocaine Friends colleagues distinguish investors and professors of economics I implore you to see reason How often are the bears actually right How many failed predictions of doom must we suffer though before the truth is seen How many incredible face ripping rallies must you miss before it sinks in You worry about a drop caused by inflation and so you keep your money in the dollar the very thing devalued by inflation The path before us is clear friends We ve broken out of the channel on the SPX and thus the sky is the limit With each next human achievement the space flights of rich assholes the cars that look like they came from Back to the Future the Amazon Drone Mothership that will have your package delivered in an hour and most of all the magic of machine learning a thing no understands but everyone will pin their hopes of tomorrow on all this will see us clear these troubled days and onward to the greatest

Friday reversing after yesterday s gains to cap off one of the choppier weeks we ve had in the market all year The choppiness largely seems to stem from very erratic movements after hours after companies report earnings In my humble opinion a lot of these movements seem like overreactions to me and represent nice opportunities Moreover this week market participants digested a weaker than expected print in GDP growth and the Federal Reserve s July Monetary Policy Report Despite the volatility all three major indexes closed the month higher capping the six consecutive month of gains As of today s close the S amp P 500 SPY is up 18 04 year to date Absolutely insane On the other hand the Russell 2000 IWM which tracks the performance of small caps continued it s streak of underperformance closing the month 3 77 lower Core personal consumption expenditures PCE grew at a faster year on year rate in June than in May reflecting ongoing upward price pressures as demand surges during the recovery The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that core PCE grew 3 5 in June over last year topping May s 3 4 rate Still however this was less hot than the 3 7 pace consensus economists expected Yesterday the US Bureau of Economic Analysis released its advanced estimate of second quarter gross domestic product GDP growth Despite accelerating from the first quarter economists were largely expecting a higher jump despite consumer spending the largest component of US economic activity beating expectations However it seems market participants were not fazed Here are the numbers Q2 GDP seasonally adjusted annualized quarter over quarter 6 5 vs 8 4 expected and a downwardly revised 6 3 in Q1 Personal consumption 11 8 vs 10 5 expected and 11 4 in Q1 Core personal consumption expenditures quarter over quarter 6 0 vs 6 1 expected and an upwardly revised 2 7 in Q1 The July Monetary Policy Report was largely reiterated the same thing it has been for the last 3 4 months but did include did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed s stated goals The statement read Last December the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least 80 billion per month and of agency mortgage backed securities by at least 40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals Since then the economy has made progress toward these goals and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings Moreover the Fed athe report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if appropriate risks arise The statement read In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee s goals The Committee s assessments will take into account a wide range of information including readings on public health

Favor Hey guys it s me again Instead of gloating about how I was right about Homebuilders by making a gloat post I decided to be constructive by writing my greatest work yet Everyone has heard about Corsair and how great its products and growth are but I don t care about the product line when it comes to earnings plays I care about numbers the street cares about numbers and the numbers to note down here are 27 5 29 95 and 35 But we ll get to the why later Earnings plays are not necessarily as esoteric as people think In fact the efficient market hypothesis is such that you can figure out whether a stock will go up or down and even get your own estimate of earnings per share that is or can be relatively accurate to do so The Process Is Simple Identify a fundamentally strong company that has lagged its peers for no reason Vet this in terms of its current price to earnings ratio its analyst future price to earnings ratio relative to its sector or even especially historically Identify whether it has a bright future ahead of itself The reason for this is that the efficient market hypothesis operates under the assumptions that markets are forward looking I identified this with home builders generally and with CCS and M I homes respectively Identify the true earnings per share of the company for the upcoming quarter because with these kinds of companies analysts are usually wrong Don t bullshit yourself with pie in the sky fantasy Go as far out as a year with your estimates or at least FYE That way you can also analyze whether a company will raise guidance or even if the CEO and the executive team are playing the earnings beat game where they intentionally under promise and over deliver 1 Understand that if a company has good earnings but lowers guidance the stock will tank so it s important to note that you need to project future earnings per share for the full year 2 The way you can figure out what the true EPS will be in a company for the quarter and the year Which by the way is the lynchpin of this strategy is a process that takes hours of work That s the price you must pay for a high batting average You need to first read the latest earnings of the company you are investing in This can be done at their investor relations website or by finding their quarterly or annual on EDGAR Follow that up by sitting down and listening to their earnings call or by reading the earnings call transcript to add color 1 Follow that up by looking at sector peers who have reported for the latest quarter where your stock has not yet reported earnings Read their earnings release and delve deeper by looking at their Q s K depending on what time of the year it is Then listen in on their earnings call Don t forget to look at sector peers in foreign markets because they have different disclosure rules For example the Hong Kong Exchange lets has companies issue early warning profit alerts before earnings 2 Have you done your sector research Make sure you have Including sector numbers economic data If they aren t what the market likes question if there s a reason why For example CCS M I home and other home builders haven t been selling homes until they ve been mostly constructed and have been metering or effectively metering their home sales This is because they wanted to get fixed costs before they sell their home as opposed to getting a home pre ordered and having to deal with highly variable prices in commodities In short home builders wanted better visibility on their margins So the new home sales data for this month didn t look great but if you know what s going on you know that it was a head fake 3 Compare the current P E to your company s peers and then compare the future P E Is it woefully undervalued for no good reason I m talking a material impact here Is the projected analyst earnings expectations for the quarter and year just too low Doing this will allow you to make a more accurate projection of your specific company s earnings and forward earnings Even then your expectations can be blown even though they re higher than analysts as occurred to me with home builders I was in What is the market sentiment towards your stock If it s been red the last week month three months Then that means there is a strong negative sentiment But it doesn t need to be red for all three you just must recognize the sentiment If that s the case and you ve paired this with everything else the stock will go up So long as you identify that there will be a beat raise or bullish earnings call or a combination Be mindful of any obstacles such as the bear case If only to do like a persuasive argument where you acknowledge the argument then counter it In certain cases hedge by limiting your downside and protecting a large portion of your upside This can be paired with trimming on a as needed basis when you are up The process will take you a significant portion of time running in the hours This Corsair play took me 5 7 Hours of Research and I m not counting most of my Razer research hours in this It can be tedious but it s the price to pay for a high batting average I m lucky that I love doing this stuff How I Discovered The Play They way that I am going to describe this DD is by weaving the story of how I came to discover this play in bullet point format The story starts a month and a half ago with a Singaporean American company listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange I was incredibly bullish on what Razer s first half earnings would be because I was seeing them buy back their stock in real time every single day Hong Kong has different disclosure rules requiring a next day disclosure if the company did a buyback the previous day with how much shares had been bought how much they had retired and how much they had bought back so far but not retired They also require a monthly issuance of equity I had been seeing them buying their stock back every single day So I knew the first half for Razer would be gangbusters But another disclosure requirement is the inside information profit alert that the exchange requires them to do before earnings Looking through it I noticed a few things https doc irasia com listco hk razer announcement a210714 pdf https doc irasia com listco hk razer announcement a210714 pdf 1 There was higher than expected revenue growth Though I must remember that Q1 is included in the profit alert since the earnings are for H1 and H2 2 The operating margin was higher because of a higher gross margin product mix as well as organic improvement of hardware margins They had spoken of doing it in their investor presentation for their annual report in 2020 It can be found here https investor razer com pdf pre210324 pdf https investor razer com pdf pre210324 pdf Page 47 3 I expect something similar for Corsair where the higher gross margin products are a larger product of their revenue mix 4 There was also continued improvement in operating expenses management which I expect for Corsair as well That s not enough color for me so I move on to Logitech which has reported earnings They beat earnings expectations but they did not beat Q1 EPS sequentially Part of it is expected in that the area is seasonal with Q3 and Q4 having the best numbers but something tells me that s not why You see Logitech has a lot of segments of which only gaming is one of them and I expect their non gamer peripheral segment etcetera has decreased etcetera I wager that the gaming segment revenue increased sequentially I must look at their earnings to figure that out and compare their recent quarter to their last quarter 1 First I look at the earnings release for last quarter which can be found here Quarterly Factsheet F4Q21 xlsx q4cdn com https s1 q4cdn com 104539020 files doc financials 2021 q4 Logitech F4Q21 Quarterly Factsheet pdf It shows me that gaming revenue is 323M 2 I then look at the latest earnings release here https s1 q4cdn com 104539020 files doc financials 2022 q1 Logitech F1Q22 Quarterly Factsheet pdf https s1 q4cdn com 104539020 files doc financials 2022 q1 Logitech F1Q22 Quarterly Factsheet pdf I can see that gaming revenue stands at 336M 3 That equates to a 4 02 sales increase However by looking at the fabled Q instead of just the fact sheet itself I know that gaming doesn t represent video cameras for streaming or streaming accessories nor the microphone segment for streaming 1 On Page 8 of the latest earnings found here 0001032975 21 000034 d18rn0p25nwr6d cloudfront net https d18rn0p25nwr6d cloudfront net CIK 0001032975 d1c28ef6 b9ef 4a9a 974e f23b941b1689 pdf you can find the definition of gaming 2 Our gaming category comprises gaming mice keyboards headsets gamepads steering wheels simulation controllers console gaming headsets console gaming controllers and stream labs services 3 What it doesn t say is streaming webcams streaming accessories or microphones 4 This means I must go to the web cam section to find sequential gains as well as audio and wearables section This is to get a complete picture PC Webcams decelerated from 145 to 110 in terms of revenues That s a decrease of 31 8 However that s because of the WFH trends fading because as the segment states our PC Webcams category comprises PC based webcams targeted primarily at consumers including streaming cameras Furthermore they say that the 81 increase over a twelve month period in terms of sales was partly because of organizations adopting remote or hybrid work environments 1 I expect the gaming and higher margin portion of the webcam side to have increased However looking at their earnings transcript will give me some color 2 o While webcam growth has started to moderate after more than tripled in last year sales still grew 73 in the quarter and we have regained some of the share we lost last year due to supply shortages 3 That s interesting The gaming peripheral and streaming segment is hyper fragmented and so I suppose Corsair has been eating market share I m expecting the majors to continue doing so 4 Yeah I mean the streaming business has just been a really strong grower underneath these numbers has really kind of lives in different places in the in our different categories But generally speaking if you look at blue microphones over the past year it s really just grown tremendously And we think the long term there is very very strong And Streamlabs is also super exciting and it s beating all the expectations we had for in terms of growth and we re very optimistic ahead and we re learning so much from our service businesses it s a pure service play 5 o Alright I got that color on the product mix I m thinking that the streaming portion for webcams has continued to grow sequentially Ergo sales have increased from Q4 to Q1 6 o Corsair seems to be in the entire ecosystem while Logitech is not Elgato Gaming and 45 more pages Personal Microsoft Edge gyazo com https gyazo com 102f33504555d33bff5c7bed013ce6ee

77c0e5277ae29824d8e7a173ed47daa1 130 to 117 but a similar story regarding the consumer side dragging down the gamer side for audio and wearables Hopefully there will be more color in the earnings call transcript The NPD has been quite clear that Streaming as a segment is going to grow at a strong pace for the next few years 1 Yeah I mean the streaming business has just been a really strong grower underneath these numbers has really kind of lives in different places in the in our different categories But generally speaking if you look at blue microphones over the past year it s really just grown tremendously And we think the long term there is very very strong And Streamlabs is also super exciting and it s beating all the expectations we had for in terms of growth and we re very optimistic ahead and we re learning so much from our service businesses it s a pure service play 2 Well that sounds bullish for the streaming side of the audio s microphones Guess that means my thesis regarding this is correct Now I move on to Corsair I m just going to ignore looking at best sellers lists for pc component parts because I must take some chill and I think it s strong anyway I know that the graphics card shortage for high end graphics cards is leading to sales increases in pre built pcs Ergo Origin will do well sequentially 1 Going to focus instead on what I think earnings will be for Q2 and FYE I m going to use this and if I need to go to the Q I will fd9a3204 b129 4add 8f27 d92f22f17169 corsair com https ir corsair com static files fd9a3204 b129 4add 8f27 d92f22f17169 2 They raised adjusted operating income to be in the range of 235M to 255M from 205M to 220M Let s figure out how to get the net income from that at the top range 3 This is going to be more complicated than I initially thought since the Operating Income on a GAAP basis is 67 289M and there are some one time items I can strip out to adjust it For some reason Robinhood displays the Adjusted Non GAAP EPS of 57 Therefore my number might be lower but will be higher on an Adjusted non GAAP EPS basis The GAAP EPS is 47 4 Non deferred IPO and secondary offering costs 1 03M 5 Acquisition related and integration related costs 208M 6 Change in fair value of contingent consideration for business acquisition 072M 7 That gives us something to start with and the new tally is 68 6M in GAAP income after stripping out what I believe to be one time expenses 8 As a percentage of net revenue that is now 12 95 from 12 7 The adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenue is 15 2 9 Taking that operating income and deducting interest expense of 7 39M and then deducting the effective tax rate of 22 gives you 46 723M as your Net income Page 7 10 Corsair has debt at 294 3 million after debt repayment of 28M and they intend to extinguish 100M by the end of the year The interest payments as can be seen In Q1 can be material I expect EPS growth as more and more debt is repaid and the interest no longer has to be paid 11 We were able to convert our strong financial performance in the first quarter into an opportunity to further strengthen our balance sheet We reduced debt by an additional 28 million with outstanding principal now at 299 million and net debt at 177 3 million We did this while growing quickly and leaving sufficient resources to help us grow further We continue to evaluate growth opportunities while still expecting to further reduce our existing debt in 2021 said Michael G Potter Chief Financial Officer of Corsair 12 I expect that they will outpace the 100M goal they set for by the end of the year due to stronger revenues free cash flow and net income 13 No I refuse to check out the loan terms even though I could This is already 2451 words Okay now let s go with future projections okay I m expecting 5 8 in sales growth I don t expect it to be 1 1 as I expect there to be a higher product mix relative to other quarters Thank you Razer Therefore I probably expect 6 8 sales growth but 7 10 in revenue growth I m basing this off my review of Logitech and Razer That would mean net revenues of 582 36M 1 The operating income therefore should be 12 9 of that but I am expecting better Because of operating expense management primarily but also because of a higher margin mix Since I went topline on revenue growth sequentially I ll be somewhat conservative and say that I believe there will be a 100 BPS increase So 13 9 will be the operating income percentage of net revenue 2 That would give operating income of 80 95M 3 Then I am going to deduct interest by copy pasting the last quarter s interest expense minus what interest is saved As I m too lazy to dig for it my assumption will be 4 interest rate on the debt extinguished which means 280K in interest saved this quarter And 1 12M over a full year The new interest expense tally for the quarter is 4 666M That would turn the net income into 76 284M 4 Other Expense net line I ll just say will remain neutral which means the net income will turn into 73 86M in net income 5 Effective tax rate of 22 means 57 61M in actual net income free and clear and then divide that by 92 19M shares outstanding means basic EPS of 6249 for Q2 2021 6 IMPORTANT ALERT SO READ THIS For some reason MarketWatch and Robinhood report the adjusted EPS which is non GAAP and they do so for the analyst estimates as well I m just going to give you that number so you don t have to do the calculations and I can save time EPS under adjusted net income is 738 EPS 7 As the adjusted net income EPS is what is going to be reported and what has been reported I m just going to go with that The Price to earnings growth sequentially would be a 27 24 increase 8 Analyst estimates of a FY EPS of 1 76 are way too low and would value the company with a forward p e of 16 59 if matched However they will be easily surpassed as the first quarter had a EPS of 47 on a GAAP basis and 58 on its reported non GAAP basis 9 Q3 and Q4 are seasonally the best time for these stocks especially Q3 and I don t see how those changes They re going to have even stronger quarters sequentially 10 My EPS estimate on a GAAP basis for the full year is roughly 1 95 2 05 but roughly at or within a cent difference of 2 11 My EPS estimate of the adjusted GAP basis Which is what is reported on brokerages and finance sites would have me estimating a FY EPS 2 15 2 55 12 Every 28M of debt extinguished means that 12 month future earnings are boosted by 012 You can divide that by 4 as that EPS is divided over a full year There will be a snowball effect and you will start feeling it this quarter though it will be slight This estimate is assuming 4 interest on every dollar 13 This all means a beat and raise and a bullish earnings call or a combination of the three Corsair s trailing P E after earnings will be 12 14 1 Logitech s current P E ratio is 17 17 2 Turtle Beach is 10 49 3 Razer had turned a net profit of 8M last year and so the P E ratio is astronomical the forward P E for FY 2021 will be more reasonable Corsair s forward P E for FY 2021 according to analysts who expect 1 76 is 16 55 1 Turtle Beach s is almost 22 2 Razer is 22 under my model 3 Logitech s is 19 07 My estimate for forward P E 1 GAAP Basis The non reported one 14 57 2 EPS 2 Adjusted Basis The reported one 12 69 2 3 EPS There is strong negative sentiment because the street doesn t think the gaming boom in sales can sustain itself but I think that s wrong and I believe I ve done the research to prove that is so 1 The street if you see the share price is expecting complete catastrophe A miss of epic proportions if you look at the charts The short interest is higher than it should be because short sellers think Eagle Tree will unload at any time but that s not what is going on Eagle Tree is a rational player in the market and I do not think they will sell past 35 75 plus whatever value they assign the raised guidance My guess is that their new sell point will be 37 5 40 2 My reasoning for that is if you look here you can see when they sold and how much they sold CRSR Corsair Gaming Inc Profile MarketWatch https www marketwatch com investing stock crsr company profile mod mw quote tab 3 Aside from the IPO they only sold once Eight months later When the company was pumped to over 40 dollars They ended up selling all the way down to 35 and then stopped 35 was their stopping point 4 They didn t sell until the stock price had moved up 105 140 in the span of 8 months They are rational actors and they acted in that manner because they believed that at those price points they were taking money from you and putting it in their pockets They haven t sold below 35 before earnings because they believe that that would be the equivalent of taking money from their pockets and giving it to you 5 The executive team selling is because of RSU s recently If you know about RSU s you know that you are taxed the full value of the stock now it is issued at the market price and that is your cost basis even if you don t sell So most people just usually buy them and immediately sell them to pay the taxes and keep the rest as cash to diversify My Strategy I had bought 6 27 5 Calls and Sold 6 35 calls I added another pair today to make that 7 for each These are August 20 Calls and my debit spread means my cost basis is like 29 95 At the time I bought them yesterday to break even it would have had to go up 1 6 by August 20 The Delta was 70 versus 20 and Gamma favored me for the first dollar Thus the first dollar gain in the share price would have netted me 250 margin roughly Margin expansion would be there because of the extrinsic vs intrinsic effect thus the IV crush would be less for the 27 5 s than the 35 s Theta burn is lower on my 27 5 calls as opposed to the 35 s due to the same reason though I don t need to do that I understand an opportunity could come that makes Eagle Tree rationalize selling at prices they don t think is suitable for them so I ve protected the possibility Corsair reports pre market on Tuesday which means they only have today and Monday to sell before earnings come out Market sentiment is so low that anything positive is primed to ligjt a fuse in the company s earnings and I expect a 3 7 raise and an outside chance of a 10 raise in the share price on earnings At minimum I expect there to be parity between Logitech s future P E and Corsairs Even if it stays flat I have a week and a half after earnings to see it go up the equivalent of 1 6 It s roughly 2 now but you get the idea There is intrinsic value unless it goes down below 27 5 Which means if it ends above 27 5 but below my cost basis I can exercise those calls and become a theta beta by wheeling it for September 17 s at a price of 27 5 30 or 32 5 and get past break even and into positive territory as the extra two weeks of theta will outweigh my losses The chances of it going below 27 5 are Slim to be honest I can either sell on earnings runup or keep them and see if there is a pop for the next few days I will likely hedge my gains by trimming on a as needed basis TLDR Do you ask for ketchup on your spaghetti when you re ordering in Italy Do you go to the Louvre and ask what that funny picture is when you look at the Mona Lisa No Then why would you ask for a TLDR of the financial write up equivalent of the Odyssey on a earnings play with a 2 week condom

stacking live ops game over live ops game and there goes your growth amp x200B What to expect what are the catalysts Q2 Earnings early august Q2 wasn t great because no new game was released till the

SensorTower will update its revenue worldwide app revenue metrics on the 1st or 2nd of the month as they do every month So more people will wake up to realize Next Gen and Origin are hitting it hard I

this 100 Free https www youtube com watch v yr OhOs8Xu8 amp t 10s https www youtube com watch v yr OhOs8Xu8 amp t 10s The first manner human beings are creating wealth from Tik Tok is developing bills after which promoting them This is turning into an increasing number of famous with inside the eCommerce or product area Example of Tiktok Live on diverse Tiktok bills Similar to Instagram you re going to pick a gap after which pass in advance and create wonderful content material preferably content material that is going viral to draw that individual who might be the appropriate client on your product There are already human beings on this area nowadays who re developing TikTok profiles round a sure hobby Usually it s a gap subject matter and that they may not have whatever to promote however they re going to attain out to manufacturers in that enterprise and promote their TikTok profile to them and those are authentic creating wealth this manner The right information for product manufacturers is after they have that account of their hands it s without a doubt pretty clean to promote merchandise One manner that human beings are promoting merchandise is thru TikTok Live They are launching merchandise whilst livestreaming or they re without a doubt keeping auctions whilst stay streaming And of course there may be the hyperlink withinside the bio wherein you may constantly power your fans to buy your product So in case you re the kind of individual to like TikTok and also you simply need to develop a following round a sure subject matter and construct that network round a sure subject matter pass for it after which attain out to the ones manufacturers who would really like to have get admission to to the ones fans and promote them your account 2 Donations The 2nd manner human beings are creating wealth from TikTok goes Live and gathering donations from viewers similar to you may do on different platforms like Twitch I discover this selection of TikTok fascinating It s truly a constructed in monetization platform actually from day one From what I ve visible here s the way it works When you re a TikTok user you may pass into your profile and buy some thing referred to as cash For one hundred cash it ll price you 1 39 Now what do you do with those cash When one in every of your preferred creators goes Live you may without a doubt ship them cash as a manner of giving thank you for all in their attempt in growing the content material they do What does the author do with this coin The author turns the cash into diamonds and people diamonds may be transformed into coins through PayPal Cool proper On the Chinese model of TikTok an app referred to as Douyin there may be a next stage function much like this When creators are Live they could without a doubt connect a buying cart to a product they promote So it s kinda like QVC or the buying channel You can pass Live keep an auction and those can purchase your product whilst you re Live thru the buying cart function My bet is this selection goes to return back to bills international faster in preference to later 3 Manage influencer campaigns The 1 3 manner to make cash from TikTok is to control influencer campaigns This isn t a brand new idea There are directly up influencer organizations to serve Instagram influencers already The identical idea applies to TikTok You may be the intermediary or the broking among a author on TikTok and a logo who desires to paintings with that influencer From growing the settlement coping with each parties ensuring the deliverables are all met simply being a coordinator you may fee a carrier rate to control campaigns like that TikTok as a platform is smart they without a doubt have an inner influencer software already constructed in So if I m a massive logo and I need to attain out to TikTok and say Hey that is the distance I m in what influencers ought to I paintings with I can do that The best component is I m going to pay a percent to TikTok for brokering that settlement That s wherein you may are available in as a carrier or business enterprise to make that settlement outdoor of TikTok and assist manufacturers shop a bit little bit of cash 4 Tiktok advertisements platform The fourth manner you may make cash from TikTok is through the use of their advertisements platform Just like Facebook and Instagram advertisements you may Google proper now TikTok advertisements and join up for get admission to to their advertisements platform It is quite self explanatory in case you ve ever run paid site visitors before so in case your market s on TikTok it is probably really well worth you growing some advertisements placing a few price range closer to experimenting there and seeing what occurs Maybe you may promote greater of your merchandise thru TikTok 5 Management offerings The 5th manner you may make cash from TikTok is through presenting control offerings for creators at the app Some creators on TikTok have hundreds of thousands of fans and occasionally this occurs truly rapid and in a single day for that author It s like having a enterprise land of their lap Tiktok profile of Charli D Amelio with 14 4M fans You should step in and provide offerings to assist them with their content material method their innovative method perhaps coping with gives and offers that come their manner So when you have that history in manufacturing or storytelling you may simply observe that to presenting control offerings to TikTok creators https tiktokbusiness7 blogspot com 6 Consulting Last however now no longer least when you turn out to be a seasoned on TikTok and perhaps you truly apprehend how a person should take a video that perhaps receives one hundred perspectives and assist them get 100 000 perspectives well you may really provide consulting offerings This is a truly high quality manner to leverage your understanding from the platform and assist folks who need to be TikTok well known or they need to be creators without a doubt increase their method so their films get visible through loads of thousands if now no longer hundreds of thousands of human beings Of course you want to have the history and the enjoy on this first to provide this as a carrier But when you re there human beings can pay to have your enjoy and your mind on their account And in case you assist them get any offers or influencer agreements you may even negotiate a percent or a reduce of that deal really due to the fact you re their representative and you ve helped them pass viral on TikTok So there you ve got got it Six approaches that I see human beings creating wealth from TikTok nowadays even whilst it s https tiktokbusiness7 blogspot com nevertheless truly truly early on Let s pass returned to my first factor at the start of this video Why do I an Instagram marketer suppose that TikTok is probably greater effective than Instagram The manner I see it Instagram testimonies are type of much like TikTok films however they expire after 24 hours This is wherein TikTok is effective TikTok is without a doubt much like YouTube which means you may submit a video nowadays however perhaps the set of rules alternatives it up months later and begins offevolved pushing that video into the feed of folks who would really like it The reality that your films don t disappear has a variety of electricity to it due to the fact it could power a variety of site visitors and eyeballs to you months after the reality That motive on my own is why human beings have become occasionally hundreds of thousands of perspectives to their TikTok films with only a few fans It s due to the fact the set of rules is selecting up your video and pushing it out Again there s a variety of hobby and now no longer a variety of content material So the set of rules is pushing it out to the folks who it thinks are going to be receptive to that content material And hello waking as much as hundreds of thousands of perspectives with only a few fans I mean in nowadays s day and age I don t suppose there s some other app or platform that could provide you with the ones types of outcomes proper now https
