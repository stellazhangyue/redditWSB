that is about to follow is speculation It is purely a theory of mine based on known facts and common sense Any dates included are to provide context They do not indicate the beginning middle or end of the impending squeeze Disclaimer 2 I am not a financial advisor this is not financial advice I just really like this stock TL DR Wanda AMC and the SEC are working together to build a case against the major short sellers committing blatant fraud daily that is suppressing the price of AMC stock Wanda and AMC will stand to make a lot of money in lawsuits for capital losses Meanwhile the SEC will be able to prosecute fraudulent entities using information shared by AMC The Players Wanda America Entertainment Before February of 2021 Wanda had voting stake in AMC and was the single largest institutional shareholder of AMC In early February 2021 Wanda converted class B common stock to class A common stock which allowed them to sell shares on the open market On March 19 20 2021 Wanda sold 15 6 million shares of AMC stock reducing their holdings from 8 8 of AMC common stock to 6 8 of AMC common stock Pay attention to those dates AMC Entertainment Led by CEO Adam Aron AMC has staved off bankruptcy during the COVID 19 pandemic They have raised a total of 752 million dollars from direct offerings in 2021 That is in addition to the funds raised in december 2020 This influx of capital has put AMC into a position that they can maintain operation at current levels until the end of 2022 per their Q1 2021 earnings call The first dilution of 2021 put an additional 63 3 million shares on the market That was completed on January 27 2021 The second dilution was the ATM offering program that completed the sale of 43 million shares from April 27 to May 12 Remember these dates too Securities and Exchange Commission As the lead regulating agency for the stock market the SEC is supposed to legislate investigate and prosecute any entity committing securities fraud We vilify them and rightfully so They have taken a sideline seat and watched as we battled back from our own 1 yard line to be 1st and goal today Their only interest in all of this is to mitigate the effect on our economy as a whole and to prosecute the offending parties In order to do that they need evidence Not just evidence of when and what dates naked shorting amount illegal FTD resets etc but also the WHO We all have our sights on Citadel but they are not the only complicit player here This is systemic and market wide AMC and GME are not the only securities affected by this but that are the most public They are also the ones that can provide information that the SEC desperately needs The Game Remember when I said to pay attention to the dates before Well lets dig into those January 27 This was D day for the HFs We had them cornered a squeeze was imminent Share price rocketed to over 20 a share trading halts comprised most of the market hours brokers weren t allowing people to buy and Apes were throwing shit all over the walls with excitement Marge was dialing During all of this at the peak of all peaks with us getting ready to get out of the atmosphere AMC announced the 63 million share dilution The following day AMC plummeted to the 10 14 range and started its descent back down to 5 a share Why would they do this now It doesn t make sense until you read below March 18 20 On March 18th AMC is on the rise We are about to break a critical resistance level at 14 50 Intraday we break that wall We are all watching patiently to get our tendies out of the fryer It feels like January 27th all over again Then March 19th comes and instead of going up share price drops Not as heavily as on the 27th but it doesnt continue the upward trend All of a sudden shares available to borrow goes from 0 to millions Apes are confused It doesn t make sense We broke the wall it s time to move Maybe it s just the last breath of the HFs before they let it run and Marge calls March 20th rolls around and again the share price drops This time we crash below the 12 50 support level In the following days we come back down to the 10 11 dollar range where we sat until the end of April We later found out through 13F filings that Wanda sold 15 million shares stalling our ascent and bringing us back down to earth Why would a company who stands to gain billions from a squeeze do this It doesn t make sense until you read below End of April 2021 Once again we are on the rise Not quite to the 14 50 break point but we are in a streak of green days shares available to borrow are almost gone and cost to borrow is skyrocketing when they are available It feels like January and March again We re getting ready to break 12 50 and gap up to the 14s again Then AMC announces its ATM offering program Once again from the 27th of april through the end of May we drop back to the 10 11 dollar range We found out at the Q1 earnings that during this period of descent AMC had sold over 15 million shares onto the market raising a significant amount of capital Once again we plummet back to earth Why would a company sacrifice billions in profits off of the ATM offering to sell all of it s remaining sellable shares at 9 50 10 50 a share It doesn t make sense until you read below Where are we at today Once again we are getting ready to break the resistance levels and shares available to borrow are somehow appearing out of nowhere Borrow rates have dropped 75 percent in a week and every time we push that level of resistance we get pulled back down Does this sound familiar I think Wanda is unloading another block of shares This is horribly bad for us right Can t be good Wrong This was always the plan it was always the game They re adding shorty rocket fuel FOMO is kicking in Retail is seeing a huge increase in liquidity as new buyers join in for liftoff It is the perfect time to drop shares if you are intentionally delaying the squeeze Those shares are gone almost immediately Literally if they sell at open even the full 30 million would get eaten up in the first hour of trading In order to figure out why they would delay the squeeze we need to look at the playbook The Playbook AMC and Wanda s goal throughout these last 5 months has been to build a case for the mother of all legal claims against the entities short selling the stock with synthetic shares Each time we reach a breaking point for the good they are keeping the SP down as they gather the information they need to file a lawsuit I graduated with a political science degree with the aim of going to law school so I have a decent amount of knowledge when it comes to legal proceedings Having said that this is what you need to prove damages in a civil lawsuit 1 Who Who was the offending party that caused the damage 2 When During what period or at what time did they cause you the damage 3 How What did they do that caused you to incur damages 4 Damages incurred You need to be able to define the amount of loss incurred due to the actions of the offending party In this case its a pecuniary damage money lost The plays 1 Share count In order to identify the who and the how AMC needs to be able to prove which entities wronged them and the amount of damage EACH of them caused IE how many shares did they short using malpractice naked shorting FTD resets etc The share count does this for them In order to disseminate voting materials they need to know the information of who owns the shares of stock how many they own and have the contact information to send out voting materials This gives them the who and the factor to multiply damages incurred per share against 2 Delay annual meeting I firmly believe AMC delayed the meeting because of the sheer amount of shares they counted The last thing a company wants to do is go into a critical vote with an inflated number of shares In order to get anything on the ballot to pass they need a majority of shareholders to approve If the amount of shares and votes is inflated they could potentially see all of their ballot items fail to pass 3 Involve the SEC When they knew the who and amount of shares I believe AMC got the SEC involved They were able to provide concrete evidence to the SEC of the fraud that was ongoing since December The SEC needed that information to file legal proceedings Keep in mind they need the same things AMC does minus the damages incurred to bring a case against the malpracticing firms At this point the SEC can actively watch the actions of the offending parties in real time Building a case until the next share count In addition this gives AMC the ability to follow with a civil lawsuit using the SECs findings as the How of their claim Here s the bonus the SEC will be able to show AMC the how during the time of the 43 million dilution These illegal activities were going on during a share dilution directly affecting the share price AMC should have gotten for their shares sold 4 2nd share recount I think the SEC advised AMC to conduct another recount for a few reasons 1 the illegal activity ramped up from Janurary to April and the actual share count would have undoubtedly increased in this period and 2 It allows the SEC to track another data point while getting ready for the market implosion this could cause It also delays a notification to the public of just how broken the system is Now when AMC announces the share count the SEC can announce the legal proceedings it will pursue naming the defendants 5 Timing of dilutions If AMC diluted during or after the squeeze they wouldn t be able to correctly identify damages incurred and when they occurred By having Wanda and AMC dilute when share price was not inflated it gives a concrete timeframe of when they were damaged as well as a count of shares that form the basis of the damage claim 15 million for Wanda and 103 million for AMC 4th and Goal how it ends On June 2nd AMC has to finish their share count so they can disseminate materials Adam Aron has already stated he will make the share count public When he announces the total shares counted it will clearly show the blatant manipulation and illegal activities Retail will FOMO institutions will FOMO and large private investors will FOMO If you want confirmation that this was the end play look for an announcement of a share recall a formal investigation or both with the announcement When they recall the shares the MMs will need to get real shares and only real shares back from the HF before the date specified This will ignite the margin calls and form the catalyst from the squeeze The squeeze will be squoze in theory Again no dates shhhh When the squeeze is over AMC can now identify just how much they were damaged They now have the who and when share recount the how SEC investigation and the damages incurred delta between share price at market offering and top of the squeeze A civil lawsuit will follow At any point after June 2nd the SEC can announce the legal proceedings it will have and identify the offending parties Here is the beauty they can file for an immediate injunction to take control over the offending parties assets In fact this is common in legal proceedings involving malpractice You have evidence the offending party is committing illegal acts so you stop them from continuing them during legal proceedings Confirmation bias time Why would Wanda and AMC sell shares pre squeeze Remember I said you would find out below Well buckle up Imagine the shares you have now and knowing that you could get the maximum gains possible the top of the top peak for your shares That is the position AMC and Wanda have put themselves into it is honestly genius if you really think about it They don t have to time the sales Just watch it go and when the dust settles they can name their price from HISTORICAL FACT I think we would all take this option AMC and Wanda stand to make billions from this from the way they have played this game Thank you if you made it this far This was a labor of love and took some time If you disagree with the above any of it let me know This is just a THEORY It makes sense though doesn t it Beebs

listing and is only to being listed as a path for the private equity owners and key staff to cash out their shares The IPO values the company at around USD800million yet shows no path to ever achieving profitability Beware https www smh com au business banking and finance puffed up ipo two class action law firms investigating nuix 20210519 p57t5t html https www smh com au business banking and finance puffed up ipo two class action law firms investigating nuix 20210519 p57t5t html amp x200B Keypath IPO Keypath Education is a US based education business that is soon to IPO in Australia not sure why they don t do it in the USA Keypath Education has been building its business since 2014 7 years and is yet to turn a profit Each year Keypath Education adds additional programs Masters to drive additional student enrollments and revenue Additions of programs requires investment in learning design The more Keypath Education invests in learning design the greater its future growth will be as this means new programs are being developed or existing programs are being refreshed High overheads Old programs grow stale and over time drive lower revenue so ever increasing investment in programs is required to drive revenue growth year on year The second part of Keypath Education driving revenue growth is through marketing Keypath Education primarily drives student enrollments via online marketing primarily Google and Facebook but also a range of online sources Keypath Education is operating in a highly competitive market which results in high marketing costs as a proportion of revenue Higher marketing spend drives higher enrollments which drives revenue If marketing spend is reduced enrollments reduce Covid black swan to the rescue The covid pandemic was a black swan event which saw a large portion of its largest market Australia in lockdown for a good part of half a year which the government paying people to not work and doubling welfare payments to unemployed This saw a large spike in enrollments over 2020 and 2021 as people turned to study to improve chances of re entering the workforce or to upskill while they were under lockdown Keypath s financial statements for the years 2020 2019 and 2018 Statement of Cash Flows shows increasing investment in its program offering Additions of amortizable assets with investments increasing 50 over the three years Meanwhile existing programs also see increasing depreciation as the investment in those programs depreciates in value However the financial statements for the half year ended 31 December 2020 shows something interesting While revenues have increased substantially 70 marketing spend only increased 42 This means the marketing spend over the 6 months ended Dec 2020 was much more effective than that in the six months ended Dec 2019 Additionally salaries and wages which reflect investment in people to generate sales and retain existing students only grew 43 in line with marketing What this means is that Keypath Educations recent jump in revenue is not sustainable and was only due to the Covid pandemic as people were left with little to do but study What this means is Keypath Education saw a windfall gain in enrollments due to Covid without a resulting higher investment in either marketing or staff to enroll those students Keypath Education was converting marketing spend at a rate far higher than in previous periods This is an abnormal situation and is unlikely to continue as people return to work and life returns to normal Diminishing investment in the business Further Keypath Education s additions to amortizable intangible assets was lower in the Dec 2020 half than in prior periods This means Keypath Education invested less in its business As new courses see diminishing enrollments as they mature this under investment in building and maintaining courses will show itself over the coming years If Keypath Education isn t building and maintaining its existing programs at ever higher rates its revenue will eventually plateau then decline Keypath s main revenue drivers is number of new students and its ability to retain existing students However if you read the offer documents both of these drivers are completely absent instead is hundreds of pages of fluff about minimal investment in technology to market itself as a tech business It s nothing more than a sales and marketing arm of universities Definitely not a true tech business The rest of the offer document is fluff about diversity and how Keypath Education isn t just like every other Online Program Management business in a very crowded market What Keypath s IPO represents is a private equity firm that is desperate to exit a loss making business that cannot turn a profit The Covid epidemic saw a windfall temporary increase in enrollments which combined with reduced investment in its product and reduced marketing and staff spend gives the impression of a business about to turn a profit This could not be further from the truth Recent jump in revenue not sustainable As life returns to normal the unemployment rates in Australia and the USA are driven below 5 and 4 online education will become less appealing and driving new enrollments will become much more competitive requiring substantially more investment in refreshing programs and higher marketing and staff spend to convert leads to enrolments and retain them in study Further Keypath Education s Dec 2020 results are inflated by gains on currency revaluation and movements in the AUD to the USD over the 6 months this adds approximately 1 5m to its bottom line which in future periods won t be recurring In their attached financial statements Note 6 Amortization of intangibles 2020 2019 and 2018 years This note reflects that the amortization expense on intangibles namely its course development is forecast to decrease substantially from 2021 through to 2025 If no future investment is made this points to a downward investment in the future of the business in order to drive short term profitability and the share price at the expense of the long term growth of the business Keypath Australia is running out of growth Keypath Education has drawn a large portion of its growth from being one of the first movers into the Australian market with which Keypath Education found little competition This allowed Keypath Education to add from FY15 to FY18 three partners then another three in FY 19 However this slowed to two new partners and FY20 and in FY21 only one partner was added There is diminishing opportunities for Keypath to growth in Australia with much of the low hanging fruit in terms of partners and programs already developed Future of exiting programs Page 70 of the prospectus illustrates the expiry of Keypath Education s contracts A full 74 of contracts will expire over the next six years Over this time university partners boosted by Covid pushing their programs online are going to find ways to reduce costs and learn how to deliver successful online programs themselves There is no guarantee these contracts once they expire will roll forward to longer contracts and if they do the universities are likely to demand better terms once the industry is at maturity than they did in the growth phase for OPM over the last six years This is a major risk for Keypath as just as it is moving towards smaller losses it might find its revenue streams dry up with increased competition and lower margins offered by its existing partners Keypath in Canada and UK Keypath Education s business in the UK and Canada has been a failure Keypath found the Canadian and UK markets not conductive to the type of rapid growth a private equity business seeks in new markets This has resulted in little revenue growth in these markets and little prospect for future growth KeypathEdge fake eductech Keypath Education markets itself as an edutech business to boost its tech credentials However the fact is Keypath has little sophisticated technology much of its platforms are based on Microsoft platforms or other purchased software used for course development Keypath is not a tech business it is more accurately described as a marketing and sales business which is where the vast majority of its expenditure sits This is why it has high operating costs but relatively small investments in technology Another Macquarie Bank Pump and Dump Keypath Education is highly over valued based on its proposed offer price This will be a float like Macquarie Bank s other recent famous IPO Nuix which was tainted by inflated numbers fraud and has tanked and will be very unlikely to return to its IPO valuation Keypath has no path to profit requires massive investment just to keep pumping out new courses and due to the intense competition in the industry must spend a massive proportion of its revenues on marketing and staff to keep students from dropping out after finding the online learning experience less than satisfactory Read about another Macquarie IPO named NUIX https www afr com technology nuix committed cardinal sin of ipos says fund manager 20210519 p57t95 https www afr com

Opportunity, Investment Thesis Overall what makes MDXG a good buying opportunity right now is a combination of two factors Number one is management s miscommunication with the market The market currently believes that wound care is the core business of MDXG is not entirely aware of the potential of its biopharma pipeline and more specifically its Amniofix drug and has priced the company based on this Number two is the huge potential of the Amniofix treatment and its ability to become the next blockbuster in the healthcare space after the conclusion of its phase 3 trial Idea Summary MiMedx Group MDXG is a leading BioPharma and wound care business whose value has been drastically misunderstood by the market Through drivers such as miscommunication from management about the company s valued proposition as well as the lack of institutional investor coverage the market currently believes that the majority of the company s value sits in its low growth wound care business In reality its major competitive advantage is within its osteoarthritis drug Amniofix which has the potential to become the next blockbuster after it clears phase III clinical trials A sum of the parts valuation was used to determine a minimum implied upside of at least 300 Risks are discussed at the end Business Overview MiMedx Group is a leading biopharma and advanced wound care business utilizing human placental tissues to develop products used in the healthcare sector It processes placental tissues using its patented processes to produce allografts which are tissues transplanted from one person to another for wound care and regeneration These allografts are effective in healing difficult wounds because of the ability of the allograft cells to quickly associate with the cells of the patient thereby taking part in the healing process easing the ability of the body to close the wound and speeding up the body s regeneration process MDXG s product offerings can be split into two business segments wound care and biopharma surgical solutions Its flagship product Epifix and additional product Epicord fall under its wound care umbrella and its flagship product Amniofix as well as additional products Amniocord Amniofill and Epiburn fall under its biopharma umbrella The wound care products service the broad wound care industry targeting specifically chronic wounds The biopharma product line is more specific with the flagship treatment Amniofix targeting knee osteoarthritis in specific MDXG sells through direct sales sales agents and distributors in the United States This past quarter 95 of its sales were direct to customers such as healthcare professionals and facilities Internal Analysis The past 3 years have not been ideal for MDXG Its revenues began to dip in 2018 around the time of their accounting scandal the growth went from 40 in 2018 to 11 in 2019 and is currently around 16 This sent their stock price tumbling from 16 USD to lows of almost 1 USD though it is currently trading at 9 with new updates on their biopharma pipeline Their gross margin has stayed very high around 80 while their EBITDA margins have dropped over the years Though it wasn t explicitly disclosed a large part of this drop in EBITDA margins has been attributed to a temporary increase in legal fees due to the litigation MDXG has faced this past year Its decreased volume may have also suppressed margins as the number of wound care treatments in hospitals significantly dropped during COVID 19 The company s cash balance is sitting at a very high level of 84 mm This is in large part due to its recent capital raise which happened to be strongly criticized by one of MDXG s activist investors Prescience Point Capital discussed in detail later External Analysis Wound Care Market The global wound care market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4 1 from 2021 to 2028 This has been driven by the aging population and rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer Wound care products are increasingly being used to prevent and surgical site infections Though the overall market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4 1 the specific advanced product segment which includes products such as those of MDXG s which target chronic and non healing wounds is projected to grow much faster than 4 1 The wound care market is relatively fragmented with large players such as Integra LifeSciences 3M Johnson amp Johnson and Medtronic competing to gain the most market share MDXG s direct competition for its allograft advanced wound care treatments include Organogenesis Axogen Mediwound and Vericel Organogenesis is currently in the lead in this niche market and while MDXG reported an 11 YoY decline in sales in 2020 which has already been factored into the current price Organogenesis reported a 30 increase This is evident when comparing the stock performance of both companies over the past year figure 1 Osteoarthritis Therapy Market 91 million U S adults have arthritis 20M have knee OA and 32 million per year are currently treated for plantar fasciitis which is specifically targeted by MDXG s Amniofix drug There are very few FDA approved treatments for knee OA and plantar fasciitis and those that exist have low efficacy and many drawbacks Amniofix is currently the only treatment of its nature in phase 3 clinical trials that have posted very positive results in both company and independent trials has been used off label by gt 100K patients with zero severe adverse effects and consistently demonstrates a significant reduction in pain as reported by patients In addition Amniofix has an RMAT regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation granted by the FDA which allows for MDXG to benefit from an expedited approval process from the FDA Management Miscommunication The current market opinion of MDXG has been blurred by the miscommunication from company management whose goals do not align with maximizing shareholder value This is largely due to the fact that EW healthcare a private equity firm has 33 representation on the board as a result of its 17 stake From a corporate finance perspective a private equity firm s interests do not generally tend to align with those of public shareholders Their influence has been exacerbated by the fact that there are no large institutional holdings in MDXG as of yet other than Prescience Point and there has been minimal coverage on the stock leading to the market s opinion on the company being heavily skewed by management communications MDXG s current growth strategy is focused on roll ups in the wound care space This is very characteristic of a private equity playbook and goes alongside EW s historical acquisitions As was mentioned in the external analysis the wound care space is growing at a slow rate of 4 1 however MDXG has lost significant market share to Organogenesis Management has failed to realize that the current value driver of the business is within its biopharma line and not its wound care line yet has continually communicated to shareholders that it believes it is in fact wound care and it is going to continue investing in growing within the industry Prescience Point Capital an activist investor group which has advocated for change in MDXG s communication strategy has supported the fact that MDXG s communications have been focused on the wrong industry At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference the potential for the drug Amniofix was drastically undersold and much time was spent convincing investors that the core business is in wound care The 3 6 decline in shares two days after the conference illustrates how effective this strategy was There has been strong opposition from MDXG s board of directors to Prescience Point s activist efforts In a shareholder letter in early May prior to their annual meeting the company communicated that they believe the wound care and regenerative medicine direction being followed now is ideal They stated that the activist investor does not understand pharmaceutical company disclosure and were advocating for speculative actions themselves though Prescience s report discusses the opposite with them outlining how EW s influence on the board of directors is shifting the company s focus away from maximizing shareholder value Amniofix As mentioned in the external analysis there is currently no other treatment either in development or on the market as effective as Amniofix in treating knee OA and also just as safe Most recently at its Q1 earnings call MDXG CEO shared positive results from the phase IIb prospective trial of the treatment There was a statistically significant reduction in VAS visual analog score for pain and an improvement in the foot function index score There were also no serious adverse events during this clinical trial Amniofix is currently in phase III trials and MDXG believes they are on target to meet all criteria needed to find a biologics license application BLA so that the treatment can be introduced to the general public MDXG is aiming to file their BLA in the first half of 2022 meaning that within a year this blockbuster treatment could be on the market and given the feedback so far from clinical trials as well as the RMAT designation it is highly likely A Prescience Point market capture analysis estimated that the treatment would bring in 4 050 million of annual sales This is 8 times higher than the current sales brought in through wound care One year ago it would have been prudent to not entirely incorporate this into the share price however today with clinical trials nearing completion and MDXG s new RMAT designation the likelihood of approval is much higher Valuation From a valuation point of view a quick sum of the parts analysis is the most ideal given the two different business lines of MDXG A more in depth DCF can be created once more cost information is provided from MDXG after the conclusion of clinical trials Shares outstanding of 109 8 mm total debt of 51 8 mm and total cash of 84 7mm were used to convert from enterprise value to equity value The current implied upside was calculated using the current price of 9 46 Wound Care Valuation MDXG s FY 2021 sales guidance assumed 255 mm to 270 mm in revenue from the wound care segment Different points in this revenue ranged were used for the low base and high cases of the valuation An EV Revenue multiple was used to calculate implied enterprise value The comparables analysis shown in figure 2 illustrated the median multiples derived from the analysis done using the aforementioned list of MDXG s competitors A median multiple of 5 3x was used The median was used and not marked down because the gross margin and UFCF yield of MDXG is in line with all competitors Though the EBIDTA multiple was lower the similar yield and gross margins indicate that company performance is relatively the same In addition litigation expenses factored into the lower EBIDTA multiples and thus it is not indicative of recurring performance Based on the revenue multiples implied share values for the wound care segment range between 12 0 and 12 8 Wound Care Equity Value https preview redd it dibh93jl1a071 png width 549 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 2c1871e08591796daa0a434274332cd9a4353258 Biopharma Valuation Prescience Point estimated annual revenues from Amniofix through using the market capture method The total market size annual knee OA injections was estimated and a capture percentage was applied to determine the annual number of patients receiving the Amniofix injection Prescience assumed 1 5 injections per year but to be more conservative in this valuation 1 was used Price per injection and FDA approval probability varied by the cases and were used to adjust the EV Rev multiple downwards Overall an implied share value range between 25 4 and 57 1 was calculated for this segment https preview redd it we0pw4jm1a071 png width 611 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 567d19cc5acc59acbe552a2afcf09789c80866ff Biopharma Equity Value Overall the total implied share price ranges between 37 43 to 69 81 As more information regarding Amniofix comes out including the price of manufacturing different multiples can be used to fine tune the analysis https preview redd it a8035yfo1a071 png width 517 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 12e0f9a041e326b505bfda25304261367c651406 Risks 1 Given the high influence EW healthcare has on the board of directors there is potential for more value to describe acquisitions such as that of stability biologics which was bought for 10 million and sold for 3 5 million 3 years later If such a trend continues the value of MDXG s wound care business can dramatically decrease which will hurt the share pierce 2 The FDA approval of Amniofix is a large driver of the valuation calculated There is a large risk that the FDA will not approve the treatment however with the RMAT designation in place and positive results from the first two phases of clinical trials the odds are strongly in the favour of the approval at the current point in time Overall MDXG has been strongly misrepresented by management leading to a skewed opinion and pricing by the market

nobody knows about it yet,I have done so much DD on this play and I really want to share it with you guys since WSB is the reason I started investing over a year ago In this post I m going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed Hint it crashed big time yesterday You know the one There is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space How much Well 7 EXABYTES and it s currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days I m going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I ve posted to recently involving this particular one Topics of discussion Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2 12 weeks WDC Fundamentals Bear case If you are reading this on May 20th you are early WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory WDC was a beaten down stock in 2018 after NAND SSD memory prices declined and analysts thought that HDDs spinning disk hard drives were going the way of the dinosaur They did saw a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices think external drives for work from home setups but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end By all accounts it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend yielding boomer stock WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 with revenues down only 1 compared to the 20 that analysts expected The EPS was way higher than expected non gaap was expected to be around 0 68 and WDC delivered 1 02 The analysts are already wrong and they don t know what else is coming The new currency thing that I won t name They didn t even mention it in the earnings call None of the investors on the line in the Q amp A even asked about it It s totally under the radar In the next quarter WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result possibly by a gigantic unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency When this happens this stock is going to test its ATHs at around 110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past This stock can double and it s going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC s next earnings call This is expected first week of August Fundamentals WDC is an American company they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S amp P 500 index since 2009 This is a solid company we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold we are betting on gold turning to diamond WDC has like 64k employees and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016 They own their own supply chain so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about 70 per share They saw some spikes to 75 recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out plus S amp P indexes falling and selling off here and there Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news This company has been stagnant for a while but they are ready to expand They want to be a growth company again and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay The new reality is not priced in WDC s TAM market just increased 50 and nobody knows about it An industry expert at Forbes Tom Coughlin has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021 Next quarter they are expected to ship around the same amount WDC says there is seasonality but I really don t see it in the numbers WDC owns somewhere about 35 40 of the HDD market and around 17 of the SSD market The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300 petabytes daily at this point Even after yesterday s events the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50 of it s value it s still worth buying HDDs over MSRP Farmers can buy HDDs at 50 per TB double the msrp market rate before the rise and break even in 1 month This is unheard of in the space That s how profitable this is While it s hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer it s worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for 400 WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make If we apply WDC s market share to the current size of the network we are looking at conservatively 2 5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for Let s look at it another way with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1 90 days that means WDC ships 1 38 exabytes daily Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long term contracts so say 700 petabytes daily If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily and 40 of those drives are WDC that s an extra 17 more demand than anyone so far knows about If that doesn t seem like a lot it s because it s massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality The network space is a lagging indicator People buy hard drives ahead of time and fill them with plots over time Plotting speed is the bottleneck Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased waiting to be consumed or even more And its not only farmers buying drives scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB They are sold out Supply is also a bottleneck the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage For all intents and purposes that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers If they could deliver double the storage to consumers at 1 4 exabytes per day they would probably still sell all of them But wait there s more WDC also makes SSDs and Seagate does not Seagate has 0 2 marketshare of SSDs I didn t think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs and the go to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC But I was wrong Just this morning I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock there are only 2 available SN750 2TBs are out of stock SN 850s are sold out I ll go into why this is significant A company called Phison makes SSD controllers They recently said they are raising their prices 10 due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock Yeah WDC makes their own controllers for those They don t need Phison If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it s lagging behind HDD but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly so buying NVMEs are not one time purchases they are like the gas the fuels the car They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually Bear case Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure the new currency is well positioned and strong It s not going to 0 because of a market crash I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay and the demand will persist for potentially years but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price Since the pandemic the price has gone up as datacenters are forced to expand but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC s sails even apart from the new currency s affects Summary TL DR HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out Price increases are imminent and SSDs could follow soon All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30 50 or 100 premiums None of this was accounted for in WDC s most recent earnings call and the price has not reacted to it yet This thing is a ticking time bomb WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space Positions 157 shares Canadians unite https i imgur com 6y4p3ax jpg 1 leap Jan 23 70c https i imgur com SAqvMhA jpg I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to 150 If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80 90c If WDC s next earnings are the catalyst the July calls may not be the best value but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August If you are a real smooth brain ape you can t go wrong with shares There is virtually no downside risk WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency STONKS ONLY GO UP

knows about it yet,I have done so much DD on this play and I really want to share it with you guys since WSB is the reason I started investing over a year ago In this post I m going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed Hint it crashed big time yesterday You know the one There is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space How much Well 7 EXABYTES and it s currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days I m going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I ve posted to recently involving this particular one Topics of discussion Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2 12 weeks WDC Fundamentals Bear case If you are reading this on May 20th you are early WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory WDC was a beaten down stock in 2018 after NAND SSD memory prices declined and analysts thought that HDDs spinning disk hard drives were going the way of the dinosaur WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices think external drives for work from home setups during Covid but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end By all accounts it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend yielding boomer stock WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 with revenues down only 1 compared to the 20 that analysts expected The EPS was way higher than expected non gaap was expected to be around 0 68 and WDC delivered 1 02 The analysts are already wrong and they don t know what else is coming The new currency thing that I won t name They didn t even mention it in the earnings call None of the investors on the line in the Q amp A even asked about it It s totally under the radar In the next quarter WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result possibly by a gigantic unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency When this happens this stock is going to test its ATHs at around 110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past This stock can double and it s going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC s next earnings call This is expected first week of August Fundamentals WDC is an American company they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S amp P 500 index since 2009 This is a solid company we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold we are betting on gold turning to diamond WDC has like 64k employees and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016 They own their own supply chain so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about 70 per share They saw some spikes to 75 recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out plus S amp P indexes falling and selling off here and there Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news This company has been stagnant for a while but they are ready to expand They want to be a growth company again and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay The new reality is not priced in WDC s TAM market just increased 50 and nobody knows about it An industry expert at Forbes Tom Coughlin has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021 Next quarter they are expected to ship around the same amount WDC says there is seasonality but I really don t see it in the numbers WDC owns somewhere about 35 40 of the HDD market and around 17 of the SSD market The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300 petabytes daily at this point Even after yesterday s events the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50 of it s value it s still worth buying HDDs over MSRP Farmers can buy HDDs at 50 per TB double the msrp market rate before the rise and break even in 1 month This is unheard of in the space That s how profitable this is While it s hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer it s worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for 400 WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make If we apply WDC s market share to the current size of the network we are looking at conservatively 2 5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for Let s look at it another way with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1 90 days that means WDC ships 1 38 exabytes daily Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long term contracts so say 700 petabytes daily If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily and 40 of those drives are WDC that s an extra 17 more demand than anyone so far knows about If that doesn t seem like a lot it s because it s massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality The network space is a lagging indicator People buy hard drives ahead of time and fill them with plots over time Plotting speed is the bottleneck Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased waiting to be consumed or even more And its not only farmers buying drives scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB They are sold out Supply is also a bottleneck the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage For all intents and purposes that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers If they could deliver double the storage to consumers at 1 4 exabytes per day they would probably still sell all of them But wait there s more WDC also makes SSDs and Seagate does not Seagate has 0 2 marketshare of SSDs I didn t think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs and the go to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC But I was wrong Just this morning I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock there are only 2 available SN750 2TBs are out of stock SN 850s are sold out I ll go into why this is significant A company called Phison makes SSD controllers They recently said they are raising their prices 10 due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock Yeah WDC makes their own controllers for those They don t need Phison If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it s lagging behind HDD but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly so buying NVMEs are not one time purchases they are like the gas the fuels the car They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually Bear case Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure the new currency is well positioned and strong It s not going to 0 because of a market crash I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay and the demand will persist for potentially years but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price Since the pandemic the price has gone up as datacenters are forced to expand but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC s sails even apart from the new currency s affects The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well If they are really bearish on the currency they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he s got a background in tech of course but more specifically in Cisco He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend If he is looking to transform WDC I think this is the perfect opportunity for him Summary TL DR HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out Price increases are imminent and SSDs could follow soon All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30 50 or 100 premiums None of this was accounted for in WDC s most recent earnings call and the price has not reacted to it yet This thing is a ticking time bomb WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space Positions 157 shares Canadians unite https i imgur com 6y4p3ax jpg 1 leap Jan 23 70c https i imgur com SAqvMhA jpg I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to 150 If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80 90c If WDC s next earnings are the catalyst the July calls may not be the best value but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August If you are a real smooth brain ape you can t go wrong with shares There is virtually no downside risk WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency STONKS ONLY GO UP

armature securities analyst for about 6 7 years now 3 I m careful about where I put my money Pubmatic is a compelling investment so lets get into it What is Pubmatic Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community In a nutshell their platform as a service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads Pubmatic is known as an SSP or supply side platform Supply being ad inventory on a publisher s website Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand side platform or DSP and the whole transaction happens automatically This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever Here is a high level info graphic amp x200B https preview redd it 555339dhob071 png width 1920 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2 I would encourage you to look into this further as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about The SSP Market Unlike the DSP side of the equation the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized I ve found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10 20 SSPs at a time So how does an SSP compete The competition There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another Technology and scale are the two that come to mind If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features it s an easier sell to publishers Additionally if an SSP can operate at a large scale they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers and can provide better fees Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite fact check needed The biggest players in this market are Google Facebook and Amazon These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet They are often called walled gardens Think about youtube ads for example Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations no need for Pubmatic They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube So they play both sides of the market It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us However the open internet is still very much alive and growing and this is where Pubmatic competes History lesson section I ll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I ll post it in the next DD Historical context is important to the story Basically though the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts If you look back Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they ve needed to reinvent their products a few times over Some examples are the rise of header bidding and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome This is why Pubmatic doesn t hold any debt Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts Pubmatic s Moat 1 I don t have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat 1 First 1 Pubmatic s net dollar based retention rate is 130 up from 121 last year That tells me that for one reason or another more ad dollars are flowing through their platform This is probably due to the SPO deals that they ve been cutting or supply path optimization These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with and drives up market share for Pubmatic They ve been making these deals for a while now and it s a big growth driver Smaller SSPs are going to suffer but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon 2 Second 1 Management describes their competitive advantage as being an infrastructure first company This is unique they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS I ll get into their financials later but I like this part of their business Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS so they re giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon who also competes with them So you can see how that s a problem Also by owning their own infrastructure Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers They are still working on this but theoretically they could offer lower prices and faster speeds They aren t there yet however Take a look at their cost per ad impression amp x200B https preview redd it kffnxp4gob071 png width 961 amp format png amp auto webp amp s db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed A nice downtrend on the costs This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach And yes the T on the left is TRILLION They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month 1 One final note on the moat creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as generic or not interesting but the numbers tell a much different story Lets get into that next Pubmatic product and revenue mix This will be in the next post 1 High level 1 Mostly mobile ad sales 2 omnichannel meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels desktop CTV mobile etc 3 One note about CTV 1 Linear TV boomer style cable television is going by the way side in favor of connected tv or CTV CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market so it is all up for grabs Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney Roku Fubo Magnite through Spotx M amp A and others Pubmatic has a CTV implementation but they were late to the party That said they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV so now it s just a matter of selling it They ll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors Financial condition 1 This is the part that gets very interesting Pubmatic s financial condition is really something special 1 18 5 GAAP net profit margin for 2020 2 32 EBITDA margin 3 Zero debt 4 73 Gross profit margin 5 7 years of positive free cash flow These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here Nothing about these numbers is generic If Magnite s products are so much better and if Magnite is a market leader why are they losing market share and not growing organically Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale Why haven t they been able to achieve high profitability Seems to me that Pubmatic isn t so generic after all But again I am not an expert in adtech so please please fill me in if you know more Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years even with the COVID headwinds Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20 I ll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation hint it s higher than 1 6 billion I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability Often times with IPOs the company has to go out and prove that they can make it or that they can grow into profitability Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses Magnite is still 1 2 years away from profitability that makes it more speculative The next Trade Desk I ve heard this before Bottom line the SSP and DSP markets are different There is no next trade desk The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren t right in front of the advertisers Advertisers pay for the internet not publishers That said Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates very similar to TTD Short interest 1 Most people seem to be the most interested in this part which is understandable I find the above more compelling myself but lets get into it 1 Public float 1 7 million shares 2 Yes you heard that right just 7 million shares are available for purchase It s not a mistake 2 Institutional ownership 1 North of 90 2 This is what makes the public float so small 3 Short percentage 1 North of 50 2 This is not a mistake it really is that high 3 What s more it seems like there is just one fund shorting this stock Northern Lights Trust Fund II fact check needed I looked into their SEC filings but I couldn t find where the short sales were shown 4 Speculation time 1 Tin foil hat activated Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic By almost every measure Pubmatic is a better company Wouldn t it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic If they didn t short to such a high degree my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue That would be very embarrassing for Magnite so they need Pubmatic s price to struggle And why not With such a low float and low volume it wouldn t be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree How could a smaller company pubmatic with better profitability better margins and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite Is SpotX really that good What if the Disney contract falls through Magnite is a good company but I see red flags all over Doesn t make much sense Tin foil hat deactivated Risks 1 The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch 1 Rebuttal 1 Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn t hold any debt Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient I have worked with similar teams in the past 2 Again Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness 2 The oligopolistic internet super powers I e Google figure out a way to crush them 1 Rebuttal 1 This is a risk but they haven t been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far In order to do this these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet This is a very low risk The open internet isn t going anywhere 3 Ad dollars drying up 1 Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue global economic meltdown they lose reveune 1 Rebuttal 2 We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic Nevertheless Pubmatic grew their revenue so they ve shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind 4 Transparency 1 This is a weak point for Pubmatic Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed For example a family theme park isn t going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand They also want to defend against ad fraud or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn t buy anything Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it 1 Rebuttal 2 Pubmatic needs to work on this They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products where they provide a refund if fraud is detected So that is good but I think they can do more Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible even to bots I m not sure what else they could do but I think this could be a good selling point I know that they ve been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers so that is good Again I think they could do more on this That said they aren t having any trouble selling their products so maybe this isn t too big of an issue At the very least management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers That s it for now Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence I have more to post so please bear with me as I am very busy
