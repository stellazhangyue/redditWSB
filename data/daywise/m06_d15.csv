OTT sports streaming service with 85 live channels of sports focused programming Company fundamentals FUBO has 35k SVOD assets and 50k live events including the largest football package in the US NFL amp NCAA and the highest number of regional sports networks in the US Key drivers for growth include 1 secular decline of traditional TV 2 shift of advertising dollars from traditional TV to connected devices 3 online wagering betting 4 FUBO is a young company founded 2015 compared to peers such as NFLX ROKU 25 years old and KPIs are growing at triple digit rates Subscriber metrics Total subscriber count for vMVPDs is 11mm households vs 73mm traditional paid TV households Over the next 10 years the executive expects the secular decline of traditional TV will continue and for the subscriber count to drop to as few as 25mm households He expects vMVPDs to capture a significant amount of these traditional TV cord cutters as subscription fatigue sets in for SVOD and AVOD services this will become especially prominent as monthly sub prices increase e g Disney increased 1 month in Mar 21 He anticipates 2026 4 5 years from now will be an inflection point where vMVPDs will become larger than traditional cable services The executive highlighted that FUBO s sub count typically declines going into Q1 but picks up significantly in Q3 amp Q4 as fans become re engaged with football season in Q3 20 FUBO added 165k subs Hulu 700k YouTube 500k Sling 200k vMVPDs vs SVOD The executive identified headwinds for SVOD services which will likely limit their long term growth requiring them to more widely distribute content on other services including vMVPDs These are 1 for SVOD services excl NFLX the cost associated with producing content coupled with the low hit rate of shows is too capital intensive to limit content to their own platforms 2 as the growth in SVOD sub counts slows their profits will decrease but production costs will remain the same or increase In addition long term the executive expects more simulcast on cable vMVPDs in order for the cable companies to maximize the value of their content The need to distribute content on vMVPDs will spark a second wave of growth on the vMVPD side Betting Wagering The executive remains highly optimistic on FUBO s entrance into sports betting due to 1 FUBO has brand awareness within sports and enormous sports content I do not see why we could not get to 5 of the betting market which is a 70bn market 2 Vigtory acquisition the asset is a fully functioning sports book that FUBO has continued to build upon and improve 3 state licenses FUBO secured 3 licenses in Q1 21 IA IN NJ and could launch in 80 of markets by the end of 2022 if needed 4 competition FUBO s core vMVPD competitors are giants such as GOOGL YouTube DKNG and other pure betting companies are much smaller 5 upward trend in vMVPDs gaining sports betting share vMVPDs had 2 8 of the market in 2019 5 5 today Long term FUBO s betting platform will have key competitive advantages which include 1 authenticating the video user with the betting app FUBO will have the betslip open directly to the game being watched on TV vs opening an app and having to find the correct game 2 prop betting FUBO has engaged users watching live games which opens up more opportunities within prop betting vs competitors e g if a user loves field goals FUBO will bring up a quad view of 4 NFL games all close to having a field goal attempted ARPU FUBO started at 6 99 month in 2015 61 00 month today He attributes the 10x ARPU increase to 1 strong product platform 2 targeting customers who understand the value of FUBO s bundle 40yo males 3 branding FUBO has 10 15 more sports content than competitors 4 value added functions such as 4k quad view calendar view for sporting events etc Price inflation FUBO dropped churn in Q3 21 despite raising prices and continues to see q q growth Peers such as Sling and DIS saw lackluster sub growth in Q4 amp Q1 and highlighted the headwinds they are facing were based on price increases Long term the executive believes FUBO will continue to be more shielded from price inflation vs peers due to 1 95 of FUBO s users are sports fans if only 30 of consumers who have cable watch sports a price increase due to sports programming will isolate the other 70 of the audience 2 adding wagering which is at a 50 gross margin will be another revenue stream to handle price inflation 3 media companies who are paying 60 100 more for broadcasting rights will pass this on to users which will shrink their audience and decreasing advertising revenue they will need to distribute further to make up for this lost revenue so vMVPDs will benefit Direct Q amp A There have been customer complaints about uneven video quality on FuboTV can he discuss this A Because we control our own video coding and delivery there was a point in 2019 where we were 12 or 13 seconds from the edge and there is a FCC broadcast rule which requires a delay of 9 seconds in case of emergencies We found people cared more about the quality of the video rather than the lag We could always change it back whenever we want but for now we still find customers continue to care more about the quality Explain the Net present value of a subscriber of a traditional cable sub vs a virtual cable sub A The number of attachments sold was 1 23mm in March 2021 With 129 hours of viewership we will continue to be able to improve our ability to sell more attachments Right now we are at about 840 of revenue on a run rate basis and we will probably hit 2k long term including wagering and any additional attachments we would be selling It would also include commerce we added a button on videos which leads consumers to a commerce platform if clicked so it is like a mini Amazon ecosystem where sports and betting are the hook Outside of soccer and possibly gambling what exclusive content does Fubo have A I believe content should be fully distributed in order to be fully monetized In terms of what we have today de facto exclusive is all NY hockey the Knicks all Boston local sports with the Bruins Red Sox Patriots Celtics Chicago Cubs Pittsburgh Penguins and Pirates the Houston Astros and Rockets and Pac 12 teams In the shorter term can Fubo become a greater aggregator of content where they bundle OTT streaming services and integrate them for on demand viewing A It is certainly possible but not rational The entertainment piece is important because it drives usage and stickiness Sports only is basically about PPV and the churn rate is 35 Even with this churn the service still showed value because these consumers signed up had a great experience rated 5 stars and dropped after their team lost in the playoffs they got what they wanted Entertainment allows us to improve our retention because it is an expensive product so it is important to have the consumers come to our platform consistently That is reflected in our churn numbers in which we have had 8 quarters of sequential churn decline Most smart TVs are fairly limited in the number of buttons on the remotes how do you approach this from a UI UX perspective when competing against phone based sports betting apps A As long as you have anything with a pointer and arrows you will be fine You ll see it on Roku in the next 5 weeks or so when we are launching our free to play predictive games Apple will be different we are not planning on launching them soon because it is a more robust platform so we will do more with it

the likes of GM Daimler and Ford in the sub 600 cubic feet class while the 650 1200 cubic feet cargo capacity space is left largely ignored The main reason being that vehicles over 10000 lbs require a Professional driver and costs associated with increase in skill required Workhorse is focused in BOTH the 650 1200 cubic feet range AND 10000lb gvw class I found that information hidden away in a scroll called a 10 k amp x200B Traditional OEMs Ford eTransit GM EV600 both have 600 cubic feet cargo capacity or less Late 2021 production Freightliner has both the ECascadia class 8 and eM2 class 6

I originally discovered Workhorse digging through daily ARK invest movement emails I found it interesting to see Cathie grabbing extraordinary amounts of shares in the company so I looked further into them I was disappointed to see them exit their position but I have added an additional 200 shares to my portfolio since I found out Workhorse was probably way ahead of itself when it reached 40 That doesn t make it Deadhorse just because it missed out on one government contract The government will need electrified fleets Workhorse might stand a chance who knows I miss flying my drone I crashed it into a darn tree and ever since videos of the Horsefly on youtube have had to fill the void Not the same but it s like watching an airplane play Tetris I did not provide a list of catalysts use the

this subreddit a lot in the past and people have been burned on it as well I ve lost thousands on PLTR but i m still holding because the company is beyond incredible One of the biggest questions i ve seen that nobody truly understands is What is Palantir What do they do so let me attempt to explain wtf they do Precursor this isn t an in depth analyses of PLTR fundamentals and financials If you want to look at their fundamentals you can check some other dd like this one https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments n9ydod palantirs pltr fundamentals just became even It s about a month old but it s still incredibly relevant now This post is meant to address the general question of what PLTR is as a company what they do and bring some general attention to the interesting options volume this week This is not financial advice Do your own research The more research i did in PLTR the more bullish i became TL DR PLTR visualizes abstract data in a meaningful way for any business to easily analyze and efficiently run their business PLTR is a modular system that allows for companies to connect with each other seemlessly creating an interconnected community for data to travel which will create waves in how business is conducted PLTR is an engineering master piece that is incredibly unique For anyone to compete with them will be difficult to put it lightly PLTR has been sleeping for a while it s ready for a rally if we can get enough attention due to high Open Interest and low IV Karp is a Giga Chad https encrypted tbn3 gstatic com images q tbn ANd9GcQwLx qpgHrcSU27NjPrIq6LBMCkjMG6HIfjZCcVKRmhQmlyNwx What is Palantir Palantir is a platform for data analytics and ai I ve seen this thrown around quite a bit and honestly wtf does that mean I m a programmer and even i don t fucking get it Well all became clear after the demo day https www youtube com watch v EFP3sBQfaww came out where finally PLTR showcased their platforms which people are sleepin on Before we can answer what PLTR is we need to answer what is data Data is the logical representation of the real world Any largescale business will always collect a ton of data most often stored in texts such as spreadsheets or databases which requires programming knowledge to navigate through So what does PLTR do with this data Well they consolidate a company s data and displays it in a comprehensible easily digestible UI for the company to use Note that they take company s data PLTR doesn t gather or store any data of it s own Easy right This allows for pretty much any company organization like the CDC for medicine https www wsj com articles palantir to help u s track covid 19 vaccines 11603367276 the military for national security https www palantir com palantir gotham 21 launch and the stock market for financial fraud https twitter com PalantirTech status 1399747624463486986 stock market is only rumors for now but hopefully PLTR HELP US FIND THE HEDGIES THAT MANIPULATE THE MARKET But how insane is this Working with that much data is a nightmare In a society where data is already a necessity being able to look through and analyze data quickly for any anomalies or patterns is crucial to any company and is often overwhelming With PLTR a normal non technical operator can click their computer to pull up an order or an issue that PLTR detected make any changes and or notify whoever needs the attention Let s take the CDC for example When the vaccine rolled out PLTR had a huge hand in this PLTR gives visual display of where the vaccine is going how many and any issues that has risen if any allowing for fast response time You can imagine PLTR displaying a map with the various routes to different deployment sites with pictures of a little truck representing the shipments being routed to their destination An operator can click 1 of these shipments routes and pull up any data of that specific point With data being displayed and organized in this way it makes it easy to analyze data where are things going what kind of picture does the data represent rather than staring at a spreadsheet of numbers Now this is just an example PLTR is general enough and customizable enough where it can represent any business organization s structure Once data is organized it opens up the possibility for even further opportunities such as creating simulations of potential issues that can happen in order to forsee and plan for various situations It allows data to be clean enough to train machine learning algorithms a big problem with ML is that data isn t clean or has weird edge cases that fucks up the model If you talk to any data ml engineer they will typically mention most of their job is cleaning data over actual application Companies can create scripts or AI to respond to events if needed It can be as simple as notifying an executive if an issue occurs or completely issuing a rollback order if there s a sudden spike of side effects for the covid vaccine which will be represented in the data It s the ultimate data representation analysis platform that any company can utilize and it s fucking insane i still casn t believe PLTR managed to do this But it brings up a few problems Why Palantir Why can t companies just create their own platform Because it s expensive time consuming and complicated A common issue large companies have is simply having too much data Take the automotive industry for example and self driving Driving data needs to be collected and stored for AI That s a lot of data like pentabytes of data if not more Now let s say there s data being collected in America the signs and the messages on side walks are different than those that are in the UK If you have a dataset from the UK well that data comes with it s own issues and rules this creates a problem called data silos meaning data is separated into it s own little circle separated from other data silos If the company decides to make a platform to analyze these 2 different types of data they will have to consolidate organize and create 2 kinds of platforms for it Now this example is only 2 large businesses have dozens of data silos that are often abandoned or isolated PLTR is a generalized platform that encompasses any and all kinds of data which they themselves work closely with companies in order to cater to what they need Why can t companies create a general platform themselves Because it s an engineering nightmare and PLTR is an engineering masterpiece It is so insanely difficult to create something general enough to fit any and all data but PLTR has done exactly that The best comparison i can correlate this to is computers Before generalized computers computers would be built and deployed to do 1 job and 1 job only Once generalized computers came out it s used everywhere and no company develops their own computer for a single job they go out and buy a computer in this case any company that manages data can benefit from PLTR Another benefit we see from PLTR is that PLTR is 1 huge modular system If a person from 1 company wants to share data with another company that utilizes PLTR they can do so seemlessly PLTR talks with each other and easily sends data to and from Imagine if hospitals or universities adapted this system You no longer have to manually print a transcript and submit it to the other university s administration and then wait for it to be processed for a few days If your medical records are stored in 1 hospital and you get sent to the ER in another hospital your main hospital can send your medical records to the ER you re at seemlessly and quickly Its insane how misunderstood PLTR is but it s a far reaching company that will dig into the roots of all whether you jump into it or not all i m doing is trying to have it move sooner than later Deep roots are not reached by the forst Karp is a giga chad Fucking guy got the intelligence of Elon Musk if not more and the hair to fucking prove it If you want to witness it first hand listen to some of his interviews https www youtube com watch v hjjHdys2Ph4 A lot of his philosophies are amazing and I believe in his abilities to make PLTR go to the moon If anyone s worried that the military may drop PLTR here ya go https www defensenews com land 2019 03 29 palantir who successfully sued the army just won a major army contract Why now I did a DD on AMC a week ago calling the rally from 20 gt 70 Will the same happen with PLTR It can but it ll need some help Not gonna explain how the squeeze works as it s beyond the scope of this post If you want check out the DD i did on AMC https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nqa5x8 why amc is rallying and why it will continue i explain the idea there PLTR Option Chain from Yahoo Finance https preview redd it e10egiyiac571 png width 1363 amp format png amp auto webp amp s db92a97940da7189c65e524fe3e6595c70eb638e fucking options volume is even higher than AMC when i did AMC s DD Now PLTR has a larger market cap than AMC so we probably won t see a run up as large as AMC but it s still a great stock with great opportunity If we can get enough people to get on PLTR it can definitely pop The options volume is spread out very nicely through the 20 30 range which is perfect for launching the price forward Meme stocks typically has a second coming GME had a 2nd wind BB had a 2nd wind AMC s 2nd wind is nuttier than it s first one ffs it looks like it s about time for PLTR to have it s 2nd wind but it needs more attention Why not AMC GME BB etc I love memes and have made a lot of money off memes As much as I love AMC and GME I sold at the top I sold AMC at 70 and i sold GME at 400 Why Because Meme stocks need to cool down This isn t because of hedgies or any kind of attacks Stocks that are very volatile causes their options to be ridiculously expensive which prevents the potential for a rally from happening because it s much harder for people to buy in options Ultimately I don t want to be a bag holder and i don t want others to be bag holding rip GME 400 holders and AMC 70 holders Everyone should look for selling opportunities for GME it was RH closing down and AMC was when the rally ran it s course Check the AMC DD above if you need proof i updated the post as soon as i sold at 70 GME unfortunately I have no proof for I will still look for opportunities to buy into GME AMC again once it s cooled down a bit but for now PLTR is really cheap volatility is really low and we re sitting at the floor right now with huge potential for it to explode People have been burnt before when PLTR was cooling off from the past but now the second coming is near We re at the floor right now so if the narrative doesn t play out it s also just a great stock to hold Reversal Exit Unfortunately PLTR doesn t have the same attention as AMC did when i wrote the last DD so in order for it to pop off this week PLTR will need some love Even if not enough people realizes how amazing it actually is then it ll just sit steady and grow over time For PLTR i don t really have an exit If it does rally i will sell and let it cool but i ll update this post if that happens If that doesn t ever happen then i ll just keep PLTR as a long term hold and re allocate funds to riskier plays based on my risk tolerance and when opportunity arises Other than that I m more than happy to hold PLTR for years to come PLTR already has pretty much everything i own right now All my money my commitment my wife o o PLTR is my wife s boyfriend amp x200B Position 4250 shares at 23 32 40x 27 calls 7 9 10x 30 calls 7 9 I do think PLTR will moon sooner sometime within the week with enough attention but I don t want to get dicked by Theta so i bought calls a bit further out I plan on buying weeklies tomorrow morning for the big dick yolo 47x 30 calls 1 21 22 the long term hold

morning gamblers For a brief overview Canoo is a Los Angeles based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles with over 300 employees from leading technology and automotive companies link https www canoo com about Their unique selling point is a modular platform purpose built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses This skateboard platform is largely what drew Apple s interest The platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car s electronics allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design It also features steer by wire technology which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry link https www theverge com 2021 1 12 22225026 apple canoo acquisition investment electric car goev Canoo is bringing its first vehicle to market next year with its electric microbus van available at a base price of 34 750 before tax incentives or add ons It s now taking preorders in the United States for the lifestyle vehicle as well as for its round top pickup truck and multi purpose delivery van Canoo is taking a different route than many other electric vehicle manufacturers which played a role in the interest from Apple and Hyundai Canoo s trio of vehicles all have the same proprietary skateboard platform architecture that houses the batteries and electric drivetrain in a chassis that sits under the vehicle s cabin This contributes to a similar design language between the vehicles which all have the same wide front windshield and relatively low profile link https techcrunch com 2021 05 17 canoos electric microbus will start under 35000 when it comes to market next year A quick glance at its balance sheet shows that they aren t at risk of running out of cash anytime soon Their total assets are 717 8M of which cash and cash equivalents are 641 9M and

cap of 2 3 Billion This is primarily due to an overhaul in management as well as a change in the business model which favored protecting Canoo s IP instead of providing it to other OEMs still ended up bring the SP down short term since it was radically different from when they went public 2 Shorts running into a wall 150 000 shares are left available to borrow at a rate of 24 5 which is 0 15 of the entire float so shorts are about to hit a wall in terms of how easy it is to manipulate the share price link https iborrowdesk com report goev 3 Possible PT unlike all the other information which is part data part speculation this is pure speculation since we re talking about pre revenue but I really think you could easily 10x the current share price if it s a momentum based squeeze since it s a short term event that isn t based on technicals Valuations based on fundamentals aren t really the same as they were a couple of years ago and given the low interest rate easy access to cash the question really is how high can it go Since institutions don t hold the majority of the float they currently only hold 24 of the float but have increased their position by 120 in the last month and there should therefore theoretically be a smaller likelihood of shenanigans with lower price manipulation this could easily 10x the current share price to 100 if more retail become aware of the company s potential and buy in to their long term vision and additional institutions start buying in Personally speaking I like to look at market caps to see how high things can go with GME and AMC both were hovering under a 20 Billion market cap before AMC blew open the gates a couple of weeks back Other tickers that went up in the last week like WISH and CLOV however hit around a 10 Billion market cap before coming back down If we use that 10B market cap to be conservative that still gets us to almost 50 which is 5x the current share price and since you can make a case for Canoo s short interest being higher than the previous two cases I don t see why it couldn t reach that by the end of the month or even within a week if shorts start to cover and bring the house down Upcoming catalysts 1 Upcoming investor day this Thursday June 17th which will be a hybrid in person and virtual journey into Canoo s product portfolio and business strategy link https canooirday com 2 Canoo is

should know about the russell rebalance 2020 06 22 On a final note this is not financial advice so please don t treat it as such do your own due diligence read your own news study their financials and evaluate multiple perspectives bullish and bearish to see what others are saying Don t invest money you re not willing to lose and do so at your own risk TLDR Canoo is among the healthiest EV startups out there 641 9 million in cash only 6 9 million in long term debt and a market cap of just 2 3 billion with a lt 10 share price This is the company that Apple wanted to buy and Hyundai wanted to partner with Other EVs have the same market cap and may not even have the cash to make it through the next 3 months so Canoo really should be trading at multiples of where it is atm Price is trending

the lumber from your grandmas porch to get some free cash amp nbsp ASTS is a satellite company which allows 5G internet cell phone connectivity anywhere in the world through your existing cell phone In short ASTS represents an attractive asymmetric bet in the following ways Space Launch Market Competition It seems every week there is a new article about how cheap launches are becoming due to increased competition SpaceX Blue Origin among others have brought space into the mainstream and are allowing for repeatable launches Billionaires are throwing away cash just to win some twitter space race The question here is who actually stands to gain from cheaper launches The International Space Stations 10 Astronauts trying to satisfy their coke addiction and a satellite company like ASTS https i imgur com 8QqoIDQ jpeg Customer Acquisition ASTS works with existing telecom providers and does not need to acquire customers pay for marketing or gain approval for spectrum usage By signing with existing telcos all ASTS needs to do is launch a patent protected satellite and collect a check 5G Fund 9 Billion in government funds are in play for rural 5G expansion AT amp T is working with ASTS to gain access to this money Microsoft believes 157m Americans do not have access to broadband internet ASTS solves this Sold off ASTS has been wrapped up in a space market correction without participants understanding the value this company adds At current levels you are buying in below investors like Vodafone and Rakuten who have all vetted this company and have a vested interest in the company s success American Tower is invested and is essentially hedging their business against the success of ASTS removing the need for Cell Phone towers Take a second to look at their chart and thereby the proliferation of cell towers and think of Satellites replacing their entire business structure amp nbsp What makes ASTS Different A comparison chart https i imgur com 3jzbOoB png Something with less words for the High Schoolers who forgot their Ritalin today https i imgur com 01RnI87 png amp nbsp Iridium currently sits at a 5B market cap and allows for cell phone calls to be completed via satellite This company serves maritime and oversees applications charges customers by the minute think cell phones circa 1999 or Roblucks if you re the same high schooler and requires a separate bulky headset This is the difference maker for ASTS anyones existing smart phone can connect to their satellite as they rely on a larger high powered satellite vs IRDM which has a smaller satellite and relies on the headset to make up the difference This same principle can be transferred to Starlink which has smaller satellite arrays and relies on a dish to connect amp nbsp The average AST SpaceMobile satellite signal is powerful enough to penetrate two walls inside a building the fuselage of an airplane or the interior of a car or train No direct line of sight is needed and the service is similar to that provided by a tower two to five kilometers away from a handset The satellite architecture is completely different from that used in other systems With each satellite providing coverage to a large area approximately 2 800km in diameter a much smaller number of satellites are required to achieve global coverage compared to other systems and the constellation will be capable of supporting 5G speeds as defined by the FCC amp nbsp AST SpaceMobile recently participated in the public comment period regarding the 5G Fund for Rural America In October the FCC formally moved to allow mobile satellite providers that meet specified performance standards and other requirements to apply to participate with its partners in the 5G Fund auction as a 5G broadband provider The 5G Fund will distribute up to 9 billion for 5G wireless broadband connectivity in rural America to close the digital divide amp nbsp The first phase deployment of 20 satellites is expected in the second half of 2022 with coverage to 49 equatorial countries in 2023 ASTS plans to achieve full global mobile coverage with 110 satellites by the end of 2023 or early in 2024 with a total of 168 satellites by the end of 2024 Commercial service expected to be offered beginning in 2023 across 49 equatorial countries If ASTS proves to be successful IRDM would be an easy short ala long GOOG short YHOO amp nbsp What moat exists With 836 patent claims and growing https i imgur com iTXb4VW png the company believes it has a five to seven year first mover advantage over competitors A steep barrier to entry exists in the satellite space which these patents protect ASTS CEO Abel Avellan has proven another satellite company Emerging Markets Communications which sold to Global Eagle for 550m amp nbsp Customers have already been established with ASTS SpaceMobile service will be initially offered to 1 3 billion users Vodafone has a 50 50 revenue share agreement covering its markets Millicom LiLAC TEF AT amp T including Mexico and TEO among others already have a memorandum of understanding with ASTS All of these companies have done their own DD on the technology and have signed off on it This isn t a question of if it will work but when AT amp T has signed on for the exclusive rights in the US They think of this as a potential difference maker in carrier choice going forward think iPhone exclusivity that existed previously amp nbsp What need is there Management estimates that 90 of the planet s surface isn t reached by wireless networks About 5 2 billion people move in and out of coverage as terrestrial towers frequently fail to reach distant areas There are 3 3 billion people without wireless data connectivity and another 0 7 billion with no cellular coverage whatsoever amp nbsp In middle America broadband speeds are lacking as is cellular connectivity This is why the government is looking to make advances in 5G quickly Microsoft believes 157m Americans do not have access to broadband internet amp nbsp Addressable Market and Costs Cost of the service estimates for final users living in emerging markets could be as low as 2 06 month Currently carriers spend 80 of their capex serving 20 of their traffic in remote areas ASTS could significantly reduce the amount of capex needed to serve unconnected areas amp nbsp The development efforts to date and the equatorial project should cost 510M and the global constellation a further 1 3B of additional capex ASTS projects to generate revenues in 2023 and become cash flow positive by 2024 amp nbsp With as little as 9 million users in emerging markets SpaceMobile expects to generate 181M in revenues and 130M in EBITDA by 2023E Once phases 2 and 3 are completed revenues and EBITDA would shoot up to 1 07B and 1 0B in 2024 At this point the company would generate enough cash flow to pay for its future expansion amp nbsp This doesn t fit anywhere The Barclays Managing Director who did the due diligence for ASTS merge Scott Wisniewski left his job to joins ASTS as their Chief Strategy Officer This mans job was doing DD on space companies and he left for ASTS options amp nbsp Potential Catalysts Research Coverage Initiated As of now no price targets have been set for ASTS Research coverage being initiated could result in a positive reaction for the stock This was what set SPCE on a run which this sub participated in in January 2020 Blue Walker 3 As of now the proof of concept launch used a satellite on the ground connecting to a phone in space Q4 of this year will be the launch of their test satellite A successful launch and test would mean the business will be able to go through Phase 1 and become cash flow positive Someone much smarter than me will tell you what that is worth in terms of stock price amp nbsp TL DR Max Bid ASTS Walk Away Space internet on a toilet anywhere in the world amp nbsp POSITIONS DISCLOSURE https i imgur com 2kLto8V png

things to look out for are financial performance and possible share dilution However I recommend you read this analysis I am sure you all have heard of a Chinese Electric Vehicle manufacturer that goes by the name NIO NIO Inc https utradea com stocks NIO and I am sure that you have heard them been called the Tesla of China but this title is very deceiving and gives the impression that Nio perhaps copied TSLA Tesla https utradea com stocks TSLA However this is false because Nio has a completely different business model and very different technology especially in their swappable batteries than Tesla does Nio is up nearly 1000 on the year so I decided to do an analysis to find out what all the hype was about and if this hype can be justified Company Overview Nio is a leading manufacturer of premium smart electric vehicles Nio designs develops manufactures and sells their vehicles to their main customer base in China Furthermore Nio is constantly looking to improve upon their autonomous driving digital technology battery technology and their powertrains in order to differentiate themselves from their competition Nio has industry leading battery swapping technology which drives their battery as a service BaaS business Additionally Nio also has proprietary autonomous driving technology which enables their Autonomous Driving as a Service ADaaS business Nio currently sells their vehicles in China however they are planning on expanding their business into international markets to capitalize on the growing demand for EV s Nio has 4 vehicle models their ES8 ES6 EC6 and their ET7 Investment Information Vehicle Offerings ES8 is a 6 7 seat premium electric SUV that features 2 induction motors 240 kW The ES8 accelerated from 0 100 kph in 4 4 seconds and is ranked 5 stars by the C NCAP Chinese New Car Assessment Program for their safety standards Lastly the ES8 can go roughly 355 km on a single charge IN 2020 Nio sold 10 861 of their ES8 models ES6 is a 5 seat high performance SUV that features one magnet motor 160 kW and one induction motor 240 kW The ES6 can accelerate from 0 100 kph in 4 7 seconds and can reach up to 430km on a single charge In 2020 Nio sold 27 945 of their ES6 models EC6 is a Coupe SUV that features one 160 kW magnet motor and a 240 kW Induction motor The EC6 is capable of accelerating from 0 100 kph in 4 5 seconds and it can go 440 km 70 kWh battery to 615 km 100 kWh battery on a single charge The EC6 also features a 2 1 square meter panoramic glass roof In 2020 Nio sold a total of 4 922 of their EC6 models basically just in Q4 alone 16 were sold in Q3 and none in Q1 Q2 ET7 is a Sedan that offers 1 front magnet motor 180 kW and one back Induction motor 300 kW The ET7 is very aerodynamic and can accelerate from 0 100 kph in a mere 3 9 seconds The ET7 has 5 star safety ratings from both Chinese and European Assessment Programs The ET7 also features their computing system Adam and super sensing system Aquila This vehicle is said to be able to reach distances of 1000 km on a single charge with their 150 kWh battery Battery Swapping BaaS Nio s battery swapping technology is supported by over 1 200 patents and this technology is supported on all of Nio s vehicles This technology provides Nio customers with the convenience of quickly swapping their battery for another one to continue their journey quicker through a seamless recharge Nio is releasing their Power Swap Station 2 0 in 2021 which will decrease their swap time to roughly 3 minutes and have the capacity for 13 rotational battery packs In 2020 Nio had 172 Swapping Stations in 74 cities that swapped 1 4 million batteries Nio s Battery as a Service business generates revenue through battery subscriptions in which users have flexible subscription options that they can choose to fit their battery swapping needs Currently Nio has several subscriptions for both their 70 kWh and their 100 kWh batteries If a customer were to select the 70 kWh subscription they would enjoy approximately 11 000 USD off of the purchase price of their vehicle and pay a monthly subscription of approximately 150 USD If a customer selects the 100 kWh subscription plan they will enjoy approximately 20 000 USD off of the purchase price of their vehicle and pay a monthly subscription of 231 USD Autonomous Driving ADaaS Nio has worked on their autonomous technology since day one and now delivers their products that come with Nio Pilot their Advanced Driver Assistance Systems ADAS Furthermore Nio is about to roll out their Nio Autonomous driving NAD Consisting of 23 sensors a front facing tri focal camera 4 exterior cameras 5 radars 12 ultrasonic sensors and an interior driver monitoring camera Nio Pilot is Chinas only ADAS that is on the market Nio Pilot https www nio com news new nio pilot option packs and navigation pilot 2020 has fleet learning and AI analysis capabilities that will be able to update their cars over the clous and improve their algorithms using their extensive backlog of driving data In January 2021 Nio announced their Autonomous Driving capabilities NAD https www nio com nad The NAD system was developed in house and features perception algorithms localization control strategy software and platform software The NAD technology uses their super computing platform Adam and their super sensing system Aquila Nio is planning to roll out their NAD to their customers through a subscription model similar to their battery sapping service This subscription is estimated to cost users 106 USD per month Electric Powertrain Nio has developed designed and manufactured their own proprietary electric powertrains in house since their inception Nio makes powertrains that are specific to their vehicles and through their Firmware over the air FOTA Nio is able to continually improve update and adjust their cars to fit the behaviour of their driver Nio has greatly improved their motors moving from their 240 kW 2nd generation induction motor to their 300 kW 3rd generation induction motor Additionally Nio has improved their magnet motors from 160 kW 2nd gen to 180 kW 3rd gen It is this constant drive to keep improving their technology that will help separate Nio from their competitors and help Nio to become one of the best EV manufacturers Battery Nio is very committed to R amp D and innovating their battery technology Currently Nio offers two battery options their 70 kWh battery and their 100 kWh battery Their 70 kWh battery is designed developed and manufactured in house and combines Nickel Cobalt Manganese NCM prismatic cells liquid cooling systems and intelligent battery management systems Their proprietary and patented 100 kWh battery features thermal propagation prevention climate thermal management and bi directional cloud Building Management Systems BMS Nio has also announced their 150 kWh battery https insideevs com news 465188 nio 150 kwh solid state batteries 2022 which is expected to release in Q4 2022 or Q1 2023 which is another large innovation to their existing technology and proves their determination to be the most innovative Intellectual Property Nio has developed a number of proprietary technologies throughout their business journey Nio relies on their ability to protect their technologies and property through the use of patents patent applications NDA s copyrights trademarks and intellectual property licenses Nio currently has 2 654 patents that have been approved 1 397 patents that are in the application process 3 373 registered trademarks 804 trademark applications 133 copyrights and 686 registered domain names Financial information Financial Performance Good Vehicle sales are up by 106 08 YoY and their cost of sales is only up by 63 72 which means that their margins are improving This year was Nio s first year having a gross profit which equalled 287M USD Their SG amp A expenses decreased by 27 88 YoY which is good and helps their margins Lastly Nio decreased their operating loss by 58 42 which shows that they are making their way towards profitability which would be a huge milestone Financial Performance Bad R amp D expense decreased by 43 82 YoY While this usually is a good sign R amp D is important to Nio s business model and future successes so I would like this figure to be higher Although Nio decreased their operating losses they still reported a 706M operating loss USD and a 813M net loss this is not favourable for investors and might scare away potential investors Stock Incentive Plan Nio s stock incentive plan was designed to attract and retain the best possible personnel to promote the success of Nio s business Under their 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 stock plans there are currently 79 32M shares outstanding that have yet to have been granted If all of these outstanding shares were to be granted it would cause dilutionary effects of roughly 6 45 Share Options As of December 31st 2020 there are 32 5M common shares available in options that are yet to be exercised and converted into common shares If these options were to be exercised it would cause a dilutionary effect of 2 6 Restricted Shares Outstanding Currently there are 1 735 744 shares outstanding that are classified as restricted these shares will be vested gradually over a period of time these shares have a weighted average period of 3 6 years If these shares were put on the market today it would cause dilutionary effects of 0 14 over 3 6 years which is essentially negligible Management Team One of the most important aspects of high growth stocks is the management team that is heading the company We have seen awful management teams destroy promising stocks over and over again so it important to know the management team their experience and their track record s With that being said lets dive into Nio s management team Bin Li CEO amp Chairman Mr Li founded and served as the director for Beijing Bitauto E commerce

previously the VP of IT at Tesla from 2012 2016 and was the Senior IT roles at VMWare from 2010 2012 Mr Iyer has plenty of experience that will help him to drive the future progression growth at Nio Investment Valuation The only way in which I could value Nio is through a set of comparable analyses These analyses will compare some of Nio s financial ratio s multiples to that of their competitors Comparable Analysis 1 In this comparable I compared Nio s financial ratios to that of TSLA Tesla https utradea com stocks TSLA XPEV Xpeng https utradea com stocks XPEV and LI Li Auto https utradea com stocks LI EV Assets When comparing Nio s EV Assets multiple to that of their competitors as listed above I found that Nio has a fair value of 257 66 which wouldimply a share price increase of 453 39 This is very optimistic so I decided to undergo more comparables to find out if this result was consistent EV Revenue By Comparing Nio s EV Revenue multiple to that of their competitors excluding Xpeng because their ratio was not positive I found that Nio is 196 70 which implies an increase in value of 322 47 This is quite similar and consistent with the results achieved in the EV Assets comparable so I decided to do one last comparable to gain more insight P B By comparing Nio s P B ratio to that of their competitors I arrived at a fair value of 45 19 per share which would imply a downside risk of 2 94 This is inconstant with the other 2 results so I decided to average the results achieved by each comparable to reach an unbiased valuation Average Comparable 1 By taking the average of all 3 comparable that I underwent in this analysis I arrived at a final all encompassing price target of 166 51 which would imply a price increase of 257 62 Comparable 2 I decided to undergo a second comparable to factor out the influence of Tesla on the results of my first comparable I did this for a variety of reasons which include Tesla being valued so much higher than the other EV comparable companies Tesla being the only company located outside of China this is because Chinese companies tend to be undervalued so taking the comparable for these solely Chinese companies makes more sense and these other companies pose more of a threat to Nio given their current geographical reach EV Assets By comparing Nio s EV Assets multiple to XPeng and Li Auto I found that Nio s fair value is approximately 51 64 which would imply a share price increase of 10 91 this is very reasonable however I decided to undergo the other comparable to either validate or invalidate this result EV Revenue By comparing Nio s EV Revenue multiple to Li Auto because XPeng does not have a positive EV Revenue multiple I arrived at a fair value of Nio of 52 00 which would imply an upside of 11 68 Once again this is very reasonable and constant with the result from the EV Assets comparable P B By comparing Nio s P B multiple to their Chinese competitors I arrived at a fair value of 37 46 which implies a downside risk of 19 54 This is not consistent with the results achieved in the previous 2 analyses and as a result of this I decided to average my results to achieve an unbiased fair value Average Comparable 2 By taking the average of the fair values that I achieved in the 2nd comparable analysis w o Tesla I achieved one all encompassing fair value of 47 03 which implies an upside of 1 07 meaning that Nio is approximately at fair value in comparison to their Chinese competitors My Thoughts I think the fact that Nio is undervalued when comparing them to their Chinese competitors is very good for the stock I believe that Nio should be overvalued compared to them because Nio presents a larger upside The fact that Nio is undervalued is very bullish and when incorporating Tesla is extremely bullish I think the comparable with Tesla will be more applicable when Nio starts to expand their operations internationally as they will likely start to be valued as less of a Chinese stock and more of a legitimate EV company I think that investors need to keep up to date with Nio s financial reports to make sure that they are on the right track since here is no way to do a proper DCF right now But other than this Nio is looking very bullish Risks Dilution Nio has multiple different streams of possible dilution that will negatively affect their shares price these streams consist of Nio s Share Incentive Plan Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units All of these streasm would combine to make a total dilutionary effect of roughly 9 19 which is not bad Typically high growth stocks have large amounts of dilution and some of Nio s dilution is spread over 3 years so I do not see this being a huge risk although it is worth keeping in mind Financial Performance Nio reported an operating loss and net loss of 706M and 813M respectively this level of loss is not great to see as investors however they are making moves toward profitability which is good to see Furthermore Nio almost cut their R amp D spending by which is not favourable in my eyes because I would rather Nio spend the extra money to further develop their technologies and be the most technologically advanced EV maker in China the World Catalysts Financial Performance Nio exhibited great growth YOY while keeping the cost of sales growth significantly lower than their revenue growth Furthermore Nio reported a gross profit for the first time and decreased their operating losses significantly If Nio can continue to improve their financial reports position and become profitable in the near future then this will serve as a huge catalyst for Nio Social Sentiment According to Utradea s Social Sentiment Tracker https utradea com feed Nio is currently the 20th 16th and 18th most trending stock om Reddit in the past 4 24 and 48 hours respectively with an overall positive sentiment As we know Reddit can have beneficial impacts on stocks that they target and is important to keep in mind as a current future investor Technology Nio has been consistently improving upon their technology moving from their 1st to 2nd and now to their 3rd generation of Electric Powertrains Nio has consistently been improving their motors both magnet and induction to futher the technology of their EV s and offer superior range Furthermore Nio is set to release their 150 kWh battery in late 2022 this battery is expected to have a range of 1000km if this is true they will have the longest range of any EV by a long shot which will help show Nio s superior technology As you can imagine this analysis too a lot of time for me to put together so I would greatly appreciate it if you follow me https utradea com member portfolio WallStreetWhale utm source R amp utm medium B amp utm campaign

and short term gains , TL DR HEAVY SHORT INTEREST MULTIPLE UPCOMING CATALYSTS LOW FLOAT HEALTHY COMPANY WITH NO DEBT AND EXCESS OPERATIONAL CASH BEAT DOWN BY SHORTS AND PRIMED FOR A COME BACK RUMORS OF HIGHLY PROFITABLE PARTNERSHIPS Hello degenerates I like you have been watching the roller coasters and rocket ships that is this market and think I ve found something very early with great upside LET S START WITH THE BASICS Canoo is an EV startup that will be selling commercial and passenger vehicles that are in production and are slated to be released next year They have had a lot of unfounded trepidation surrounding their SPAC debut which has lead to shorts bombarding this stock to well below it s fair cost As far as EVs go it is one of the healthiest EV s on the market currently with 641 9 million in cash and ONLY 6 9 million in long term debt with a market cap of just 2 3 billion This is huge in terms of long term potential when GOEV can easily be a 10 bn mkt cap stock Let s talk shorts The current float available to short is 0 15 you apes know what this means borrow fee is 24 5 meaning the demand is HUGE A buy and hold can cause a monumental squeeze here and there s only 11 days to cover I m going to refer you guys to u ny92 post here because he did a great write up Does it meet key conditions for a squeeze High short interest Yes 29 7 short interest link https www wsj com market data quotes GOEV Low float Yes total float of 99 9M 58 2 shares outstanding being held by insiders and 9 9 shares outstanding being held by institutions 23 7 of float link https finance yahoo com quote GOEV holders p GOEV Decent volume also because of the high short interest there s a medium high short ratio Yes Nasdaq has the avg daily share volume at 2 6M link https www nasdaq com

average at 5 59M link https www marketwatch com investing stock goev High short ratio Yes based on the volume numbers above we re looking at anywhere from 5 3 to 11 3 so shorts really shouldn t be able to cover within the week possibly even two weeks link https shortsqueeze com symbol goev amp submit Short Quote Nasdaq 11 3 link https www nasdaq com market activity stocks goev short interest Other points of interest 6 17 will be Investor Relation s day a potential catalyst as the company is urged to share some good news because of short attacks 6 25 GOEV Canoo will be added to the Russell 3000 index along with our other favorite meme stocks like GME This is a tremendous catalyst for volume Keep in mind that half of the short interest here is ALREADY under water They ve been short since April and at 9 or under they have been paying a 25 rate There will be MASSIVE covering Ok so what about the long term Besides their very healthy balance sheet and being vastly oversold they seem to be getting a lot institutional attention and insider ownership in my experience this is a VERY bullish sign The top institutional investors in Canoo are Vanguard Invesco and Blackrock Institutional holdings are at about 22 661 541 shares but more importantly GOEV stock had 55 NEW institutional investments in for a total of 18 683 793 shares This is a sign of bullish optimism in the long term The Covid Killer Car Canoo is starting to release positive news and this is the first of many https www press canoo com press release canoo debuts air purifying climate control with uv technology their new interior enhances interior air quality attacks odors and kills viruses instantly including Covid 19 and will be pre loaded in the Premium and Adventure packages of its Lifestyle Vehicle Their vehicles will have both luxury and more affordable models along with a commercial line Coupled with INNOVATIVE TECH the designs are so good that Apple wanted the designer which leads me to my next point The juicy speculative rumors Apple Partnership The co founder and CEO of Canoo Ulrich Kranz has stepped down and been hired to help with the development of the Apple Car A lot of people initially thought this was bad for Canoo but I see it as a bullish sign He is still a major shareholder and his design s have been implemented into the vehicles that will be released next year and they were good enough that Apple hired him to design theirs More importantly there have been rumors of Apple teaming with Canoo to use their self driving software or parts of their already developed hardware since it s trademarked by Canoo Limited Apple partnership could be imminent This can be a HUGE partnership for Canoo and can easily 10x their stock SEC investigation I think I should cover this even though it s entirely baseless This initially made the stock take a huge hit and has more or less been deemed to be nothing There is so much positive news boiling up that once people reinvest and realize nothing will come of this I can see a lot of FOMO from previous sellers The Long and short of this stock is bullish if you were just to buy it and forget about it you would do well if you were to play an upcoming squeeze you would do well this is a healthy and innovative company that has been unfairly shorted way below it s fair market value I will be updating this post with more information but I want to post this on a dip my position is shares and calls bought 9 60 edit WE HAVE TAKEOFF GENTLEMEN This is not financial advice please do your own research

out obligations Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close out Obligations sec gov https www sec gov about offices ocie options trading risk alert pdf This can be a complex process that we can go into in another post but the gist of this is that when the fund shorting the stock needs to make a delivery on a hard to borrow security like ARVL they give the appearance of satisfying the brokers dealer s close out requirement all the while MAINTAINING their short position by engaging in these reset transactions Proof of the nefarious activity can be found by running through the checklist of SEC observations for these strategies and noting all which apply to ARVL highlighted below amp x200B https preview redd it svuhhm08zg571 png width 653 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5297b9a988a9bcb6a0ee00a38e8827378a8319df The implications of this don t lead to easy conclusions but it looks like the shorts are going all out in their attempts to maintain their positions Likely there are two or more funds engaging in this strategy which is outlined in these highlighted sentences below img d9zb1sv9zg571 We can perform a rough calculation of how much the shorting fund will pay to buy time by using the call option and share price at the time of purchase and exercise Reverse Engineering June 18th 10 call contract 9 30 per contract Share price 19 34 Quantity 10 000 contracts Therefore they are paying a 0 04 premium on the stock We can reverse engineer the equivalent borrow rate 0 04 19 34 x 100 x 365 76 equivalent yearly interest or borrow rate they are paying on every transaction with the calls contracts As per the SEC document noted above it seems like they are using the strategy called The Second Transaction to Reset the Clock Party A with large short interest Balance 1 000 000 shares short Party B Shorts 10 000 options contracts Party A buys and exercises contracts Balance 0 shares Party B Balance 1 000 000 shares Party A Short sells 1 000 000 shares Balance 1 000 000 shares Party B Buys 1 000 000 shares from party A Balance 0 Both parties have the same amount of shares they started with Party A benefits from buying time and paying a reduced borrow rate This explains why there is such high short interest every day The party with the large short position is refusing to cover their position because they are waiting for the shares to unlock which would create downward selling pressure Section 4 Conclusion Massive borrow rate 2nd largest indicating a decrease in supply or vigorous short sale activity or both Huge daily short volume over the past month Failure to delivers FTDs caused by low float and massive short selling Questionable buy write activity indicating massive stuck short positions Super tight float allowing for a large pump Low IV allowing for call option gamma squeeze further trapping the shorts TL DR short interest on ARVL is massive and interested parties seem to be betting on a PIPE unlock soon They are paying over 100 for their borrow fee and could be forced to cover if the stock gains upward momentum They appear to be manipulating the price and buying time through options contracts How much time they have is the salient question Feel free to weigh in Disclaimer this is all public available data and we have no idea If we are

975k shares Options are cheap IV is only 54 Low Volume 400k No longer just a TV company Gross profit from Platform grew 152 yoy in Q1 Huge Omega will not take much price movement for tendies I was inspired by the WWE post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nvcyxf wwe can you smell what the stock is cooking in here last week so I thought fuck it lets use his patented S M E L L system to sniff out WWE junior For those of you who missed out on the sweet tendies from WWE last week here s your chance to redeem yourself Vizio is no GME or AMC but as long as I m getting 1000 gains mainlined to my mommy s basement I don t give a fuck I Fundamentals I know 97 of you retards don t about fundamentals let alone even know how to spell fundamental but for the 3 that can tie your own shoes here s some highlights from their Q1 results https www businesswire com news home 20210511006163 en VIZIO HOLDING CORP Reports Q1 2021 Financial Results amp x200B Net revenue increased 52 year over year to 505 7 million for Q1 Platform net revenue increased 120 year over year to 52 2 million Gross profit increased 82 year over year to 86 7 million Adjusted EBITDA increased 218 year over

14 52 And here s the part that gets me the most excited Gross Profit from Platform is up 152 year over year Vizio is already ranked 2 in best selling TV brand and 1 in best selling soundbars and now they re going to start competing in the smart TV market The king of the smart TV Market right now is Roku controlling a 30 market share as of Q1 2021 https 9to5google com 2021 05 03 roku global streaming marketshare drops text Conviva 20reports 20 via 20Protocol 20that to 2030 25 20in 20Q1 202021 The King is hurt right now reeling from their awkward breakup with Youtube TV https clark com streaming tv roku announces youtube tv breakup Turns out Youtube TV actually prefers Vizio s magnum dong https www engadget com vizio smart cast owners no longer need two apps for you tube 132131066 html text Just 20here 20to 20drop 20a in 20the 20next 20few 20days I m willing to bet Vizio becomes a major player in the streaming market plus they have the advantage of already being a huge TV manufacturer Roku certainly got a head start but we ve seen companies blow a 3 1 lead before cough Skype We all know streaming is the future and the future of Vizio s Smartcast and by extension our tendies right now is bright And I m not the only one who thinks this As of 6 11 2021 Vizio has 7 Buy ratings and a consensus price target of 30 29 For the mathematically challenged that s a 33 6 upside from where the stock is now Or put simply to any boomers skulking around that s 3 36 years of returns compared to your boomer index S amp P fund and I m being fucking generous II Catalysts Vizio is getting into the data tracking advertisement business as well recently reporting that they have just surpassed 11 million addressable enabled TVs https www businesswire com news home 20210609005230 en VIZIO Surpasses 11 Million Addressable Enabled TVs in the US Why does this matter It s yet another income stream for the TV manufacturing god and one that has been insanely profitable for other companies For those of you who live under a rock almost all of these tech companies are competing for your data to sell to advertisers and Vizio is finally getting into the game We re only a few years away from lightspeed briefs ads being beamed into your dreams while you sleep so for Vizio to start carving out a market share in this space I think is pretty significant III Technicals Here s why I think VZIO can be a WWE junior Extremely low float The float on this is around 18 million shares which is less than half of the float on WWE And for you AMC and GME retards Vizio s float is only 4 of AMC s and less than half of GME s If you re still confused let me say it this way If everyone subscribed to wallstreetbets wanted 2 shares there wouldn t be enough shares to go around I ve been sniffing around and this is the lowest float non bullshit stocks I ve been able to find And by non bullshit I mean Vizio actually has a respectable market cap and actually makes money Volume is low Volume is extremely low and trending lower Average volume is only around 400k and has been trending downward ever since the IPO Options are cheap IV on this stock is only 54 For reference when CLNE popped the IV was around 80 If there is any kind of volume spike this IV will go up considerably It is crazy to me that the IV can be this low when the consensus price target has a 33 upside Moderate SI The SI is only moderate sitting at 7 but still enough to cause some heartburn And fuck it it s you know what season With the IV so low if the shorts were forced to cover we could see some serious tendies Huge Omega With the IV so low it won t take much movement for our options to print The Omega https www investopedia com terms o omega asp or elasticity is huge For example when Vizio went up 3 60 last Friday June 18 2021 Calls increased 84 or an Omega of 23 4 Plus not only is the Omega large the options chains are fucking scarce July FDs only go up to 30 strike and if you were paying attention to the Fundamentals section that s below their target price IV Conclusion This is my pick for a low risk high reward play Its got everything I looked for plus the options are cheap On the 3 6 move last Friday even my Nov 19 25 calls went up 12 It was fun riding the WWE tending train last week and I think we could have a similar situation here You could even play this stock like a boomer buy and hold can t go tits up and come out with some solid gains if we hit the consensus price target I think the July 25C have a great chance of printing I m personally holding shares June 18 22 5 C July 16 25 C and Nov 19 25 C and if this post gains traction here I ll probably add some 25C FDs Not financial advice buy some shares and options or don t I don t really give a fuck I just like the stock and the 32 Vizio my mommy got me for birthday so I thought I d share this post with you degenerates I sit in front of a computer for a living so I m probably actually autistic
