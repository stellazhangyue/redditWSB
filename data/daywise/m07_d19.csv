reinforced this enough this is a possible breakout period There is a very high chance it does something completely different or on a way different time frame so plan accordingly So what price can we expect to see upon breakout or soon after For that lets combine the 1 5 year trend which includes the previous spikes and consolidations with the shorter 3 month bullish pennant trend amp x200B

that It looks like the lower support meets perfectly with the end of the pennant on some day around early September So what would the price hit Keep in mind that the price does not peak when the pennant ends and when it hits the lower support but as we see from the previous two spikes the time from hitting the support to hitting the upper resistance is about two months If we look at the upper resistance two months after early September we get the following graph 29 62 in early November https preview redd it m0fbd9oym2c71 png width 1622 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

only two months later The fact of the matter is it doesn t need to hit 29 for me to make money on the price action Which brings me to positions I am considering taking amp x200B 24 call 1 21 22 https

stick to 22 24 calls because while I am confident we will see some positive price action in the coming months 29 is certainly not guaranteed and I think a conservative estimate of 26 by 1 21 22 is more realistic I will probably also grab some 26 calls just in case cause the premiums aren t bad right now Godspeed

a lot of news since I originally published this post I m publishing it again with updated informations 1 WHO IS CARMAT CARMAT was founded by Alain Carpentier in 2008 he is known to have performed the first artificial heart implant in Europe in 1986 He is also the father of the mitral valve repair techniques The biggest player behind this company is Airbus which co founded it 2 WHO IS AESON Aeson was a king of Iolcus in ancient Greece but more importantly he reincarnated into the most advanced artificial heart currently on the market UE It s currently the only product of CARMAT 3 WHO IS ALCAR ALCAR is the ticker name on Euronext For retards who can t buy EU stocks go to chapter 10 4 CAN I HAVE MORE INFORMATIONS ON THIS AESON You need first to understand there is multiple categories for medical cardiac devices 1 LVAD Left Ventricular Assist Device 2 RVAD Right Ventricular Assist Device 3 BiVAD Biventricular Assist Device 4 TAH Total Artificial Heart As a retard you would think that TAH is amazing and so Aeson should be category 4 This not the case Aeson is so fucking amazingly advanced that they had to create a new category PHRT Physiologic Heart Replacement Therapy This is the only device in this category and due to the difficulty of the task there is no other devices which is going to be able to compete with Aeson in the near future gt 10 years So why is this AESON so fucking amazingly advanced 1 Pulsatility The artificial heart mimics a real heart with 2 pumps 2 ventricles 4 valves 2 Autoregulation The embedded sensors and microprocessors allow a live response to changing patient physiological needs It automatically adjusts if the patient walks runs sleeps etc like a real heart 3 Hemocompatibility All the surfaces in contact with blood are totally hemocompatible Compared to other similar cardiac medical devices Aeson is really safe It is the only one which didn t provoke any stroke gastrointestinal bleeding or infection at the cable site This artificial heart still uses an external battery in any of the study participants 5 SO CAN AESON BE USED COMMERCIALLY IN EU AND US RIGHT NOW Not so fast not so fast If it was 100 the case the rocket would already have launched a long time ago There is 4 uses category for this device type 1 BTR Bridge To Recovery 2 BTT Bridge To Transplantation 3 BTB Bridge To Bridge 4 DT Destination Therapy The final target is DT Destination Therapy which means that the heart is going to be used as a permanent implant In December 2020 Carmat received CE marking for BTT It means that it can be used for now as a temporary solution for patients which can receive real transplantation but are still on the waiting list Carmat genius as they are will also use the data from BTT patients to push for the DT The first commercial implants are going to be in Germany in Q2 2021 as they are ready to reimburse it UPDATE FIRST COMMERCIAL IMPLANT WAS SOLD AND IMPLANTED IN ITALY IN JULY 2021 In parallel another study EFICAS is starting in France in Q2 2021 to drive Aeson adoption support the value proposition and mainly to get French reimbursement In the US They are starting the EFS Early Feasibility Study in Q1 2021 now 3 centers in the US are already trained and ready to implant their first patients UPDATE FIRST EFS IMPLANTATION IN US DONE IN JULY 2021 6 OK COOL BUT WHAT IS THE MARKET SIZE Currently the EU market for BTT is estimated to be of a minimum size of 2000 patients year Right now Germany is the focus as it represents 40 of the EU market 800 France is following with 14 of the market 280 The competitors did less than 60 interventions in Germany and France last year on this type of patient BVAD Syncardia Which is showing that the market is currently without any real competition as the concurrent products aren t really as convincing which explains their small volumes The combined EU US market for DT is estimated to be around 180 000 year On these 180 000 patients around 3 3 are getting a real heart transplantation each year which is around 5 500 Which gives a market size of 174 500 The market size is also growing each year for multiple reason Ageing of population boomers dying The fatness of fat people is becoming more prevalent not fat shaming intended The number of real transplants could soon slow down as there will be less car accidents with new autopilots system thanks daddy elon An estimated 33 of all organ transplants come from deadly traffic collisions 7 BUT CAN CARMAT PRODUCE ALL THESE HEARTS Carmat finished building its first factory in France last year It will be soon able to produce 800 year As we see the current EU BTT market is large enough for this first factory UPDATE CURRENTLY PRODUCING 10 month gt 20 month as a target for end 2021 The timing is really good as they will be able to optimize and streamline the industrialization and production process before the CE destination therapy marking and the BBT DT FDA approval With the EU BTT market and current production capabilities Carmat can partially finance the future studies it s development needs and new factories This can prevent too much share dilution It is possible that for future factories in the US Carmat could partner up with a big name Edwards Medtronic Abbott Johnson amp Johnson Boston Scientifics etc A partnering would give Carmat more credibility and a bigger commercial strike force in Uncle Sam Country 8 LET S SPEAK REVENUES VALUATION QUALITY MATH ECONOMICS TIME SOURCES OF REVENUES The 2 main sources of revenues for CARMAT are going to be Sales of Aeson The first AESON was sold in Italy this month JULY 2021 for 200 000 euros or 235 000 Aeson maintenance They can be conservatively estimated to be around 10 000 year REVENUES ESTIMATES Short term revenues estimates I am going to use the future production capabilities of the current factory gt 800 per year I won t be using the maintenance revenues as in the short term only BTT category is used Medium term revenues estimates I m going to use a pessimistic 5 market share Long term revenues estimates 1 I m going to go with the number of 25 000 heart which was a minimal target by the Prof Christian Latr mouille currently Director of Surgical Affairs at Carmat This is still only 14 of market share on a market without real competition it can still be seen as conservative Long term revenues estimates 2 I m going to go with an arbitrary but realistic 30 market share For mid and long term I m going to use a conservative 5 years average survival rate for maintenance revenues It should be a much longer amp x200B TIME REFERENCE MATH REVENUES SHORT TERM BTT ONLY 800 x 235 000 188M MID TERM 0 05 174 500 235 000 5 10 000 2 5B LONG TERM 1 25 000 235 000 5 10 000 7 1B LONG TERM 2 0 3 174 500 235 000 5 10 000 15B CARMAT VALUATION P S RATIO ADVANCED ANALYSIS We are going to do a quick autistic but realistic valuation of CARMAT by comparing its revenues to 2 random companies in more or less the same sector P S ratio SARTORIUS P S 13 4 FEB 2021 ABIOMED P S 18 4 FEB 2021 From This let s take a pessimistic starting P S of 12 for our beloved CARMAT My advance prediction model also predict a lowering P S when the company gets bigger Because most of the times the growth is slowing which wouldn t necessary be the case for carmat but whatever gt I thereby announce a pessimistic 2 P S for each row in the following table for big brain people P S 7 n 2 TIME REFERENCE MATH VALUATION SHORT TERM 188M 12 P S 2 25B MID TERM 2 5B 10 P S 25B LONG TERM 1 7 1B 8 P S 57B LONG TERM 2 15B 6 P S 90B SO HOW MUCH MY SHARES WILL BE WORTH Currently there is 15 3M shares each worth 30 19 JULY 2021 for a total ridicul valuation of 390M There was some share dilution early 2021 But we can except less share dilutions in the future as carmat is starting to have some revenues from it s sales amp x200B TIME REFERENCE MATH SHARE PRICE RETURN ROCKET RATING SHORT TERM 2 25B 15 3M 147 490 MID TERM 25B 17

on medical devices is huge Stefan Piat CARMAT CEO is targeting 70 The market size I used only takes into account the current AESON which by its size can t fit into your wife s chest neither in her asian boyfriend chest Carmat is already working on a smaller which would more than double the market size Women Asia I spoke about the market growth but didn t took it into account in my advanced model Stephan Piat had a high level job in Johnson amp Johnson and Abbott good relations can help sweet deals to be made 10 BUT THE STOCK IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN EUROPOOR Stocks in europoor are worldwide famous for having a low valuation Which is in fact a good occasion to get it before it comes to the US where valuation is without any known limits When asked about a NASDAQ introduction Stefan Piat answered 6 jan 2021 It makes a lot of sense it really is on the table 11 BUT I NEVER INVEST IN BIOTECH COMPANIES WHICH STILL NEED AUTHORIZATIONS FOR THEIR PRODUCT It s true that investing in small biotech companies is not for small balls investors But if you followed carefully which you didn t you would have understood that even in the improbable event that Carmat can t have the DT again really improbable more a question of when my model shows that Carmat would still be worth more than 36 a share solely on taking into account the EU BTT market 12 LAST WORD It is important to understand that currently only 25 to 45 of the 180 000 yearly potential patients are surviving more than one year without the Aeson It is not a comfort medical device it is a necessity for all these people There is no real competition and there won t be before a long time This product is the result of more than 12 years of research and studies made by worldwide specialists In my opinion it is really hard to see Karma t not succeed in the next few years 13 TLDR gang gt 15500 amp x200B I am long CARMAT gt 40 of my portfolio P S Sorry for my poor english This post is an opinion and is for entertainment purposes

soon,I am not a market expert but I have been observing red flags piling up recently and it s wise to pay close attention to them as they point to a near market correction including Low market breadth and divergence there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high Overbought stocks such as AAPL AMZN MSFT NVDA and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way hence the overbought flag Reduced volumes signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3 7 billion Incidentally this index tracks 2 000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7 3 thus far Major trend line broken for the second time in less than one month the S amp P 500 has dipped under its major trend line The first time on May 18th it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop Obviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics but they don t explain the reasons behind such changes We have to look at economic news to identify causes including Peaking economic recovery several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery For example both the services PMI 64 6 vs 65 2 vs 64 8 actual forecast previous and ISM 60 1 vs 63 3 vs 64 0 reports for June show a declining rate of expansion Also industrial production is showing similar pattern 0 4 vs 0 6 vs 0 7 Mixed Q2 banking results also point to the same issue above While the overall figures are up the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness Declining consumer sentiment while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85 5 to 80 8 The main driver behind this is inflation Inflation rising the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the base effect and some temporary supply constraints Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months Now it s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI the Fed s favorite metric registering 0 9 the highest increase since 2008 Furthermore the PPI producer price index also continues to rise at a rate of 1 in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED s 2 threshold by a wide margin Reemergence of a new variant the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world While its effect in the US might be limited a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up Bond yields going down usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it Remember the inverse relation between bonds and yields China s Crack on tech has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out All of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings but it could be starting as we speak especially that corrections don t play out in one straight line They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out It s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash Corrections are a much smaller event ranging around a 10 drop on the low end for the leading S amp P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers A crash on the other hand is a much larger event that s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event Crashes usually last much longer than people expect well past the initial large drop There are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repo facility The most prominent of them however is QE tapering quantitative easing and increase in interest rates Massive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S amp P500 Shiller P E ratio is reaching a whopping 38 That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 44 and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term Some argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown but given rising inflation beyond expectations the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like Equities and bonds expert Ray Dalio explains this process in his most recent video on YouTube

we are happy we have one My only concern is I have no concerns Pipeline in a Molecule My aim is to make c5 inhibitors obsolete This is Big BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project amp x200B amp x200B V II Phase I study amp x200B On March 22 2021 BCRX announced that BCX9930 will be advancing from PH1 to Pivotal PH3 Trials in PNH following the successful proof of concept trial totally skipping the Ph2 Pivotal PH3 trials for PNH and proof of concept trials in renal complement mediated diseases are expected to begin in 2H 2021 Straight jumping from a PH1 to a pivotal PH3 trial is something that s not common in the bio world it accelerates the process of the drug develoment giving it a chance to hit the market in a smaller span of time The quicker the drug is in the market the better and the more value it brings for investors amp x200B On March 22 the company unveiled BCX9930 Ph1 data 100 of treatment na ve patients and 83 of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were

they Skipped the PH2 jumping from Ph1 to Pivotal Ph3 s and also changed the Primary Secondary endpoints of the study to ease the approval path amp x200B amp x200B V IV Alternative Pathway amp x200B What makes BCX9930 a game changer is it being an oral inhibitor of the Factor D enzyme that controls both extravascular and intravascular haemolysis advantage that widens the spectrum of Alternative

able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases we reach to the following conclusion The potential market size BCX9930 will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to 28 56B 51B year This numbers are explained below amp x200B 1 2 Due to COVID 19 the market for PNH and aHUS was anticipated to grow from US 4855 million in 2020 to US 7023 million by 2026 it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5 89 during 2021 2026 3 Anca vasculitis prevalence in the USA rounds 10 20 per million 3300 6600 patients Using Soliris which costs 500 000 year We would aim for 1 65B 3 3B market size as of now Expected to grow by 2025 4 The global systemic lupus erythematosus market size is expected to reach USD 3 08 billion by 2025 according to a new report by Grand View Research Inc 5 8 IgAN The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone Prevalence rounds 45 million meaning 14 850 patients or a potential 7 25B market size using Soliris s yearly price 6 C3G Prevalence in the USA round 14 140 per 1M people 4620 46 200 patients If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs 500 000 year the potential market size we aim for rounds 2 31B 23 1B 7 PMN prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN so we would potentially aim for a similar market size meaning 7 25B amp x200B amp x200B V VI Alexion Buy Out On December the 12th 2020 Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B More than 90 of their revenue come from their C5 inhibitor being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen You might think why does this matter Well remember we have the best in class Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion s and is able to treat x4 times more diseases than they do aswell This buy out reflects how undervalued BCX9930 is Apart from the buy out I think it s essential to mention that Alexion bought Achillion s Factor D when it was in Ph2 for 930MM In 2020 Alexion s SOLIRIS eculizumab ULTOMORIS Ravulizumab net product sales were 5 13B Treatments that are currently approved to treat PNH and aHUS As a quick example using the average biotech mid cap x7 revenue multiplier and the revenue Soliris managed to generate in 2019 5 13B 35 91B It would mean a SP value of 203 90 for BCRX I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in class treatment and it s able to treat x4 times more diseases therefore aims for a bigger TAM amp x200B amp x200B V VII Soliris Ultomoris patients survey amp x200B BCRX recently did a survey with 23 PNH patients 12

x200B Having in mind BCX9930 is a the B est in class treatment that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their C5 inhibitor and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the 40B mark BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a 30 of Alexion s buy out price this is 11 7B meaning 66 44 Same thing as with Orladeyo happens here BCX9930 is an Orally taken treatment the other approved treatments out there requiere usage of Needles so we shoud expect BCX9930 to follow Orladeyo s steps or perhaps perform even better now that the company has gained valuable experince with the launch

his stake in BCRX along with BlackRock he now owns a 5 of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc Denner has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning 789 in the last 3 quarters showing strong conviction in

coming from Biogen BIIB company where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors would make total sense in the following 1 2 years once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled BIIB s financial position in the last year has notoriously worsened the profitability has gone down a 71 25 in the last year They need new revenue sources and BCRX s excellent pipeline could change so Takeda TAK could be another excellent suitor for the BO considering how Orladeyo is stealing its HAE patients market share amp x200B It also is important to mention that Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M amp A candidates Mergers and Acquisitions as of October 30th 2020 Stating how they believe BCRX will have a strong revenue growth in the upcoming years amp x200B https preview redd it

to have an idea of what we should expect from Biocryst in the upcoming years From 2007 to 2014 Alexion s SP grew a 1777 Being valued at 10 5 in 2007 and 186 6 in 2014 Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their C5 inhibitor was approved to treat additional diseases firstly PNH then aHUS as the market size it captured became wider and the amount of patients it treated slowly scored up Biocryst Pharmaceutical s SP managing to do the SP move Alexion s stock did is more than doable considering the unique pipeline it possess Having in mind Alexion made 66 4 MM revenue the first year

Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management With this agreement BCRX was funded with 325 000 000 in order to support Orladeyo launch Jon Stonehouse CEO confirmed that the company will not need to

exhaustive analysis we come to the conclusion that BCRX is severely undervalued and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline it should be valued around 180 PT will keep growing as we get new data updates from the on going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing potentially making it have the Best Risk Reward ratio in the Bio Sector I naturally do have a position in this company my average

branching out into other verticals The majority of their revenue comes from paying users who donate to their favorite streamers This market has gotten a little more competitive with streamers being offered higher payouts elsewhere so analysts have been ratcheting down their expectations Huya has been upping the ante and is paying to keep their market position intact They overtook their rival DouYu last year as the number one in China Tencent owns about 1 3 of the company and is trying to merge it with their competitor which it also owns roughly a third of DouYu The merger is stalled with the CCP due to monopolistic concerns Ultimately if it does go through the combined company would take back pricing power and be attractive for software companies to make deals with as they would own 80 of the Chinese gaming streaming market If it doesn t go through it s also good because HUYA is winning anyways so would expect them to continue to take market share from the competition Also it s heavily shorted on merger arbitrage so there would be an unwind trade The company reported earnings on March 23rd which beat by a penny and the stock began its descent closing the day down 12 5 to close at 22 36 At 17 76 it is now down another 21 Here s where things get interesting you ve got a company that is growing earnings at 20 with a fortress of a balance sheet If you ex out the cash you re buying a cash flow positive company at 10 76 with expected earnings of 1 14 next year if you stick a boring 15x multiple on this and knock 2022 EPS down to 1 15x1 15 7 cash 22 but if you put the growth valuations into it it probably gets a 20x PE FB is 22 x 2022 EPS and it could rally to 27 by year end I could use some fluffy price sales ratio to jam this higher or just remind you that this hit 36 33 earlier this year and was over 50 back in 2018 I think it s headed higher way higher what am I missing I remember when Facebook debuted and it had huge engagement but made no money I feel as though it took them a while to find the right balance of advertising monetization opportunities and perhaps they held back in order to keep up their user engagement Nobody likes getting spammed with ads This company is doing something similar their advertising revenue is miniscule but with such massive user engagement they have huge potential to monetize those viewers I would expect some solid growth in advertising revenues in the next couple of years this is the opportunity I am most excited about with this company Cathie Wood owns some Morgan Stanley and Renaissance Technologies were buyers in q4 2020 and when the 13 Gs were filed this took off like a rocketship For those who like charts and stuff it recently had a MACD crossover it looks oversold and appears to be trying to form

predictions, This research was performed by E E on AMC yahoo message board Hey Apes There are about 100M legal shares on loan I did some calculations to come up with the realistic AMC SP when all the legal shares are returned My calculations for the legal shares on loan when returned first Here it goes 1 AMC share price jumped from 35 to 72 with 30M legal shares returned on June 2nd 2 If 60M legal shares on loan are returned AMC SP should be about 109 3 If 90M legal shares on loan are returned AMC SP should be about 146 4 If all 100M legal shares on loan are returned AMC SP should be about 158 30 I estimated there are about 3B synthetic shares My estimate is low Wes Christian thinks 9B to 26B synthetic shares There may be more I will provide my calculations for AMC SP based on my 3B synthetic shares created 9B and 26B synthetic shares 5 If 3B synthetic shares are returned buy back covered AMC SP should be about 7 200 6 If 9B synthetic shares are covered AMC SP should be about 21 600 7 If 26B synthetic shares are covered AMC SP should be about 62 208 We will find out the numbers of synthetic shares when Chad amp Wes count them I believe there will be FOMO when AMC SP starts to run from 100 There are probably many paper hands that will jump in once we short squeeze starts The HIGH of AMC SP might be higher than 62 208 due to other variables FOMO Gamma Squeeze more than 26B synthetic shares etc The MOASS will happen Short HFs MMs can only delayed the inevitable It will come sooner or later I am HODL ING amp BUYING until these GREED CORRUPTED SHORT HFs cover These are only my research and opinions Do your own research before investing And some additional research by E E 1 AMC will likely surpass Volkswagen SP when it has its short squeeze Why a 5M Apes strong The numbers continue to grow each trading day b 80 Apes own AMC LEGAL shares 20 by institution c I believe there are about 2 5B 3B synthetic shares d There are more shorted AMC shares legal amp illegal than any other stocks when all the synthetic shares are officially counted e Apes own about 480 of all legal amp illegal shares f Short HFs MMs have been heavily shorting AMC for the past 3 months at about 10 Avg short position 2 Short HFs MMs used at least 7 different shorting tactics 2a They short in the Lit NYSE market 2b They massively bought in the Dark Pool amp sold those shares in the Lit Market to manipulate SP to strike stop losses amp get rid of paper hands 2c They short via the ETF any and all ETF with AMC stock 2d They short using Options 2e They short via converting convertible notes bonds death spiral debt into shares amp short those shares AA decided to withdraw 600M convertible bond to not give them any ammo 2f They short by FAKE selling among their many accounts to drive SP lower to strike stop losses 2g Even with SSR they have the ability to mark short shares as short exempt 3 Most if not all short HFs MMs are under water since the Avg short position was 10 about 3 months ago They are massive in over their heads They will have to cover their short position eventually It s a delay tactic to get as many paper hands out as possible before they cover But they have NOT covered it Instead they continue double triple quadruple down with their short positions Check the short interest It keeps going up 4 They own more than 50 of the media Be careful what you read The more under water these short HFs MMs are the more desperate they are amp the more FUD FUD FUD FUD FUD we see hear 5 They pump other stocks to get some paper hands to leave the AMC position to chase then dump those stocks The only 2 stocks with majority of Apes holding are AMC amp GME AMC continues to have more buying orders than selling orders even when it s on low volume day amp SP down Remember the 7 shorting tactics mentioned on item 2 6 I believe the market will likely crash due to AMC stock The banks know this Some are shutting down all existing personal lines of credit in coming weeks 7 AMC anticipates that this weekend Black Widow will beat F9 last week s opening The Poirier vs The McGregor fight will be shown at 95 AMC theaters this weekend 8 The CDC amp FDA think the current vaccination will likely be safe for the Delta Variance They do not think the booster shots are needed for the Delta Variance at this point This is great news for AMC 9 Short HFs MMs will likely go bankrupt if they continue to double down their short positions The Options T 35 Threshold Security Listing for 13 calendar days plus T 2 which mean next week last week of July Middle of August early September etc Start with June 25th count 13 calendar days from June 25 then add T 2 trading day We might be in this position until the end of 2021 or better half of 2022 due to all the call options and if AMC continues to be on the Threshold Securities List in the weeks and months ahead 10 I believe short HFs MMs will likely stop shorting at some point All the SEC amp FINRA rules have been put in place to stop this corrupted system for a more transparency amp level playing field for Retail Apes The short HFs MMs often choose to pay the fines rather than stop shorting The best case scenario I see is for them to short get in more deep water and start to go long or play some call options to recoup their losses It costs them about 1 billion a day with the CTB fees It costs Apes nothing to HODL They have not been covered yet I am HODL ing for as long as it takes until I see these short HFs MMs cover The Gamma Squeeze will eventually happen with all the Call Option Contracts The Mother of All Squeezes is inevitable and will likely trigger once Gamma Squeeze strikes 100 When the MOASS strikes we will likely see the most violent SP jumps Call options T 35 amp F T D of 13 calendar day plus T 2 will likely play out for weeks amp months This is the social amp culture movement play to bankrupt these short HFs MMs Anyone talking about the fundamentals or tell you

continue looking at these fucking filings Vyvanse is starting to wear off and I m starting to talk like an ape Let s wrap it up 73 5 of shares are held by institutional investors or employees so we re at a 6 36m float Since we re trying to be precise when the filing says Greenidge approximately owns 30 of Support they actually mean 31 8 https www sec gov Archives edgar data 0001844971 000119312521097400 d145424dsc13d htm So it s actually 75 3 which makes the float closer to 5 92m But it turns out institutions own a bit more through mutual funds https fintel io somf us sprt Fuck it let s do more mindnumbing calculations For mutual funds if you calculate all the ones listed that are not Vanguard and Bridgeway that s approx 580k shares of Support owned or 2 4 of shares outstanding 75 3 2 4 77 7 which brings us to a 5 352m float It s annoying AF but you have to calculate this shit by hand since the data online is sometimes off Trust but verify End Math TLDR the float is just under 5 5m due to institutions merger deals and mutual funds Variables impacting a squeeze include 1 limited float 2 tightening short constraints 3 price instability and 4 major positive catalysts Clearly number 1 has been addressed Moving on to number 2 Tightening Short Constraints Support just made the SHO Threshold Security List http www nasdaqtrader com trader aspx id regshothreshold last week July 16 a situation that experts this paper pg 5 https poseidon01 ssrn com delivery php ID

amp EXT pdf amp INDEX TRUE label as gt an exogenous shock that tightens the short sale constraint This coincides with a major T 35 closeout period from a massive spike in Failure To Delivers coming due next week more later Historic volatility has been increasing and it has been getting more intense the past 5 10 trading days Bullish flow is repeatedly met by short sellers Ortex daily data shows increases to keep the stock falling Short sellers are aggressive leaving Support on the Sho Threshold Security list for the last two days in their attempts So some short seller s is are pretty underwater and can t afford the price to rise even 5 Short Interest 4 5mil shorts on loan of a 5 5mil float 100 utilization rate no shares to borrow Soaring cost to borrow short demand is high supply is low Bullish consolidation up Why is it so hard to borrow Even if the 5mil on loan Ortex estimate is off exchange reported SI is 4 5mil of a 5 5mil float Shorts are completely maxed out unless they start working over 100 float short interest which didn t end so well for them last time see GME All metrics that Ortex provides are soaring Shares on loan utilization cost to borrow even days to cover are peaking indicating that shorting constraints are getting in a critical area After the deep dive on filings it s clear that 4 51mil 5 5mil shares AKA 82 of the float are sold short and shorts have taken a huge position Note that 4 51m SI is the number reported by exchanges as of June 12th In the NEGG DD I made a case that FTD spikes correspond with shorts opening large positions Support has had FTD spikes from June 9th to June 30th and it has been on the Sho Threshold Security list since last Thursday so we can infer that there are FTD spikes happening right now So considering the Ortex metrics are spiking and FTDs are off the charts to the point that Support has been on the Sho Threshold Security list for multiple weeks in June and is on it right now the 4 51m SI number reported by exchanges as of June 12 is pretty conservative IMO FTD Squeeze But wait there s more In my previous NEGG DD I made a case that FTDs can be used as an approximation for the point when shorts are the most vulnerable How do FTDs translate to upward potential The SEC and SHO regulations https www sec gov investor pubs regsho htm state that shorts must close out within 35 days T 35 from hitting a Fail to Deliver Excerpt from Section IV 3 below gt Rule 204 provides an extended period of time to close out certain failures to deliver Specifically if a failure to deliver position results from the sale of a security that a person is deemed to own and that such person intends to deliver as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed the firm has up to 35 calendar days following the trade date to close out the failure to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity Guess when T 35 is from the gigantic spike in June That s right June 15th 35 days July 20 this coming Tuesday Tuesday and the next two weeks should see solid volatility and volatility is profitable Let s zoom in on this FTD activity We see aggressive opening of short positions with a negligible effect on the price Shorts are deep which makes sense for the repeated attempt at forcing down any increase in price protecting a fragile underwater position Usually as you can see in the graph below for my other babes PUBM large FTD spikes are usually associated with rather deep depressions in price usually around local or global minimums This is not happening with Support so shorts are exhausting a lot of capital with marginal effects on the price This is good Cost to Borrow amp Short Availability The borrow rate below concurs that shorts are becoming tight and locating shares to borrow is becoming harder and harder Shorts are going underwater and this coincides with the major activity recently They are spiking up the cost to borrow and depleting the number of shares available to borrow while the price bleeds up Caption Red is cost to borrow and blue is number of shares available to borrow No shares left to borrow after the shorts shorted down the 200k in call options when the market opened Friday Last week Support had run out of shares to borrow multiple times and this can explain the Sho Threshold Security List inclusion on Thursday Friday since if they could short by regular means then Support would not be on the list Price Instability Price is becoming increasingly more unstable AKA liquidity is drying up which makes sense since so much of the float is locked up Why is this important BTW Well quickly before AMC popped 70 there was extreme after hours volume in which tick data displayed one of the telltale signs of extremely poor liquidity amp price instability barcoding There are some good approximations for price instability Intraday there Support is showing widening bid ask spreads and a limited orderbook Historic volatility is also increasing I ve also noticed that over the past 5 10 trading days the price has become even more volatile Last Thursday and Friday you can look at the tape and see that the bullish flow of price peaks of 4 is met by immediate shorting Normal players don t get excited by a 4 intraday price move that s not an investor and retail in this situation would be encouraged to FOMO and buy more That s a short seller protecting a price point in an increasingly unstable environment Shit indicators are even picking this up as well see below Positive Catalyst Why are these shorts so deep Seems like they were hoping the merger would fall through before they needed to cover after trying to short Support com into oblivion pre merger news in March Now they need to cover their shorts before the merger happens or they re fucked Unfortunately for them all is good on the GREE front Greenridge updated their share registration https www sec gov Archives edgar data 0001844971 000119312521217543 d166032ds4a htm with Support com on Friday People have also noticed that there is now a scheduled meeting on Monday at 11am https www reuters com companies SPRT A events The entire Support com team sent a message back in the winter to their team holders and investors basically drooling over this passing and we have confirmation it s working its way forward Also Greenridge and their investors already own 46 of Support see the float section The bear case seems to be on unstable grounds Part 3 Technical Setup We touched briefly on the technical setup earlier Support is solid Bottom of trendline In a standard deviation channel and RSI is coiling on the 4hr FTD positive impact to be seen in following 2 weeks Upper resistance is easily broken with a move up from shorts closing Confirmed by recent 8 20 calls for 5 5c Cup and handle In addition to current short set up SI is at an all time high 4 5mil short of an estimated 5 5mil 8 2mil float Utilization is 97 no more ammo for shorts 3x daily volume needed for shorts to close Part 4 TLDR Positions Who knows what happens with price volatility but the margin of safety is getting larger and larger at least for me Risk reward ratio is good for me and the probability of bullish action post merger for me seems pretty high hence I m betting on GREE Position is crazy right now I ll update with further holdings on Monday amp

being non qualified stock options I m not sure if this is the total number of options or the total number of shares that these options represent so let s ignore them leaving us with 2 232 857 common

looking at these fucking filings Vyvanse is starting to wear off and I m starting to talk like an ape Let s wrap it up 73 5 of shares are held by institutional investors or employees so we re at a 6 36m float Since we re trying to be precise when the filing says Greenidge approximately owns 30 of Support they actually mean 31 8 https www sec gov Archives edgar data 0001844971 000119312521097400 d145424dsc13d htm So it s actually 75 3 which makes the float closer to 5 92m But it turns out institutions own a bit more through mutual funds Fuck it let s do more mindnumbing calculations For mutual funds if you calculate all the ones listed that are not Vanguard and Bridgeway that s approx 580k shares of Support owned or 2 4 of shares outstanding 75 3 2 4 77 7 which brings us to a 5 352m float It s annoying AF but you have to calculate this shit by hand since the data online is sometimes off Trust but verify End Math TLDR the float is just under 5 5m due to institutions merger deals and mutual funds Variables impacting a squeeze include 1 limited float 2 tightening short constraints 3 price instability and 4 major positive catalysts Clearly number 1 has been addressed Moving on to number 2 Tightening Short Constraints Support just made the SHO Threshold Security List http www nasdaqtrader com trader aspx id regshothreshold last week July 16 a situation that experts this paper pg 5 https poseidon01 ssrn com delivery php ID

amp EXT pdf amp INDEX TRUE label as gt an exogenous shock that tightens the short sale constraint This coincides with a major T 35 closeout period from a massive spike in Failure To Delivers coming due next week more later Historic volatility has been increasing and it has been getting more intense the past 5 10 trading days Bullish flow is repeatedly met by short sellers Ortex daily data shows increases to keep the stock falling Short sellers are aggressive leaving Support on the Sho Threshold Security list for the last two days in their attempts So some short seller s is are pretty underwater and can t afford the price to rise even 5 Short Interest 4 5mil shorts on loan of a 5 5mil float 100 utilization rate no shares to borrow Soaring cost to borrow short demand is high supply is low Bullish consolidation up Why is it so hard to borrow Even if the 5mil on loan Ortex estimate is off exchange reported SI is 4 5mil of a 5 5mil float Shorts are completely maxed out unless they start working over 100 float short interest which didn t end so well for them last time see GME All metrics that Ortex provides are soaring Shares on loan utilization cost to borrow even days to cover are peaking indicating that shorting constraints are getting in a critical area After the deep dive on filings it s clear that 4 51mil 5 5mil shares AKA 82 of the float are sold short and shorts have taken a huge position Note that 4 51m SI is the number reported by exchanges as of June 12th In the NEGG DD I made a case that FTD spikes correspond with shorts opening large positions Support has had FTD spikes from June 9th to June 30th and it has been on the Sho Threshold Security list since last Thursday so we can infer that there are FTD spikes happening right now So considering the Ortex metrics are spiking and FTDs are off the charts to the point that Support has been on the Sho Threshold Security list for multiple weeks in June and is on it right now the 4 51m SI number reported by exchanges as of June 12 is pretty conservative IMO FTD Squeeze But wait there s more In my previous NEGG DD I made a case that FTDs can be used as an approximation for the point when shorts are the most vulnerable How do FTDs translate to upward potential The SEC and SHO regulations https www sec gov investor pubs regsho htm state that shorts must close out within 35 days T 35 from hitting a Fail to Deliver Excerpt from Section IV 3 below gt Rule 204 provides an extended period of time to close out certain failures to deliver Specifically if a failure to deliver position results from the sale of a security that a person is deemed to own and that such person intends to deliver as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed the firm has up to 35 calendar days following the trade date to close out the failure to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity Guess when T 35 is from the gigantic spike in June That s right June 15th 35 days July 20 this coming Tuesday Tuesday and the next two weeks should see solid volatility and volatility is profitable Let s zoom in on this FTD activity We see aggressive opening of short positions with a negligible effect on the price Shorts are deep which makes sense for the repeated attempt at forcing down any increase in price protecting a fragile underwater position Usually as you can see in the graph below for my other babes PUBM large FTD spikes are usually associated with rather deep depressions in price usually around local or global minimums This is not happening with Support so shorts are exhausting a lot of capital with marginal effects on the price This is good Cost to Borrow amp Short Availability The borrow rate below concurs that shorts are becoming tight and locating shares to borrow is becoming harder and harder Shorts are going underwater and this coincides with the major activity recently They are spiking up the cost to borrow and depleting the number of shares available to borrow while the price bleeds up Caption Red is cost to borrow and blue is number of shares available to borrow No shares left to borrow after the shorts shorted down the 200k in call options when the market opened Friday Last week Support had run out of shares to borrow multiple times and this can explain the Sho Threshold Security List inclusion on Thursday Friday since if they could short by regular means then Support would not be on the list Price Instability Price is becoming increasingly more unstable AKA liquidity is drying up which makes sense since so much of the float is locked up Why is this important BTW Well quickly before AMC popped 70 there was extreme after hours volume in which tick data displayed one of the telltale signs of extremely poor liquidity amp price instability barcoding There are some good approximations for price instability Intraday there Support is showing widening bid ask spreads and a limited orderbook Historic volatility is also increasing I ve also noticed that over the past 5 10 trading days the price has become even more volatile Last Thursday and Friday you can look at the tape and see that the bullish flow of price peaks of 4 is met by immediate shorting Normal players don t get excited by a 4 intraday price move that s not an investor and retail in this situation would be encouraged to FOMO and buy more That s a short seller protecting a price point in an increasingly unstable environment Shit indicators are even picking this up as well see below Positive Catalyst Why are these shorts so deep Seems like they were hoping the merger would fall through before they needed to cover after trying to short Support com into oblivion pre merger news in March Now they need to cover their shorts before the merger happens or they re fucked Unfortunately for them all is good on the GREE front Greenridge updated their share registration https www sec gov Archives edgar data 0001844971 000119312521217543 d166032ds4a htm with Support com on Friday People have also noticed that there is now a scheduled meeting on Monday at 11am https www reuters com companies SPRT A events The entire Support com team sent a message back in the winter to their team holders and investors basically drooling over this passing and we have confirmation it s working its way forward Also Greenridge and their investors already own 46 of Support see the float section The bear case seems to be on unstable grounds Part 3 Technical Setup We touched briefly on the technical setup earlier Support is solid Bottom of trendline In a standard deviation channel and RSI is coiling on the 4hr FTD positive impact to be seen in following 2 weeks Upper resistance is easily broken with a move up from shorts closing Confirmed by recent 8 20 calls for 5 5c Cup and handle In addition to current short set up SI is at an all time high 4 5mil short of an estimated 5 5mil 8 2mil float Utilization is 97 no more ammo for shorts 3x daily volume needed for shorts to close Part 4 TLDR Positions Who knows what happens with price volatility but the margin of safety is getting larger and larger at least for me Risk reward ratio is good for me and the probability of bullish action post merger for me seems pretty high hence I m betting on GREE Position is crazy right now I ll update with further holdings on Monday amp

based on momentum their flashy NASA 5G contract US government 5G cybersecurity contract and NOK s growing 5G market share In February of 2021 I furnished a little DD of NOK with a one year to 18 month price target of 14 possibly with an OTT exuberance at that time Afterwards I dug deeper into Nokia and it continues to be one of the most interesting stocks on the market Being an Autistic Silverback looking to buy more crayons to eat since my wife is too busy with her boyfriend and has no time to make me dinner I bought in with another large long position in April of 2021 Previously posted on the NOK subs I probably have more silver in my hair than the average Redditt Autistic Ape hence I prefer to be titled Silverback but I have equal exuberance and love of our communities here There is a lot to look into Nokia Bell Labs formerly named Bell Labs Innovations 1996 2007 is an American industrial research and scientific development company now owned by the Finnish company Nokia NOK which itself was established in 1865 Nokia Bell Labs headquarters is located in Murray Hill New Jersey the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world 9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories as well as 4 Turing Awards The C Programming Language as well as Unix was developed at Bell With the 5G 6G arms race heating up it is time for the 100 year old Nokia Bell Labs think tank and 155 year old NOK to be leveraged once more Hard SPECULATION Big tech trades human futures Zuboff The Age of Surveillance Capitalism IMO modern institutions are very cunning Everything they do has purpose From certain notorious figures in the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market I have learned this and scaled it into larger markets The behaviors are the same but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading Just trade whale for institution Nokia is seen in a negative light by retail and the whole WSB push on January 27 2021 further weekend NOK s image to traditional retail investors Many investors instantly rejected the notion of learning about this company Forgive me if you have disdain for WSB and the Robinhood investors but I believe that there is big money behind them BlackRock JPM etc They are a vehicle for change and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation Some of the DD are likely released by BlackRock themselves I ve seen some of the account s post histories Robinhooders are looked down upon yet under the guise of anonymity Hedgie s can release red herring DD that far exceeds any big

of NOK is 5 6B however with a large float and a high percentage of short interest and public participation even NOK can be manipulated Impulse Wave 1 is often a test pump To gauge the retail demand levels Institutions love to do this and only create a melt up when an ideal motive wave can be created However with NOK short interest has been dropping from nearly 300M in January to 150M this month a 23 drop from last month Accumulation of Institutional Ownership has ranged from about 4 0 in Q4 2020 to 6 44 in Q2 2021 double that if one follows Fintel The Institutional Ownership has increased because of the analyst upgrades and the added possibility of dividends being reinstated Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases Are you in need of tools to seize the opportunities of 5G Would you prefer to win new revenue with low risk and minimal investment instead of spending CAPEX and time building an IoT network and developing new services Welcome to Nokia WING a managed service that offers operators the ability to support their enterprise customers with global IoT connectivity across borders and technologies It is live today with a truly global footprint but also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow no matter what directions it is taking There is nothing else like WING on the market Nokia website At the start of new bubbles CapEx Capital Expenditure for juniors get filled very quickly If we make a comparison to precious metals miners this company is a first wave major not a second wave junior i e in the early stages CapEx is high and that is why in October of 2019 NOK suspended dividends to reserve cash for increased spending in RD Since 2019 NOK has made major expenditures in RD In November of 2020 Nokia Elisa and Qualcomm together have achieved the fastest 5G speeds recorded in the world However in March of 2021 Nokia achieved a new record of over 4 5 Gbps speed for the first time

coverage will support smart vehicles and transport infrastructure such as connected cars trucks and buses where a split second delay could mean the difference between a smooth flow of traffic and a 4 way crash at an intersection What is the number 1 problem that EV manufactures wish to solve right now Completely independent self driving 5G 6G is part of the solution Why is Elon Musk focusing on Starlink now It is the solution for Tesla s biggest roadblock Don t forget the June 29 2021 article about Musk and Starlink began Don Joyce a Nokia manager working from home at a remote lake cottage in Canada recently abandoned his painfully slow phone line internet in favor of satellite broadband service Starlink offered by Elon Musk s SpaceX Moreover Musk said he was talking to possible partners as a number of countries require operators to provide rural coverage as conditions of their 5G licenses 5G infrastructures are the neurons for IoT 5G is huge It is of UTMOST importance Why would the US go to such lengths to cripple China s Huawei for YEARS Huawei seems to be their number 1 target Key contracts and partnerships July 13 2021 We are progressing well with our three phased plan to achieve sustainable profitable growth and technology leadership laid out at our Capital Markets Day in March said Pekka Lundmark Nokia president and chief executive officer in a statement The FIRST company contracted to set up internet on the moon Partnering with SpaceX Why would astronauts on Earth have access to 5G at home but not have the same access to the same technologies when they are on the Moon Thierry Klein head of Enterprise and Industrial Automation Research Lab at Nokia Bell Labs is addressing the gap between communication technology on the Moon and technology astronauts have access to on Earth In October Nokia was named a NASA partner for its Tipping Point technologies for the Moon program receiving a 14 million contract to deploy the first LTE 4G communications

contract US government 5G cybersecurity contract and NOK s growing 5G market share In February of 2021 I furnished a little DD of NOK with a one year to 18 month price target of 14 possibly with an OTT exuberance at that time Afterwards I dug deeper into Nokia and it continues to be one of the most interesting stocks on the market Being an Autistic Silverback looking to buy more crayons to eat since my wife is too busy with her boyfriend and has no time to make me dinner I bought in with another large long position in April of 2021 Previously posted on the NOK subs I probably have more silver in my hair than the average Redditt Autistic Ape hence I prefer to be titled Silverback but I have equal exuberance and love of our communities here There is a lot to look into Nokia Bell Labs formerly named Bell Labs Innovations 1996 2007 is an American industrial research and scientific development company now owned by the Finnish company Nokia NOK which itself was established in 1865 Nokia Bell Labs headquarters is located in Murray Hill New Jersey the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world 9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories as well as 4 Turing Awards The C Programming Language as well as Unix was developed at Bell With the 5G 6G arms race heating up it is time for the 100 year old Nokia Bell Labs think tank and 155 year old NOK to be leveraged once more Hard SPECULATION Big tech trades human futures Zuboff The Age of Surveillance Capitalism IMO modern institutions are very cunning Everything they do has purpose From certain notorious figures in the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market I have learned this and scaled it into larger markets The behaviors are the same but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading Just trade whale for institution Nokia is seen in a negative light by retail and the whole WSB push on January 27 2021 further weekend NOK s image to traditional retail investors Many investors instantly rejected the notion of learning about this company Forgive me if you have disdain for WSB and the Robinhood investors but I believe that there is big money behind them BlackRock JPM etc They are a vehicle for change and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation Some of the DD are likely released by BlackRock themselves I ve seen some of the account s post histories Robinhooders are looked down upon yet under the guise of anonymity Hedgie s can release red herring DD that far exceeds any big name analyst report It smells fishy Don t forget what RH did with blocking purchases of BB GME AMC and NOK on January 27 2021 Announced on July 16 2021 Robinhood traders who held Gamestop AMC Nokia

of NOK is 5 6B however with a large float and a high percentage of short interest and public participation even NOK can be manipulated Impulse Wave 1 is often a test pump To gauge the retail demand levels Institutions love to do this and only create a melt up when an ideal motive wave can be created However with NOK short interest has been dropping from nearly 300M in January to 150M this month a 23 drop from last month Accumulation of Institutional Ownership has ranged from about 4 0 in Q4 2020 to 6 44 in Q2 2021 double that if one follows Fintel The Institutional Ownership has increased because of the analyst upgrades and the added possibility of dividends being reinstated Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases Are you in need of tools to seize the opportunities of 5G Would you prefer to win new revenue with low risk and minimal investment instead of spending CAPEX and time building an IoT network

the start of new bubbles CapEx Capital Expenditure for juniors get filled very quickly If we make a comparison to precious metals miners this company is a first wave major not a second wave junior i e in the early stages CapEx is high and that is why in October of 2019 NOK suspended dividends to reserve cash for increased spending in RD Since 2019 NOK has made major expenditures in RD In November of 2020 Nokia Elisa and Qualcomm together have achieved the fastest 5G speeds recorded in the world However in March of 2021 Nokia achieved a new record of over 4 5 Gbps speed for the first time

coverage will support smart vehicles and transport infrastructure such as connected cars trucks and buses where a split second delay could mean the difference between a smooth flow of traffic and a 4 way crash at an intersection What is the number 1 problem that EV manufactures wish to solve right now Completely independent self driving 5G 6G is part of the solution Why is Elon Musk focusing on Starlink now It is the solution for Tesla s biggest roadblock Don t forget the June 29 2021 article about Musk and Starlink began Don Joyce a Nokia manager working from home at a remote lake cottage in Canada recently abandoned his painfully slow phone line internet in favor of satellite broadband service Starlink offered by Elon Musk s SpaceX Moreover Musk said he was talking to possible partners as a number of countries require operators to provide rural coverage as conditions of their 5G licenses 5G infrastructures are the neurons for IoT 5G is huge It is of UTMOST importance Why

plan to achieve sustainable profitable growth and technology leadership laid out at our Capital Markets Day in March said Pekka Lundmark Nokia president and chief executive officer in a statement The FIRST company contracted to set up internet on the moon Partnering with SpaceX Why would astronauts on Earth have access to 5G at home but not have the same access to the same technologies when they are on the Moon Thierry Klein head of Enterprise and Industrial Automation Research Lab at Nokia Bell Labs is addressing the gap between communication technology on the Moon and technology astronauts have access to on Earth In October Nokia was named a NASA partner for its Tipping Point technologies for the Moon program receiving a 14 million contract to deploy the first LTE 4G communications

share between 25 to 27 in FY21 On July 16 2021 ERIC tanked over 11 due to retaliation for Sweden s China ban ERIC had a 28 market share in China and due to the retaliation ERIC lost 60 of its market share in China amounting to 300M While NOK only has 1 market share in China NOK has no fear of retaliation and only what to gain particularly since China needs NOK for its cloud services NOK 5G

Revenue and increased Profits , I entered a large long position on October 20 2019 based on momentum their flashy NASA 5G contract US government 5G cybersecurity contract and NOK s growing 5G market share In February of 2021 I furnished a little DD of NOK with a one year to 18 month price target of 14 possibly with an OTT exuberance at that time Afterwards I dug deeper into Nokia and it continues to be one of the most interesting stocks on the market Being an Autistic Silverback looking to buy more crayons to eat since my wife is too busy with her boyfriend and has no time to make me dinner I bought in with another large long position in April of 2021 Previously posted on the NOK subs I probably have more silver in my hair than the average Redditt Autistic Ape hence I prefer to be titled Silverback but I have equal exuberance and love of our communities here There is a lot to look into Nokia Bell Labs formerly named Bell Labs Innovations 1996 2007 is an American industrial research and scientific development company now owned by the Finnish company Nokia NOK which itself was established in 1865 Nokia Bell Labs headquarters is located in Murray Hill New Jersey the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world 9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories as well as 4 Turing Awards The C Programming Language as well as Unix was developed at Bell With the 5G 6G arms race heating up it is time for the 100 year old Nokia Bell Labs think tank and 155 year old NOK to be leveraged once more Hard SPECULATION Big tech trades human futures Zuboff The Age of Surveillance Capitalism IMO modern institutions are very cunning Everything they do has purpose From certain notorious figures in the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market I have learned this and scaled it into larger markets The behaviors are the same but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading Just trade whale for institution Nokia is seen in a negative light by retail and the whole WSB push on January 27 2021 further weekend NOK s image to traditional retail investors Many investors instantly rejected the notion of learning about this company Forgive me if you have disdain for WSB and the Robinhood investors but I believe that there is big money behind them BlackRock JPM etc They are a vehicle for change and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation Some of the DD are likely released by BlackRock themselves I ve seen some of the account s post histories Robinhooders are looked down upon yet under the guise of anonymity Hedgie s can release red herring DD that far exceeds any big name analyst report It smells fishy Don t forget what RH did with blocking purchases of BB GME AMC

your claim in arbitration if necessary 2 Possible threads of speculation The outstanding shares of NOK is 5 6B however with a large float and a high percentage of short interest and public participation even NOK can be manipulated Impulse Wave 1 is often a test pump To gauge the retail demand levels Institutions love to do this and only create a melt up when an ideal motive wave can be created However with NOK short interest has been dropping from nearly 300M in January to 150M this month a 23 drop from last month Accumulation of Institutional Ownership has ranged from about 4 0 in Q4 2020 to 6 44 in Q2 2021 double that if one follows Fintel The Institutional Ownership has increased because of the analyst upgrades and the added possibility of dividends being reinstated Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases Are you in need of tools to seize the opportunities of 5G Would you prefer to win new revenue with low risk and minimal investment instead of spending CAPEX and time building an IoT network and developing new services Welcome to Nokia WING a managed service that offers operators the ability to support their enterprise customers with global IoT connectivity across borders and technologies It is live today with a truly global footprint but also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow no matter what directions it is taking There is nothing else like WING on the market Nokia website At the start of new bubbles CapEx Capital Expenditure for juniors get filled very quickly If we make a comparison to precious metals miners this company is a first wave major not a second wave junior i e in the early stages CapEx is high and that is why in October of 2019 NOK suspended dividends to reserve cash for increased spending in RD Since 2019 NOK has made major expenditures in RD In November of 2020 Nokia Elisa and Qualcomm together have achieved the fastest 5G speeds recorded in the world However in March of 2021 Nokia achieved a new record of over 4 5 Gbps speed for the first time during a trial on live commercial equipment 5G Market 5G Applications and Services Market value expected USD 132B in 2020 to 663B in 2027 The global 5G Applications and Services Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 25 8 from 2020 to 2027 According to

favorite type of technology According to Statista The global market for Internet of things IoT end user solutions is expected to grow to 212 billion U S dollars in size by the end of 2019 The technology reached 100 billion dollars in market revenue for the first time in 2017 and forecasts suggest that this figure will grow to around 1 6 trillion by 2025 5G 6G is the LIFEBLOOD of IoT 5G is much more than just fast downloads its unique combination of high speed connectivity very low latency and ubiquitous coverage will support smart vehicles and transport infrastructure such as connected cars trucks and buses where a split second delay could mean the difference between a smooth flow of traffic and a 4 way crash at an intersection What is the number 1 problem that EV manufactures wish to solve right now Completely independent self driving 5G 6G is part of the solution Why is Elon Musk focusing on Starlink now It is the solution for Tesla s biggest roadblock Don t forget the June 29 2021 article about Musk and Starlink began Don Joyce a Nokia manager working from home at a remote lake cottage in Canada recently abandoned his painfully slow phone line internet in favor of satellite broadband service Starlink offered by Elon Musk s SpaceX Moreover Musk said he was talking to possible partners as a number of countries require operators to provide rural coverage as conditions of their 5G licenses 5G infrastructures are the neurons for IoT 5G is huge It is of UTMOST importance Why would the US go to such lengths to cripple China s Huawei for YEARS Huawei seems to be their number 1 target Key contracts and partnerships July 13 2021 We are progressing well with our three phased plan to achieve sustainable profitable growth and technology leadership laid out at our Capital Markets Day in March said Pekka Lundmark Nokia president and chief executive officer in a statement The FIRST company contracted to set up internet on the moon Partnering with SpaceX Why would astronauts on Earth have access to 5G at home but not have the same access to the same technologies when they are on the Moon Thierry Klein head of Enterprise and Industrial Automation Research Lab at Nokia Bell Labs is addressing the gap between communication technology on the Moon and technology astronauts have access to on Earth In October Nokia was named a NASA partner for its Tipping Point technologies for the Moon program receiving a 14 million contract to deploy the first LTE 4G communications system on the Moon 5G 6G will be essential for space travel Sounds like ARKX will need

Anthos platform Yes a Google partnership Market Share Sources are varying and biased and there needs to be more rigorous audits in this sector However you will get the idea 5G Hardware Market Share 2020 1 Huawei 28 2 Nokia 16 3 Ericsson 14 but for 2021 NOK is targeting a 4G and 5G market share between 25 to 27 in FY21 On July 16 2021 ERIC tanked over 11 due to retaliation for Sweden s China ban ERIC had a 28 market share in China and due to the retaliation ERIC lost 60 of its market share in China amounting to 300M While NOK only has 1 market share in China NOK has no fear of retaliation and only what to gain particularly since China needs NOK for its cloud services NOK 5G Contracts in last 9 months have more than doubled Moreover NOK s contracts are growing by leaps and bounds On October 5 2020 NOK had secured 100 5G Contracts but as of today NOK s contracts and market share are way up NOK has 170 Commercial 5G Deals 67 5G Live Operator Networks 230 Commercial 5G Agreements Patents The following figures of the following 5g players are very conservative as to NOK Investors accumulate shares Research companies accumulate patents Those who own the patents are the power brokers in the industry According to a GreyB total 5G European patents owned and granted as a live patents as of June 20 2020 and those limited to 5G and Standard Essential Patents SEP s 1 Huawei 3 007 SEP s 530

patents at 76 5 Ericsson 1 678 SEP s 230 Essentiality Ratio 24 6 Qualcomm 1 125 SEP s 219 Essentiality Ratio 29 NOK is the leader in SEP s The argument is that SEP ownership materially affects which patents actually matter and as of April 28 2021 and independent study by PA Consulting firms confined that Nokia owns over 3 500 patent families declared essential to 5G As such NOK is now the leader in SEP s Nokia s industry leading patent portfolio is built on more than 130 billion invested in R amp D since 2000 and is composed of around 20 000 patent families including over 3 500 patent families declared essential to 5G NOK President and CEO Pekka Lundmark has been leading NOK since August 1 2021 he has been steady understated and rather than exaggerate NOK s position he has
