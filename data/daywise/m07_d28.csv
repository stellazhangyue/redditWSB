to remove corrupt Postmaster General DeJoy, 1 Not only is Workhorse an innovative American technology company with outstanding growth projected by analysts to be over 5000 year over year with the upcoming earnings report but 2 as the only last mile delivery electric vehicle it is the only viable choice to meet President Biden s executive order which directs the federal agencies to procure carbon pollution free electricity and clean zero emission vehicles for government fleets Recall that the order states the Postal Service shall ensure that at least 75 percent of the total number of vehicles purchased using such funds shall be electric or zero emission vehicles 3 It was unfairly removed from consideration in the USPS contract in favor of a defense contractor that a has never made a last mile delivery vehicle let alone an electric one b was awarded the contract based on a prototype that was not subjected to required testing as Workhorses models were c only promises to deliver up to 10 conversion of their combustion engine vehicles at some unspecified time d had a 54 million insider stock buy equal to their average trading volume for an entire day in the after market trading session the night prior to their surprise award of the contract 4 Workhorse s legal challenge to the likely fraudulent USPS award has now provided the Biden administration the legal path to remove Postmaster General DeJoy who has been in suspicion of fraud and is now a target of an FBI investigation Workhorse argues that DeJoy s appointment violated the constitution as outlined in this video USPS Violates Constitution Workhorse Argues Yes YouTube https www youtube com watch v rNsryX9mSr8 If there wasn t already enough reasons for me to pile into Workhorse stock on the future of this innovative American tech company with projected over 5000 year over year growth for this quarter s earnings call in a week or so with one of the highest short interest IMO unfairly depressing this stock price and causing Ortex and other services to list WKHS as the highest short squeeze alert category but now they are exposing government corruption and are providing the legal path to remove the corrupt Postmaster General DeJoy This is not investment advice But I see an American innovator electric vehicle and drone maker fighting hedge fund shorts fighting government corruption and still achieving outstanding growth So I have gotten behind them as my largest holding See below I am holding 5400 WKHS shares now at a 14 26 cost basis My WKHS position https imgur com a tWykcOv Additional due diligence below I believe in the long term prospects of what appears to me to be a great American technology innovator in an emerging market with huge upside growth possible To be balanced the stock has been beaten up badly this past month with short interest in the stock currently the 2nd highest reported according to Ortex and the decline in stock price the last few weeks has been accompanied by anywhere from 30 to 60 of the daily volume being short selling trying to drive away interest from the stock This makes it one of the highest short squeeze targets in the market highest short squeeze rating by Ortex and noted as such by several other financial services as well I like both that it could be an extremely explosive short squeeze AND that it is a very promising long term

been thinking about risk management in a way that works for the new aggressive retail trader The traditional 1 of your portfolio value in trades PV 10 000 thus each trade should be 100 is the recommendation but might not be worth your time or seem realistic Heck if you are working a decent job and have a good budget on your finances you might be willing to sacrifice a bit more is probably what you re thinking Well that s what I did and it brought me great success in 2020 and 2021 so far Though I m not recommending everyone that needs to do this This is mostly for the aggressive trader

gains but ignore the fact that this is a small sample size of a mass group of people We tend to leave out does that fail and how times has that person failed to get to that point Well this is survivorship bias in action Any who you might be thinking If that person can get 400 gain I can at least get 100 or a piece of that Very motivating inspiring intoxicating right However if catch yourself throwing more than 30 of your portfolio value into just ONE TRADE then this is for you to put the brakes on sabotaging your account and prevent you from quitting amp x200B Buying options for me is consider going on offense and Selling Options going on defense amp x200B So we are going to focus on the buying options first since that s what most traders start off with and I might make a selling options post at later date So to start with the basic assessment question 1 What am I willing to lose 2 This can be tricky causing new traders to abusively diamond hands their options shares and baghold Raise your hand if this is you So we must ask a more detailed question 1 How much am I willing to lose so that my lost doesn t wipe out my monthly YTD profits 3 By asking this specific question it lead me in a performance based mindset I wanted realized profits on a weekly and month basis NOT unrealized when you don t sell This gave me the space to think about the chances of making back those profits if I lost the money in one or few bad trades So I narrowed it down to these percentages 4 Calls or Call Debits Spreads 10 or less of Portfolio value graph below 1 It seems risking to losing 10 of PV to make 20 50 gain on trade is a good mix 2 Some plays overtime might zoom pass your price targets and you might just let some run just remember to take profits because you need your portfolio to grow and not get stuck with a lucky win 3 As the Portfolio grow in value due to great trades inject new capital long position growing you will start to use less capital for calls puts debit spreads 4 New trader make a mistake and risk it all and then have to wait MONTHS to restart or they just give up and blame stock market sucks You might also here it works until it doesn t lol Thus being stuck in the hamster wheel of the rat race Re read this point again 5x Don t write yourself off too soon especially if you haven t put in at least 1 year of trading amp x200B 1 Debit Spreads for more consistent gains 1 Almost becomes a cheat code because typically there is still equity in the trade as time passes and your losses is limited If your underlying goes against you and there is more than 5 days to expiration you mostly can close out early or place a stop loss order to prevent further loss With Calls and puts time decay and IV crush is a bitch point blank period 2 It s best to stick with SPY IWM and or QQQ but if you want to gamble with individual stocks just know it very difficult to save the trade or escape quickly since most of you are probably doing weeklies 3 With debit spreads always close out your trade yourself to avoid assignment Below is the difference between Call and Call Debit Spread 1 Both serves as a purpose of a bullish move but if the stock price is at or above the short strike price the debit spreads is also a neutral strategy 2 The Call option is roughly double the cost but infinite profits this is on SPY so a rapid price movement in a day would typical not exceed more than 1 1 5 in a day 3 Notice how the call loses premium each day if price action stay stagnant and the debit spreads preserves capital in this scenario and as each day gets closer to expiration the potential of profit is higher than the call but profits is limited 4 Below is both ATM options for call 1 and Bull Call Debit Spread 2 on the Same expiry date amp

AMC SNDL AMD due to the low premiums plus expected rise in volume at the time where it didn t make sense to do a debit spread due to opportunity cost amp x200B Below is a visual and potential outcome you can look to see if you had 25 winning trades per year hence executing more and being responsible is key So 50 winning trades could be a goal or 25 This is just for motivation and the numbers below

right but that will be 20 of your portfolio value meaning all it will take is 5 trades to destroy your account Those who built an account to 25 000 or more through trading have some experience but still may be a beginner in trading if they are only executing a few trades a year and go lucky There is even 6 figure professionals who start off with a large account think they know how to trade based off their professional 1confidence and risk it all as well without having any proper risk management and business sense But if you feed your portfolio with new capital in the beginning eat crow go on defense with expenses and be a student of game putting 25 hours of homework and trading a week then you can get your goal asap Pretty Simple stuff but the questions is Do you really want to put

still a keen gamer and build gaming rigs and game on PS5 as well I d also like to point out from the start that I really like Corsair I own shares and do build PCs using their components They are not my go to choice for every component and i ll explain why later in this DD As always this isn t financial advice it s the ramblings of someone who s spent too long scouring the internet for a 3200mhz stick of memory I ve also done a TL DR at the end with nice bullet points for those knuckle dragging retards who can t read more than a few paragraphs at a time amp x200B Corsair has been smashing earnings We ve seen this so many times before in other DDs so I won t focus on it too much but it s good for perspective The rate at which Corsair has been increasing its revenue is pretty impressive In their Q1 2021 earnings they reported net revenue of 529 4 million which is a year over year increase of 71 6 Their gamer and creator peripherals segment net revenue was 175 9 million A huge increase here of 131 9 Corsair s gaming and components segment also grew with a 51 9 increase to 353 5 million Clearly the demand for Corsair products is there with increasing demand increasing revenues and profit Most expect Corsair to beat earnings again in their Q2 report next week Their market share is also impressive with by Corsair s own claims and from research from NPD Group a total component market share of 41 9 and about 20 for peripherals I can t seem to find very recent market share figures since IPO since you need to pay for market analysis and I m a peasant who can t afford it but from what I can find Corsair is 1st in Keyboards 3rd in Mice 4th in Gaming headsets 2nd in Streaming gear 1st in High performance memory 1st in Cases 1st in PSUs power supplies 1st in Cooling solutions amp x200B How does Corsair fit into the gaming market As you probably know the gaming market is a fucking behemoth It s bigger than the music and movie markets combined and is only getting bigger The pandemic has further fuelled this market with new gamers joining as they were sat around at home and needed something to do that wasn t jacking off So they built epic RGB gaming rigs I think these new customers will stick around in the industry for years to come Building a PC is a bit like smoking crack your current rig doesn t quite achieve the maximum FPS possible so you re always on the look out for the next component that will give you a slight boost you re always chasing that high The PC building market and console market vary widely in terms of generational changes With consoles you get a change of console generation most people buy the new one all at the same time or within the same year or two With PC building gamers will be constantly upgrading bits and pieces of their rig to keep it up to date there s no seismic generational shift like there is with consoles It s rare for gamers to throw an entire gaming rig away and build from fresh Corsair is a mid tier component maker Their products fit into the not the cheapest but not the most expensive category This is the same in terms of quality performance and reliability they offer good quality products that have decent reliability and the performance is usually pretty good In some cases as I ll mention later their products are basically identical to other manufacturers This mid level position in the market is probably one of the reasons they make it to the number 1 spot in terms of sales for several component categories Gamers want good bang for buck and decent reliability when it comes to components They spend hours and hours researching this and usually know exactly what they are buying if it s a good deal and if it s going to perform the way they want it to Also it s important to point out that the term best components is a relative and sometime subjective term Taking price out of the equasion the best component is the one that works in your rig to deliver maximum performance and not cause a bottleneck Sometimes it s a cheaper one sometimes it s a more expensive one amp x200B Who is the Corsair customer The Corsair customer is a mid tier and sometimes high tier PC rig builder Younger teenagers kids often use Corsair as their marketing and branding appeals to them They love RGB fans and Corsair basically puts RGB in absolutely everything these days even on RAM sticks and built into the GPU cables Console gamers are also included in this customer base mostly for headsets and streaming gear The extreme ultra nerd PC builder who spends hours and hours pouring over spec sheets and benchmarks might not use Corsair unless there was a reason related specifically to their build like compatibility with other components or perhaps a part was on offer at their chosen retailer Have a look at some build guides online and a lot of the time their no holds barred builds often won t include Corsair components or only one or two There are so many variables that go into building a PC it s not just a case of buy whatever components you like the look of It all has to work together amp x200B The misconceptions of Corsair The first misconception of Corsair is that their components and products are the absolute best in the industry the ultimate in luxury component the Apple of gaming if you will Corsair is mostly a mid tier component maker Their components are good value for money work well and are reliable but there are companies out there that make higher quality components some that make lower quality ones and some that make pretty much identical ones The components market is extremely crowded there are a lot of companies competing for the same margins on the same products NZXT CoolerMaster Noctua G Skill Fractal are just a few of the dozens of companies in this space I ll go over the competitors later in this DD Once you start to peel back the surface of the gaming market you ll realise that actually a lot of these companies are pretty much the same in terms of the products they sell In some cases the spec is almost identical and in reality some of the time it doesn t really matter what brand of component you put in your rig as long as its not a cheap knock off the performance will be roughly the same or in many cases identical For example the Corsair Hydro Hxxxi series are basically the exact same products as the NZXT Kraken X series just with a different fan arrangement branding exterior LED arrangement and exterior shroud This leads me neatly onto my second misconception that Corsair has a massive moat Unfortunately it doesn t have a huge moat against the other companies in the component space in terms of actual products that compete or compare with each other The acquisition of Elgato was a nice move though and in the streaming market does give them an edge over some other competitors with an expanded product lineup But in terms of their moat over other component manufacturers in some cases they don t have one at all The third misconception of Corsair is that gamers have extreme brand loyalty towards specific component manufacturers Gamers usually want one thing when building a rig the absolute maximum performance for their budget Looks and RGB often come secondary to this While some gamers do have some brand loyalty particularly some of the younger kids who are less experienced at building rigs and Corsair strengths in branding and advertising help this I don t think there s extreme brand loyalty amongst gamers who build their own rigs and have spent years doing so I don t think I ve ever seen someone who exclusively built their rig with Corsair components because they specifically wanted to out of brand loyalty except Linus from Linus Tech Tips on YouTube https www youtube com watch v wEIKFxHzzac amp t 194s which was a paid for sponsor by Corsair The price is an important factor here and in many cases gamers will just buy a stick of RAM for example from one manufacturer over another simply because the price is different or the specific stick is on offer at the time they build their rig They also might be limited to what kind of AIO cooler they can get due to the other components they are using such as the size restrictions in their case There s a lot of variables that go into making a sale right then and there and a lot of the time Corsair doesn t stand out as the absolute leader in some components that warrant gamers spending the extra money if their parts are more expensive at that given moment in time I would say there is more brand loyalty around core components of a rig like CPU or GPU amp x200B Some Corsair components aren t actually made by Corsair Corsair doesn t actually manufacturer all its components Many of their products are actually OEM products rebranded and built by another manufacturer Corsair AIO CPU coolers are all made by either Asetek or CoolIT Corsair PSUs are made by Seasonic GreatWall Flextronics CWT or Chicony Corsair RAM have chips made by Samsung Micron or SK Hynix So what does this mean Generally it means that there is often minimal or no difference between some products that are sold under many brands within the PC component market Gamers will often say Look at the underlying product rather than the brand when comparing two almost identical products You could compare a Seasonic PSU to a Corsair PSU and end up finding that they are actually almost identical and underneath it s actually just a Seasonic PSU with a Corsair logo slapped on it Now this isn t always the case OEM rebrands are not always an identical item the end brand may modify the products they take from OEM before selling it to the customer They can also request specific changes to an OEM part from the manufacturer In some cases this can change the performance of the component for example using different fans on an AIO cooler can cause performance increases decreases depending on how said fans displace air through the radiator fins This is seen a lot with GPUs for example Nvidia release a Founders Edition of all their cards which is basically the standard card Then all the GPU manufacturers such as MSI Gigabyte ASUS Zotac etc will built their on shrouds and fan arrays onto the cards with their own branding and brand specific features The base card and chip are always the same but there can be slight performance differences between the cards in terms of active cooling and power consumption But rebranding OEM parts doesn t mean the quality of the part is reduced and this doesn t seem to be the case with Corsair What OEM parts can do though in the case of Corsair is reduce its moat For some products Corsair has little to no edge over the competition and often if you go onto some of the PC building subreddits and compare an OEM Corsair PSU made by Seasonic and an actual Seasonic PSUs most of the replies will suggest buying the Seasonic one since Seasonic are the original manufacturer There are arguably slightly better offerings from Seasonic vs Corsair in terms of PSUs in some instances even though the underlying product is similar with better warrenties if something goes wrong in the future Being the original manufacturer seems to also hold some value amongst gamers To further this in some cases you can cut out Corsair alltogether and go direct to the manufacturer to get almost the exact same product this is the case with AIO Coolers you can build your own direct from Asetek Gamers don t usually do this many of them probably never heard of Asetek they are an OEM so don t really target end consumers their customer is companies like Corsair amp x200B Corsair s branding and marketing By this point in the DD you re probably asking why Corsair has some products that have absolutely no moat but are still best sellers And here is one way that Corsair shines over its competition branding marketing collaboration and visability They sponsor eSports tournaments give away free kit to increase exposure and work with streamers to increase brand awareness Also just look at their website it s head and shoulders above many of their competitors in terms of functionality look and feel Their targeted marketing seems to be paying off With collaborations and sponsorship with YouTubers targeting younger audiences with their stylish colourful branding and RGB unicorn puke I think Corsair can continue to lead the market in terms of sales by continuing their marketing Corsair is not new to the gaming space it was founded way back in 1994 so this long term pedigree in the market place definitly helps with their visability amp x200B Corsair s competitors Corsair has a lot of competitors Dozens of companies compete in the PC gaming space Corsair is somewhat unique in the way that you can basically build an entire PC almost exclusively from Corsair components so it doesn t have a direct like for like competitor in that sense but there are many many competitors who compete with them for specific components Logitech Peripherals and streaming gear Corsair and Logitech compete over peripherals and streaming kit Logitech is often compared to Corsair on this sub probably because it s one of the only other companies relating to gaming that trades on the stock market but they are actually pretty different companies with different target markets and different products While Logitech does target gamers for some products it also has a substantial productivity target peripherals for people working from home or in the office in creative fields and so on Personally I don t find the two companies that comparable but they do compete in some product lines so have added them here Razer Peripherals cases pre built desktops In terms of peripherals Razer Corsair and Logitech often compete for the top three spots on any Best gaming keyboards mice this year blog post They make similarly good quality peripherals but often where Razer falls down is their QA and longevity They are often slightly more expensive than Corsair many say Razer is style over substance They also compete for the headsets portion of the console market Peripherals in general are very subjective everyone has differing opinions on which one they prefer in terms of quality usability and comfort so other than looking at sales figures it s pretty hard to figure out which supplier produces the best peripherals In terms of their hardware though Razer are allegedly somewhat unreliable in that aspect with users complaining of poor QA issues Razer compete with Corsair for PC cases which they offer two choices a full sized ATX and a Mini ATX Recently Razer also entered the pre built market with the Tomahawk Gaming Desktop a small form factor pre built rig Razer in general are pretty expensive targeting the high end gamer who has money to burn You could argue that Razer is the Apple of the gaming world with stylish ultra expensive laptops Judging by user reports online though their QA and performance doesn t quite live up to the price tag Turtle Beach Headsets Corsair and Turtle Beach compete directly with gaming headsets This is not PC specific console gamers will also buy headsets from either of these suppliers Many say Turtle Beach is massively undervalued it does trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker HEAR Personally I find their headsets disappointing I own one and it was expensive not comfortable to wear the audio quality isn t great and has a cheap plasticy feel That s just my opinion though they are a popular choice amongst many gamers NZXT Components and pre built gaming rigs I feel like NZXT is one of the closer all round competitors of Corsair While they don t sell all the products that Corsair offers they do sell cases AIO coolers amp fans PSUs RGB lighting and recently motherboards which Corsair don t offer at all Their products are good quality their cases are nicely designed popular and easy to build in NZXT also have started selling pre built rigs like Corsair to add further revenue streams In my opinion NZXT could be one of the main rivals to look out for in terms of a major competitor in coming years because they could increase their product lines to compete more directly with everything Corsair does In some cases as I ve described previously NZXT and Corsair products are almost exactly the same The AIOs sold by both companies are actually manufactured OEM by Asetek with changes to the fans exterior shroud and so on but the underlying product is pretty similar the same in some cases Seasonic PSUs As i ve mentioned elsewhere in this DD Seasonic actually produce some of Corsair s PSUs they are an OEM supplier Seasonic make some of the best PSUs in the industry in terms of quality reliability and customer support i e warrenties etc This quality does filter down to Corsair s OEM PSU units but many gamers will reccomend going to the original manufacturer when buying a PSU It s worth noting that when gamers buy a Corsair PSU some of the money they pay for it goes directly to Seasonic depending on model Corsair gets its OEM PSUs from multiple suppliers depending on the model I don t know the exact margin figures for these PSUs so can t make a judgement on if this positive or negative i e does Corsair make a tiny margin on their PSUs becuase they give the OEM manufacturer most of the money of the sale or do they actually make better margins than manufacturing them in house becuase it s costly to do so A few other competitors in the component space Fractal Design They make cases and a few AIO CPU coolers which are OEM made by Alphacool CoolerMaster Makes keyboard mice cases AIO coolers they are a main manufacturer air fans monitors Noctua They compete directly with Corsair in terms of air cooling Corsair recently started offering the A500 a fan CPU cooler for those who didn t want to use AIO cooling but it doesn t perform as well as many cheaper or equally priced Noctua or Deepcool competing products In some instances a decent Noctua air cooler will outperform a Corsair AIO cooler for less money G Skill Compete with Corsair on RAM G Skill are often used in high end rigs with built in RGB decent clock speeds and some of their sticks are ultra low latency for maximum performance This RAM is quite popular at the moment I regularly see it in build videos on YouTube Crucial Compete with Corsair on RAM Crucial can be a slightly more budget choice some of their sticks are bare without RGB or fancy heatsinks but their performance and reliability is good Kingston Patriot HyperX Compete with Corsair on RAM at mixed prices and performance levels amp x200B amp x200B Revenue increases during the pandemic a one off One of the main reasons for Corsairs current sideways trading in my opinion is the uncertainty that has come from the pandemic Some analysts and investors have taken this huge revenue rise in the last year or so as a one off caused by the pandemic To a certain extent I d argue that this is correct The pandemic did cause a huge influx of customers into the sector in general The real test for Corsair here will be if they can continue to grow their revenue after the pandemic is completely over It does look positive with their revenue continuing to climb in their recent January 2021 earnings report I feel that in the short term we may see a slight slow in revenue growth but over the long term it will continue to increase The customers that built their first PC during the pandemic won t go anywhere For that reason Corsair is a long term hold It s possible we will see some sharp rises as the result of earnings announcements for example if they absolutely obliterate the estimates to the point where no one expected it amp x200B How can Corsair grow Growth of products not revenue growth is something that can hold back the share price Many of the products Corsair sells might not see any further innovation For example a CPU air or AIO cooler is pretty much as good as it gets these days it s unlikely we will see that many technological improvements in this area so gamers have less of an incentive to upgrade Cases is another one you can literally keep PC cases for a decade without ever needing to change it For other components however there are more tech improvements RAM is one of them DDR5 memory will be coming out this year This could offer further incentives to gamers to upgrade other components while they upgrade to DDR5 RAM However the changeover for RAM usually takes years as we saw in the past with DDR4 RAM when it came out so gamers might not all rush out to buy new sticks as soon as it comes out Often the clock speeds on launch are often slower than later on in the generational cycle and the prices are expensive so it s likely those top tier gamers with high end rigs who will upgrade their RAM at release but many mid level gamers will wait a bit before upgrading Continuing doing what they are doing in terms of increasing revenue through existing product sales might not cut it in this instance As i ve mentioned elsewhere in this post their moat for many products isn t big and in some cases non existent and I feel like many institutions and analysts have looked at this during their research and it s made them uneasy Future mergers and acquisitions could be the key They ve already acquired Elgato which gave them a foothold in the streaming market and acquired Origin to be able to sell pre built rigs They also released the Corsair One a few years ago a pre build compact workstation gaming PC It has had a pretty decent reception from some of the online reviews Although most PC custom builders turn up their noses at pre builts and yes you can build a superior performing rig yourself they have a place in the market in my opinion There are plenty of gamers out there who want a decent gaming PC that s simple compact good looking and high performing but don t want the hassle of learning about all the components and figuring out how to put it together They also want the warranty that comes with a pre built and the ease and peace of mind that comes with sending it back to Corsair if it breaks Corsair seem to have a pretty decent returns policy regarding this too they will pay for the courier service both ways you can drop it into a physical repair center and will even send you fresh packaging if you threw yours away when you bought the rig initially amp x200B The elephant in the room Yep the elephant in the room is EagleTree EagleTree Capital is the major shareholder of Corsair and has helped them grow for the last 4 years or so At one point they held over 60 of the shares of the company and in recent months have been selling off sizable chunks of their position Obviously this probably isn t good for short term rises in share price we could see them sell off larger chunks of their position in the coming months The flip side of this is that it could just be scheduled profit taking and may not effect the share price whatsoever amp x200B You can do your research on CRSR here on Reddit We are somewhat blessed to literally have a shit ton of customer insight right here on reddit something we don t often get There are several PC building and gaming subs that have millions of members who regularly discuss at length the pros and cons of every component and brand imaginable Here are some of the biggest subreddits r gaming r pcmasterrace r buildapc r battlestations r Corsair r Games r pcgaming amp x200B TL DR Bullish points Excellent revenue and profit growth The fundamentals are super strong Earnings are expected to grow a further 21 in the coming year Proactive expansion into new sectors such as streaming which will likely grow in the future and pre built PCs Wide range of good quality reasonably priced products many of which are best sellers within the market Strong marketing and branding that increases exposure and visability of their products globally Did extremely well during the pandemic increasing its customer base In terms of financial fundamentals very undervalued at the moment The video games industry in general is only going to increase in size and revenue and streaming will likely increase with it In terms of share price there s decent support at this level New generations of products entering the market could be beneficial to Corsair for example DDR5 memory is just around the corner This can have knock on positivity for Corsair in that if gamers want to upgrade to DDR5 RAM they might need want to upgrade other components too amp x200B Bearish points Some suggest their recent revenue spurts are a one off due to the pandemic We could see a reduction or slow in revenues in the coming months years The uncertainty surrounding the return to normality after the pandemic could make investors hesitent to invest Many of their products are almost identical to others from competitors in the same market the moat in some cases isn t significant or even existent EagleTree dumping shares could have an effect on share price The margins on many products in the sector are quite small For some products there s a level of innovation that might not be improved upon A fan is a fan and that s it There s no growth in some specific lines of products to obtain sales from users upgrading when there s nothing to upgrade to The PC components market is exceptionally crowded Corsair has a fair amount of debt although it is well covered by operating cashflow amp x200B Conclusion As I said at the start of this DD I really like Corsair They are a well run company with incredible revenue growth solid fundamentals decent products and a good foothold in the market Personally I don t buy the whole the pandemic is a one off take We ve already seen a continuation in revenue growth into 2021 even after lockdown restrictions are reduced or lifted so I feel they will continue to make bank While we might see a slight slow overall Corsair will just keep growing in terms of revenue and profit It will grow with the continuously growing gaming industry I feel like this is a long term play with somewhat short term uncertainty But I feel it s a buy I only have a small position as am about to go through a divorce but will be adding to my position as soon as is possible I don t suggest calls with short expiries i ve already been burned on this becuase i m a dumbfuck If you re gonna do options then leaps are probably ideal or buy shares and sell covered calls against them Shares is probably the play in general I ve tried to be as accurate as possible with this DD if anything is incorrect feel free to comment below and I ll amend it Godspeed apes

www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments oq1mv3 an unbiased take on the robinhood ipo the good a lot of you have reached out to me regarding an explanation for Payments for Order Flow and what it means for the average investor Given that it s a complicated topic that is not easily understood and with the pending Robinhood IPO I felt that this would be the right time to dive deep into what is PFOF and how it has changed retail trading What is PFOF https a16z com 2021 02 17 payment for order flow https preview redd it 0y3xqvmlryd71 png width 624 amp format png amp auto webp amp s d14e8446b26580f114f5d198071fa53c3fecdb9a Before we try to explain what is PFOF we first need to understand how a trade happens in the US stock market 1 Let s say you have 500 shares of AMD that is you want to sell The probability of someone else who wants to buy exactly 500 shares of AMD at the same exact moment is low Here is where the market makers come into play They would buy the 500 shares from you at 99 and then sell those 500 shares to a different set of people at 100 So the spread for this sale is 1 in reality this would be in pennies but this would give a round number for easier understanding In theory the market maker made a 500 profit for executing this trade If you are wondering why the market maker gets paid for doing a simple supply demand match transaction it s because they are taking a risk by holding the security for that short period of time For Eg In this case if the market maker was not able to sell it to another buyer at 100 in that short period of time and the stock tanked they would have to take that loss Hence you can consider the market maker as someone who takes the risk of holding the security from one seller to the time another buyer comes for the same stock Now coming back to PFOF Payment for Order Flow means exactly that The brokerages get paid a percentage of the spread for routing the transaction to particular market makers In our example above the 500 dollar profit that was made by the market maker would be split between the market maker and the brokerage that gave them that order flow In theory this should be a win win for everyone involved Trader broker and the market maker as the trader get to execute his trades for zero commissions the broker gets paid from the market maker and the market maker will get his profit from the spread between the buy and sell prices Almost all the major players except Fidelity have some revenue coming in from PFOF which is not necessarily a bad thing It s estimated that market makers provided in total 3 6 billion of price improvement for trades in 2020 i e they made the trades at a better price than what was present in the public exchange So why is this controversial PFOF is controversial due to the inherent conflict of interest it raises A broker is expected to obtain best execution for their clients ie the broker is expected to look across all the market markers and give the trade to the one offering the best price for its client in this case the trader who is selling 500 shares of AMD But if your main source of revenue is coming from PFOF as in the case of Robinhood the company might try to maximize its profit by giving the order to flow to the market maker which would pay them the most instead of getting the best deal for its customer who pays them next to nothing In December Robinhood paid 65 million to settle an SEC enforcement action for not disclosing how much money it was receiving for routing its orders to firms like Citadel and for failing to seek the best price for its customers orders They have neither admitted nor denied the allegations SEC said in the announcing settlement that gt Due in large part to its unusually high payment for order flow rates Robinhood customers orders were executed at prices that were inferior to other brokers prices and it caused its clients 34 1MM It s not like the situation at Citadel is any better They have been accused of more than 59 market violations over the past 15 years https files brokercheck finra org firm firm 116797 pdf with them paying 22M in 2017 to settle charges against misleading clients about pricing trades At the moment it looks like these companies consider these fines as part of the cost of doing business Are there any alternatives There are multiple well developed markets where PFOF is banned This https www cfainstitute org media documents issue brief payment for order flow ashx paper by CFA Institute analyses the impact of the UK Financial Services Authority banning PFOF in 2012 FSA argued that the conflict of interest between the broker and its client under PFOF arrangements was unlikely to be compatible with the FSA s inducement rules and risked compromising compliance with best execution rules They have stated in their paper that gt We observed an increase in the proportion of retail sized trades executing at best quoted prices from 65 to more than 90 between 2010 and 2014 It is possible that markets that do have trade through protection such as the US market may not need this explicit quote protection to maintain best execution as long as PFOF is banned as well This shows empirical evidence that you can have efficient markets without having PFOF Conclusion PFOF was pioneered by Bernie Madoff and although it was not a factor in the Madoff investment scandal it s still rife with some massive conflict of interests While I don t think that the SEC is going to ban PFOF in the recent future the growing retail trading increased scrutiny into companies accepting PFOF and successful shift of the UK market to a more efficient one after banning PFOF is all bound to put more pressure on the SEC to bring in new regulations

interest 15 of shares outstanding and borrow rates less than 2 per year have been rapidly declining Most hedge funds that are short AMC are short in small sizes allowing them the ability to hold their short positions indefinitely AMC is not GameStop GameStop is led by a visionary CEO and actually has a viable path towards transforming itself AMC on the other hand is stuck with its old CEO and management team and faces significant revenue cannibalization from home streaming services which has been exacerbated by the pandemic Introductory Disclosure Even though I reference GameStop GME I do not advocate buying shares in GME I also do not hate AMC or think anyone who bought AMC is foolish I have been invested in both stocks With this post I am trying to be as objective and helpful as possible Many of you may consider me a shill because I do not share all your opinions and or urge you to hold AMC until the stock reaches some non sensical price target That is fine But I am definitely not a shill per the actual definition of the word in that I am not an accomplice to anyone I invest money for a living and have run my own investment fund for over a decade It s not a huge hedge fund like Citadel but I have outside investors I also have a lot of my own money in my investment fund I have no special agenda other than making money for myself and my investors I also do not have special access to regulators AMC or other large investment funds including hedge funds short oriented or otherwise I hardly ever speak with other portfolio managers I can t manipulate stocks I wish I could legally of course If you imagine the equity market as every casino in the world maybe Citadel is MGM Resorts and I m just a card shark counting cards at the blackjack table We do a lot of research on our positions I am here to share some of that research for no other reason than I find this community fascinating I like underdogs I often root for them But to be clear I m just trying to make money and have recently invested based on this diligence Specifically I am long AMC puts The AMC Short Squeeze is Over I joined Reddit during the GME short squeeze To be sure it was a great way to make money GME had over 100 short interest when Ryan Cohen joined the Board so it appeared to many that the short squeeze was going to happen Good for everyone that saw it early The GME short squeeze really did happen GameStop traded to over 450 per share Then the squeeze abruptly came to an end when GME s short interest declined to less than 10 of shares outstanding Stock borrow rates collapsed in tandem The stock dropped to 40 per share and the short squeeze was over As many of you put it the squeeze was squoze That part of the trade had concluded AMC also experienced a squeeze or more accurately the perception that a squeeze could happen Rapid and sustained buying caused share volumes to explode and the stock price to appreciate quickly we think this may have been ignited by unusually large call option buying Hedge funds who were short needed to post 5 10x the collateral previously required to hold a short AMC position Buyers including and maybe especially retail traders continued to overwhelm sellers As that occurred at the end of May and early June AMC shares ran up to 72 per share Wave after wave of retail buyer piled in hoping to make life changing money Some did The problem is the squeeze or more accurately the perception of the squeeze ended and now the stock is drifting lower every day The amount of AMC shares short relative to its market cap and trading volume has never been that high and is currently declining amp x200B https preview redd it rch6n8jpxyd71 png width 458 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 254122efeade378349a8a9123ba482b06212d118 Borrow rates are consequently diminishing as well shorting doesn t cost that much anymore less than 2 per year and there is plenty of borrow available If you need to cover your short you can do so pretty easily For example if you re short 1 million shares you can cover that before breakfast with recent trading volumes and it wouldn t move the stock at all Remember covering a short is simply buying shares in the market at the prevailing price AMC trades over 50 million shares a day People keep yelling they have to cover Or we own the float Both of those things are true But when someone wants to cover they don t need to ask for everyone s permission They just need to buy stock in the market at the current price much like people in this community buy stock every single day from people that are selling it That s how it works amp x200B https preview redd it j05xfy6qxyd71 png width 458 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 2cac26761be9575e1ba23e4cf07651cbae36434e Finally hedge funds that are short AMC are doing so in small size relative to the size of their funds In other words most are assuming over 200 price appreciation in their downside scenarios and have plenty of collateral in reserve to place against the short position they are maintaining if the short goes against them For all intents and purposes they can hold these short positions forever This is not a recipe for a short squeeze AMC is not GameStop After the GME squeeze ended GameStop continued transforming itself GameStop raised a ton of cash 500 million in April paid down all its debt and then raised even more cash 1 billion in June In the midst of cleaning up its capital structure Ryan Cohen hired an experienced team of top notch managers GameStop current market cap 14 5 billion now has a real shot at becoming a successful niche online retailer of gaming accessories and related products that competes effectively against Amazon Investors are now betting that Ryan Cohen can make GameStop as successful as his last company Chewy current market cap 35 billion Chewy captured market share from Amazon and others in the pet food and accessories market on its way to becoming a very large and thriving business Investors hope GameStop will do the same against Amazon Best Buy and others The value reflected in GameStop s current market cap is driven mostly by an optimistic bet on this transformation The gamble on the short squeeze is over GME is trading fairly rationally right now maybe a little expensive considering the road to 35 billion is going to be really bumpy GameStop s valuation is not completely detached from reality in that GameStop has a good chance at succeeding AMC on the other hand has traded from the realm of the improbable into the universe of the impossible AMC is stuck with its old management team and is pursuing the same tired strategy of trying to get people to fill theaters even though every content provider including video game producers are pushing consumers to enjoy and participate in content at home AMC does not have Ryan Cohen It has Adam Aaron who is struggling to steer AMC through 5 billion in debt and growing rent obligations With this debt burden and with zero history of being an entrepreneurial visionary like Ryan Cohen Adam Aaron will not be able to attract the kind of talent Ryan Cohen can recruit Consequently AMC doesn t have a shot at competing against Disney Netflix Amazon and every other streamer AA s only hope is to cynically appeal to apes so that you keep buying his stock My bet is that he s going to have to deliver a lot more than free popcorn to keep people buying But enough of my opinions Here are the facts amp x200B https preview redd it 2ekjvbtqxyd71 png width 510 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

they can hold these short positions forever This is not a recipe for a short squeeze AMC is not GameStop After the GME squeeze ended GameStop continued transforming itself GameStop raised a ton of cash 500 million in April paid down all its debt and then raised even more cash 1 billion in June In the midst of cleaning up its capital structure Ryan Cohen hired an experienced team of top notch managers GameStop current market cap 14 5 billion now has a real shot at becoming a successful niche online retailer of gaming accessories and related products that competes effectively against Amazon Investors are now betting that Ryan Cohen can make GameStop as successful as his last company Chewy current market cap 35 billion Chewy captured market share from Amazon and others in the pet food and accessories market on its way to becoming a very large and thriving business Investors hope GameStop will do the same against Amazon Best Buy and others The value reflected in GameStop s current market cap is driven mostly by an optimistic bet on this transformation The gamble on the short squeeze is over GME is trading fairly rationally right now maybe a little expensive considering the road to 35 billion is going to be really bumpy GameStop s valuation is not completely detached from reality in that GameStop has a good chance at succeeding AMC on the other hand has traded from the realm of the improbable into the universe of the impossible AMC is stuck with its old management team and is pursuing the same tired strategy of trying to get people to fill theaters even though every content provider including video game producers are pushing consumers to enjoy and participate in content at home AMC does not have Ryan Cohen It has Adam Aaron who is struggling to steer AMC through 5 billion in debt and growing rent obligations With this debt burden and with zero history of being an entrepreneurial visionary like Ryan Cohen Adam Aaron will not be able to attract the kind of talent Ryan Cohen can recruit Consequently AMC doesn t have a shot at competing against Disney Netflix Amazon and every other streamer AA s only hope is to cynically appeal to apes so that you keep buying his stock My bet is that he s going to have to deliver a lot more than free popcorn to keep people buying But enough of my opinions Here are the facts amp x200B https preview redd it

stay DD,Since early May the hawkish talk by JPOW had big money quickly rotate out of the RTY inflation plays they were in since late Feb back into growth stocks that benefit in a deflationary regime once people realized inflation might be transitory and commodities normalized ie lumber For the past few months these growth stocks and big tech have ramped HARD But interestingly today Powell moved away from harking on transitory as a word to describe inflation and noted that inflation was showing up at a greater pace than expected No exact word on taper timing But under the hood 10 year yields have moved too far in one direction down as with deflation investors have piled into bonds as a safe haven for yield One thing these investors havent accounted for is the biggest factor of the CPI Rent Yes rent weights about 33 percent ish of the CPI and has for the better part of COVID remained stagnant Ironically housing prices arent measured in the CPI the equivalent rental price is So basically if you have a house with x price the price it would rent for is what is considered in the CPI which measures a basket of consumer goods and things to see month over month price changes Why is this Well landlords have been unable to evict tenants due to the nationwide eviction moratorium that is finally slowly coming to an end in certain states and soon federally Most think of people who dont pay that would be in risk of being evicted but landlords cant even cut leases for tenants in cases where they want to increase rents to adjust to the recently higher CPI prints some leases are based on CPI print y o y increases So ergo even landlords that want to just raise prices cant evict and restructure leases This is all changing slowly Spokane WA was a city that was the first to deal with the lifting of the moratorium subsequent rental prices leases rose nearly 8 1 one lady reported her apartment complex planned on raising rents 30 in the late summer once the moratorium was done The thing is this isnt going to be a small jump in the CPI like the spike in used cars was this will be a consistent and slow rise nationwide into the fall and will increase over time as rental prices catch up to housing prices which can be seen in the housing vs rent ratio amp x200B https preview redd it y14bhpb4s0e71 jpg width 909 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s

A BIG INFLATION FACTOR Some wallstreeet jerkoff will try to point to credit impulse as the first factor of seeing inflation but those are endogenous a dependent variable to some of these consumer price increases So how do u go long inflation Theres a few ways you can position in cyclical names with solid cash flow that provide consistent dividend returns or that are yield sensitive industrials materials utilities select banks Another way is via bonds Which big money is quietly doing imo TLT is an etf for the 20 year treasury bond and yields move inversely to bonds as the government increases the yield when there are less bond buyers to continously encourage buyers In an inflationary regime buyers dont want to buy bonds as they know inflation will cause the yields to spike further down the road and their bonds now will be less yield than bonds down the road quick TLT chart amp x200B https preview redd it i2s6abz3t0e71 png width 1324 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

not going to happen overnight as bonds arent that volatile Watching last week s option orderflow lots of big money was quietly adding short to TLT when it hit 152ish with what I believe is the same idea Inflation is coming but for good this time amp x200B Option order flow mid last week in TLT multi million dollar TLT put buys https preview redd it ja6tqjpst0e71 jpg width 907 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 2096633b0465629452b610f6da8b4e04e07d2d00 In general get ready inflation is coming and although lots of tech is rocketing recently I think it will be short lived into this week and further out into August and onwards The Fed has exhausted a great deal of tools and I predict yields will have a decent spike before they truly admit the situation they are in with inflation potentially going to run rampant Everyone is going back to the office early fall the largest population of renters single adults under 30 are all going back to rent after moving home with parents in the largest since the great depression We are facing a massive influx of supply rising prices and a fed that wants to keep fucking printing RISK TO THIS The bear case for the inflation idea is a world conflict Taiwan being invaded by China would lead to people looking to go cash in an emergency and quickly spike the dollar and potentially kill yields quick This is a real potential situation to be aware of but imo we are a few months out as tensions escalate If this were to happen market would tank just as bad as March 2020 as most of the worlds semiconductors are made in Taiwan and we cant have a multi month halt of production at TSM s foundry amp x200B TLDR Inflation is coming due to rent prices starting to increase once more increased demand Shorting bonds via puts is one potential way to offset inflation exposure as short bonds long yields There are ETFs for yields too doesnt have to be just in options
