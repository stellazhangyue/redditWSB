TLDR The whole Citron attack the news articles Cramer etc was planned by pissed off hedge funds mainly Melvin who want to portray WSB as a coordinated market manipulating entity By pinning the blame for current volatility or anything that may go wrong in the future on us no one will bother looking at how many laws they break actually manipulating markets everyday such as naked short selling Hedge funds are bleeding and they re fighting to cover Source London Hedge Fund PM Hi everyone Time to finally spill the beans about what s really going on here WSB deserves to know Long time lurker here This is a crazy but true story so buckle up for a wild ride Here is evidence of my conversations with the mods before the Shitron shit went down Most of the complex sensitive stuff was explained via signal call with OIP Numerous emails which would be too long too disclose and also containing sensitive info were exchanged takes centuries to write this shit out as you can see but here are the things which I can release It s very hard to prove everything because it s based on a tip I got from a reliable source and I don t have a recording of my calls with him or OIP but here s proof I can provide without compromising certain people that I know what I m talking about Evidence of modmail sent before this shit Note the Urgent before this shit went down https imgur com a Cx6SDAT Initial response by u zjz to my private mod mail warning about impending chaos by the shorts to WSB via encrypted email https imgur com a flE9HRE Signal warning to OIP after mod mail message 1 https imgur com a mVbH0FD Very short explanation to OIP before sleeping 2 went into depth on a call the next day https imgur com a HkLqOA0 Initially dismissed by Bacon but after initial discussions he knew I had something https imgur com a ARR3Edp Evidence of call with OIP Signal doesn t show length https imgur com a Ti9sEU3 One of my convos with Bacon Futures had to cut off because sensitive info https imgur com a hX1z6s7 End of Conversation with Bacon Futures Backing my post in light of all evidence provided https imgur com a NfGkmPD More conversation with OIP references proving that I mentioned these upcoming events https imgur com a XFc5nzz OIP confirming on Thursday that my warnings were true and panned out exactly how I said they would https imgur com a 5TmznIF Storytime Earlier this week I m British I sent an urgent message to the mods via a private channel truth is if I put the full details of that screenshot some people involved who may be reading this will figure out the source potentially warning them about information I received from a hedge fund trader at a boutique British fund who happens to be in the know about a lot of things going on behind the scenes in the market he has friends in the SEC from his time in NYC I contacted the mods as fast as possible I warned of a ridiculous conspiracy some shit uncovered that was ridiculously crazy and that the mods had to know urgently I gave them my encrypted email and phone I got on a Signal call with OIP for some time but also talked to Bacon Futures and u zjz https www reddit com u zjz about this situation Everything I told them panned out in the specific ways I said I didn t know it would be Citron tweeting but I knew and told OIP that some unexpected people with weight and attention would get involved very soon and take on WSB head on Initially I was treated like a jokeman and a crazy conspiracy theorist but zjz and Bacon both came around in the end The 3 mods I have referred to will hopefully confirm in the comment section below that I indeed did warn ahead of these events unfolding But anyways it s time you guys hear what my source had to say He warned that there were many more hedge funds involved with the naked short selling of GME and that the recent short gamma squeeze had really pissed off quite a few people who were now faced with the prospects of huge losses on their books Ever since WSB was covered by Luke Kawa on Bloomberg firms have been keeping an eye on the sub But this was the final straw when retail investors just fucked over the institutions who are so used to manipulating markets the way they want through illegal practices such as naked short selling They were pissed off royally and finally decided to do something about the growing retail investor base WSB who were making money too easily and that too at their expense Their plan is simple 1 First of all get the finance world to start covering WSB again heavily Notice how there wasn t much coverage before of all the crazy things people on this sub have bought and how far they went up But recently everyone s focused on WSB They have to push the narrative that we are out of control retail investors Brits like me who use CFDs are exempt lol who are an institution a solid group manipulating markets This turns the public perception of WSB what is a retarded forum famous for both immense gain and loss porn into a group of highly coordinated manipulators fueled by nothing but short term greed Barrons Cramer Seeking Alpha Business Insider Bloomberg Wall Street Journal Marketwatch even VICE FUCKING NEWS etc everyone s on us Never had this much coverage It s all paid jobs coordinated across the media to draw attention to this It s also to draw attention away from the fact that they engaged in naked short selling and that s a key reason why the squeeze has been so hard 2 Collude together to get someone who is considered a heavyweight to intervene and take on the WSB head on explicitly I told OIP on Monday that there were much bigger fish involved in this and that we d rattled the hornet s nest and that my source didn t want to give me a name but he said they were well known short sellers He said their goal was to act as the public muscle on behalf of Melvin remember how he sucked Melvin off completely during the video and others with an unexpected entrance to spice things up and again draw public attention and paint a straw man of Reddit traders being the sole force behind GME going up and not a combination of Cohen coming in general turnaround buying naked short selling squeeze as well as options gamma squeeze from WSB Not only does the market listen to Citron in general so some puts can finally go in the money notice how the expiry of the contracts is tomorrow but it draws huge attention Their sole intention is to villify and demonise retail investors and to squeeze every penny out of us as they can like they normally do The whole situation doesn t make sense from a logical point of view Why would Citron enter out of nowhere shill for Melvin consistently repeat that GME is going to 20 postpone their speech for inauguration get hacked by too many people and then a mysterious person buys puts at the same time as the announcement The whole markets are watching now Institutions vs Retail Citron takes on all GME buyers Surprisingly enough having told OIP explicitly that we should not act like a coordinated group with the GME pushing unless we want something crazy to unfold OIP passed the message to the senior mods the very next day WSB makes a twitter account with inflammatory comments like We are a force to be reckoned with We are taking over It s time for us to have a voice My source told me weirdly enough ahead of time that there would be some form of public contact calling out between short sellers and WSB He literally said their tactic was to draw WSB out explicitly paint us as a collective single entity which coordinates trades and turn the public sentiment against us I literally told this to OIP exactly on the call that the hedge fund muscle didn t know it was fucking Shitron then were going to come out and attack WSB for the first time directly as a bunch of clueless traders and suckers Literally everything unwound almost exactly as my source claimed they would This started happening slowly before but I only got the tip now about the full story They were bleeding before they got their buddy Cramer who s admitted to openly manipulating markets to push for a GME stock offering to give those gay shorts liquidity Shore up the balance sheet and some BS Constantly moving from side to side The whole thing is completely off As I consistently said to the mods in my messages images the twitter account plays right into their hands and it s basically doing their job for them You couldn t get more explicit than saying that you re taking over a market and a force to be reckoned with We couldn t be more explicit in trying to get the SEC to investigate the subreddit Even if we did control the stock market the worst thing you can do is write these things out explicitly on Twitter where the SEC are known Hi Papa Elon to be fucking strict My opinion Getting retail investors out of the game has been a goal of the financial establishment for some time They cannot fathom that what was once a big boys only table has now been democratised into any autist with 100 can buy options and make money Meme stocks made more money than the hedge funds last year They want us out of the game It s that simple But don t worry they ll probably put restrictions in the name of protecting unsophisticated retail investors from volatility They ll ban your options without owning the underlying but keep an exception for authorised financial institutions just like they lobbied to class CFDs as swaps and keep them out of US retail s hands freedom my arse Pattern day trader rules hello In the future something is probably going to seriously wrong and they ll pin it on the uneducated retail investors To preserve the future of this sub we must not act like or even entertain the idea that we are an institution Deepfuckingvalue made a really good call and kudos to him But the whole GME situation has gone too far and you know it has when Cramer Shitron Melvin and a ton of major news outlets are all hammering on about WSB and GME Not acting like an institution extends to not having a Twitter account which speaks on behalf of WSB There s bull gang bear gang cash gang theta gang etc etc Fellow autists I hope you can see this As for the lead mods please heed my warnings As fun as it is crushing the institutions they have much more power us retail investors The SEC itself was founded by a fucking insider trader Only 1 person went to jail for the financial crisis but they sent a WSBer to jail for filing a false acquisition offer for Fitbit The game is rigged always has been Stick to meme stocks go back to inversing each other to see who wins Or post diamond in the rough DD which WSB is famed for Thanks High profiles do not help anyone and it leads to things like this happening which threaten the very existence of our sub We may win the battle but we will most definitely lose the war against these corrupt entities who bribe politicians to get bailed out when they fuck up make laws to ruin their competition manipulate markets for their own gain and have a chummy revolving door with the SEC Citron Cramer Melvin Fuck you You guys are the true scum of the earth I don t care that you re short GME I care that you re taking part in collusion market manipulation via naked shorting and the intentional villification of small time day traders Just like in 2008 you re coming up with bullshit and trying to sell it as AAA Just like you villified the poor people and immigrants for taking home loans instead of the people like yourselves who committed securities fraud you re villifying the small retail trader trying to make some money in a period of massive job losses whilst you continue to manipulate markets as you ve done for decades and keep minting money u zjz https

01 22 , Stocks have a mixed day as Biden has his first full day in office Traditional energy stocks lose some ground as we continue to see a transition to Green Energy Let s talk about this and other stock market news Long post Hello everyone and Good Morning So let s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the Nasdaq Composite https ibb co RbB5Xhz leading the way finishing 55 up and closing at a new all time high just like the SP500 https ibb co X5v19R6 which barely finished the day in the green while the Dow Jones https ibb co Gtq5WF7 industrial lost 12 points We also saw the VIX https ibb co Mpbp84k continuing to lose ground but at a lower rate as it is testing the 21 levels yet again Almost 60 of the companies were declining yesterday https ibb co 6rnhSpQ on below average volume as the companies trading above the moving averages is still very high Yesterday we also saw only 3 of the 11 sectors https ibb co 2ZbYCWp finish in the green with Tech leading the way up over 1 while the biggest laggard by far was the Energy sector losing over 3 for the day as Large cap growth companies were the only ones to gain yesterday https ibb co yQNzN5b while value plays lagged behind Here is the HEAT MAP https ibb co y626Sdj from yesterday We can see Apple had a terrific day ahead of earnings with most of the semis also joining in the rally while the value heavy sectors like banks materials and utilities joined Energy in underperforming for the day Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment survey https ibb co QFsMCkj which revealed a further decrease in bullish investors which is music to my ears as bearish investors saw another increase of 3 I really hope we can get the bullish sentiment down under 38 so we can find better opportunities in the markets We also received other economic data yesterday as the jobless claims https ibb co tPmQGkd came in 26k below last week and in line with expectations while continuing claims were also down over 100k to 5 05M as we also saw the Philly FED https ibb co YpQSMj4 coming in way better than expected while the December Housing Starts https ibb co H7cPXfx also came in ahead of expectations with a 5 8 increase m m as it doesn t seem the housing market will cool itself soon it just wants to go higher amp higher right now And one last number that we saw yesterday was from Store https ibb co TTGMFCv Capital which announced rent collections for January standing at 91 a 1 increase since December This is better than I expected as I thought they would start to have more problems with more restriction amp lockdowns happening in the cold season rather than improving the situation Today https ibb co BTQDPvt we start the day off with the PMI reading and finish mostly with energy related economic data In some other stock market news we saw most of the solar stocks https ibb co WWKvsmz and the other green energy stocks pop yesterday after Biden signed the executive order to rejoin the climate accord and also signed a number of other orders focused on moving to a greener energy I think this will remain a very investable theme in the next couple of years especially if the Dems keep the control of the Congress in the next elections This sector also contains Tesla https ibb co 0sQv2th which according to the most recent data saw a 63 increase y y in vehicle registration in California which is another good sign for the company as they are working towards building into this high valuation while others like Lucid https ibb co 8s42vV5 Motors are still working into getting their first production car to the market I think this highly flying stocks and IPOs should be taken with a lot of attention yes they are very interesting but not all of them will make it to the other side meaning the profit side just like not all dot com companies made it Invest wisely and diversify your portfolio to avoid significant risk Yesterday we also saw Intel https ibb co vvXfTqz beat expectations with a beat of 40 cents on earnings and a beat of 2 5B on revenues but did not impress with anything else as the guidance still disappointed investors This was the last quarter for the outgoing CEO which will be replaced in the next weeks in a try to reimagine Intel s path forward The company also increased their dividend https ibb co 0DfsfnX by 5 probably in an attempt to keep investors motivated to hold the stock I think Intel might eventually catch up to their competitors somewhat but it will take a lot of spending and time I think you are better off investing in others like Broadcom AMD Micron which seem to have a plan figured out already So let s hope for a turnaround in the markets or hopefully we only see a small healthy correction as the Asia Pacific markets https ibb co 3NQmSck fell overnight with the US FUTURES https ibb co mNq0Cy7 also posting to a red open Thank you everyone for reading Hope you enjoyed the content Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the

another DD on Gamestop I will take a look at the biggest institutional inflows and outflows into Gamestop and reason myself into bullish confirmation bias explain why objectively the buyers are right and the sellers are fuk You can also see my full DD with charts and images and emojis and shit in this PowerPoint yes there is a Powerpoint DID I STUTTER https docdro id zbMjIJk https docdro id zbMjIJk This DD is concerned with institutional investments in Gamestop Why do we care about institutional investors 1 They can greatly influence the price with big buy or sell orders 2 They often have longer holding periods than WSB autists If many institutions hold Gamestop it reduces the actively traded float and increases the probability of a short squeeze 3 Institutional buy in means support for the fundamental value of Gamestop and confidence in their turnaround Tl dr Lots of institutions IMMEDIATELY but quietly made big bets on Gamestop after Ryan Cohen made his first investment I believe these inflows will continue as his influence on the company grows While many institutions also exited Gamestop in the past months due to the timing of their sales I believe these were panic sells that were made prematurely Even more tl dr but you really might need to hold for quite a few months to see big gains This post talks about three different issues 1 Gamestop s situation in Summer 2020 and how Ryan Cohen swooped in to save the day 2 How different institutions reacted to Ryan Cohen s investment 3 Why the bullish institutions were right and the bearish ones were wrong Part 1 Initial situation in summer of 2020 Things were looking real dire for Gamestop just a couple of months ago Processing img ejlho2zamuc61 The price was on a consistent slide Sentiment was absolutely terrible A dying brick and mortar company Going short was a sure thing Then Covid and retail closures Bear thesis totally confirmed right Right In swoops Ryan Cohen and sneakily accumulates 5 of the company We all know what happened to the share price after Processing img u5i7k2oemuc61 This DD is mainly concerned with institutional money flows in Q3 2020 who bought and who sold and what can we conclude from that Part 2 How different institutions reacted in Q3 Now sadly reporting takes a long time so we only know what movements funds made up until September 30 2020 But that gives us a glimpse into what funds did in the same quarter in which Ryan Cohen bought in In that quarter institutions bought 22m shares of Gamestop and sold 13m A few big names were involved both in the selling and the buying https preview redd it 62lu32fimuc61 png width 1400 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 234024c1e51099af1c098c4e556f6b788512e45d But drunkiez you say why do I care So some institutions sold and some bought How does this info help me go to Mars Read on my child Part 3 Why the bulls were right The relevant info here is timing If we just look at the the Top 10 funds with the biggest Gamestop inflows in Q3 2020 7 of those opened completely new positions once they heard about Cohen s first investment The other 3 increased their share count by 200 900 They realized immediately that the narrative would shift completely Gamestop would no longer be seen as a dying retailer but had a long term chance for a new future These guys are in it for the long haul Companies like Morgan Stanley and Susquehanna hold their positions for an average of 20 40 quarters The average WSB tard can t even hold for 20 40 minutes Now what about the poopoo bears We can see that many big institutions like Blackrock also exited in Q3 2020 These funds also have long holding periods In fact you can see in the chart below that the Top 10 bearish institutions had nearly unchanged share holdings since at least September 2019 and suddenly panic sold at the height of the Covid panic right before they heard about Cohen s involvement amp x200B Processing img huityktkmuc61 Actually the truth is even worse then the chart shows Many big dick funds started making bullish bets on Gamestop even before 2019 Yes you read that right Blackrock made a huge bullish bet in Q2 2018 bagheld for over two years then panic sold weeks before Ryan Cohen got in Citigroup kept accumulating in 2018 and 2019 then suddenly sold almost the entire stake at the very bottom D E Shaw went all in at the beginning of 2019 and panic sold at the bottom They all deserve to be mods on this sub Do you really want to follow these people with your trades What does this mean for the future Sometime in February we will receive new filings on institutional purchases made in Q4 2019 I expect to see many more inflows as Ryan Cohen continued his commitment Not to speak of Q1 2020 when he actually got operationally involved with 3 new board members This turnaround story has only just begun Bonus why it s a good idea to trust Ryan Cohen A lot has been done to praise Ryan Cohen on this sub If you want to understand why I m bullish on anything he does read this great DD by runningAndJumping22 GME DD Background and experience of new leadership https www reddit com r runningAndJumping22 comments l1egkw gme dd background and experience of new leadership I just want to add one point to this building a successful startup is HARD Out of the companies that receive funding which in itself is really hard to do 9 out of 10 will go on to fail But you know what increases your chances of building a successful company to almost 100 If you ve already done it before You have the money the network and the talent to do it again Look what the founders of Paypal later accomplished Tesla Affirm SpaceX all of Peter Thiel s successes Palantir Youtube Linkedin etc Very different companies every single one of them a winner VC funds will fall over themselves to give money to previously successful founders because they know they will have an almost 100 chance of succeeding again Ryan and his buddies have done it once and they can do it again It doesn t really matter to us how they do it They could walk into any fund s office and easily collect tens of millions to start a new gaming e commerce company But they chose to do it with Gamestop Not a bad idea in itself In my opinion they could literally close every single store sell all assets and use the net cash of USD 200m to build an ecommerce company from scratch btw Chewy which ships 60 POUND HEAVY BAGS OF DOG FOOD only used USD 130m in capital investments while Ryan Cohen was there But Gamestop does come with some good assets a store base a well known name partnerships Reginald Fils Aime on the board etc One hindrance is that the name Gamestop is poison on Wall Street I know this point has been beaten to death lately but I think it will take several quarters of Cohen s involvement and operational changes to truly change that so you really shouldn t invest a ton of money if you re not willing to hold for that long However we can see that sentiment started changing almost immediately once Ryan Cohen got it and I don t see that stopping anytime soon Even without a short squeeze this stock can go to the moon in the coming years tl dr once more

I noticed that this sub is going to hit 2 million people soon and I have decided to put aside my project assignments to write this DD albeit more towards psychologically on why luck is extremely important in the stock market and what you can do to potentially get in favor of luck I want to talk mainly 3 things luck the psychology behind investing and what you should do to maximize profits Luck In the book The Drunkard s Walk under chapter of Illusions of Patterns and Patterns of Illusion and I quote In 1978 Koppett revealed a system that he claimed could determine by the end of January every year whether the stock market would go up or down in that calendar year His system had correctly predicted the market he said for the past eleven years Of course stock picking systems are easy to identify in hindsight the true test is whether they will work in the future Koppett s system passed that test too judging the market by the Dow Jones Industrial Average it worked for eleven straight years from 1979 through 1989 got it wrong in 1990 and was correct again every year until 1998 But although Koppett s predictions were correct for a streak of eighteen out of nineteen years I feel confident in asserting that his streak involved no skill whatsoever Why Because Leonard Koppett was a columnist for Sporting News and his system was based on the results of the Super Bowl the championship game of professional football Whenever the team from the original National Football league won the stock market he predicted would rise In the book Fooled by Randomness the Prologue mentioned luck disguised and perceived as nonluck that is skills and more generally randomness disguised and perceived as non randomness that is determinism In the book by Taleb Nassim Nicholas Page 119 mentioned A successful person will try to convince you that his achievements could not possibly be accidental just as a gambler who wins at roulette seven times in a row will explain to you that the odds against such a streak are one in several million so you either have to believe some transcendental intervention is in play or accept his skills and insight in picking the winning numbers More often than not luck is rarely on your side So why am I saying all these What I am trying to imply is do appreciate your GME gains or whatever astronomical gains that you have These gains more often than not are results of extremely lucky happenstances where most people are incapable of harnessing them Yes there are tons of good DDs But you yourself are incredibly lucky to be part of WSB and personally reading the DDs yourselves and lucky enough to decide that you would be retarded enough to take the risk You should be happy and grateful about it because like I said this is hugely and heavily dependent on luck Humans are flawed because we have the tendency to look for specific causes that lead to effects We often find it hard to accept that an event can be the result of total randomness but sometimes it is In financial forecasting several times random volatility is mistaken for accurate prediction In a group of many analysts it is normal to expect that someone s predictions will turn out to be true u DeepFuckingValue So in case you get way too ahead of yourselves thinking you are absolutely a genius for having triple percentage gains in your portfolio remember you re most likely just lucky And since you re lucky be appreciative and do not be complacent Psychology behind Investing Several studies have fooled people into believing they are in control of something they actually have no control over In fact human decision making shows systematic simplifications and deviations from the tenets of rationality heuristics that may lead to suboptimal decisional outcomes cognitive biases There are currently three prevailing theoretical perspectives on the origin of heuristics and cognitive biases a cognitive psychological an ecological and an evolutionary perspective To simplify that it basically means that cognitive biases arise from intrinsic brain mechanisms that are fundamental for the working of our neural networks Your mind is always on the cautious side of things because it is trying to protect you Remember a time when you were very near the edge of a building cliff and all of a sudden you feel hypersensitive to the surrounding around you You are aware of every rocks and stones that might sabotage you Another example can be that you shiver when peeing because your body is exaggerating the signal that you are rapidly losing body heat and is trying to shiver up the muscle fiber to keep you warm etc You get the idea This unfortunately applies in investing as well Your mind will inevitably forces you to be on the safer side A dip Oh no you panic But relax that is normal In my last point I will explain what you can do to overcome it What you can do to stay calm So now you know that it is in human nature to be a paper handed bitch The first step is realizing that your own neutral networks are playing a huge part in giving you a paper hand When you realized that it is your own mind that is keeping you on the safer side perhaps you can be more self aware Being impatient in the market is the worst mistake that you would commit while investing in the stocks You have to know that if you do not have good patience in the market then you would find difficulty in getting the right stocks for your investment You have to finally take your own decisions when you wish to select the stocks Remember however you do have to be lucky to hit the jackpot on certain investments as per my first point Confirmation bias is also a bitch As philosopher Francis Bacon put it in 1620 the human understanding once it has adopted an opinion collects any instances that confirm it and though the contrary instances may be more numerous and more weighty it either does not notice them or else rejects them in order that this opinion will remain unshaken This happens very often in WSB and I want you to be cautious as well Luck does not solely come from deciding whether to listen to another retard s DD on a thread and YOLO ing your life savings onto some stocks It also comes in the form of your birth status etc Having a 100 000 head start in the stock market is almost always better than someone having 1000 as a starting capital or worse still negative capital simply because your parents are poor that s unlucky That being said I believe all of us here are in some way privileged to be gathered here and discussing individually The poor kids in some countries have to fight for clean water and food So the next time you realized that you are earning money in the stock market remember it is incredibly hard to do it and you should be proud of yourselves And in the scenario where you lose your money well you shouldn t be surprised either way If you make huge gains go and give some of it to other people that may not have been so lucky Go and give it to the homeless people who ain t so lucky as you Maybe buy him food Get him clothes Donate to your local charities Most importantly give it back to your parents because your parents are the one who most likely set you up in this direction and you are lucky enough to be here today If you did not make any gains remember it is perfectly okay

the stock in the next years amp months Let s start by talking a little about Disney https ibb co PMhMz9f yeah I know everyone knows Disney their movies their parks and much more but I believe Disney is still undervalued at this current price especially due to their Disney and other streaming businesses which have taken of since the start of 2020 Disney is the biggest entertainment company in the world and has the 20th biggest market cap as they operate a number of profitable segments including cable networks like Disney ESPN and many more others while they also have a vast segment of parks amp experiences including multiple Disneyland resorts cruise lines and many others Disney also operates a studio entertainment business under multiple big names like Marvel Pixar Walt Disney pictures and also offer Direct to Consumer networks amp streaming services like Disney Hulu ESPN and others The company has over 200K employees and is nearing 100 years since it was founded So we have to talk about the adjustment Disney has made starting in 2020 The company has cut the dividend https ibb co YQQ8xLL payouts and has focus its efforts into growing the company with the company accelerating their move to an elite streaming business which was supposed to have a time horizon of at least 3 4 years and which has now surpassed all their expectations and made the stock pop to all time highs of over 180 just recently Disney just had their latest Investors Day meeting in which they announced a lot of promising business opportunities for the company related to their developing streaming business They announced at least 10 Marvel series https ibb co RQrxPfR like Captain Marvel 2 a new Doctor Strange development while continuing movies https ibb co 87CcQ7B for Thor Black Panther and

guidance in all 3 big streaming services Disney Hulu amp ESPN have been reached in less than a year with Disney and ESPN hitting the top of their expectations for 2024 while Hulu is just shy of their

over 230M and a top expectation of 260M subscribers by 2024 which is 30 more than Netflix has right now after over 20 years since it was founded They are also planning on pricing https ibb co zZszZWR Disney at 8 month starting this March as they have revised the content expense https ibb co kKK2Rxq to over 8B for 2024 more than double their previous estimates as they look to provide as much and as good as possible content for their customers Despite the huge number of subscribers Disney https ibb co 1Lrscqx is still losing money due to very high costs of getting the service of the ground but the company has revised their expectations and expect peak operating losses from Disney to come up this year and are expecting profitability by 2024 which is pretty much on schedule So let s go a little through the latest quarterly amp yearly results for Disney https ibb co x3n4Bmb The company has been hugely affected due to the events that happened in 2020 as they were forced to close or operate at a significant reduced capacity their Parks Experiences and Products segment The company reported a non GAAP loss of 0 20 for the 4th quarter and a loss of 2 02 for the year Despite this loss I think the company has done as good as was possibly expected as the situation accelerate their growth of their Disney service The company reported https ibb co Bjpz16L just over 7B in Media revenues for the 4th quarter and over 28B for the year both of them being increases of at least 11 vs the previous year Disney also reported a 41 increase in Direct to Consumer revenues for the 4th quarter with almost 17B in revenues for the year while on the other hand both the Studio Entertainment amp the Park Experiences amp Products segment saw a major loss of revenues with both of them being down more than 50 for the 4th quarter vs 2019 Disney https ibb co G0KBJQG also improved their operating results in both Media Networks and Direct to Consumer but only manage to obtain an operating income from their Media Networks and their Studio Entertainment business totaling an operating income of just over 8B for the year a 45 decrease over 2019 Their latest moves to accelerate the growth of Disney had a big effect in the operating results https ibb co t3wfwzC as the costs of rolling out Disney eat up the revenues while very few of their Movies were actually released to the cinema which also impacted their Studio Entertainment top amp bottom line Also to be noted that the eliminations segment includes the inter segment transaction between their Media amp Studio segments to their Direct to Consumer segment Disney https ibb co SxXHZLK also saw their Parks amp Experiences revenues decline drastically as well as their operating results as a result of the closing or operating at a reduced capacity for all of their resorts which is estimated to have had a negative impact of 2 4B for their operating income Studio Entertainment was hit just as bad with a decline of more than 50 in both revenues and operating income as theatrical releases were mostly put on pause as most of the theaters around the world have been closed or have operated at a significantly reduced capacity We also saw Direct to Consumer operating loss and revenues improve https ibb co G7Sg19n for the 4th quarter as ESPN amp Hulu were a boost while Disney continued to burn money at a very high rate that is needed for a rapid growth of the service We can also see that all 3 major streaming services had a big increase year year with ESPN amp HULU gaining more than 7M paid subscribers while Disney skyrocketed to over 86M after the latest numbers from their investors meeting Despite this numbers the only increase in monthly revenue subscriber was seen in Hulu s https ibb co LzmrvwV top package while the rest of them dropped very likely due to the high number of promotions in the Asian markets It s also to be noted that though most of their parks amp resorts were affected Disney didn t stop investing in them and had a Capex https ibb co 2jsth35 of over 4B in 2020 The company https ibb co dk88L7f also received other sources of income due to their gains in DraftKings but most of these gains were offset by their interest expenses So you should now that I am bull on Disney but I am willing to hear other opinions so don t be afraid to leave a comment down below I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company the latest plans https ibb co 9WxkCyd announced by them and used some estimates and expectations of their revenues streams to normalize in the next years So keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on So let s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow projections https ibb co mtb7s5y though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon I implied the same growth rates for the total revenues based on my growth projections and also implied that EBITDA margin will slowly recover to the levels it stood before the massive investments in their streaming business as the EBITDA margins stood https ibb co Svr8NjN at over 30 before that and with streaming business being a very lucrative affair I can easily see that happen again I also used the Depreciation amp Amortization from 2020 and implied a 10 growth while also doing the same for the Net Working Capital I used a 15 capex increases like I will do in my growth projections and used a 9 discount rate which is above the avg SP500 return in the past 60years Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method but for Disney I think the EBITDA approach is better suited as I expect the stock to be re rated after they start to turn profitable on their streaming business and you will see with my growth method that it shows pretty much the same results So this means we have an estimated 56B worth of FCF for a 9 discount rate I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 3 5 rate after 2025 and that would mean that Disney will be worth almost 500B by 2025 So let s do the math for the growth approach and with a share count of 1 81B that would mean a stock price of 175 and would imply a return of just over 2 But I don t expect this to be the best way to value the company I think the EBITDA approach is better suited for the growth that lies ahead for the company So I wanted to be conservative and used only a 16 times EBITDA which is the last multiple Disney traded before 2020 though I think with this new approach to the business we can see Disney valued at even higher multiples maybe even 20 to 25 So with this 16 times multiple the stock would be undervalued by over 40 right now but for safety reasons I would use an average of the 2 approaches So I expect Disney https ibb co hM8mqnd to trade around 210 using the DCF model which would imply a 22 return which seems pretty good I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation approach https ibb co jkL0JG9 for the future I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings So let s take a look at what Disney earnings share will be by 2025 For my projections https docs google com spreadsheets d 1Bp9cIUB8s VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb xmKHZ4c edit gid 1003936878 I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream So for the Media Networks I implied a 10 increase for next year and a decreasing growth after that and did pretty much the same for the Studio Entertainment Business I did however imply a return to normal in Parks amp Experiences revenues by 2022 and a slowing growth after that while for the Direct to Consumer I implied a bigger growth rate as by their own forecast Disney should account for around 20B in revenues by 2025 on its own For Disney s cost of sales I maintained the 68 expense ratio on their Media Networks while for their Parks amp Experiences I implied a very big cost of sales for the next 2 years and expect that to normalize towards the end of the period Meanwhile for the Studio Entertainment business I actually used a bigger expense ratio just to be safe and for the Direct to Consumer cost of sales I implied a loss for 2021 a break even for 2022 and just starting to become positive after 2023 ending with a cost ratio of 75 in 2025 For the eliminations revenues and costs I implied a gradual 10 decrease in each year but this shouldn t affect the results that much in the end I used their Capex spending from 2020 and implied a 15 annual growth as this will continue to increase at least for the next couple of years while for the interest income amp expenses I implied a 10 annual decrease but this numbers are again so small that they don t impact the end result that much and didn t want to assume and other significant losses or income I used the nominal US TAX rate of 21 and implied a 5 dilution of the stock each year So let take a recap https ibb co nj7sX5h I expect Disney to have over 137B in revenues in 2025 and almost 35B in gross revenues After subtracting their 8B capex and the almost 700M related to interest and also account for the tax rate Disney should have just over 20B in income after tax or just over 11 in earnings share So adjusted for the 5 dilution this would mean the stock is trading at just over 15 times price to 2025 earnings right now I know Disney has traded under a PE of 20 historically but with them renouncing dividends and focusing on growth especially as I can see every streaming business being valued very highly right now I think we can see a multiple expansion on Disney vs the previous normal So depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 20 and 35 the stock can trade between 220 and almost 390 So after all these estimates what are my price targets Here https ibb co 849LJH3 are my actual price targets I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Disney trade at is 249 which would imply a return of over 45 while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Disney will trade at 304 share by the end of 2025 implying a 77 return on the current price But my most bullish case would see the company trading at 359 which would imply a return of 110 So yeah guys this are my Overall price targets for 2025 my bear case is an average of the 20 amp 25 PE ratio while the normal case is the average between the 25 and 30 PE s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 30 35 So here is the FULL https docs google com spreadsheets d 1Bp9cIUB8s VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb xmKHZ4c spreadsheet that I have projected for Disney by 2025 if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below I think I have been conservative in most of my projections but feel free to give your opinion Keep in mind these targets might sound ridiculous but just look at the growth Disney has had just in the past year in the past The company has increased https ibb co BP8SVHK in value by more 18 despite all the obstacles it has faced and was up 57 in the 4 years before https ibb co bHxHf5h 2020 So yes I think Disney will be one of the best re opening plays and stay at home trades as well so a win win no matter what The company also has very good financials https ibb co JntSMr8 with more than 35B in current assets vs only 26B in current liabilities and with over 200B in total assets So the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future even after the bad year they had in 2020 And let s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts We can see that the analysts https ibb co 1sRqCTB expect somewhat smaller revenues by 2025 of around 115B compared to 137B that my Growth Valuations are projecting But I think this haven t been revised enough and don t take into account fully what the streaming business will mean for them even after their other revenue streams come back to normal So what do I expect in the next couple of days weeks and months for Disney Let s look at this CHART https ibb co cTCvdgf Disney has had a history of gapping up and then filling back the gap up in the past 6 months with the stock doing so 2 times But more recently they didn t fill the gap up after the vaccine news and even gapped even higher than that after the revised subscribers numbers revealed at the investors day The stock was almost overbought and overbought for pretty long stretches of times in the last 6 months but right now the RSI has dropped to 51 which could be a sign the stock is ready to move up once again So my personal opinion is that we can see the stock trade flat or even drop a little more but not below 158 before the next quarterly earnings https ibb co k8x6cCW are released in February Last time around they beat expectations by quite a lot and I think they might actually pull it off again with the increasing strength in the streaming business and that might be enough to push the stock even higher So using the DCF https ibb co ZfcJZz9 valuation I think we can see Disney trading at around 210 by the end of the year especially if things start to get back to normal and their parks amp other revenues streams come back at increased strength And let s take a quick look at what 27 analysts https ibb co VJNg2m5 on Wall Street are saying They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of 181 and a high price target of 220 as 20 of the 27 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Disney So yet again I think the analyst are undershooting the price of Disney as it s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around So what would I do Well I own Disney stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow so I would start building a position on any weakness and I would especially buy more if the stock drops to 160 One last thing to mention about Disney is that they also have a very big of their shares held by institutions with over 65 of the float being held by big funds https ibb co 5KRGT0Y like Vanguard amp Blackrock So this are my projections and my expectations for the company I think Bob Chapek https ibb co 1JJzyq2 has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO early in 2020 and has driven Disney to a renewed approach to their business so if

amp DCF Can Disney 2x , Is this the time to buy Disney stock Will Disney make this company a must have What is my price prediction for Disney Read until the end of the post as I reveal my price target for Disney and what I expect to happen next Very Very Long Post Don t read if you hate long post Hello everyone and stock analysis in which we will go into an in depth analysis about Disney s stock We are going to talk about Disney as a company and what s the upside for the stock So let s go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental technical analysis predictions cash flows analysis and my price target for the stock in the next years amp months Let s start by talking a little about Disney https ibb co PMhMz9f yeah I know everyone knows Disney their movies their parks and much more but I believe Disney is still undervalued at this current price especially due to their Disney and other streaming businesses which have taken of since the start of 2020 Disney is the biggest entertainment company in the world and has the 20th biggest market cap as they operate a number of profitable segments including cable networks like Disney ESPN and many more others while they also have a vast segment of parks amp experiences including multiple Disneyland resorts cruise lines and many others Disney also operates a studio entertainment business under multiple big names like Marvel Pixar Walt Disney pictures and also offer Direct to Consumer networks amp streaming services like Disney Hulu ESPN and others The company has over 200K employees and is nearing 100 years since it was founded So we have to talk about the adjustment Disney has made starting in 2020 The company has cut the dividend https ibb co YQQ8xLL payouts and has focus its efforts into growing the company with the company accelerating their move to an elite streaming business which was supposed to have a time horizon of at least 3 4 years and which has now surpassed all their expectations and made the stock pop to all time highs of over 180 just recently Disney just had their latest Investors Day meeting in which they announced a lot of promising business opportunities for the company related to their developing streaming business They announced at least 10 Marvel series https ibb co RQrxPfR like Captain Marvel 2 a new Doctor Strange development while continuing movies https ibb co 87CcQ7B for Thor Black Panther and others https ibb co Dpr73G2 They also announced at least 10 Star Wars series https ibb co 9HBrXZj including https ibb co PZkKTC4 the continuation of their big hit The Mandalorian and also provided updates on more child friendly productions with 15 Disney amp Pixar series https ibb co HNkMYvT The company has far outpaced any of their previous GUIDANCE https ibb co vhWGCRd as their initial guidance in all 3 big streaming services Disney Hulu amp ESPN have been reached in less than a year with Disney and ESPN hitting the top of their expectations for 2024 while Hulu is just shy of their bottom expectations as Disney was a hit since its start with over 10M signups in the first DAY https ibb co PW4WRfY Disney also keeps expanding into multiple countries as they continued to launch the streaming business in over 15 countries https ibb co Kwk9dd1 just recently in November as their streaming services are offered https ibb co 4N8s3yt on most devices like Android amp Apple devices Amazon s Fire TV Roku streaming platform and Google s devices The company has extreme pricing power due to their capability to generate revenues from their other income streams but haven t chosen to abuse that with only minor increases in price while also offering a great Disney Bundle https ibb co R2p28zM for just 13 month that includes the top 3 streaming services Disney Hulu amp ESPN Hulu has seen a huge subscriber growth https ibb co XkVCK72 in the past years adding around 8M subscribers year since 2017 as they offer multiple subscription choices https ibb co sFnV4gV starting from 6 up to 71 for their no ads amp live TV service After these results Disney has slightly increased their bottom line expectations for the service https ibb co 4sK1HR7 to 50M by 2024 and are expecting Hulu to become profitable https ibb co W3C6Ybm as soon as FY 2023 They also revised the ESPN https ibb co S0wx121 expectations from between 8 12M to an incredible 20 30M subscribers range by 2024 as they also expect this service to become profitable https ibb co 4S8Qj8b by FY 2023 But guys by far the biggest guidance https ibb co 3swTzSG upgrade for Disney has come from Disney with a revised guidance of over 230M and a top expectation of 260M subscribers by 2024 which is 30 more than Netflix has right now after over 20 years since it was founded They are also planning on pricing https ibb co zZszZWR Disney at 8 month starting this March as they have revised the content expense https ibb co kKK2Rxq to over 8B for 2024 more than double their previous estimates as they look to provide as much and as good as possible content for their customers Despite the huge number of subscribers Disney https ibb co 1Lrscqx is still losing money due to very high costs of getting the service of the ground but the company has revised their expectations and expect peak operating losses from Disney to come up this year and are expecting profitability by 2024 which is pretty much on schedule So let s go a little through the latest quarterly amp yearly results for Disney https ibb co x3n4Bmb The company has been hugely affected due to the events that happened in 2020 as they were forced to close or operate at a significant reduced capacity their Parks Experiences and Products segment The company reported a non GAAP loss of 0 20 for the 4th quarter and a loss of 2 02 for the year Despite this loss I think the company has done as good as was possibly expected as the situation accelerate their growth of their Disney service The company reported https ibb co Bjpz16L just over 7B in Media revenues for the 4th quarter and over 28B for the year both of them being increases of at least 11 vs the previous year Disney also reported a 41 increase in Direct to Consumer revenues for the 4th quarter with almost 17B in revenues for the year while on the other hand both the Studio Entertainment amp the Park Experiences amp Products segment saw a major loss of revenues with both of them being down more than 50 for the 4th quarter vs 2019 Disney https ibb co G0KBJQG also improved their operating results in both Media Networks and Direct to Consumer but only manage to obtain an operating income from their Media Networks and their Studio Entertainment business totaling an operating income of just over 8B for the year a 45 decrease over 2019 Their latest moves to accelerate the growth of Disney had a big effect in the operating results https ibb co t3wfwzC as the costs of rolling out Disney eat up the revenues while very few of their Movies were actually released to the cinema which also impacted their Studio Entertainment top amp bottom line Also to be noted that the eliminations segment includes the inter segment transaction between their Media amp Studio segments to their Direct to Consumer segment Disney https ibb co SxXHZLK also saw their Parks amp Experiences revenues decline drastically as well as their operating results as a result of the closing or operating at a reduced capacity for all of their resorts which is estimated to have had a negative impact of 2 4B for their operating income Studio Entertainment was hit just as bad with a decline of more than 50 in both revenues and operating income as theatrical releases were mostly put on pause as most of the theaters around the world have been closed or have operated at a significantly reduced capacity We also saw Direct to Consumer operating loss and revenues improve https ibb co G7Sg19n for the 4th quarter as ESPN amp Hulu were a boost while Disney continued to burn money at a very high rate that is needed for a rapid growth of the service We can also see that all 3 major streaming services had a big increase year year with ESPN amp HULU gaining more than 7M paid subscribers while Disney skyrocketed to over 86M after the latest numbers from their investors meeting Despite this numbers the only increase in monthly revenue subscriber was seen in Hulu s https ibb co LzmrvwV top package while the rest of them dropped very likely due to the high number of promotions in the Asian markets It s also to be noted that though most of their parks amp resorts were affected Disney didn t stop investing in them and had a Capex https ibb co 2jsth35 of over 4B in 2020 The company https ibb co dk88L7f also received other sources of income due to their gains in DraftKings but most of these gains were offset by their interest expenses So you should now that I am bull on Disney but I am willing to hear other opinions so don t be afraid to leave a comment down below I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company the latest plans https ibb co 9WxkCyd announced by them and used some estimates and expectations of their revenues streams to normalize in the next years So keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on So let s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow projections https ibb co mtb7s5y though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon I implied the same growth rates for the total revenues based on my growth projections and also implied that EBITDA margin will slowly recover to the levels it stood before the massive investments in their streaming business as the EBITDA margins stood https ibb co Svr8NjN at over 30 before that and with streaming business being a very lucrative affair I can easily see that happen again I also used the Depreciation amp Amortization from 2020 and implied a 10 growth while also doing the same for the Net Working Capital I used a 15 capex increases like I will do in my growth projections and used a 9 discount rate which is above the avg SP500 return in the past 60years Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method but for Disney I think the EBITDA approach is better suited as I expect the stock to be re rated after they start to turn profitable on their streaming business and you will see with my growth method that it shows pretty much the same results So this means we have an estimated 56B worth of FCF for a 9 discount rate I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 3 5 rate after 2025 and that would mean that Disney will be worth almost 500B by 2025 So let s do the math for the growth approach and with a share count of 1 81B that would mean a stock price of 175 and would imply a return of just over 2 But I don t expect this to be the best way to value the company I think the EBITDA approach is better suited for the growth that lies ahead for the company So I wanted to be conservative and used only a 16 times EBITDA which is the last multiple Disney traded before 2020 though I think with this new approach to the business we can see Disney valued at even higher multiples maybe even 20 to 25 So with this 16 times multiple the stock would be undervalued by over 40 right now but for safety reasons I would use an average of the 2 approaches So I expect Disney https ibb co hM8mqnd to trade around 210 using the DCF model which would imply a 22 return which seems pretty good I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation approach https ibb co jkL0JG9 for the future I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings So let s take a look at what Disney earnings share will be by 2025 For my projections https docs google com spreadsheets d 1Bp9cIUB8s VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb xmKHZ4c edit gid 1003936878 I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream So for the Media Networks I implied a 10 increase for next year and a decreasing growth after that and did pretty much the same for the Studio Entertainment Business I did however imply a return to normal in Parks amp Experiences revenues by 2022 and a slowing growth after that while for the Direct to Consumer I implied a bigger growth rate as by their own forecast Disney should account for around 20B in revenues by 2025 on its own For Disney s cost of sales I maintained the 68 expense ratio on their Media Networks while for their Parks amp Experiences I implied a very big cost of sales for the next 2 years and expect that to normalize towards the end of the period Meanwhile for the Studio Entertainment business I actually used a bigger expense ratio just to be safe and for the Direct to Consumer cost of sales I implied a loss for 2021 a break even for 2022 and just starting to become positive after 2023 ending with a cost ratio of 75 in 2025 For the eliminations revenues and costs I implied a gradual 10 decrease in each year but this shouldn t affect the results that much in the end I used their Capex spending from 2020 and implied a 15 annual growth as this will continue to increase at least for the next couple of years while for the interest income amp expenses I implied a 10 annual decrease but this numbers are again so small that they don t impact the end result that much and didn t want to assume and other significant losses or income I used the nominal US TAX rate of 21 and implied a 5 dilution of the stock each year So let take a recap https ibb co nj7sX5h I expect Disney to have over 137B in revenues in 2025 and almost 35B in gross revenues After subtracting their 8B capex and the almost 700M related to interest and also account for the tax rate Disney should have just over 20B in income after tax or just over 11 in earnings share So adjusted for the 5 dilution this would mean the stock is trading at just over 15 times price to 2025 earnings right now I know Disney has traded under a PE of 20 historically but with them renouncing dividends and focusing on growth especially as I can see every streaming business being valued very highly right now I think we can see a multiple expansion on Disney vs the previous normal So depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 20 and 35 the stock can trade between 220 and almost 390 So after all these estimates what are my price targets Here https ibb co 849LJH3 are my actual price targets I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Disney trade at is 249 which would imply a return of over 45 while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Disney will trade at 304 share by the end of 2025 implying a 77 return on the current price But my most bullish case would see the company trading at 359 which would imply a return of 110 So yeah guys this are my Overall price targets for 2025 my bear case is an average of the 20 amp 25 PE ratio while the normal case is the average between the 25 and 30 PE s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 30 35 So here is the FULL https docs google com spreadsheets d 1Bp9cIUB8s VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb xmKHZ4c spreadsheet that I have projected for Disney by 2025 if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below I think I have been conservative in most of my projections but feel free to give your opinion Keep in mind these targets might sound ridiculous but just look at the growth Disney has had just in the past year in the past The company has increased https ibb co BP8SVHK in value by more 18 despite all the obstacles it has faced and was up 57 in the 4 years before https ibb co bHxHf5h 2020 So yes I think Disney will be one of the best re opening plays and stay at home trades as well so a win win no matter what The company also has very good financials https ibb co JntSMr8 with more than 35B in current assets vs only 26B in current liabilities and with over 200B in total assets So the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future even after the bad year they had in 2020 And let s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts We can see that the analysts https ibb co 1sRqCTB expect somewhat smaller revenues by 2025 of around 115B compared to 137B that my Growth Valuations are projecting But I think this haven t been revised enough and don t take into account fully what the streaming business will mean for them even after their other revenue streams come back to normal So what do I expect in the next couple of days weeks and months for Disney Let s look at this CHART https ibb co cTCvdgf Disney has had a history of gapping up and then filling back the gap up in the past 6 months with the stock doing so 2 times But more recently they didn t fill the gap up after the vaccine news and even gapped even higher than that after the revised subscribers numbers revealed at the investors day The stock was almost overbought and overbought for pretty long stretches of times in the last 6 months but right now the RSI has dropped to 51 which could be a sign the stock is ready to move up once again So my personal opinion is that we can see the stock trade flat or even drop a little more but not below 158 before the next quarterly earnings https ibb co k8x6cCW are released in February Last time around they beat expectations by quite a lot and I think they might actually pull it off again with the increasing strength in the streaming business and that might be enough to push the stock even higher So using the DCF https ibb co ZfcJZz9 valuation I think we can see Disney trading at around 210 by the end of the year especially if things start to get back to normal and their parks amp other revenues streams come back at increased strength And let s take a quick look at what 27 analysts https ibb co VJNg2m5 on Wall Street are saying They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of 181 and a high price target of 220 as 20 of the 27 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Disney So yet again I think the analyst are undershooting the price of Disney as it s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around So what would I do Well I own Disney stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow so I would start building a position on any weakness and I would especially buy more if the stock drops to 160 One last thing to mention about Disney is that they also have a very big of their shares held by institutions with over 65 of the float being held by big funds https ibb co 5KRGT0Y like Vanguard amp Blackrock So this are my projections and my expectations for the company I think Bob Chapek https ibb co 1JJzyq2 has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO early in 2020 and has driven Disney to a renewed approach to their business so if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 1Bp9cIUB8s

There is literally no way for shorts to exit their costly positions without paying us as long as we HOLD STOCKS ONLY GO UP GME would have hit 100 today if it wasn t for the circuit breakers pausing

PlayFree Bird This was a gamma squeeze not a margin call on the shorts A legit margin call takes this to 200 not 75 What happened to day is that 1 22 60c were suddenly and unexpectedly in the money And there were a hell of a lot of them Call writers were covering their asses this morning not the big shorts A significant margin call today on top of all those 60 calls going ITM would have been the true short squeeze It would have made 75 look cheap Without that circuit breaker today might have been close to the moment we were all waiting for I can only imagine how close the brokers were to picking up the phone and completely fucking the short sellers Someone was definitely thinking about it you know that Eventually when the big boys need to unwind their positions the circuit breakers won t matter I guess they ll just trip the breaker a lot It s true that there does need to be a catalyst that actually starts the snowball effect and that s a little trickier when the trading gets halted on a day like today Remember that time is always on the side of the long holders They bleed interest we don t The first significant short to make a run for the exits buy and cover before his fellow shorts catch on could be the thing that does it Could also be good news about the company or word that a whale has entered a position The point is that something will eventually trigger a run

j2gtyktt7yc61 obligatory rockets What is Corsair CORSAIR offers a complete range of products to equip gamers enthusiasts and esports athletes including mechanical keyboards precision gaming mice wireless headsets premium PC components and the CORSAIR ONE fully integrated gaming PC Basically they sell high quality items to gamers amp x200B Gaming Peripheral Industry as a Whole The global gaming peripheral market size was valued at USD 3 88 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 10 4 from 2020 to 2025 And who tf sells gaming peripherals CRSR and its main competitor Logitech LOGI Now let s step into the ring with LOGI and CRSR LOGI Net Revenue 73 Gross Profit 108 Operating Income 18 Net Income 276 CRSR Corsair Net Revenue 60 7 Gross Profit 112 4 Operating Income 353 6 Net Income 2293 5 amp x200B Obviously Corsair is expanding like a fucking madman and will continue to do so this year They are stacking up very well against LOGI numbers wise The fun doesn t stop there Corsair commands over 18 percent of the US market share in gaming peripherals and nearly 42 percent of gaming PC components Logitech has a current price of 104 and a market cap of 17 2B Corsair has a current price of 38 and a market cap of 5 35B CORSAIR IS LIKE 2 5 THE PRICE OF LOGI BUT IS EXPANDING QUICKER ACQUIRING MORE COMPANIES AND HAS AWAY MORE LOYAL FOLLOWING What differentiates them from the competition 1 Quality Anyone who buys a corsair product will instantly realize the superior build quality and feel Somewhat like Apple products Corsair products are ascetically pleasing last for ages and offer many creature comforts 2 Name Brand If you look at any PC forum that recommends what parts to buy Corsairs name will always be popping up Experienced gamers know what Corsair offers and superior build quality Most of the time one off Chinese brands that also sell PC peripherals are not named People recommend Corsair instead Almost all of the commentators on this Reddit post swear by Corsair s product line This is not just a one time occurrence it can be seen regularly Enthusiasts recommending Corsair due to their amazing products 3 United Product Front Unlike a lot of their competitors like Logitech or Razer Corsair has a diverse product lineup for inside and outside of gamers PCs Almost all of these product lighting can be controlled by Corsair s proprietary lighting software Lighting sounds very stupid I know but gamers love it as it makes their PC look cool With iCue all of the owner s Corsair products can be controlled from a single interface This encourages people to stay in the Corsair ecosystem once they purchase their first Corsair product Everything just works together perfectly To sum up they shit on their competitors for their better execution Their products Computer RAM light up CPU air and water coolers light up Keyboards light up Mice light up Headsets light up Mouse Pads light up Computer power supplies light up Headset stands light up RGB strips light up PC Cases light up PC Case fans you guessed it light up If a consumer can buy all of their peripherals from one company and have them work harmonically together why not amp x200B https preview redd it gijwx5s08yc61 png width 1024 amp format png amp auto webp amp s faec86dacc0bb4229eb005ca3ab9713ef1fec86b amp x200B But consoles are becoming more and more popular right Yes and Corsair is covered They own Scuff Gaming which is a global innovator and creator of high performance gaming controllers providing superior accessories and customized gaming controllers for console and PC that are used by top professional gamers as well as casual gamers Scuff has cornered the 3rd party controller market When someone has a non Xbox or PS4 brand controller they ask Is that a scuff Scuff is the only real name brand company that makes comfortable and quality 3rd party controllers Unlike Corsair there is much less high level competition in this space Also almost all competitive console players use a scuff controller due to the superior button layout and customizability amp x200B https preview redd it 91fonxmq7yc61 png width 914 amp

necessities for streamers Elgato does not only offer necessities for steamers but also for YouTubers filmmakers and hobbyists They offer a wide variety of products to produce high quality videos Again like Corsair Elgato is one of the best if not the best at what it does in its industry But who wants to build their own PC when I can just build a prebuilt I think you know what I am going to say Corsair offers this through their subsidiary Origin PCs Origin offers some great value for money prebuilt PCs because they can secure exclusive deals with Corsair as it is its parent company I am not going to sugarcoat this but Origin does have ALOT of competition in this space but I think it is good that Corsair has exposure I know multiple people who really like their Origin PCs but I know just as many who own other prebuilt that get the job done amp x200B amp x200B Your whole setup could be Corsair amp x200B https preview redd it js7wto5s7yc61 png width 529 amp format png amp auto webp amp

which is expected around Febuary 10th but has not been confirmed yet There will probably be a runup if the hype is there so calls could be good to capture that IV runup but I am sticking to shares so

have a great impact on our personal health and the health of our planet By shifting from animal to plant based meat we can positively impact four growing global issues human health climate change constraints on natural resources and animal welfare The above is taken from their website definitely check out the stats it really opens your eyes in terms of how disruptive this could be in terms of health ethics the environment etc Essentially this company creates plant based meats where the products they offer currently are burger patties sausages and minced meat meant to resemble the smell texture and taste of beef They are looking to expand into the poultry and pork markets too and chicken in particular is the biggest meat market in the world so if they can do so it should prove very well for future shareholders We re almost ending January now and in January there s a challenge called Veganuary whereby people try a vegan diet for the whole month in order to reduce environmental impact and improve their health in particular it all coincides with the New year new me saying Essentially what happened was last year from this Beyond Meat saw record sales and the stock price

driven and a very honest person who doesn t pump the stock in his interviews Jim Cramer a well respected Wall Street former hedge fund manager is long on this company He has also had past success as an energy analyst at Ballard Power Systems so it seems he s very driven by solving climate change and improving the environment Very big social media following willing to bet almost everyone reading this who has social media has heard of this company Lots of celebrity investors and promotions too According to this article vegan interest is at an ATH which I m not surprised by https vegnews com 2020 9 interest in veganism hits all time high in 2020 google trends report shows https vegnews com 2020 9 interest in veganism hits all time high in 2020 google trends report shows The plant based meat industry is projecting massive growth this decade and particularly this year due to the virus it has massively accelerated the trends and I think the figures above are incredibly conservative take my opinion with a grain of salt BYND are partnered with countless retailers and restaurant brands and have recently expanded to the Asian market which will be huge in my opinion The meat market is a multi trillion market and the plant based meat market is an incredibly small fraction of it right now but growing at a much faster rate approx 20 CAG to the meat market approx 5 CAG suggesting to me they are taking market share This reminds me of what is happening with EVs and OEMs renewable energy and oil except we re much earlier in my opinion UK politicians including MP Kerry McCarthy have signed an open letter calling on the public to try a vegan diet if the UK government act on this it ll be huge and likely other governments will follow suit Recent plunge in stock price occurred due to miscommunication with McDonald s in a partnership for creating the Beyond Big Mac which would ve been huge for the company as the Big Mac is one of the most popular fast food products in existence McDonald s are creating their own in house plant based meat to cut expenses and maximise profits which is a blow to this company I bought at the 120 dip Big expectations as Q1 2021 is meant to be a huge quarter for them and if they underperform a massive drop in share price should be expected As with most companies emerging in a new industry looking to disrupt an old one they are loss making but have a content plan to profitability soon which will be huge once achieved Products they currently make are quite expensive compared to competitors but have some of the best taste imo the CEO said he really wants to bring prices down to be cost competitive with meat According to Yahoo Finance short interest currently sits at 30 which is really high for any company This isn t no GME but still very

interest at ATH visionary CEO Jim Cramer appraisal customer satisfactions shits on conventional meat in terms of water and land usage Securing deals left right and centre to produce record sales Veganuary How many of your friends relatives etc are participating bc a fuck load of mine are High short interest in the stock from missing expectation and Biden adminstration pro vegan foods bc of the ENVIRONMENT all of this Record Q1 earnings and stupid money when the shorts bleed Conclusion My main analogy behind this is that a lot of people are still salty on missing out on Tesla NIO XPeng etc so I think they d flock to this stock once media attention comes and if the management can perform to their expectations today s current market cap is extremely undervalued but that s due to the risk involved By mid 2021 if they can deliver a 500M 1B market cap gt 10 20x at current price wouldn t be unreasonable and that s without hype involved as a factor which I think is conservative PS I think this will blast through 200 all the way to the moon you schmucks if you don t think so go cry in front of a mirror and buy some bonds like the schmuck you are bc you don t belong with the men Literally EVERYTHING points towards this short interest veganism interest at an all time high YES they didn t perform to analyst expectations recently and have screwed up with the McDonald s deal but look at what happened to GME after diluting shareholders and a terrible Q3 PPS I m not a snowflake but give a n00bie a nice time down below Let s fuck up Wall Street and become multi millionaires Half

manufacturer 8 00a ET 1 18 2021 Globe Newswire H2O Innovation Builds Momentum Signing 3 2 M in New Industrial and Wastewater Contracts Mentioned HEOFF TSXV HEO H2O Innovation Inc H2O Innovation or the Corporation is proud to announce it was awarded the engineering contract on a capital equipment project for the largest electric vehicle manufacturer in the US as well as four new municipal and industrial capital equipment projects These new contracts totaling 3 2 M will bring the Corporation s Water Technologies amp Services WTS sales backlog to 37 1 M Our WTS business has been very active and their efforts are highlighted by the recent wave of projects we have captured keeping our WTS backlog very healthy With our business model the projects we execute often also lead to opportunities for our other business units down the line stated Frederic Dugre President and Chief Executive Officer of H2O Innovation The Corporation has secured the engineering contract to design two identical reverse osmosis RO trains each rated at 2 200 m day for an electric vehicle manufacturing plant located in Texas Upon successful completion of the engineering work a purchase order for construction and delivery of the equipment should be issued to the Corporation The first project is for an upgrade of the 7 500 m day Granbury Wastewater South Plant in Granbury Texas The existing conventional activated sludge plant will be converted to a membrane bioreactor MBR facility with biological phosphorus removal The new equipment builds on the plant s current infrastructure reducing the capital cost and the upgrade is designed using the Corporation s innovative flexMBR TM universal membrane system which reduces lifecycle cost The next project awarded to H2O Innovation is for a redesign and replacement of a failing MBR system at a school in the State of Maryland The Corporation has been selected to make the necessary repairs and improve the durability of the wastewater system using ceramic membranes The third project an exciting first for H2O Innovation is the award of a demonstration pilot for its novel SILO technology at an industrial customer in the Midwest US The SILO platform was developed in house as a simplified approach to MBR treatment for smaller applications and decentralized treatment facilities where installation costs ease of operation and low maintenance are key differentiators Finally H2O Innovation has secured a contract in Southern California for the supply of two RO demonstration units at the Hyperion Water Reclamation facility for long term testing and public outreach Each unit will be capable of producing up to 134 m day treating secondary MBR filtrate This project reinforces the Corporation s presence and experience in the critical water reuse market According to Mr Dugre We continue to put our efforts into capturing more wastewater water reuse and industrial opportunities characterized by higher gross profit margins and expanding our presence in Texas which is a strategic market for us Prospective disclosures This press release contains forward looking information under applicable securities law All information that addresses operations and activities that H2O Innovation expects to occur in the future is forward looking information Forward looking statements use such words as believe continue estimate expect intend should or will and other similar terms as well as those usually used in the future and the conditional Forward looking statements concern analysis and other information based on forecast future results and the estimate of amounts that cannot yet be determined and are based on the estimates and opinions of management on the date the statements are made In this press release such forward

derivative mixed equity fund primarily value focused with some growth In the past we have been value holders of GME three other times and started a small position today nears it s intraday high and will likely add to this next week should the stock fall Previously all my Reddit comments have involved my e Skate collection or my landing of my airplane in challenging conditions see https youtu be Rn7XoYKlZl0 https youtu be Rn7XoYKlZl0 However I can t resist commenting on the fascinating technical factors that likely will continue to propel this issue higher perhaps significantly so over the next few weeks Andrew Left s mocking derision of retail investors may prove to be his waterloo Why would a value focused fund manager buy a stock that based on classic fundamental value analysis appears significantly overvalued GME appears to be a very interesting example of individual stock reflexivity What is reflexivity you ask This is the theory originally promoted by George Soros that the stock market itself can cause the economy to either rise of fall as opposed to the classic teaching that the economy affects the stock market An example of market reflexivity would be the great depression whereby a crashed market brought down an economy that was only in an ordinary recession or the recent improvement in the economy not withstanding Covid which has followed a rising market In GME s case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company Why 1 As the price of the stock rises GME finds itself in the enviable position where it can use it s stock at currency to buy complementary businesses it could not otherwise afford monetization of the current short squeeze by the enterprise will lead to fundamentally higher revenue and profits of the enterprise should they find good strategic acquisitions to further monetize their large retail customer base which has real and to date largely untapped value The company is likely right now on the hunt for a major acquisition that could fundamentally alter the companies future prospects with that acquisition largely paid for on the back of short seller covering 2 Monetization of the short covering increase in share price via issue of a secondary The 500 million in debt net of cash the company currently has could be entirely extinguished with a secondary that is dilutive of only 10 of the equity base In fact such a secondary will despite this dilution likely result in a significant price rise for the stock versus the usual fall in price after most but not all secondaries Bankruptcy risk will largely be eliminated with this secondary as will interest rate risk and financing costs ultimately increasing cash flow per share A 20 secondary will leave the company in a strong cash positive position with this cash available for expansion of sales efforts cloud offerings acquisitions etc 3 Directly increased sales and revenue by virtue of the large amount of attention this epic short squeeze has brought to the company I suspect most long retail stockholders have explored the companies web offerings and are considering becoming customers This is free advertising to people with money who are tech savvy and the exact demographic GME would target with paid advertising 4 Retention and efforts of existing management now becomes easy Every manager there wants to see this continue Operations at companies with sinking share prices typically suffer as management and employees leave the enterprise or develop anger and lassitude think Sears Holdings The opposite is occurring here with every manager trying to beat their numbers to see the squeeze continue 5 This issue remains extremely heavily shorted Despite the squeeze that has already occurred other value based investors have dived into short positions as the price has risen The short positions of this issue appears although I can t be certain to exceed 100 with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well Although I don t yet have the current data on todays short position I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter perhaps more so now than at any previous time Today I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the hard to borrow desk No borrowable shares are available at any broker anywhere at this time even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers This extreme short against a small common float made more extreme no doubt by naked shorting could end very poorly for those short this issue As they are forced to close out their positions the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues Impossible to know really where the stock goes from here as there does currently exist a disconnect from fundamentals However the extreme short position against the unrestricted common float here suggests to me there is a much greater chance of GME s price continuing to increase perhaps significantly so and this chance is far greater than the now fearful pundit in hiding s proclamation that the stock would soon see 20 For what it s worth over the past 13 years of this funds life we have significantly beaten both the overall market and the dow 12 2 year margin over DJIA inclusive of dividends since 2008 We have had plenty of losing issues
