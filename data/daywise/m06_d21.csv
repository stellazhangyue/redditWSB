DD is Just look at the front page post after post about the same 3 tickers with absolutely zero substance behind them aside from some rocket emojis and pointing out the short interest on a stock Several of these totally banal posts are marked with what used to be a sacred flair DD Unfortunately these posts are NOT DD in the slightest If the extent of a person s DD on a company is entering the stock s symbol on iBorrowDesk they have not conducted their research I d like to illustrate my point Let s take a look at the stock that started this new fad GME In 2019 u DeepFuckingValue opened a YOLO on GME based on research that he had conducted What was the basis for his investment 1 GME had a Price to Sales ratio of just 0 17 compared to an S amp P 500 average of 2 7 This implied a significant undervaluation with an upside of 1500 2 GME had approximately 1 6 billion cash on hand compared to a market cap of approximately 300 million 3 GME was free cash flow positive in 2018 and 2019 They had a slump in 2020 but have returned to positive FCF in 2021 4 GME would soon benefit from the release of new consoles by Sony and Microsoft driving revenues and profits Based on these figures DFV believed that he had identified a substantially undervalued company and that he simply had to buy the stock and wait for it to move to fair value which by itself would be a 5 10 bagger The short interest was merely the cherry on top which made certain that GME would return to fair value given a positive catalyst event which the new console release was expected to be DFV s DD was solid He was not simply praying for a short squeeze on a shit company s stock There was a real investment made there and it seems that fact has been lost in the frenzy to find the next GME I would like to now draw your attention to an example of one such shit stock which is going to lose a lot of idiots a lot of money if they aren t careful This isn t the only shit stock being pushed right now based solely on its short interest but it is the one I ve conducted the most research on WKHS For those of you not in the know WKHS is an Electric Vehicle manufacturer that aims to capture the last mile electric delivery vehicle market Their stock was pumped significantly earlier this year on hopes that they would win a 6 billion contract with USPS to modernize the Postal Service s vehicle fleet The stock tanked from 30 all the way down to the low teens immediately after losing the contract to Oshkosh and has traded in the 8 16 range for the last 4 months It s currently at about 15 The entire bull case for WKHS amounts to the short float which sits at 40 I will reiterate Looking up a stock s short float is NOT DD If people had looked into the company s history and financials before buying many of them would not have lost half their investment back in February So what does the DD on WKHS say 1 They are incapable of manufacturing their vehicles at scale They made a measly 38 vehicles in Q1 of 2021 2 They are incapable of selling what vehicles they do manage to build Of those 38 vehicles manufactured 6 were delivered to customers in Q1 3 In order to sell those 6 vehicles for which they received 500 000 they spent 6 million That s not their overall loss that is their revenues vs cost of revenues They lost 5 5 million just trying to move their product They lost a total of over 100 million in Q1 3 They have a price to sales ratio of approximately 1 000 Projecting their sales figures from Q1 they are on track to make about 2 million in sales for all of 2021 while having a market cap of about 2 billion If WKHS were valued based on their P S ratio they would be worth about 4 cents per share 4 WKHS has issued new stock and taken on debt to keep themselves afloat every single year since 2016 They have never turned a profit from operations 5 WKHS recently lost a contract for USPS fleet modernization to Oshkosh a trend which could be expected to continue as larger auto manufacturers increasingly transition to EVs In short an investment in WKHS is pure speculation based on the hope that they start moving product on the hope that they become market leaders in the delivery EV space and on the hope that they win their lawsuit against the USPS for not picking them for the vehicle contract An investment in WKHS is pure speculation WKHS deserves to have high short interest because their stock is several hundred times overvalued It is a penny stock masquerading as a small to mid cap company These situations are clearly not the same DFV s investment in GME was based on solid fundamental analysis with upcoming catalysts to move the stock towards fair value which was above the stock s valuation at the time The short interest was secondary to the fundamentals WKHS has a fair value well below its current valuation The short interest is being treated as the primary reason to invest Which brings me to the final point There was a sticky on this sub a week or two ago that put it perfectly Investing is not a team sport We are all here trying to make money Too often lately I find myself sorting by controversial in the comments of a DD post because morons are downvoting people who point out the bear case in a wannabe meme stock That shouldn t be happening That bear case could save a lot of noobs a lot of money when it convinces them not to throw money at a shit stock Remember to do your own DD on whatever the latest fad is because positive returns are not guaranteed Feel free to disregard any post that treats investing as a team effort anyone that posts about diamond hands and anyone who uses a rocket emoji in their post titles because those people are imbeciles If you do invest in a meme stock for a short squeeze make your money and get the fuck out before it crashes back down to earth TL DR Investing in a stock based purely on the hope of a short squeeze makes you a fucking imbecile Posts marked DD with little more than short interest and shallow speculation should be banned

131,o4m5ju,t2_8fxmkvyu,1624246586,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o4m5ju/sens_dd/,1,SENS DD,SENS why to buy Skip to end to see summary Catalyst SENS CGM system has been remodeled and improved to last 180 days and is awaiting approval from the FDA The chances of it being approved are high considering that it s already being used In Europe Keep in mind America makes up about 96 of the market share Due to Covid 19 the approval was pushed back and is thought to be some time around the middle of this year This has caught the eye of institutional buyers as 25 of the stock and 50 of the float is held by institutional buyers Recently H C Wainwright agreed to buy about 25 974 026 shares at 1 925 per share Within days the same Hedge Fund agreed to increase the magnitude of their purchase to 51 948 052 shares at the same price The total value of the purchase is exactly 100 million dollars Then on January 21st it was bought deal valuing the total purchase at 115 million SENS has 14 patents all relating to the design and specific parts of their CGM system The way a normal CGM system works is a tiny sensor with a needle is inserted under your skin and then it measures your glucose levels while lasting up to 7 14 days Twice a day you need to check the CGM system itself by pricking your finger and inserting a drop of blood You also need to replace the CGM sensor every 3 7 days which requires you to remove the entire device The Percentage of Americans with type 1 diabetes that use a CGM is now on an exponential growth curve rising from 12 in 2014 to 24 in 2016 to 38 in 2018 The general market concentration has about 4 major players Dexcom Abbott Medtronic and Senseonics So this market is extremely concentrated Out of all the other companies that are solely devoted to the design and manufacturing of CgM devices there are 26 competitors however Senseonics has received the most funding at 143 4 million Also the main subject behind the majority of their patents is analytical chemistry analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining processing and communicating information about the composition and structure of matter In other words it is the art and science of determining what matter is and how much of it exists And while yes this field is being used to separate and measure the glucose levels within the human Body this field is very wide and offers a wide selection of possible futures once revenue increases Out of the past 4 quarters SENS has beat revenue expectations 3 times and beat EPS estimates twice Continuous Glucose Monitoring Market Current market dynamics and growth opportunities Technological advances on the market Strategies and different product innovations for major players Two things make up the CGM market the components used and the geographical location of the company MARKET DRIVERS Surge in diabetic population 205 47 million people suffer from diabetes in China and India 20 million had type 1 diabetes America 2 7 million Americans have type 1 diabetes 32 3 million Americans have type 2 diabetes Diabetics have a 300 increased risk of being hospitalized thus increasing expenses or cautionary measures In developed countries close to 90 of type 1 diabetes patients use glucose meters 50 of type 2 may also use glucose meters With increasing awareness among the type 2 diabetes patients demand for CGM devices has been rising at a rapid pace In 2016 there were about 321 million people with diabetes by 2020 the number has increased about ten percent to 361 million 2017 Increased 2 18 percent 2018 Increased 3 96 percent 2019 Increased 2 93 percent 2020 Increased 2 84 percent SENSORS Eversense CGM System an implantable glucose sensor by Senseonics Incorporated was launched in 2018 The advantage of Eversense CGM System is that it can remain in place for up to three months where the other CGMs sensors remain in place for up to 3 10 days MARKET SEGMENT Medical devices occupied 27 7 of the share in 2020 Between 2018 and 2020 Senseonic generated a meager 8 3 million in product revenue It cannot manage to break even in terms of gross margin Since its inception in 1996 the company has lost 648 5 million Before its 175 million equity infusion in Q1 2021 the company had just 35 9 million in assets to offset 177 2 million in liabilities Possible downsides Its peers such as Abbott Laboratories NYSE ABT Dexcom and Medtronic NYSE MDT are all better capitalized and farther ahead in their technology By the time Senseonic launches Eversense 365 its competitors will likely have moved on to seventh or eighth generation CGMs It s typically not a good idea to go long on stocks of a healthcare company that can only play catch up Summary As an investor I typically like to follow Socially Responsible Investing Value Investing Looking at the companies free cash flow ebitda ratio shows that they are in a good position to grow along with pending FDA approval for their 180 day CGM device Also considering majority of diabetics have said they would prefer this over the dexcomm CGM device it shows promise Overall I believe SENS can have great enterprise value and wouldn t be surprised to see it trading around 30 dollars EOY Disclaimer Normally I Buy a stock within 10 15 of a 52 week low that s shown itself to offer some price support If in this case it breaks to a new low cut losses Also look into rare birds asset plays to a lesser extent arbitrage opportunities and companies selling at less than two thirds of net value net working capital less liabilities I am also buying an additional 50 000 shares currently holding 10 000

current price and a low float ticker that is primed for run given current marco economic factors in conjunction with some other bullish reasons I ll get into below gt DO NOT EXPECT A 10 BAGGER lt Who ATSG Air Transport Services Group provides air cargo transportation services to a wide variety of industries and customers Not only do they move shit from Pt A to Pt B they also have subsidiaries that customers like Amazon use to help make logistics and transportation challenges more manageable Why do I care The underlying business model is incredibly resilient Transportation and supply chain issues will be an ongoing theme for the months and most likely years to come as COVID exposed just how fragile and anemic our global infrastructure truly was As a result companies will have to continue to look for new ways to get products from one point to another ensuring they don t churn customers due to poor experiences A great example of this is PTON having to start air shipping treadmills and bikes from their manufacturing plants to distribution centers whereas in the past they could put those products on cargo container ships Ports are fucked so PTON decided to spend hundreds of millions of dollars extra to fly those heavy pieces of equipment to end markets Air transport will be taking on an ever increasing share of global supply chains and commerce Fundamentally speaking take a look ATSG performance over the past few quarters and years and you ll see a steady increase and march upwards for revenue margins EPS etc EPS amp x200B https preview redd it

74766e43d3a491b6a91fe60506fe61b980f41e96 While COVID provided some challenges it s also allowed ATSG to become increasingly relevant in the global supply chain and oh yea there is one more thing that is incredibly bullish for ATSG AMAZON Bull Case 1 Acquisition Amazon has been a longtime customer of ATSG and back in March they exercised warrants to acquire roughly 20 of the company https www cnbc com 2021 03 08 amazon takes minority stake in cargo contractor atsg html gt Amazon exercised warrants in ATSG that will allow it to acquire about 13 5 million shares in the cargo airline at an exercise price of 9 73 per share or more than 131 9 million ATSG said in an SEC filing Monday As part of a separate agreement Amazon also purchased approximately 865 000 shares of ATSG with no cash exchanging hands the filing states Amazon has owned warrants in ATSG since 2016 Amazon is also poised to perhaps double that stake in the future https www aviationpros com airlines news 21221040 atsg emerges stronger from covid with amazon investment Also worth noting Amazon does business with almost all of the other subsidiaries and organizations under the ATSG corporate umbrella This includes Cargo Aircraft Management leasing ABX Air air cargo and passenger airlift and Airborne Maintenance amp Engineering maintenance services Hmm that s a lot of connections and money flowing between Amazon and ATSG So Amazon continues to want to own its entire logistics network and supply chain and they re assuming an increasing stake in a company that provides all of those services under one roof If that s not enough consider that Amazon has held the warrants to ATSG since 2016 Why exercise now Bull Case 2 Massively undervalued All of the reasons I ve stated so far but also add on the fact that ATSG as a company is INCREDIBLY undervalued right now Look at peers in the industry and compare their fundamentals and book value to ATSG If you zoom out on the 5 year chart for ATSG and just do a simple overlay of EPS and revenues you ll see ATSG as a stock has gone practically nowhere despite their success in terms of financial performance In fact if you take a look at implied value comparing historic multiples in this space to ATSG it is at roughly a 35 discount to it s FMV amp x200B https preview redd it bd6v84gohj671 png width 695 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

greed hookers and blow If you with me you may just learn something too TL dr at the bottom ofc definitely a shitpost Now if I had to wager and I am in fact a betting man I would assume that WSB s largest demographic at any given time is Recent Highschool Grad Males In reality it s just anyone whole likes BRO time any age gender background and creed That being said we have always encouraged each other to do stupid shit and maybe not too much less than 1 3rd of the time it pays off I started trading in 2017 immediately after I entered college I felt like a big man in every way I d always been familiar with stonks and I thought it looked easy Just don t be stupid right I m a man of science m kay So naturally I was drawn to biotech stocks Oh my fucking god biotech stocks I m not talking about J amp J or big pharma tech that s that weak old man shit I knew big plays were more possible when a company is small and has massive moves to make Nobody expects to see Apple run up 30 points in a day or to see Facebook tank 80 in an afternoon That s not a play people would ever regularly bet on no truly autistic person at least But that s definitely not the case with biotech stocks There s always a couple of guys making moves like that and the entry fee to play is CHEAP There s some sayings and numbers in biotech trading Something like 1 in 3 biotech stocks fail and only 10 of your plays make you money But the ones that do Sheeeeeesh As a man of science I would read up on a company before I finalized a play I wouldn t just look at financials I d look at patents and academic publications and reputations A lot of times I d also gauge market sentiment by looking at online forums didn t know about WSB at the time though I d always look at motherfucking yahoo finance conversations That was my fucking biotech forum of choice That place is a hell hole filled to the brim with idiots bots impersonators and fake accounts We re spoiled here at WSB One day while reading up on some now failed company and their new revolutionary breakthrough drug as it always is somebody listed their positions stock positions that is you pervert I looked into every recommendation as always and stumbled across a little ol stock GERN I m telling you it s name so you can look at the chart and follow along I researched it liked what I saw and discovered a cult inside that little yahoo finance section imagine a soulless and emoji less landscape of boomers and gambling addicts coming together to talk about specifically ONE stock all day every day It was and arguably still is mad They filled my head with delusions of grandeur and untold riches and they delivered Longer story made almost marginally shorter I put in almost all of my portfolio at the time The date March 7th 2018 Starting around March 9th GERN had something like a 100 increase and I had just gotten approved for both margin and options trading on dear old robinhood Bleck btw I was jacked to the tits And I knew everything about that one stock I d fallen in love with a stock an age old tale The feeling of seeing my first ever BIG play pay off was unforgettable I d even perfected the timing and purchased at the bottom I was like that mf in wolf of wallstreet At the time I was also rushing a fraternity They could see my phone as I monitored throughout the day damn bro they would say As a college student nothing compares to when somebody asks how much you made in the market that day and you have the option to quantify it in the number of Playstation 4 s you could buy I was on top of the world I was invincible and it looked like I could keep doing this like as a job Imagine my sheer guh however when the market does its thing when biotech does its thing and the stock suddenly kills itself one day when you least expect it Something like 30 in an hour You try to grapple with denial while simultaneously trying to figure out how to sell all of your positions in the best way possible no exit strategy all the while money is being pissed away as the seconds tick by It s hell Lost all my money Put in more than I could afford to lose Held on to hope that things could turn back around Lost more money As the years go by and you eventually get back in the market after regaining financial independence and eventual financial comfort you repeat the same cycle a few more times just with different stocks Eventually you find WSB and grow into meme stocks shoutout to all my SPCE and coin veterans and mature as a trader Maybe you found WSB first before losing everything in that case RIP But no matter who you are eventually you feel like you re ready to retire from trading maybe a tendie aire but likely 10x poorer than when you started out I wish all of you fame and fortune should your plays work out and infinitely more patience wellbeing and wisdom if they don t WSB stay retarded Mods stay gay You check on your wife s boyfriend And I ll see you all in either a yacht the coast of Bermuda or outside a box near JPow s mansion Either way enjoy the time you spend trading and the hours you spend on this forum We say the house always wins but the real winners are the friends we made along the way Ps to the guys in my Environmental chemistry class this last semester I had to listen to you guys talk about stupid market plays everyday before class because you thought you were stock market gods after GME s first jump and the only time I ever said something was when one of you talked about buying on margin One of you tried to argue with me when I warned you not to do it although you didn t know I d been down that road before too After you guys one day suddenly stopped talking about stocks before class I didn t have the heart to ask if you guys went broke Did you I know you fuckers are in WSB TL dr I am old and have lost a lot of money I used to trade biotech WSB makes me laugh I hope we all get rich Did my classmates go broke See everyone tomorrow GERN 12 17c 2

discovery in decades,This is a DD for a company Reconnaissance Energy Africa RECAF I have been following since mid January I haven t seen it discussed on this sub because it s market cap is only 1 54 Billion USD There is A LOT of DD on this company out there that takes weeks to really go through I m not going to even try to cover it all but basically ReconAfrica is an oil exploration company that recently discovered and has 90 rights to the largest undeveloped onshore basin in the world right now the Kavango Basin with total petroleum generating potential that s north of 120 billion barrels of oil Given it s current market cap I believe ReconAfrica is one of the most undervalued stocks in the market a potential future 100 bagger Some history on the ReconAfrica the company was taken public about two years ago Back then all it really had was an aeromagnetic survey showing what the company interpreted to be extremely deep sedimentary basin in the countries of Namibia and Botswana On the basis of this survey they had the foresight to purchase drilling rights to over 8 million acres of land for very cheap Last year Recon purchased a drilling rig and shipped it to Namibia to get more detailed stratigraphic data The company commended drilling the first well in January February and are currently midway through the second well The preliminary results have been very bullish I am not a geologist but as I understand it an active petroleum system needs to have a source rock a seal and reservoir and traps in order to be viable With the data released in the past two months being even better than expected it looks like all of those components are present and there is potential for huge amounts of extractable oil A full suite of results from the core samples in the first two wells is expected to be released soon In future wells they plan to target an actual oil trap using the seismic data By the end of 2021 they hope to be entering discussion with Joint Venture partners Geologically speaking the Kavango basin is similar to the Permian Basin in Texas which has over 50 billion barrels of oil and is currently producing 5 million barrels of oil per day However the Permian acreage is Texas is divided among dozens of companies The largest of them Diamondback FANG Pioneer PXD Concho CXO and EOG all have market caps in the tens of billions of dollars In contrast ReconAfrica has the rights to the entire basin all to themselves That is what makes it an incredible opportunity in my opinion I think the company currently trading in the 9 10 range could be a 100 200 stock by next year once the exploratory drilling and seismic program is completed and the company enters Joint Venture JV discussions Long term I can see the company being a next oil supermajor Again for one company to own the drilling rights to an entire basin like is extremely unique Another bullish tailwind for Reconnaissance is that Western supermajors have been cutting oil exploration expenditure due to environmental pressure from environmentalists and the EIA However demand isn t going to significantly decline for decades and we could be in for a major oil supply crunch https oilprice com Energy Energy General Saudi Arabia And Russia Warn Of Major Oil Supply Crunch html The company is in the perfect position to capitalize on a good macroeconomic environment for oil and gas The bear case Some of the biggest risks are Extreme opposition from foreign activist groups who want to stop ReconAfrica and Namibia from developing in the Kavango They ve spread rumors and misinformation on social media published hit pieces in newspapers organized marches etc If they are successful at slowing down or stopping ReconAfrica that would obviously be bad for the company But I don t believe their criticism is justified If ReconAfrica is successful you can bet that it will hugely benefit Namibia and Botswana which in turn will be massively beneficial for the people and wildlife There will be more money to raise people out of poverty increase access to healthcare and education support conservation areas etc So far ReconAfrica and the governments have been committed to protecting wildlife the livelihoods of local people following international best standards and promoting economic development ReconAfrica has no proven reserves yet We are waiting on more data from additional stratigraphic wells and seismic activities before the company can formally declare it has oil and gas reserves meaning we still aren t 100 derisked yet However given that we now have two exploration wells with thick marine source rock carbonates and a rift basin full of convention traps the play has been significantly derisked Governmental risk Of course it is ultimately up to the government and people of Namibia and Botswana to decide how they want to develop their natural resources However Mines and Energy Minister Tom Alweendo https www cnn com 2021 05 03 africa namibia oil

that Seem Good and Safe using Social Media You Are Helping Them, The Definition Of Market Manipulation gt Market manipulation is the act of artificially inflating or deflating the price of a security or otherwise influencing the behavior of the market for personal gain Investopedia According to most retail investors this means that market manipulation is when an entity with a huge portfolio that buys or sells a large amount of stock can cause large price movements This is one type of market manipulation but not what I want to talk about today amp x200B How in 1930 Wyckoff Described What s Happening Today Richard D Wyckoff https preview redd it r0dndnl3zk671 jpg width 324 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 66b39741d9950f15d90c73b5b49e384104492e03 Who Is Wyckoff gt Richard Demille Wyckoff 1873 1934 was an early 20th century pioneer in the technical approach to studying the stock market He is considered one of the five titans of technical analysis along with Dow Gann Elliott and Merrill At age 15 he took a job as a stock runner for a New York brokerage Afterwards while still in his 20s he became the head of his own firm He also founded and for nearly two decades wrote and edited The Magazine of Wall Street which at one point had more than 200 000 subscribers Wyckoff was an avid student of the markets as well as an active tape reader and trader He observed the market activities and campaigns of the legendary stock operators of his time including JP Morgan and Jesse Livermore From his observations and interviews with those big time traders Wyckoff codified the best practices of Livermore and others into laws principles and techniques of trading methodology money management and mental discipline Why I m Including it in This Post gt From his position Mr Wyckoff observed numerous retail investors being repeatedly fleeced Consequently he dedicated himself to instructing the public about the real rules of the game as played by the large interests or smart money In the 1930s he founded a school which would later become the Stock Market Institute The school s central offering was a course that integrated the concepts that Wyckoff had learned about how to identify large operators accumulation and distribution of stock with how to take positions in harmony with these big players His time tested insights are as valid today as they were when first articulated Basically in 1930 near his death he started writing books about what he learned during his life to make retail investors understand the market better illustrating all his knowledge in a reddit post is impossible and today I want to focus only on market manipulation Who Is The Composite Man gt all the fluctuations in the market and in all the various stocks should be studied as if they were the result of one man s operations Let us call him the Composite Man who in theory sits behind the scenes and manipulates the stocks to your disadvantage if you do not understand the game as he plays it and to your great profit if you do understand it The Richard D Wyckoff Course in Stock Market Science and Technique section 9 p 1 2 Based on his years of observations of the market activities of large operators Wyckoff taught that 1 The Composite Man carefully plans executes and concludes his campaigns 2 The Composite Man attracts the public to buy a stock in which he has already accumulated a sizeable line of shares by making many transactions involving a large number of shares in effect advertising his stock by creating the appearance of a broad market 3 One must study individual stock charts with the purpose of judging the behavior of the stock and the motives of those large operators who dominate it 4 With study and practice one can acquire the ability to interpret the motives behind the action that a chart portrays Wyckoff and his associates believed that if one could understand the market behavior of the Composite Man one could identify many trading and investment opportunities early enough to profit from them The Importance Of Liquidity Let s say a stock is sitting at 20 but a Pro thinks it could make it to be worth 40 large investors may not accumulate a high number of shares at one time as this would cause a sudden change in the stock price Instead they will take advantage of weak market sessions to slowly accumulate their target number of shares Once they have accumulated their target number of shares and want to sell for the same reason as before they can t unload everything at once or they would affect the market again But how can they unload their shares at maximum profit Through manipulation They can do it by making that shady little company look like it will become the next Apple and they manipulate the newspapers to do it FOMO https preview redd it 4ikowb6j5l671 jpg width 1024 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 949686266619575afa3c565a32df772ddf11aa1b They create FOMO Fear Of Missing Out in small retail investors and that brings a lot of volume on that stock If you thought the goal of the market makers was to inflate the stock price through this type of manipulation you re wrong Consider an institutional investor who bought 5 000 000 shares of a company at 1 that now sits at 3 has a lot more information about that company than you do and knows that company is bad and likely to release bad news in a few weeks Everyone knows that in order to sell something you need a buyer willing to pay the price you re offering so how can he dump 5 000 000 shares of stock unnoticed in a few weeks and get away with it He s going to start making people think that this company has something very big coming up that he s going to make a 500 move and you re going to miss out People start FOMOing and bring huge volume to that stock with more people willing to buy he can sell all his shares faster and get out of that stock as quickly as possible He doesn t care if the stock makes a 100 move in the meantime because of this sudden interest he only cares about getting out And guess what later on when the bad news is released the market maker will be the winner while a lot of retail investors have been burned amp x200B gt You have often noticed that a stock will sell at the highest price for many months on the very day when a stock dividend or some very bullish news appears in print This is not mere accident gt gt The whole move is manufactured Its purpose is to make money for inside interests those who are operating in the stock in a large way And this can only be done by fooling the public or by inducing the public to fool themselves This was written in 1930 90 Years ago Buy the rumour sell the news Market Manipulation 5 0 And How You Are Helping To Make It Happen After what happened with meme stocks in the last month a lot of people started looking to invest without any knowledge and trusting the advice of people on reddit and other social media many found themselves losing a lot of money on some stocks that look very good amp x200B What is happening now is that some big institutions probably pay influencers and use bots to make some companies look much better than they really are The problem is that many people trust other DDs Due Diligence too much and end up thinking that a stock is really good and they buy some stocks What s worse is that a lot of times people who have invested in some companies end up becoming like extremists and start propagandizing when they see that they are losing money amp x200B Basically what is happening is that I and probably you too am noticing a lot of people or groups who buy for example a stock at 10 because it is full of potential pumped by a market maker and when they find themselves owning it with a 30 loss they start trying to convince people that it will soon go up This is ethically wrong and to avoid getting caught in this you should ALWAYS do your research If you don t know how to research ask the person who posted the sources How Can You Stop Losing Money On Bad Stocks Don t trust anyone do your own research Ask for sources from those who publish DDs Stay away from stocks that come from scam countries If you see a lot of people saying a stock is going to go up stay away Don t buy a stock that people say will CERTAINLY have good news coming example stock X will get FDA approval next week usually won t and will fall into oblivion If you re losing on a stock stop saying on social media that it will surely rebound If you buy a stock you MUST stay current on it you can t just buy and forget about it If a stock has a news related to a sector unrelated to it stay away for example a tourism stock says it will do something in the hot sector of the moment this is usually done to temporarily pump up the stock SELL THE NEWS

BEST catalyst Cryptocurrency in supply chain financing Traditionally supply chain financing happens in five steps 1 First the buyer typically a manufacturer or distributor issues a purchase order to a foreign or domestic supplier 2 The supplier then ships the goods to the buyer and issues an invoice to the buyer In a supply chain financing arrangement the buyer then submits approved invoices to a supply chain finance company for processing 3 The supplier requests discounted payment of its approved invoices from the supply chain finance company 4 The supply chain finance company sends the discounted payment to the supplier 5 The buyer pays the supply chain finance company the amount of the approved invoice on the negotiated maturity date However this has some drawbacks Supply chain financing is available to large global manufacturers and distributors and their suppliers Middle market buyers and their suppliers haven t been able to take advantage of the benefits of these programs because they are often too small and not as credit worthy as larger rated companies This method of financing requires the negotiation of a confirmed payment amount between buyer and supplier up front and limits deductions setoffs counterclaims against billed invoices that typically occur in trade transactions However these constraints must be weighed against longer payment terms by the buyer and quicker receipt of payment by the supplier Cryptocurrency and digital asset payment will disrupt all of this Payments will be immediate with smart contracts This will remove all the inefficiencies of the old financing system This lesson became evident during the pandemic when supply chains where strained The problem with Memestocks Memestocks suffer from survivor bias For every one person you see post massive gains there are ten other people that suffered small losses You never hear from the losers because of embarrasment People don t like to show their losses or hide their gains Once a stock has been Meme d hedge funs will start buying the stock to increase the price which attracts more investors to the stock Once the price has been sufficiently inflated they can simply take their time and short it bleeding money away from retail investors Hedge funds always come out the winner This play is the BEST because it is a pure fundamentals play in an disruptive technology industry

Their therapy for SER 109 in persistent bacterial GI infection C Diff is nearing approval after a successful Phase 3 demonstrating that the company can deliver on less complicated applications for the technology and has the process and manufacturing to address more lucrative indications Phase 2 of clinical trials is a pivotal de risking milestone and is typically where most of the value of a clinical stage asset is realized The upcoming readout for SER 287 in ulcerative colitis UC represents a substantial growth opportunity for MCRB more than doubling the potential addressable market size Published disease response rates were evaluated to construct a quantitative risk model in PYMC3 https docs pymc io about html which shows a very high likelihood 88 of positive results under stringent assumptions Prior readout timelines and public statements about results mid year point to announcement in July gapping share price to ATH 38 The hype cycle may have come and gone on the microbiome field 2015 but the addressable markets are just getting ready for the disruption and Seres will lead the pack Significance Innovation If you don t think poop is an opportunity for cutting edge health care technology all it takes is constant bleeding out of your asshole to change that perspective Chron s and Ulcerative colitis are miserable chronic illnesses and apes are already paying out the ass for approved drugs with unreliable effectiveness Modifying the gut microbiome is a highly effective black box approach that has had a lot of development in basic animal and translational research Changing gut microbial composition affects multiple disease pathways in a manner superior to current targeted drugs for complex pathologies In the MCRB trial 3 groups of 67 patients Placebo low dose high dose with mild moderate UC failing standard of care 5 ASA a non steroidal anti inflammatory were treated for 10 weeks and evaluated by endoscopy for response and remission Placebo and drug effect sizes can be reliably modeled using available data so risk of failure is well defined and the company has been consistent on readout timelines of 7 9 weeks after completion The computer says YOLO To model trial success and failure probabilities in PyMC3 I reviewed published recurrence rates in randomized controlled clinical trials of mild moderate UC and estimated population means and 95 confidence intervals For placebo I used recent trials from a meta analysis paper Jairath 2017 https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC6483671 Mean 88 95 CI 91 85 FMT trials are much less consistent in treatment and design further demonstrating need for standardized approved therapy so I used a conservative estimate from several studies notably Costello 2019 https jamanetwork com journals jama fullarticle 2720727 resultClick 1 M 73 CI 70 76 Treated recurrence was taken from prior Phase I SER 287 trial and placebo meta analysis CI M 60 CI 57 63 Henn 2021 https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC7402096 These estimates were used to model distribution of patient level treatment effect for the 67 Placebo and High Dose patients PYMC3 was used to model the recurrence rate as binomial distributions individual treated patient Bernoulli trials were further challenged by mixing at a 0 8 probability with 0 1 placebo response and 0 1 FMT recurrence rates After patient level draws are made for each iteration of the trial simulation I then address the possibility that the treatment effect is statistically valid p lt 0 05 but still marginal enough that analysts shit on it and we don t get our moon mission I do this by imposing an additional hurdle of gt 10 group difference in recurrence to qualify as a pass e g if placebo recurrence is 60 67 90 treated group must be 53 67 or less to qualify After hitting the magic inference button a few times and tuning the sampler hyper parameters a few key posterior predictions probability density functions are mixed patient level recurrence

non public information and decision making behind the scenes Interim partial data analysis is standard practice for clinical trials how a company uses this early evaluation of at the data is highly informative This part is also a bit of Bayesian logic but this time we re doing it in our heads Previously Seres Therapeutics demonstrated that they will use an early stopping option to discontinue trials that are not likely to succeed ECOSPOR II saving them time money and effort They ve also never blown their load by publishing a positive interim readout like some companies choosing not to disclose data from the successful repeat of ECOSPOR II at all We ve long since passed the early stopping point for this trial so we can conclude that the internal information points towards success Management has demonstrated they are science first and don t play games with the stock price by manipulating disclosures I have extreme confidence in the company leadership and development approach they have been diligent and systematic about forward progress so far and I expect that to continue Conclusion The risk model is very conservative a significant proportion of patients could end up non responders and low responders and the trial remains a success with room to spare The risk reward ratio is off the charts and timing remains the largest source of uncertainty My positions 200 July calls are good for realizing day of 50 August is a hedge against time line risk and potentially more upside than July if held till expiration IRAs have shares up to the gills

Wall Street Bets crowd is falling for the oldest military tactic in the book Divide and Conquer The hedgies want us to split up our firepower i e buying capital across all these different stock plays like GME Blackberry Clover Health Bed Bath amp Beyond etc That s why you see all the news stories about these being the next big short squeeze plays The sole purpose of these articles is of course to get us to Divide our buying capital across all these stocks so they can Conquer us You know that MarketWatch Motley Fool Yahoo Finance etc is in the pockets of the hedge funds and not just figuratively but I bet literally as I m sure they are being paid by and in some cases are partly owned by Citadel and other large hedge funds Clover Health was not only an obvious distraction but clearly a pump and dump scheme as shown by the chart And geewhiz it just so happens that Citadel owns a big chunk of CLOV stock Go figure Secondly and this is directly as to why you were right about getting GME holders to move their capital to AMC If they are up on their GME position at the current price of about 214 they can purchase over three and a half shares of AMC for that same amount of money 3 5666 to be exact at 60 for AMC So here s why your strategy is correct 1 You know that AMC has a huge percentage of retail owners at over 80 of the 513 million shares in existence So AMC Apes have more control over the float which gives it a better chance of squeezing much higher than GME Plus GME already had it s mini squeeze at the end of January and it only went to 350 2 The short interest in AMC is likely much greater than GME Ortex data is limited and it shows around 13 of the share total sold short But that s only self reported short position by the hedgies and it s only data from 85 of prime brokers So if you add in the synthetic shares created by derivatives plus the naked shorts that are rolled over every two days with phony locates to stay in compliance the short percentage could theoretically be as much as 50 That s 250 million shares sold short 3 The average shorted position by the hedgies is at 10 and they go back an average of 46 days They are so under water and paying months of loan interest that they are burning up their available capital to the tune of 1 billion per week You know they could run low on money and get margin called especially with the new daily liquidity reporting requirement coming into effect soon So they are doomed either way If they cover they lose Billions and if they get margin called they get wiped out and someone else liquidates the company and covers their short positions 4 Eventually if we keep buying and holding thus pushing the price up the hedgies will stop with the fake shorting to drive the price down and just capitulate swallow their pride and cover This will start the squeeze And as you may have pointed out in your videos it ll be like a snowball rolling down a hill of snow it ll just start getting bigger and bigger Until it s an avalanche and unstoppable The AMC stock price will be going up 100s per day and then eventually possibly 100s per hour 5 Here s where the GME conversion play comes in If all the other meme stock players join forces with us especially GME we can push the price high enough to cause the capitulation and or margin calls on the hedge funds That s the only way Because most AMC Apes are only holding at this point they are not buying more And me personally like a lot of them are running out of new buying firepower We need new money coming in from the outside 6 Now to the math if a GME shareholder can convert each GME share to three and a half AMC shares and for example sake let s say they both were to squeeze to only 5000 which I doubt that GME even has this potential but go with me on this then the exit profit on a single GME share is roughly 4 786 But you only have one share If AMC squeezes to 5000 and I feel very confident that 10K or 20K or more is very achievable if we all Hold Strong but let s be conservative for this argument then your exit profit on one AMC share is 4 940 BUT you have more than 3 5 AMC shares for each GME share you sold 7 So it s a no brainer if you sell out of a GME squeeze your exit cash is 4 786 but if you sell out at the exact same AMC squeeze peak your exit cash is 17 619 at current price of both stocks So not only is AMC much more likely to squeeze and probably squeeze much higher but you ll get three and half times as much cash profit when it does finally squeeze since AMC is only 60 and GME is 214 You ll get 3 5 times the profit So GME holders need to ask themselves would they rather have a profit of 4 786 per share or an equal conversion profit of 17 619 Same squeeze exit but a 17 grand gross profit sounds a lot better to me than only four grand So the math proves your point And of course all this considers both squeezes are equally likely but I think most people agree that AMC has a much higher probably of squeezing in the near future than does GME given the dynamics of ownership i e we Apes hold over 400 million shares out of 513 million and the hedgies need to cover maybe 200 million shares or more therefore we Apes will end up setting the exit price but only if we weed out the weak handed Chimps the dumb Chumps and the day traders who keep selling to the hedgies

Bets crowd is falling for the oldest military tactic in the book Divide and Conquer The hedgies want us to split up our firepower i e buying capital across all these different stock plays like GME Blackberry Clover Health Bed Bath amp Beyond etc That s why you see all the news stories about these being the next big short squeeze plays The sole purpose of these articles is of course to get us to Divide our buying capital across all these stocks so they can Conquer us We know that MarketWatch Motley Fool Yahoo Finance etc is in the pockets of the hedge funds and not just figuratively but I bet literally as I m sure they are being paid by and in some cases are partly owned by Citadel and other large hedge funds Clover Health was not only an obvious distraction but clearly a pump and dump scheme as shown by the chart And geewhiz it just so happens that Citadel owns a big chunk of CLOV stock Go figure If someone is up on their GME position at the current price of about 214 they can purchase over three and a half shares of AMC for that same amount of money 3 5666 to be exact at 60 for AMC So here s why this strategy is correct 1 We know that AMC has a huge percentage of retail owners at over 80 of the 513 million shares in existence So AMC Apes have more control over the float which gives it a better chance of squeezing much higher than GME Plus GME already had it s mini squeeze at the end of January and it only went to 350 2 The short interest in AMC is likely much greater than GME Ortex data is limited and it shows around 13 of the share total sold short But that s only self reported short position by the hedgies and it s only data from 85 of prime brokers So if you add in the synthetic shares created by derivatives plus the naked shorts that are rolled over every two days with phony locates to stay in compliance the short percentage could theoretically be as much as 50 That s 250 million shares sold short 3 The average shorted position by the hedgies is at 10 and they go back an average of 46 days They are so under water and paying months of loan interest that they are burning up their available capital to the tune of 1 billion per week You know they could run low on money and get margin called especially with the new daily liquidity reporting requirement coming into effect soon So they are doomed either way If they cover they lose Billions and if they get margin called they get wiped out and someone else liquidates the company and covers their short positions 4 Eventually if we keep buying and holding thus pushing the price up the hedgies will stop with the fake shorting to drive the price down and just capitulate swallow their pride and cover This will start the squeeze It ll be like a snowball rolling down a hill of snow it ll just start getting bigger and bigger Until it s an avalanche and unstoppable The AMC stock price will be going up 100s per day and then eventually possibly 100s per hour 5 Here s where the GME conversion play comes in If all the other meme stock players join forces with us especially GME we can push the price high enough to cause the capitulation and or margin calls on the hedge funds That s the only way Because most AMC Apes are only holding at this point they are not buying more We need new money coming in from the outside 6 Now to the math if a GME shareholder can convert each GME share to three and a half AMC shares and for example sake let s say they both were to squeeze to only 5000 which I doubt that GME even has this potential but go with me on this then the exit profit on a single GME share is roughly 4 786 But you only have one share If AMC squeezes to 5000 and I feel very confident that 10K or 20K or more is very achievable if we all Hold Strong but let s be conservative for this argument then your exit profit on one AMC share is 4 940 BUT you have more than 3 5 AMC shares for each GME share you sold 7 So it s a no brainer if you sell out of a GME squeeze your exit cash is 4 786 but if you sell out at the exact same AMC squeeze peak your exit cash is 17 619 at current price of both stocks So not only is AMC much more likely to squeeze and probably squeeze much higher but you ll get three and half times as much cash profit when it does finally squeeze since AMC is only 60 and GME is 214 You ll get 3 5 times the profit So GME holders need to ask themselves would they rather have a profit of 4 786 per share or an equal conversion profit of 17 619 Same squeeze exit but a 17 grand gross profit sounds a lot better to me than only four grand So the math proves your point And of course all this considers both squeezes are equally likely but I think most people agree that AMC has a much higher probably of squeezing in the near future than does GME given the dynamics of ownership i e we Apes hold over 400 million shares out of 513 million and the hedgies need to cover maybe 200 million shares or more therefore we Apes will end up setting the exit price but only if we weed out the weak handed Chimps the dumb Chumps and the day traders who keep selling to the hedgies

According to Robinhood they ve beaten EPS projections for three straight quarters recovering from COVID 19 much more strongly than expected Per ORTEX says they ve got an EV EBITDA of 14 31 in line

interest has actually been falling from peak levels pretty consistently since March 2020 despite a short lived surge where they got fucked in September 2020 and a recent uptick in shorting last week Still SI is 30 so let s use the https emojipedia org bear case to consider reasons not all shorts have exited their position Some airlines like Delta are transitioning to free internet to differentiate themselves from low cost airlines But budget airlines have been rapidly expanding worldwide and one way they remain budget is by letting services like Gogo handle the internet so I actually see a huge opportunity for growth in that sense Some of the shorting could be fears that SpaceX s Starlink might hurt their long term growth but that s a pretty fucking big maybe at the moment Daddy Musk is a master of over promising so I think Gogo is safe in the air for a while It could also be the fact that they currently have the investing equivalent of an ambulance chaser

potential meme stocks So how does GOGO do with the SMELL test Short Interest SI of float is currently estimated to be 31 37 by MarketWatch If you re familiar with the SMELL system you ll know that the purpose of SI isn t to create a squeeze but to add a possible extra source of buying pressure Based on ORTEX data 1 4 of that short interest is new as of last week when the price was around 14 50 If

mind having to wait 43 more days until the Corsair earnings release I decided to dig through my stock screener and find the exact opposite type of play Since value investing stocks take a long time to unfold and you guys have the average attention span of a five year old I picked out the most retarded gambling degenerate stock I could find which still ticks all the right boxes TL DR Highly leveraged SPAC powered loved by Cathie Wood and shorted to the core of the earth Some important data upfront 7 5B Market Cap 275 Million float 71 590 000 Shares short 30 short float 50 78 Held by institutions 52 weeks 10 26 46 30 15 83 Held by insiders Current price 19 42 amp x200B What is Skillz Skillz is a San Francisco based online mobile multiplayer video game competition platform that is integrated into a number of iOS and Android games Players use it to compete in competitions against other players across the world and make or lose money To me that actually sounds like that they took the classic casino mechanics and replaced the chance element with skill although you still have the chance to win big if you are skilled enough The company went the special purpose acquisition route in 2020 and quickly got picked up by our favourite gambler and stock picker Cathie Wood from ARK Invest and thrown into her ARKK amp ARKW funds 15 5 million shares in ARKK and 7 5 million shares in ARKW to be exact The innovative part about Skillz is that they are not actually a game developer but rather provide a tech platform that connects mobile gamers and game developers On top of that gamers pay an entry fee and have the chance to win more Think of it like the future of mobile games being powered by the biggest Texas Hold em gambling style tournament Their business model slide shows it in a neat way how SKLZ makes money https preview redd it 2zcuou50im671 png width 1392 amp format png amp auto webp amp s fc5cd09f4c9e9638e16c750aa277793d589a3e7b Why are they good Unlike most shorted companies which are completed cash strapped in debt and struggling to survive another day Skillz has a very strong balance sheet including 613 million in cash You can get most of the important bits out of their Q1 earnings presentation but one nice way to summon up their potential is the following quote Skillz is a technology platform and its profit potential is off the charts It s not developing games it s providing the space that brings gamers and developers together In the third quarter of 2020 the company s gross margin was 94 8 and it was 95 5 through the first three quarters of 2020 These flashy numbers suggest that Skillz can leverage revenue growth into substantial cash flow I would suggest everyone to have a good look at their IR presentation here https investors skillz com events and presentations presentations default aspx to also understand their business better and have that same f ck yes moment that I had before dropping a big wad of cash on them Why are they bad and shorted Well their pricey forward P S implies extreme future growth something they still gotta materialise and they were targeted by a securities class action lawsuit 3 months ago regarding some statements they made in their public offering prospectus I personally think that this lawsuit doesn t have too much merit since it looks like a classic case of a law firm trying to find a case and make a quick buck We know that there are many law firms who are making all sorts of legal accusations against many companies every day That s just how they tick Trying to get some poor schmuck 1 70 back on their SPAC purchase isn t really gonna have a long term impact on anything Price action since inception Skillz went live at 10 26 and managed to shoot up to 43 Since then it took a nose dive with more and more people started shorting it until it hit 12 55 in April 2021 before quickly recovering and creating a double bottom around 19 20 The current short interest hovers around 30 with roughly 71 million shares sold short I think at this price it s a fantastic time to buy in and give the shorts a little pinch I decided to drop in with 5000 in shares today looking overall for an 100 300 return amp x200B https preview redd it 869g9xd4lm671 jpg width 1079 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s e25f7a1c44838b934bb00ec4d2fa31c536367bd8 amp x200B SKLZ action https preview redd it

acquisition of Aarki to form the First Integrated Esports Advertising Platform Aarki is described as a leading technology driven marketing platform that engages in more than 5T monthly advertising auctions Aarki uses data engines and proprietary machine learning algorithms to deliver ROI for performance advertisers Now why is this awesome With Aarki they can aggressively widen their footprint in the mobile gaming industry and turn the monetisation to another level This is however long term stuff that will take time to play out with the acquisition happening towards Q4 Link here https investors skillz com events and presentations events default aspx How could this be a YOLO Looking at the previous price actions of meme stocks a couple things were always present amp x200B 1 People did their own DD really liked the stock and outright bought shares 2 The companies were highly shorted dynamite barrels just waiting for a match to fall 3 And of course many degenerates bought way OTM lotto calls forcing market makers to buy up shares to hedge their own positions and creating massive gamma squeezes amp x200B Since Skillz heavily fluctuates in price shares are probably preferred As mentioned above I went in with 5000 just on shares and will load on more if we see good movement through the 20 30 price ITM calls are priced OK here but there are plenty of cheaper Moonshots available at 30 35 and 40 The good thing is that the stocktwits retards have a hard one for this one too can t blame them with that kind of price action so any movement made here is amplified I hope this was interesting to some of you who prefer straight up YOLOs Now please do your own DD This is risky shit And as always this is not financial advice I like Skillz

internet for business aircraft at a cost to the user They re present on airlines world wide so you already know they ve got opportunity in the expanding third world airline markets Gogo used to service commercial aircraft as well but they sold that portion of their business last year for 400m cash to survive the pandemic It s not that big of a big blow since they service 2 64x more business

doesn t worry me Business aircraft is their strength and I like to see a big dick CEO who is willing to take dramatic moves to stay agile and pivot towards a company s strength during emergencies In terms of numbers Gogo is projected to do 318 5m in revenue this year and 352m in revenue next year According to Robinhood they ve beaten EPS projections for three straight quarters recovering from COVID 19 much more strongly than expected Per ORTEX says they ve got an EV EBITDA of 14 31 in line with the industry mean and a positive EPS change of 16 21 Plus an analyst price target of 13 25 so it

short lived surge where they got fucked in September 2020 and a recent uptick in shorting last week Still SI is 30 so let s use the https emojipedia org bear case to consider reasons not all shorts have exited their position Some airlines like Delta are transitioning to free internet to differentiate themselves from low cost airlines But budget airlines have been rapidly expanding worldwide and one way they remain budget is by letting services like Gogo handle the internet so I actually see a huge opportunity for growth in that sense Some of the shorting could be fears that SpaceX s Starlink might hurt their long term growth but that s a pretty fucking big maybe at the moment Daddy Musk is a master of over promising so I think Gogo is safe in the air for a while It could also be the fact that they currently have the investing equivalent of an ambulance chaser lawsuit filed against them but they already defeated an almost identical lawsuit in 2019 so I m not worried amp x200B https

that the SMELL test is the best new method for determining undervalued potential meme stocks So how does GOGO do with the SMELL test Short Interest SI of float is currently estimated to be 31 37 by MarketWatch If you re familiar with the SMELL system you ll know that the purpose of SI isn t to create a squeeze but to add a possible extra source of buying pressure Based on ORTEX data 1 4 of that short interest is new as of last week when the price was around 14 50 If the price rises again shorts have already shown that they re willing to end their position In fact most 2020 shorts had already been unwinding their positions since at least January until they came back last week Market Cap Market Cap is 1 3bn per Yahoo so it s legit Extremely Memeable The name is literally GOGO the thing it s going to do over the next 6 months Of course it s fucking memeable Low Liquidity Average volume is just 2m shares according to Yahoo or 1 8 of market cap Institutional ownership is 46 11 According to Yahoo investors like Vanguard JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have all recently added 20 compared to their previous investment Per ORTEX insiders have added 10m more shares total over the past twelve months Low Risk IV is 66 so not great but not terrible It was difficult finding any SMELL test candidate with IV under 60 However volatility is within the 4 percentile rank meaning that IV was only lower 4 of the time in the last year So this is as safe a time as ever to get in https preview redd it o6xn9drxlo571 png width 1263 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

a small following of short interest hunters and got caught up in the January madness although I don t remember reading about it After Jan 28 it fell down to 10 in April Since April however it was

100k total I ve invested in EDIT since 2018 EDIT has many patents for CRISPR based gene edit technology and is working on a cure for a form of blindness EDIT 101 and a cure for sickle cell EDIT 301 Not familiar with CRISPR It s a precise and cheap gene editing platform that is leading to a new whole class of therapeutics BEAM CRSP NTLA are peers EDIT has had missteps and recently got a new CEO who has purchased 1m in shares this year Rising to nearly 100 earlier this year EDIT is puttering around in the mid 30s but a high short interest in shares 18 4 and near term catalysts expected with a progress report due for EDIT 101 by the end of the year EDIT has partnerships to cure Parkinson s with BlueRock Therapeutics with additional partnerships with Juno and Allergan CRSP gt EDIT No doubt about that The only reason Editas went up to 100 this year cause Cathie Wood said gene editing is the future of genomics If you go to their website and look at their pipeline almost none of the products they are working on are in phase 1 which doesn t mean they are a bad company It just means they are some ways off before causing a ruckus in their industry where companies like Intellia and Crispr are further along in the process https cc quixada ufc br documentos ufu video Austria Ukraine gegen html https cc quixada ufc br documentos ufu video Austria Ukraine im mama00 html https cc

outstanding and as of 2021 they currently only have 39 million shares outstanding I found this to be of particular interest when considering shareholder value typically as time goes on the shares outstanding of a company tend to increase but in the case of Big Lots the company has a consistent record of buying back their own shares This reflects in their earnings per share as it was 0 21 in 2005 and now is a whopping 16 11 amp x200B TLDR Big Lots BIG is an underappreciated undervalued company that has a market capitalization of 2 5 billion while its competitors are valued at hundreds of

Even Amazon s internal healthcare locations have the look Just check out the inside of your local Rite Aid https upload wikimedia org wikipedia commons thumb 0 07 Aisles and goods in the Rose Hill Rite Aid jpg 800px Aisles and goods in the Rose Hill Rite Aid jpg and tell me its the same amp nbsp The more intriguing options are 1 having no physically stores or 2 use Whole Foods locations Way back when Amazon first acquired Whole Foods CVS Walgreens even drug wholesalers took major hits Amazon already has 2 3 of what Rite Aid would offer locations to act as distribution if they were to go that route But they will most likely continue offering pharmacy drugs through their existing channels PillPack LLC and Amazon Pharmacy amp nbsp Amazon acquired PillPack for 753 million 2 years ago and has been working within Amazon Pharmacy on the home delivery for medication Very little is said about this part in their investor reports I was only able to find a few bullet points in the last couple years but this looks extremely clear what Amazon is trying to do They have Whole Foods for the brand and ability to deliver high end organic groceries and Amazon Fresh for the normal things you d find at a Walmart Its always been about home delivery and only about how brick and mortar assists with that A physical store acquisition quickly establishes a physical presence but I don t see the need for one to move drugs Or how that bolsters they re ability to deliver to homes They have the facilities and logistics worked out for hundreds of grocery delivery warehouses and seems much more simple to tac on drugs there amp nbsp Between the Q4 https ir aboutamazon com news release news release details 2021 Amazon com Announces Fourth Quarter Results default aspx and Q1 https ir aboutamazon com news release news release details 2021 Amazon com Announces First Quarter Results default aspx reports they added another 10 000 to total 60 000 local pharmacies that offer discounts to prime users when paying without insurance Why aggressively explore this if you were thinking of opening thousands of your own stores Seems curious to me amp nbsp People here seem to be quick to write off PillPack as a failure with no justification Summarizing a CNBC article https www cnbc com 2019 05 10 why amazon bought pillpack for 753 million and what happens next html written around the acquisition More than 60 of American s have chronic illness and 40 have two The average PillPack user in 2018 generated 5 000 in revenue The business was on track to generate 299 million in annual revenue in 2018 with plans to more than double in 2019 to 635 million before reaching 1 2 billion in 2020 And medicine spending is expected to increase 3 6 through 2025 The long term outlook on PillPack is bright and Rite Aid just isn t the right choice for Amazon I ll be honestly surprised if they ever actually announce they re buying them considering how long theres been rumors amp nbsp Also I don t think they would be eager to shell out more money after the MGM 8 5 billion buyout in May They usual go about a year between gt 1B purchases Telehealth trends due to COVID My thinking here is to look at the usage of online services in medicine due to COVID It s my assumption that effects from COVID in many aspects are here to stay Remote work is a good example and I see no reason why routine medical care and even more routinized pharmacies couldn t be done online I found this gem from the CDC looking at Jan Mar 2020 trends in telehealth https www cdc gov mmwr volumes 69 wr mm6943a3 htm Here s a chart comparing 2019 to 2020 https www cdc gov mmwr volumes 69 wr figures mm6943a3 F1 gif and this quote summarizes the major part gt During the early pandemic period in 2020 the percentage of telehealth visits for persons aged 18 49 years increased slightly from 68 during the first week of January 2020 to 73 during the last week of March A 5 increase in telehealth visits that happened almost entirely in March a time when COVID wasn t seen as a problem in the US so we can assume it is substantially higher now Cathie s TDOC pick isn t wrong I can do a dive into them later if requested But I think this points to online medicine continuing to become mainstream and the perfect environment for Amazon to fit in by delivering prescribed medication People are becoming more time greedy no commuting with remote work food delivery pick up and don t want to waste the time of going into a store and wait in line LinkedIn I sorted by people working for PillPack LLC or Amazon Pharmacy and got back 904 people currently working there I ll say 950 for margin Amazon s corporate job portal shows 99 full time openings https jobs us west amazon com en teams pillpack Thats a 10 5 increase of their workforce They are looking to expand PillPack Amazon Pharmacy TA Little TA an AMZN bc why not Bounced off 2 st dev line yesterday I d wait if we dip more back to 3400 ish where theres some support Could just as

integrated into a number of iOS and Android games Players use it to compete in competitions against other players across the world What they are actually trying to say is that they are using casino style mechanics in their games by replacing the chance element with skill This means that every time you want to compete in a game you pay 60 cents up front The company went the special purpose acquisition route in 2020 and quickly got picked up by our favourite gambler and stock picker Cathie Wood from ARK Invest and thrown into her ARKK amp ARKW funds 15 5 million shares in ARKK and 7 5 million shares in ARKW to be exact amp x200B https preview redd it 4n18gccyoo671 png width 1006 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3a3f7b07e5fcae30191b7c6efe7cba670224f7f0 https preview redd it

provide a tech platform that connects mobile gamers and game developers As mentioned gamers pay an entry fee and have the chance to win more Think of it like the future of mobile games being powered by highly addictive gambling technology Their business model slide shows it in a neat way https preview redd it pgohk981po671 png width 1392 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 7b2d296bcf3a49590c6d45b60f82cf0658c7658a Why are they being shorted and what s the bear case The bear case is actually much easier on this one They are making a couple hundred million in revenue but nowhere near enough to justify such a high market cap At the moment their pricey forward P S implies extreme future growth On top of that they were targeted by a securities class action lawsuit 3 months ago regarding some statements they made in their public offering prospectus I personally think that this lawsuit doesn t have too much merit since it looks like a classic case of a law firm trying to find a case and make a quick buck Trying to get some poor schmuck 1 70 back on their SPAC purchase isn t really going to have a long term impact on anything Why could they have a massive upswing Unlike most shorted companies which are completed cash strapped in debt and struggling to survive another day Skillz has a very strong balance sheet including 613 million in cash You can get most of the important bits out of their Q1 earnings presentation but one nice way to summon up their potential is the following quote Skillz is a technology platform and its profit potential is off the charts It s not developing games it s providing the space that brings gamers and developers together In the third quarter of 2020 the company s gross margin was 94 8 and it was 95 5 through the first three quarters of 2020 These flashy numbers suggest that Skillz can leverage revenue growth into substantial cash flow Their growth numbers and margin is very good and the business model is a sneaky way to circumvent gambling laws The technology is solid and good enough to make it into the ARK funds I would suggest everyone to have a good look at their IR presentation here https investors skillz com events and presentations presentations default aspx to also understand their business better and have that same f ck yes moment that I had before dropping a big wad of cash on them By June25th they will be added to the Russell 3000 meaning every ETF with exposure to Russell 3000 will load up on shares starting July Apart from Russell 3000 and Cathie the stock already has a very large following on Stocktwits with people trading it up and down What s the price action Skillz went live at 10 26 and managed to shoot up to 43 Since then they took a nose dive with more and more people started shorting it until it hit 12 55 in April 2021 before quickly recovering and creating a double bottom around 19 20 The current short interest hovers around 30 with roughly 71 million shares sold short I think at this price it s a fantastic time to buy in and give the shorts a little pinch amp x200B https preview redd it an4t6xt7po671 png width 1333 amp format png amp auto webp amp

Platform Aarki is described as a leading technology driven marketing platform that engages in more than 5T monthly advertising auctions Aarki uses data engines and proprietary machine learning algorithms to deliver ROI for performance advertisers Now why is this awesome With Aarki they can aggressively widen their footprint in the mobile gaming industry and turn the monetization to another level This is however long term stuff that will take time to play out with the acquisition happening towards Q4 Link here https investors skillz com events and presentations events default aspx How could this be a YOLO The bear case is way overdone and 71 million shorts is quite a lot given the company has cash on hand and good margins The price heavily fluctuates giving excellent entry and exit points aggressive pops when shorts have to cover The addition to the Russell 3000 could drive the price way up and if retail sentiment stays high The only downside is though that the IV is quite high The stock could be at 30 in a month 40 or back down at 10 Options are expensive unless they are OTM I decided to drop in with 5000 in shares today looking overall for an 100 300 return link in

process and watching a lot of videos on youtube Below is my vision based on company presentations previous earning calls 10Ks 10Qs and so on amp nbsp Recent History of CLF Up until 2018 CLF was an iron ore miner and producer in the form of pellets that it then sold to integrated steelmakers such as ArcelorMittalUSA and AK Steel In fact AMU and AKS alongside Algoma Canadian Steelmaker made up 95 of the total revenue of CLF Iron Ore is just the raw material used in the steel making process mainly in Blast Furnaces and BOS Basic Oxygenation Steelmaking The alternative to the high capital intensive BF BOS is the Electric Arc Furnace process EAF This uses mainly scrap metal and other iron feed such as HBI Pig Iron DRI These furnaces require less capital upfront to run and have more variable costs attached to them more to this later variable low cost In 2019 CLF acquired AK Steel and in 2020 they acquired ArcelorMittal thus fully converting themselves into a vertically integrated steel producer These acquisitions position CLF as the largest flat steel producer in the US ahead of Nucor and US Steel Annual production is roughly 17 million tons amp nbsp CLF in 2021 With these recent acquisitions CLF positions itself as a key and major player in the US Steel Industry The steel product mix breakdown is 28 hot rolled steel HRC 18 cold rolled 33 coated and 21 in others The customer base is 33 auto manufacturers 25 infrastructure and manufacturing 32 distributors amp converters and 11 others CLF iron ore pellets will be mainly used for intracompany operations so the steel making operations will not be impacted by the volatility of these prices CLF is on a great foot to achieve a record year in 2021 with a 5b projected EBITDA almost twice as the last 5 years combined amp nbsp Strategic Vision and Advantages I The auto industry is a key player and customer for CLF During late 2020 and 2021 automakers haven t been able to keep up with demand in new cars and their inventories have fallen to 20 days roughly half of what it was a year ago So there s a lot of backlog demand in automakers and thus a firm demand for CLF steel products The steel used in automaking is mainly AHSS advanced high strength steel which CLF produces and is a high value added item along with coated still galvanized galvalume etc II During 2021 we have seen an unprecedented rise in steel prices HRC prices are above 1 600 and started the year at around 1 000 Although CLF has fixed price contracts with some customers some naturally are expiring during the year and renovated at higher prices 2021 Q1 EBITDA was 0 5 and projected Q2 is 1 4b Full year projections are 5b which are totally feasible given the rise in steel prices and backlog for auto production Cashflow after CAPEX generated in Q1 was 0 3b excluding increases in working capital If cash flow generated during the rest of the year follows the EBITDA trend we can estimate it s going to be in the 2 5 3 0b range As the CEO has commented before this cash would be used primarily to pay the debt accumulated by the company 5 7b in Q1 that has an average weighted cost of 5 44 per year 0 3b in annual interest III During the last 20 years US Steel production has migrated from BOS to EAF production EAF mainly uses scrap metal as feed and depends on its quality and prices for steel production Its advantages are that the initial capital costs are a fraction less than 1 3 of what a BOS facility costs As quality scrap becomes scarcer EAF will need to supplement their feed with other iron products such as HBI In 2021 an HBI plant started production in the Great Lakes area producing around 2 million tons per year in order to feed CLF s own EAFs and also third parties As we stated previously EAFs enjoy low capital costs and are driven mainly by their variable costs of energy scrap metal But scrap metal prices and volatile CLF mainly has BOS operations that benefit from their integrated pellet iron ore production but also are investing in strategic HBI production so they can sell to this market as well IV US made steel has the lowest carbon footprint of any steel making country in the world It produces almost half the emissions in countries such as Germany and Japan China is the biggest pollutant country in this respect As such US steel is very well positioned to embrace the climate change challenges and promote itself as green steel Also CLF is trying to migrate to more natural gas use instead of coke coal based fuel for its blast furnace operations amp nbsp Risks The main risks are the pricing of steel products as revenue is sensitive to them and also demand mainly by the auto industry I believe the demand risk is low because auto making in the US has been diminishing for some years but it s not going to zero Also we re seeing an increase in EV automakers manufacturing in the US so that could be a plus Climate and environmental regulations are also a risk but I believe that US steel and CLF are very well positioned to take them on Competition from other countries is a risk Raises in interest rates are also a risk because this is a capital intensive business According to the FED there ll be some hikes in 2023 2024 but they appear to be moderate and if CFL takes steps to pay part of their debt this risk will be minor amp nbsp Valuation I m not a big fan of DCF valuations so I just do them to get a ballpark price or the assumptions that need to be met to achieve a certain share price Assuming this year will be an extraordinary one with 2b in FCF I ll assume a range of between 0 5b and 1b as FCF for years to come post interest expenses This assumes a yearly CAPEX of 0 5b as well The EBITDA pre acquisitions were around 350 million on average so 0 5b seems like a really low bound According to several sites the WACC seems to be in the 9 to 12 range so I m going to use the upper bound for a margin of safety Using a 2 perpetual growth rate akin to GNP growth I get a value between 23 and 45 amp nbsp Current positions 200 Shares 4 15 10 30 calls

wanted to make a follow up post to analyze how ASO has held up against my predictions analyses as well as take a look at what kind of play it is exactly View my previous thoughts here https www reddit com r ASO comments o2zm04 some aso technical analyses for your daddies and here https www reddit com r ASO comments o3ky8b price targets If you can t read TLDR ASO shows the signs of a long term stock that could be both a value and growth play Notable short term movement is plausible So far ASO is following all of my predictions from last week and may reach my 45 EOW price target Before diving deep into some charts let s just get some figures to explain how it is both a value and growth play https preview redd it m77691pu5p671 png width 2343 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5f8ccc1b48646cebd5d767c6e3eeb3669013c3b8 This Yahoo Finance article is comparing ASO to PLBY Ignore the PLBY I m just interested in the numbers it provides for ASO First I m looking at a P E of 8 11 and a P E G of 1 94 These are excellent numbers for any stock They indicate significant growth in the company and essentially tell us that Academy s business model is able to take your 8 11 and turn it into 9 11 at the moment This is a very straightforward measure of profitability and potential ROI Additionally the EPS at last report was 5 45 also excellent for any company especially a regional retailer in a pandemic With these kinds of earnings it s hard to imagine ASO not experiencing growth The other interesting number here is the P B of 2 74 While this could be better it is still lower than many competitors such as the PLBY they chose to list here ASO s market cap is also 200M below its enterprise value which indicates it may be slightly undervalued as well As a result I m sure some people would consider this a potential value play Personally I look at it a bit more as a growth play however as those numbers are more striking Ok now to some charts A few days ago in my previous analysis post I indicated that ASO should expect to hit its floor and begin tracking upward again within a few days in accordance with its historical SMA movement It did exactly that beginning to track upward last Friday and going even further today 3 month chart with SMAs overlayed here https preview redd it ubjmrj2n7p671 png width 2371 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 9048c8e471eed4ae2660b20242c45c3e849d3d42 As a result of having my predictions here confirmed as well as seeing 4 gain today alone I remain confident in my EOW price target of 45 The last several times that this pattern occured we saw about 15 30 gains within just a few days 15 up from its current price at about 40 would be 46 and that s on the low end I also remain confident that next week we will hit my 47 50 price target as it has demonstrated an ability to continue moving a little bit in the week following the initial movement These patterns have repeated themselves before and are beginning to again I see no reason to expect them to suddenly stop now Now let s take a look at how the volume has been doing https preview redd it v4xt87oj8p671 png width 2289 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0da0741659319f7996083f6fcc64f35d1cfd7087 First I find it interesting that the money flow index stayed in the center all day but the price continued to go up This indicates to me that the market has essentially decided it was undervalued at 38 and corrected itself up to around 40 These large green bookends on the volume are also interesting We can see how the first one kickstarted a nice upswing but the last one appears under a very flat candlestick As a result I remain bullish about tomorrow s trading and expect to see a nice move upward quickly This chart only helps to confirm my expectations of growth and price target of 45 for this week Now let s see how options are doing https preview redd it nmjzcia59p671 png width 2752 amp format png amp auto webp amp s cc7779bd512a98398493b37e3ef24bbd9f1c2e08 Last Friday many 40c options expired worthless However there are even more already open for July 16 While we may have missed the opportunity to see any gamma moves last week I would say that July 16 has a strong possibility of being ITM at 40 which would currently require almost one entire day s trading volume to fill This would definitely have profound effects on ASO gamma movement With the additional 20k contracts open between 40 50 that could also potentially end up ITM we could really start to see something interesting happen mid July All I have to say about short interest is this there are still not updated numbers easily available since 5 28 However based on the numbers available at that time these are the key numbers to takeaway from short interest 12M shares short 54 64M public float 21 96 of float shorted 12M shares short 2 6M average volume 4 65 Days to Cover under normal volume I anxiously await an update on the Nasdaq short interest board I will not say anything else on the subject until I see them at this point I remain confident in my price targets and my analysis of the trends is beginning to come to fruition I like
