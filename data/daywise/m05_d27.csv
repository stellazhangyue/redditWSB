that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money It s all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1 2 years Maybe even shorter perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly Maybe not the most likely but still a possible scenario that I have to consider amp x200B Thesis 1 The Covid 19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector So naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America these companies stand to benefit If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021 Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33 from January 27th 2020 Cinemark is down approximately 35 over the same time period while National CineMedia is down almost 42 and AMC is up almost 57 Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 2 Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid 19 pandemic which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re opens If we look to Asia especially China and Japan where Covid 19 cases subsided and theatres reopened things look promising There was a substantial increase in demand with demand actually higher than pre pandemic levels In China December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX s big screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier while in Japan they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021 Clearly there was a lot of pent up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia 3 And you know what I ve seen this film before Last year early in February there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China and the stock at that was point already doing well up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world and the rest is history It was an absolutely humungous winner last year There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing and more and more people preferring to watch films at home The increase in Netflix amp streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going forward but I do like movie theatres as a trade There is a lot of pent up demand that I feel will benefit the sector Risks One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services Really the risk of the Direct to consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it like Martin Scorsese Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world at least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years And now they plan to release 50 60 films per year and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach the film industry has changed Cinemas are no longer at the forefront and the Direct to Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent The DTC approach is taking over with all the streaming services that have launched They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema Catalysts amp Conclusion 1 However I still think there is still a place for theatres even with streaming especially looking at the same timeframe that I m focusing on for this trade I think now more so than ever people want to be outside These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends with everyone wanting to leave the house I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades People still want to go to the cinemas especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home Especially when it comes to immersive experience films like those with IMAX and 4DX I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room But that s neither there nor here 2 Moving on another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years Films like The Irishman Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix s online catalogue This is a really interesting move on their part especially from an investment perspective Because while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement This wouldn t just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially The big hold up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window But last year Universal Studios and Cinemark AMC amp Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window from 74 days to 31 days for major films as defined by box office domestic revenue This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies It s not all that important a catalyst for the trade nor is it all that likely but it is still intriguing and something to consider 3 A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film no time to die next year I m really excited about the movie because I m a huge James Bond fan It s probably my favourite movie series And you know what I m not alone It s very popular all over the world The previous James Bond film Spectre grossed nearly 879 million No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States I m really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it s safe to do so And I think it will be This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector 4 Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don t need to quarantine when they return provided they test negative within three to five days of their return They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US This is really exciting and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies amp x200B Thanks for reading Hope it helps

Werkstudenten Robin Balke verfasste und mittlerweile berarbeitete Artikel zum Thema GameStop war nicht nur wie auch andere Leser festgestellt haben schlecht recherchiert vielmehr werden offensichtlich falsche Informationen entweder ganz bewusst oder zumindest fahrl ssig verbreitet Dass das Interesse der Reddit Community die im Februar noch etwas mehr als 4 Millionen und nun inklusive Subreddits weit mehr als 11 Millionen Nutzer hat nicht zur ckgegangen ist sondern ganz im Gegenteil stark zugenommen hat h tte selbst ihr Werkstudent herausfinden k nnen und m ssen Einige weitere Unwahrheiten schrecken wom glich ebenso schlecht informierte Leser wie der Autor es ist ab Bei einer Aktie die im letzten Jahr mehr als 5000 Prozent zugelegt hat und trotzdem noch absolut unterbewertet ist sollte man als Fachmagazin wenn berhaupt eher zum Kauf raten und potentielle K ufer nicht in die Irre f hren und f lschlicherweise abschrecken Nun wurde ein weiterer Artikel auf Ihrer Webseite ver ffentlicht mit dem Titel Zockerei bei GME und AMC geht weiter Die Einzigen die in Bezug auf die GME Aktie zocken sind die Hedgefonds die im Februar u a live im amerikanischen Fernsehen behaupteten sie h tten ihre Short Positionen aufgel st Dass dies eine L ge war wurde bereits vor Wochen aufgedeckt nachdem sie ihre Positionen den amerikanischen B rsenaufsichtsbeh rden offenlegen mussten Auch in Bezug auf AMC haben sich die Hedgefonds die auf eine Pleite der Kinokette w hrend der Corona Krise gewettet haben um in diesem Fall die geliehenen Aktien nicht zur ckgeben zu m ssen ganz eindeutig verzockt Mit synthetischen Aktien wird seit Wochen der Kurs manipuliert weshalb nun eine Z hlung der Aktien ansteht Auch hier ist die Reddit Community offensichtlich deutlich besser informiert als Ihre Autoren Mir bleibt nichts anderes brig als Ihnen die bewusste Verbreitung von Falschmeldungen oder zumindest das Zur ckhalten valider Informationen zu unterstellen Warum berichten Sie zum Beispiel nicht ber die k rzlich eingef hrte und von der amerikanischen Bev lkerung u erst positiv angenommene Same Day Delivery oder das Preis Matching mit Amazon mit der GameStop nun eine starke Konkurrenz f r Amazon darstellt Die Transformation zu einem E Commerce Unternehmen hat l ngst stattgefunden was eine neue Bewertung der Aktie weit ber 350 Dollar erfordert Dar ber hinaus gibt es aktuelle Meldungen dass GameStop eine eigene Blockchain plant Diese erm glicht es unter anderem das bisherige Unternehmenskonzept gebrauchte Software zu verkaufen auch komplett online durchzuf hren Mithilfe von NFTs k nnten Nutzer so zum Beispiel ihre gebrauchten Computerspiele oder andere Software weiterverkaufen wenn sie sie nicht mehr benutzen m chten Dieses Konzept ist bisher weltweit einzigartig und k nnte die gesamte Computerspiele Industrie revolutionieren Somit w re nicht nur eine weitere Anpassung das Aktienkurses nach oben realistisch und notwendig GameStop k nnte sich zum Marktf hrer im Online Spiele Handel entwickeln und somit nicht nur Steam sondern auch Amazon den Rang ablaufen Bisher ist es nicht m glich gebrauchte Software weiterzuverkaufen NFTs erm glichen dies jedoch mit Hilfe der Blockchain Technologie Es mag sein dass sich in Ihrer Redaktion niemand mit diesen Themen auskennt dann sollten Sie jedoch auf die Berichterstattung verzichten Weitere Informationen zu diesem Thema finden Sie hier https nft gamestop com ber den extrem gestiegenen Umsatz von GameStop habe ich auf Ihrer Plattform ebenso nichts gelesen wie ber die ungew hnlich hohen Volumina der AMC Aktie oder das Deaktivieren der Kaufoptionen verschiedener Anbieter wie z B eToro die auch heute wieder z B f r die Norwegian Airline Service den Handel ausgesetzt hat w hrend die Hedgefonds 8 Millionen Aktien hier sind etwas mehr als eine Million blich gekauft haben um nach den neusten Meldungen ber die Rettung des Unternehmens g nstig einkaufen zu k nnen Solche Meldungen interessieren die Community sicher viel mehr wie man u a auf dem bei Ihrem Werkstudenten verhassten Forum Reddit anhand der unz hligen Upvotes erkennen kann Ich w rde mir w nschen dass Sie in Zukunft Ihre Artikel besser oder zumindest berhaupt recherchieren oder f r den Fall dass diesbez glich kein Interesse seitens Ihrer Autoren besteht sich an Autoren zu wenden die sich mit den besagten Themen auskennen Die bisher ver ffentlichten Artikel werfen ein sehr ung nstiges Licht auf Ihr Unternehmen und werden daf r sorgen dass das Interesse an Ihrer Plattform ganz im Gegensatz zu den genannten Aktien tats chlich zur ckgehen wird Mit keinem Wort werden z B die Darkpools die damit verbundenen und seit Jahren verbotenen Naked Shorts die 400 Milliarden zinsfreien Darlehen der FED letzte Woche und viele weitere wichtige und ffentlich einsehbare Informationen erw hnt Hierf r empfehle ich als Quellen unter anderem die FED https www newyorkfed org oder https tiblio com Auch wenn es nicht meine Aufgabe ist sehe ich mich im Sinne aller Ihrer verbliebenen Leser gezwungen Ihren schlecht informierten Mitarbeitern eine kleine Hilfestellung zu geben damit solche Fauxpas in Zukunft vermieden werden k nnen Gerne kann ich Ihnen unz hlige weitere belegte Informationen zukommen lassen allerdings habe ich ganz sicher andere Gehaltsvorstellungen als Ihr Werkstudent Daf r k nnten Sie im Gegenzug vern nftig recherchierte Artikel mit seri sen Quellenangaben ver ffentlichen die die b rseninteressierten Leser ehrlich informieren und nicht mit Hilfe von rei erischen Schlagzeilen und Falschmeldungen abschrecken Um ein weiteres Beispiel hierf r zu nennen m chte ich abschlie end bemerken dass der Cryptohandel in China bereits seit Jahren f r chinesische Banken und Konzerne verboten ist und nicht erst seit letzter Woche wie sie ebenfalls schrieben Dies findet man innerhalb weniger Sekunden mit Hilfe von Google raus Daher hat das Verk nden der Aufrechterhaltung des Verbots logischerweise nicht zu einem Kurssturz des Cryptomarktes gef hrt Auch hierf r findet man selbstverst ndlich seri se Quellen und wenn man sich die entsprechende Zeit f r Recherche auf den offiziellen Seiten der Zentralbanken Hedgefonds und B rsenaufsichtsbeh rden nimmt findet man sogar die wahren Hintergr nde und viele weitere interessante Informationen die Ihre Zielgruppe interessieren und vor wirtschaftlichen Sch den bereits im Vorfeld sch tzen k nnten Ich bedanke mich f r Ihr Interesse und hoffe auf ehrliche und gut recherchierte Berichterstattung in der Zukunft Mit freundlichem Gru

infrastructure company that designs develops amp manufactures hardware amp software solutions for electric vehicles at large It offers a portfolio of hardware software amp services for corporate public amp residential customers Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries History In June 2017 CHPT took over 9 800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE Prior to that point CHPT managed 34 900 charging stations across Mexico Australia Canada and the United States The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano On November 28 2018 CHPT raised 240 million At the time CHPT maintained 57 000 charging spots In 2019 VW s Electrify America https en wikipedia org wiki Electrify America and CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers Company reached 100 000 chargers in September 2019 while adding more than 2 000 charging locations per month Currently CHPT offers 132k charging station network Which accounts for 72 market share of total level 2 charging in North America New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021 What is the business model of CHPT Charge Point sells hardware amp software equipment amp network subscriptions to property owners The company doesn t own the majority of stations It doesn t monetize energy It only monetizes the driver thus capital light business model BUSINESS OVERVIEW Market Cap 7bn Shares Float 299mln Institutional ownership 13 2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65 65 5 Year 60 TAM 190bn Newly formed entity has no Debt Cash amp Cash Equivalents 650m Exponential

US Data from AFDC https afdc energy gov fuels electricity locations html analyze fuel ELEC shows that CHPT wields the largest market share at 42 8K L2 chargers out of 92 8K total of which 11 5K are non networked carving 53 market share of networked chargers No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16 8K No3 largest is SemaCharge Network at 5 2K followed by Blink with 3 1k which is 4th In terms of L3 Superchargers where Tesla leads the way with 10 7k of 19 6k units CHPT is competitive with 1 5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2 5k Superchargers account for 22 of the market pie L2 75 and L1 3 of market share People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 amp L2 Well that s wrong L3 is obviously the option for the highways commercial and service transportation Even larger segment though is found at parking lots restaurants cinemas sports arenas malls corporate offices and other mass conglomerations This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install but with longer charging times perfect fit Products Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers Solutions for every use case all vehicle types and brands High efficiency in power and footprint Modular scalable secure architecture designed for serviceability Unparalleled quality advanced testing vehicle functional climate environment for long term reliability Options for site hosts to use custom branding Software Enables Control of who can use stations and when All vehicles to get charged on time Multiple vehicles to share power Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied Roaming integrations with other charging networks Challengers VLTA Claims to go beyond just charging EVs their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with PLTR When company compares itself to the competition they do it all they own the gear they sell the electricity they provide software and networks they do fancy data things they do advertising The things they don t do are manufacture and sell the chargers They cherry pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better engagement but given they only have 1 7k Level 2s amp 6 L3 It s like chargers as billboards selected to prime locations Anyone can replicate it if it provides substantial revenue boost competitors will emulate it SemmaConnect Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant Sema appears not to have a L3 offering nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals single family residential EVGO EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers and base their business largely on L3 chargers AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1 4k L3 which garners 4th market share Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates 0 04 min assuming you spend 7 99 month and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3 EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables What differentiates the company is the L3 focus BLNK Overhyped POP stock Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals Claims to operate on an owner operator model From EC The Company made continued progress with its owner operator strategy the number of commercial Blink owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51 in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period VWAGY Subsidiary Electrify America L3 focused company it enjoys 2 5k L3 chargers EM also sells a L2 for the home EM offers an app membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board Company doesn t appear to build their own chargers instead relying on procurement using third party hardware and software Near Term Catalysts In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill AlixPartners estimates 300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030 including 50 billion in the U S alone It s not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays but you don t know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts Well the biggest companies you might say It s not that clear cut What is clear cut is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure CHPT has the most experienced 14yrs company with largest manufacturing capacity technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states 500k by 2030 Oh yeah one more thing former CHPT board member is in current administration That s only US CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world s renewable energy aka Europe Also Canada Australia UK Mexico among other places You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road Just like railways roads telcoms and internet Long Term Catalysts Fossil fuel bans Transit electrification dates Incentive programs All major auto OEM brands committed to electric Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration CHPT Estimated 1B Revenue at 3 EV Penetration Miscellaneous CHPT Apple Store rating 4 6 CHPT also has the 1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app In collaborations with Daimler Toyota BMW Siemens etc No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies Customers include Google Target IKEA NASA GM Pepsico Disney McDonalds FedEx Stanford etc Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st MOAT First Mover Advantage With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry this is where big contracts will go Asset light business model Selective ownership of charge stations outsources maintenance amp responsibilities to the owner Economies of Scale CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity Network Effect 75 of charging network market share amp operations in 14 countries CONCLUSION All in all CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure with light CapEx business model Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs recurring revenue streams and visibility CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains EV Ecosystem Hardware Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology Yes most of its network is L2 chargers but it s where most of the money is to be made As users go to restaurants malls sports events concerts office cinema universities or just a Parking Lot There will be L2 charger not L3 due to Charger Cost Basis Time Parked Pretty straightforward formula Why am I interested in CHPT Because it s an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry Because it s a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens And is a home GAS station Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals amp 13 institutional ownership what s going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it Let me use a technical term you ll understand the valuation will go bananas Average target price 38 21

infrastructure company that designs develops amp manufactures hardware amp software solutions for electric vehicles at large It offers a portfolio of hardware software amp services for corporate public amp residential customers Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries History In June 2017 CHPT took over 9 800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE Prior to that point CHPT managed 34 900 charging stations across Mexico Australia Canada and the United States The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano On November 28 2018 CHPT raised 240 million At the time CHPT maintained 57 000 charging spots In 2019 VW s Electrify America https en wikipedia org wiki Electrify America and CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers Company reached 100 000 chargers in September 2019 while adding more than 2 000 charging locations per month Currently CHPT offers 132k charging station network Which accounts for 72 market share of total level 2 charging in North America New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021 What is the business model of CHPT Charge Point sells hardware amp software equipment amp network subscriptions to property owners The company doesn t own the majority of stations It doesn t monetize energy It only monetizes the driver thus capital light business model BUSINESS OVERVIEW Market Cap 7bn Shares Float 299mln Institutional ownership 13 2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65 65 5 Year 60 TAM 190bn Newly formed entity has no Debt Cash amp Cash Equivalents 650m Exponential

US Data from AFDC https afdc energy gov fuels electricity locations html analyze fuel ELEC shows that CHPT wields the largest market share at 42 8K L2 chargers out of 92 8K total of which 11 5K are non networked carving 53 market share of networked chargers No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16 8K No3 largest is SemaCharge Network at 5 2K followed by Blink with 3 1k which is 4th In terms of L3 Superchargers where Tesla leads the way with 10 7k of 19 6k units CHPT is competitive with 1 5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2 5k Superchargers account for 22 of the market pie L2 75 and L1 3 of market share People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 amp L2 Well that s wrong L3 is obviously the option for the highways commercial and service transportation Even larger segment though is found at parking lots restaurants cinemas sports arenas malls corporate offices and other mass conglomerations This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install but with longer charging times perfect fit Products Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers Solutions for every use case all vehicle types and brands High efficiency in power and footprint Modular scalable secure architecture designed for serviceability Unparalleled quality advanced testing vehicle functional climate environment for long term reliability Options for site hosts to use custom branding Software Enables Control of who can use stations and when All vehicles to get charged on time Multiple vehicles to share power Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied Roaming integrations with other charging networks Challengers VLTA Claims to go beyond just charging EVs their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with PLTR When company compares itself to the competition they do it all they own the gear they sell the electricity they provide software and networks they do fancy data things they do advertising The things they don t do are manufacture and sell the chargers They cherry pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better engagement but given they only have 1 7k Level 2s amp 6 L3 It s like chargers as billboards selected to prime locations Anyone can replicate it if it provides substantial revenue boost competitors will emulate it SemmaConnect Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant Sema appears not to have a L3 offering nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals single family residential EVGO EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers and base their business largely on L3 chargers AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1 4k L3 which garners 4th market share Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates 0 04 min assuming you spend 7 99 month and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3 EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables What differentiates the company is the L3 focus BLNK Overhyped POP stock Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals Claims to operate on an owner operator model From EC The Company made continued progress with its owner operator strategy the number of commercial Blink owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51 in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period VWAGY Subsidiary Electrify America L3 focused company it enjoys 2 5k L3 chargers EM also sells a L2 for the home EM offers an app membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board Company doesn t appear to build their own chargers instead relying on procurement using third party hardware and software Near Term Catalysts In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill AlixPartners estimates 300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030 including 50 billion in the U S alone It s not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays but you don t know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts Well the biggest companies you might say It s not that clear cut What is clear cut is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure CHPT has the most experienced 14yrs company with largest manufacturing capacity technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states 500k by 2030 Oh yeah one more thing former CHPT board member is in current administration That s only US CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world s renewable energy aka Europe Also Canada Australia UK Mexico among other places You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road Just like railways roads telcoms and internet Long Term Catalysts Fossil fuel bans Transit electrification dates Incentive programs All major auto OEM brands committed to electric Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration CHPT Estimated 1B Revenue at 3 EV Penetration Miscellaneous CHPT Apple Store rating 4 6 CHPT also has the 1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app In collaborations with Daimler Toyota BMW Siemens etc No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies Customers include Google Target IKEA NASA GM Pepsico Disney McDonalds FedEx Stanford etc Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st MOAT First Mover Advantage With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry this is where big contracts will go Asset light business model Selective ownership of charge stations outsources maintenance amp responsibilities to the owner Economies of Scale CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity Network Effect 75 of charging network market share amp operations in 14 countries CONCLUSION All in all CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure with light CapEx business model Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs recurring revenue streams and visibility CHPT finds itself in eco friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains EV Ecosystem Hardware Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology Yes most of its network is L2 chargers but it s where most of the money is to be made As users go to restaurants malls sports events concerts office cinema universities or just a Parking Lot There will be L2 charger not L3 due to Charger Cost Basis Time Parked Pretty straightforward formula Why am I interested in CHPT Because it s an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry Because it s a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens And is a home GAS station Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals amp 13 institutional ownership what s going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it Let me use a technical term you ll understand the valuation will go bananas Average target price 38 21

been following the industry closely This is how I m betting on EVs BB 60 30c 01 2022 at 0 27 Already powering many of the telematics of current cars BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers Getting certified with an automaker is not easy so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies You don t want your car to get hacked easily so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software and already has experience with ICE cars I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kxknrl bb dd 9 reasons why bb is from former bb employee utm source share amp utm medium ios app amp utm name iossmf SONY 100 shares at 101 I wouldn t call this the Japanese equivalent for BB as they aren t a cybersecurity company But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years On PS5 it s actually a good thing that there s a chip shortage As Sony loses money on the hardware and earn on game royalties and licenses they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs and lose less money on hardware sales And because demand is so hot for the PS5 they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20 30 on every game they sell That s some fat margin Now you re probably wondering wtf I m here to read about EVs why you telling me about PS5s Yeah you re right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted While they build up their EV software platform they have cash cows in imagery and video games And if Apple is really building an EV I would bet am literally betting that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you re sitting Well that s probably a Sony camera or 20 of them There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car I mean my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras and it s a tiny slab of glass and my family can t sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment Full disclosure I also have 150 AAPL VW 200 shares 33 32 You are all excited about Ford I am too but I m not buying into them because I think they are overhyped But what s interesting about Ford s EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so That means even if Ford can t sell that many cars VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe and that s VW s home territory VW already launching EVs under Audi Porsche in the premium sector VW Skoda and Seat in the value sector and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon But you might wonder what about Tesla They are so great Well yeah they aren t that bad But VW is a goddamn monster It s kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant oh this is my 4th plant We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin That s cute VW has 136 plants around the world The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals Oh and there s that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing Welcome to the big leagues EVs VW is likely to launching 5 10 EVs per year the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year And they have Electricfy America network and Canada and similar in Europe And one more thing VW also does trucks Like 18 wheeler trucks They are one of the biggest manufacturers behind brands such as Man Scania and Navistar And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs Will merge this part with Volvo Volvo 800 shares 26 Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel Now when I say Volvo I don t mean Volvo Cars That s bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands But I m taking about AB Volvo still out of Sweden building trucks mining equipment backhoes haul trucks and cranes EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get It s not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access congestion or polluter fees common in Europe and allow EVs in for discount or free EVs increasingly make more sense You save so much on lower op maintenance costs avoiding tolls and tax credits Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do Another thing is governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus What do these trillions buy Concrete steel Volvo construction equipment labor Where does the concrete steel and other commodities like rising gold and silver prices come from They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar Liebherr and Volvo equipment Yep there s Volvo again So if you believe stimulus is happening Volvo is a good choice If you believe inflation is real Volvo is a good choice If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and or heavy loads Volvo is a good choice All my opinions only not financial advice Currency amounts all written in USD Obligatory rockets

the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security including SARS CoV 2 the cause of COVID 19 Ebola Marburg Yellow Fever and Zika The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics The 31st of August 2020 NIAID Awarded 44 Million Contract to Advance

filoviruses togaviruses bunyaviruses arenaviruses paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses Hepatitis C West Nile Dengue Jap Encephalitis Yellow Fever TBEV OHFV and Zika orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential and to top it off it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose sensitive effects in people And based on multiple animal studies it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature Not only that but this antiviral unlike any of the

exciting project this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor So the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement So that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the

potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor is a great challenge and we are happy we have one My only concern is i have no concerns Pipeline in a molecule My aim is to make c5 inhibitors

following the successful proof of concept trial The company announced that a Pivotal trial for PNH and proof of concept trials in renal complement mediated diseases are expected to begin in 2H 2021 On March 22 the company unveiled BCX9930 Ph1 data The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below 100 of treatment na ve patients and 83 of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were

diseases we reach to the following conclusion The potential market size BCX9930 will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to 28 56B 51B year This numbers are explained below stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for amp x200B 1 2 Due to COVID 19 the market for PNH and aHUS was anticipated to grow from US 4855 million in 2020 to US 7023 million by 2026 it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5 89 during 2021 2026 3 Anca vasculitis prevalence in the USA rounds 10 20 per million 3300 6600 patients As a treatment example we use Soliris which costs 500 000 year We would aim for 1 65B 3 3B market size as of now Expected to grow by 2025 4 The global systemic lupus erythematosus market size is expected to reach USD 3 08 billion by 2025 according to a new report by Grand View Research Inc exhibiting a CAGR of 7 0 during the forecast period 5 8 IgAN The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone Data gathered from the undergone study in East Asia show the prevalence rounds 45 million meaning 14 850 patients or a potential 7 25B market size using Soliris s yearly price 6 C3G Prevalence in the USA round 14 140 per 1M people 4620 46 200 patients If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs 500 000 year the potential market size we aim for rounds 2 31B 23 1B 7 PMN prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN so we would potentially aim for a similar market size meaning 7 25B amp x200B 4 5 6 Alexion buy out On December the 12th 2020 Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B More than 90 of their revenue come from their Factor D C5 inhibitor being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen You might think why does this matter Well remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion s and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell This buy out reflects how undervalued BCX9930 is Apart from the buy out I think it s essential to mention that Alexion bought Achillion s Factor D when it was in Ph2 for 930MM In 2019 Alexion s SOLIRIS eculizumab net product sales were 3 946 4 million Soliris is currently approved to treat PNH and aHUS Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases aiming for a wider market while having greater efficacy safety profile As a quick example using the average biotech mid cap x7 revenue multiplier and the revenue Soliris managed to generate in 2019 3 964B 27 748B It would mean a SP value of 157 56 for BCRX I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in class treatment and it s able to treat more diseases therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity amp x200B 4 5 7 Soliris Ultomoris patients survey BCRX recently did a survey with 23 patients 12 of them

trials in Renal Complement Mediated diseases will be made Straight jumping from a ph1 to a pivotal ph3 trial is something that s not common in the bio world and could be taken as a really bullish sign Apart from it being a bullish sign it accelerates the process of development of the drug giving it a chance to hit the market in a smaller span of ti amp x200B 4 5 9 BCX9930 valuation Having in mind BCX9930 is a potential best in class treatment that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their Factor D c5 inhibitor and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the 28 56B 51B mark

Alexander J Denner founder of Sarissa Capital is After recently increasing his stake in BCRX along with BlackRock he now owns a 5 of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc Denner has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning 789 in the last 3 quarters showing strong conviction in the company Since Denner opened his position in Alexion it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal as shown in the

acknowledge that BCRX is more than a strong BO candidate A buy out coming from BIIB company where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors would make total sense in the following 2 years once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled It also is important to mention that Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M amp A candidates Mergers and Acquisitions as of October 30th 2020

Soliris Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst s in the incoming years From 2007 to 2014 Alexion s stock price grew a 1777 Being valued at 10 5 in

with the unique pipeline it possess Having in mind Alexion made 66 4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo apart from it additional revenue generated by Rapivab Galidesivir stockpillings may come Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider amp x200B 7 De risked company Last December the 7th 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management With this agreement BCRX was funded with 325 000 000 in order to support Orladeyo launch Setting the company in an attractive position of not needing to do any money rising Offering Jon Stonehouse CEO also confirmed that the company will not need to do offerings anymore The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore It s important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement Royalty Pharma will receive a 1 on global net sales of BCX9930 if approved Showing how bullish they are on BCX9930 and their willingness to invest at it amp x200B https preview redd it gezetorvup171 png width 1080 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b6880f64de595b224faf806b09f22385ba88dabf amp x200B 8 Forward looking statements amp x200B 1

severely undervalued and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline it should be valued around 180 The StockPrice fair value number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing making it an excellent long term hold and buy out candidate I currently do have a position in this company my average entry price being around the 4 range My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term at least 2 years more provided that we don t get bought out earlier I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing aswell as the rest of the pipeline

u mf apes out there looking for a play rn GMG is the move in my opinion I posted about this earlier and thank fuck some other guys saw my ambition and posted some DD I m just gonna report there comment plus my analysis so far Ngl this seems like a prettt solid play rn low volume and it s just been on the slow and steady rise This is a real game changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium ion batteries in almost every application with GMG s Graphene and UQ s patent pending aluminum ion battery technology The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1 7 volts and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts kg which endows them with a very high charge rate Furthermore graphene aluminum ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life over 2000 charge discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance battery safety very low fire potential and lower environmental impact more recyclable graph looks good good buy but if u want idk not a professional buy at ur own risk yeah i would the user but his user name is too long anon i love u 1 1 1 v Okay Breakfast came early for You GMG V Bulls Its Pencil lead not crayons today though although Im hoping that someone with Market DD will post here in a bit and make us some fresh hot crayons this is my first time on here doing anything like this so go easy on me So here s some stuff I was able to get The only person with a science background That I can really find is their CSO Ashock Kumar Nanjundan CSO Pukyong National University Degree Name Doctor of Engineering Materials Science Current Adjunct professor at Queensland University Gotta Do Something for the Kids Right Publications I ll Let you guys go to sci hub to download this review for yourself But the TLDR is that this dude knows his shit on how to dope graphene to get it to work as a battery Cited by 178 For less academic Apes this means that 178 other scientists were like yeah this dude knows his shit Imma cite what he s saying basically as fact https doi org 10 1039 C6EE00158K Ashock s most cited individual work comes from his first post doc that he completed in Korea Polyaniline Grafted Reduced Graphene Oxide for Efficient Electrochemical Supercapacitors Basically he does some pretty no brainer synthesys to link graphene and another semi conducting polymer that really enhances the graphene properties Pretty nobrainer basic polymer bro shit even so it look like he probably wrote good supporting info and saved a lot of people a lot of time https doi org 10 1021 nn204688c Total citations for all work combined 3 845 This is pretty damn good for someone so young Here is a research paper that I m having trouble accessing that seems to be relevant to this company s work on aluminum graphene based batteries If anyone can find it DM me https doi org 10 1002 adfm 202010569 All in all based on what I can see from linkedin about this company they have a great CSO He does seem to be both teaching and doing research in academia He was recently brought up from a Head Product Scientist role to a CSO role so hopefully this change will reflect a move away from more general research and towards really developing this stuff for GMG V I m concerned about product development at this company specifically it s unclear who is managing it I m not able to see every employee linkedin but it may be that one of the people not visible is leading product development You might be thinking but wait what if there is a group of slave PHD students postdocs at the university of Queensland working on this stuff Yes there is Nanjundan has some connections with the YU group https aibn uq edu au yu And then here is a press release about it https graphenemg com gmg the university of queensland research uni quest kick off the graphene enhanced aluminium ion battery development project It sounds like the company has recently had some really good results in R amp D but until I can see and Audit the product process development lead ill probably avoid going all in sometimes the COO role at these companies can be a technical role that helps with process development but the COO looks to be doing mostly operations type stuff and is non technical Not wholly worrisome but I do want to see more listed employees on linkedin and then someone that is leading doing process development scale up and quality control quality assurance wouldn t hurt either It also looks like this company is casting a wide net of potential products but it s entirely unclear if it has launched any of them Hopefully it does It feels uncommon these days for a company to go the IPO route so early on in R amp D most will look to do venture capital funding first to launch a few products Is this an australian thing Or is this just crowdfunding with extra steps If you have more info lets talk I m a materials science ape and don t know anything about Stock Market DD but why not rely on science DD to decide on investments Anyway yeah it seems like a solid play It dipped a bit today but looking at financials i see nothing but greatness for this stock not financial advice

posts about GE Some of them seemed pretty spot on while others seemed like FUD or unresearched nonsense I ve been banging this drum for a while in my own circles and now that I ve got enough Karma to post to WSB I give to you GE The Great American comeback TLDR General Electric GE was a on its death bed and the stock had tanked They are right at the pivot point in a MASSIVE turnaround and this thing is going to Today s closing price was 14 35 PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE FROM THE PAST MADE BY SOMEONE WHO CANT SEE THE FUTURE BUT THINKS MAYBE THEY KNOW SOMTHING OR MIGHT JUST BE HIGH 6 11 2021 closes above 15 7 22 2021 closes above 20 probably drops a bit after earnings and consolidates for a while 10 20 2021 closes above 28 June 2022 closes above 35 December 2022 closes above 45 Won t edit the above predictions unless I see a typo or something Current holdings which I m liable to mess with are attached I ll be trying to get out of the June 20 without a loss sometime in the next week or two Other June and the July stuff I m gonna ride for a bit and try and get some money On the following pull back consolidation phase I ll buy calls for the next leg DD and back story The Good We ll get to that part in a bit The bad The history GE was a massive company has been around forever and was known as one of the quintessential American companies They became this massive conglomerate that bought up companies left and right leading up to the mortgage backed securities bonanza in the mid 2000 s Not sure I ll need to remind everyone what happened at the end of that Rhymed with Semen Mothers but GE took it particularly bad See after the 2008 2009 meltdown it turned out that not only had they lost a ton of money on derivatives and other financial products but as would become public later they lied to investors about it on disclosures and jumped through hoops to keep investors from finding out just how bad the situation was Add to that some really badly timed all cash acquisitions that worked out terribly and the company was about ready to go belly up The Ugly There is a reason that while the whole world got its act back together after 2009 GE continued to play act a paraplegic thrown in the deep end of a pool The stock took beating after beating as news kept coming out about acquisitions that went bad massive write downs accounting fraud and various other losses After getting rid of their CEO they brought in someone else to try and turn things around then after a very short run they replaced that guy with the current CEO Larry Culp They basically had to bribe beg him to take the job getting him to leave a cushy gig at Harvard where he was basically in working retirement after having earned a reputation as a corporate turn around guru Making our way back to the good While GE s stock continued to flounder Culp got busy and started to shake things up First he started selling divisions and companies Some of them had been with GE forever like the lightbulb divisions others were acquisitions some of which only a few years old that were sold off This wasn t about profiting by spinning something off it was about cutting losses and making sense out of a massive company that didn t have a functioning balance sheet Some of the chunks that were sold were profitable and many were not The net effect was that he cut operating expenses more than he cut operating revenue moving free cash flow FCF in the right direction albeit still negative at this point and raising cash from the sales They slashed the dividend to 1 penny People were clutching their pearls and screaming I mean It was GE for Pete s sake They ve had a good dividend forEVER This dragged the stock down more But it shoved FCF in the right direction Between significantly improved FCF and money raised from selling off divisions and assets GE managed to cut its TOTAL debt from 130 BILLION to 71 BILLION which is about where it is right now although they do have more than 25 billion cash on hand Oh yeah they also own 25 of Baker Hughes valued at about 6 5 billion that is after they sold 1 billion worth of it recently they are also selling GECAS airline leasing company that owned airliners and rented them out to airlines and other companies to the global leader in the space In return for shedding this division which due to structural issues and insufficient scale to create real efficiencies was losing GE 700 million a year in FCF GE is getting 24 billion in cash 1 billion in cash equivalents and 6 billion worth of a company 45 of the company s stock that happens to be beaten up at the moment but is the world s largest airline leasing company and is about to have a gang buster year as airlines struggle to find planes Could easily see the value of that swelling and then them dumping it to pay down even more debt The Good you may have to squint but it is there I swear GE is now a rather lean company especially compared to the mess that existed 5 years ago I ve given you the current cash debt position From that alone doesn t seem great but I do ask that you keep in mind the trend line from 130BB to 71BB over 5 years Today GE is made up of 4 divisions they no longer make home appliances it isn t one of the divisions yes I know they still are on the market but the stuff sold under the GE name in home appliances is by actually made by the Haier conglomerate and never mind HealthCare Not sure if any of you have had an MRI but if you had you may have had the same weird experience I did Walking into the room kind of nervous to get this big medical test to find out what is wrong with my Insert body party here and being confronted with the biggest GE logo I have EVER seen Embossed into the side of this MRI machine Anyway whether you were aware of it or not GE makes a lot of tech for healthcare from MRI machines to ultrasounds and tons of other stuff It is a growing business that is consistently profitable and something cough cough COVID knocked us on our butt and hospitals need to retool and get better tells me that healthcare spending is going to be rising a lot this year and next year Energy Basically this is about steam turbines used for 20th century electricity generation and storage in some cases Talking huge turbines used in natural gas oil coal nuclear and geothermal power plants I think GE itself may consider Hydro power plant turbines part of this sector but I m listing them below because that makes more sense While not very forward looking this business has the potential to generate significant FCF over the next few years maybe even a decade or more While some of these power sources are on their way out others like natural gas have seen a surge in utilization and some nuclear seem to be about to make a comeback This chunk of GE is usually profitable although not hugely so That being said between what happened in Texas which will require several power plants to be overhauled or replaced existing service and new equipment contracts and the potential to grow I think this is a worthwhile business unit to keep around Renewable Energy Some solar a decent amount of hydro power a growing pumped storage segment and WIND TURBINES These electrical generators and in the case of pumped storage mechanical batteries are one of the most exciting areas for me personally when looking at the GE story GE briefly snagged the title as producing the world s largest wind turbine 14 MW and it is the largest one that many countries have certified for use This thing is bonkers every rotation of the blades produces enough electricity to power roughly 4 000 homes for a DAY It is a monster and it has been selected for use in the next phase of the world s largest offshore wind farm and the first phase of the US first large offshore windfarm GE also makes onshore wind turbines they make the truly massive turbines used in huge hydro electric damns and they also make turbines for use in pumped storage This segment has up till now been generation negative FCF losing money however it is growing by leaps and bounds and seems poised to start adding to positive FCF a little this year or next and then growing exponentially Pumped storage is really cool Basically you create a large body of water like a lake by using excess electricity made by solar and wind when it is available to pump water up hill Then when you need more electricity because it is night time or the wind isn t blowing you throw the turbine in reverse and it acts as a hydro electric damn Aviation This is the crown jewel of GE although in a weird twist of fait it delivered a kick to the nuts just as things started turning around Needless to go into much detail as to why a business that makes its money building and servicing jet engines might be negatively effected when air travel takes a year and a half pause That being said GE s newest engines are showing a great track record of winning orders Doing this DD I found out that apparently when you buy commercial airliners you get to pick what engines you want if there are more than one option kind of like when you buy a car and pick whether you want the in dash CD player or not GE s engines are proving to be more efficient more reliable and cheaper to operate than their main competitor Pratt and Whitney That means that as everyone gets waxed and vaxed in preparation for the horney party boom we are about to witness airlines have started ordering planes again and in a big way You see during the covid crisis airlines didn t have many customers and what most of them did was they identified their oldest and or most problematic aircraft and sold them off various other companies in other industries or to companies that lease aircraft to airlines when they need a few to fill a gap Now that things are coming back online airlines are ordering more planes As other parts of the world start to open up over time this should create sustained tail winds for this division Oh yeah and one thing that often seems to be overlooked is that while yes the aviation division has been beat up management has used this as an opportunity to streamline and improve operations Both sales and maintenance saw significant drops in revenue however the drop in FCF was smaller than would be expected because the whole time GE was improving its margins Now as their order book starts filling up the aviation division is significantly leaner and more optimized which should mean that when the FCF starts up again this fall or this winter it should turn into a firehose Other points of interest GE has announced a 1 for 8 stock split that is a reverse split for every 8 shares you own you will end up with 1 share that is worth 8X the pre split value This makes sense for a few reasons 1 GE has a massive number of shares outstanding and doing this reverse split will bring its stock price adjusted for market cap within line with its piers and should put it in a position to re enter the DOW Doing so will create demand for the shares as it is added to funds that track that index 2 Once GE reinstates its dividend which will be another catalyst for the stock to continue upwards the lower share count means a slower drain on FCF since I imagine they will incrementally increase the dividend It seems silly because it doesn t really matter how many shares except when you consider that they have so many that if you decide to go from a dividend of 0 01 to 0 10 the difference in share float would be hundreds of millions annualized in FCF Obviously the target yield wouldn t be impacted but even this small thing can have a real impact in speeding up the debt reduction 3 I fully expect that as the stock price increases and then the reverse split happens GE will do a share issuance to raise a few billion to pay down the debt I view that as a buying opportunity as any drop in share price should be short lived and I expect the resulting reduction in debt will mean net net share prices will increase due to the issuance On that note GE has committed to a stated target of 2 5 times EBITDA which is the cutoff for investment grade securities from the current 6 times EBITDA Getting to investment grade will create increased upside pressure that is why I m saying the stock will go up when they issue more shares even though there will likely be a temporary dip at that time
