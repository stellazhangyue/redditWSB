63,nsk1jm,t2_5ifozyrw,1622854731,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsk1jm/wkhs_42_short_interest/,1,WKHS 42 Short Interest,Workhorse currently has a 42 short float which could cause a short squeeze The support is around 13 00 with bulls still in control of the chart This is similar to AMC because the higher the short interest the higher the squeeze will go For example shorts borrow shares from a broker for a fee This is possible because people buy shares and don t set limit orders This is why it is important to set limit orders high so that shorts can t borrow your shares The shorts then sell your shares that they just borrowed for a fee to then sell on the open market driving the price down Shorts make money by selling the shares back to the broker at a lower price as well as making money through buying put options A short squeeze happens when shorts have to buy back their shares that they borrowed from a broker at a higher price We can accelerate a short squeeze through buying the shares and setting a limit order high above the ask so that shorts can t borrow your shares This will cause the stock price to go up which will cause shorts to buy back the shares that they borrowed causing a short squeeze For example if we buy WKHS at market price such as 13 00 it will cause the stock price to go up at which point shorts will need to cover their positions or risk being margin called which means that the broker can automatically close out the short s position which will cause them to buy back those shares at market price which is often much higher then when they borrowed them which causes the shorts to lose their money by handing it over us as we sell our shares when the price is above 100 share

com superior gold three in one producer developer and explorer https investockreal com superior gold three in one producer developer and explorer amp x200B Superior Gold https www superior gold com is a Canadian Company operating a Gold Australian Mine Plutonic Superior Gold acquired it for 30M including two mills the mine s camp 7000 km of drilling and 450 km of underground development The company affirms that the total worth is 2 7B an exaggeration although it is true that the value of the mills the camp and the mine works are higher than the paid 34M amp x200B The main question is if with all the infrastructure in place the gold mine will produce benefits Plutonic is one of the Australian mines with the higher AISC In 2015 Plutonic AISC were AU1600 while now are even higher 1550 This is one of the reasons Superior Gold is in the InvestockReal portfolio https investockreal com gold and silver mining stock portfolio with higher price of gold Superior Gold margins will just explode In July 2020 the previous CEO resigned when the production declined and the cash cost increased Since then and with a necessary equity raise of CAD17M the company is turning around The production guide has been accomplished and surpassed the grade of the ore has been increasing as well the AISC have been declined Moreover there is a plan to increase production via an open pit which PEA has already been delivered Three in One Explorer Developer and Producer One of the most positive aspects is that Superior Gold can be considered a company with the three different flavors of a gold company producer developer and explorer All of it at the same time that is three in one Producer Plutonic Underground is already producing between 65 and 75 Au koz and increasing The plan of the company to increase the grade of mined ore is paying and they had a strong last quarter If their plan continues Superior Gold will not last much in increasing the guideline for the year production Developer Superior Gold has 5Moz of resources and it is planning how to increase production Recently has released a PEA for mining ore from a push back in the main pit The development plan will be short and the CAPEX low It will increase considerably the production of gold Explorer They had two drillers working in exploration and recently they added a third one There has been some success in the underground mine lately that are going to be followed up The exploration is going to continue and it should not be discarded that they hit big Having the three possibilities open there will be a constant flow of news that could help if they are positive and in the right direction to increase the market value of Superior Gold Turnaround Plan Superior Gold has dealt with the operational problem they had in the following manner 1 Raise capital Superior Gold raised C 17M in Q4 2020 to implement some investment that could help to turn around the company The price of the offering was C 0 7 per share issued 2 Modernize the underground fleet which was necessary to operate the mine The new mobile mining equipment improves the availability of the equipment and material lowering the operation costs and increasing ore production 3 Buyback a 2 net smelter return royalty for 4 6M using the funds from the share offering 4 Increase the drilling including a third driller To increase exploration and to increase the knowledge of the orebody with infill drilling This policy has already paid well to Superior Gold as the resources have been increasing year after year to the current 5Moz 5 To study the complex mineralization of Plutonic with modern tools including in the 3D model all the available data inclusive of the historic data 6 Find extra sources to fill the mill This already is in place with the delivery of the PEA for the push back of the main pit Great economics and extra production coming in line in the next year and a half Turnaround Results The turnaround strategy is starting to pay dividends This last quarter the production has increased the mineralization starts to be understood which is reflected in the recent exploration success and the increase in production and there are new sources of ore in the pipeline The PEA of the Main Pit Push Back project has been delivered with strong economics The NPV 5 at 1900 gold price is C 236M with an IRR of 64 The project has low Capex C 82M and low AISC 862 The mine life is 6 years with an average production of 60koz The main pit push back project has an EV NPV 5 ratio of less than 50 And the project is conservative there is the possibility to further expand the open pit reallocating some heritage sites and some infrastructure The PFS is expected for H1 2022 and once in production Superior Gold will be producing together with the underground mine more than 100koz at reduced costs The main push back open pit will start operation by the end of 2022 Already this year Superior Gold will start to mine one of the already permitted open pits the Plutonic East open pit And Superior Gold will continue to evaluate the different identified possible sources of ore focusing on shallow deposits that could constitute an open pit Meanwhile Superior Gold is adding a third driller to push further exploration Drill drill drill that s one of the recipes for success Rob McEwen when turning around one of their mines and having problems between production and exploration teams took advantage of a very long strike to increase exploration drilling and increase the mine resources In the case of Superior Gold this should not be a problem as the underground works are huge Adding a second mining front will make simpler and easier the exploration tasks which will redound in better grades and production And exploration is starting to pay and there has been some recent success in the underground mine with some exciting 53g 15m GxW 800 or 40g 6 5m GxW 260 holes not far from the mining front that will be followed up with more drilling Another important point in which Superior Gold is working is in understanding the mineralization All the historic data including geological structure alterations and lithology are being included in a 3D model that once completed will help to optimize the mining operations and to increase the exploration success This is expected to be finalized in 12 months Strong Potential In two to three years if the management continues to deliver we could expect conservatively a production of around 80koz from the underground plus an additional 40 koz from the main pit push back feeding the main mill with ore with an average grade of 2 5 grams This scenario seems very plausible with the grade of the open pit at 2 grams the PEA grade and the underground grade at 3 grams now at 3 5 grams there should not be a problem to arrive at 120koz with the main Mill completely feed or even get over this level of production 120 koz with an estimated AISC of 1300 and a gold price of 1800 Superior Gold will have benefits each year of 60M or 75 of the current EV 79M If the price of gold increases to 2400 which is probably in two years then the benefits will increase to 132M per year sensibly superior to the current EV and the Market Capitalization of Superior Gold A killer And there is still optionally to the exploration and the development On the development side Superior Gold has 5 million ounces in resources It is possible that Superior Gold converts an important share into reserves and finds the way to mine them in an economic way to feed the second mill Another possibility is that the second mill is feed with mineral ore from a third party similarly to what Newgold is going to do feeding partially NewAfton mill https stockhouse com news press releases 2021 01 27 gold mountain mining corp signs ore purchase agreement with new gold inc NFB20210127 with ore mined by Gold Mountain On the exploration side there is the possibility that Superior Gold makes a home run The best place to find gold is where it already exists And the properties of Superior Gold are full of possible targets one of them below the tailing storage facility which has not been drilled as most of the property as historical drilling has been focused up to 40 m below the surface Final consideration Superior Gold has exciting times ahead It combines the three flavors of a gold mine company production development and exploration If the turn around story continues together with an increase in the price of gold Superior Gold is going to provide a constant flow of exciting news that for their investors pleasure and delight will push the share price up InvestockReal Final Note Of course nothing of what has been said here is financial advice Do your homework and if you consider it contact a financial adviser

,TLDR This company has a high short interest that is only continuing to increase according to Ortex https public ortex com along with a days to cover that has essentially tripled in the last week alone Fundamentally they are better now than ever before yet are trading at more than a 60 premium from ATHs Shorts have hammered the stock and I think an opportunity may have presented itself if you all agree TLDR for the TLDR This stock is good and has a higher SI than BB and has an extremely auspicious likely to succeed business model with innovations that guarantee and justify a price target that is nearly 4x the current share price by EOY Where I got all this info will be listed amp x200B High SI Of the shares outstanding the short interest of this stock is 36M shares 13 12 per the last settlement date May 14th BUT the estimated short interest according to Ortex is now 42M shares a fairly substantial increase from the current as of last publication 36M short interest Days to cover has increased from the 1s to now 3 32 in just a few days Which is good because it means if a run up were to happen then the shorts would have a hard time exiting their position making a short squeeze more auspicious According to Fintel io https Fintel io the short share availability has only decreased and stayed today indicating that very few shorts have covered today even with the price up significantly This is because the less short shares the brokers have to lend out the higher amount of short shares that have already been lent out meaning that the people those short shares have been lent out to have not covered given that the short share availability has done nothing but go down and sideways all of Friday Not only does this stock have a high SI but it has increased recently meaning a squeeze opportunity may be perfectly aligning amp x200B amp x200B Fundamentally Undervalued Most high growth stocks have gotten obliterated since February 16th and this one is no different in that regard However the fundamentals of this company have only exponentially increased with essentially zero price action reaction There is proven manipulation in this stock s price action imo Just to name a few of the catalysts the price action practically utterly ignored ALL of these were after February 16 the peak of high growth 2 revenue beats 1 EPS beat CEO and 3 C suite members getting LEAPS with share exercisability valuing in the hundreds of millions WITH an exercise price of 7 83 which is ABOVE the current and then stock price announcement of 5 studies that in the company s own words would act as important marketing events that would likely lead to increased sales CFO projection of substantial double digit revenue growth along with his 20 40 YOY operating expense increase projection for the next few years According to own company estimates as far as sales and adoption profitability chances based on their numbers are likely to come at least one year before analysts are projection imo MORE bullish insider transactions in the form of the CMO picking up more LEAPS after her original one mentioned above CEO and COO being awarded tens of millions of dollars in profit in the form of hundreds of thousands of shares 840k to be exact and as of now they have not sold any new EXTREMELY innovative product confirmation nanonozzle imo added to MSCI index confirmation of

along with a better quality of life is what would happen should their goal of global Sap adoption be effectuated Chemotherapeutic drug enhancements is one of many of the revolutions that we could see specifically because of what this company does Paraphrasing the CEO we believe that the next big wave of innovation in Biology will derive from optical genome mapping which is what Bionano Genomics BNGO s Saphyr does optical genome mapping and they do it better than anyone According to the company itself gt 500bp detection in SVs with Saphyr compared to the CMA FISH and KT competition is cost effective requires less hands on time and has a faster turnaround time Not to mention it has more accurate readings and has less false positives LOH and SNV detection are said to be in the works currently zero of the three competing methods can detect these Nor can FISH CMA or KT detect the wide range of variant classes Saphyr can With this knowledge one wonders why Saphyr has not already been adopted in all 2 500 cytogenetic labs most of this can be attributed to resistance of change and relatively low academic praise and exposure of Saphyr s capabilities but with FIVE large clinical studies in the works on NIPT postnatal screening hematological malignancies in leukemia and lymphomas and solid tumor research that is sure to change all in due time Not to mention cost per genome reducing from 450 550 currently to 100 by at maximum 2023 Saphyr is already cost effective just imagine how cheap it will be compared to other methods once the price more than halves per genome Throughput to increase by 14x from the already immense maximum of 5000 genomes per year with the current Saphyr system Throw in in the nanonozzle release that may include SNV detection and will fill in the gaps of what current NGS is missing and one has a strong case to make that this company will revolutionize healthcare and the entire genomic sector as we know it amp x200B amp x200B So What I

predict when they drop PR and harder to predict when other people will react to it There is a short squeeze on the horizon and I believe gt 10 is the true current fundamental value of the company

of you following AMC daily what a week right We have had some pretty intense price action out there and since I posted last week I ve been flooded with private messages from some of you guys wanting more information as we go along to help you understand where this market is going Just to be clear I am not your financial advisor and you really should invest based on your own analysis of the stock and risk tolerance I know there is a lot of information going around out there and it can be confusing for people Now more than ever the use of technical tools helps us make choices not based on fear and greed but on logic and the balance of probabilities That being said here is my view of the past week with AMC using volume and price as my guide amp x200B Weekly chart https preview redd it zn6y8j95rg371 png width 570 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 8b2031e3bb869df44838baf462f7657da7017937 On the weekly chart since the breakout from the HTF high tight flag we have quickly reached my initial target of 63 96 The real body of last week s candle is longer than the previous week s on slightly higher volume which is normal It means Wyckoff s law of effort and result still suggests the price action is in harmony with its associated volume For a stock to rise it needs effort represented here as volume So here we have rising price action with rising volume which is good I am a little bit concerned about the long upper wick on this candle though because this suggests there is quite some selling happening here Could be a mix of price suppression professionals taking money off the table and some retail booking profits panic selling For sure what this long upper wick tells me is that the bears have not given up yet and we are not out of the woods The good news here is that the heavy resistance we found at 35 got blown out of the water on very high volume So whatever happens we now have VERY HIGH support at 35 36 resistance becomes support when broken Daily chart https preview redd it ij4cvnvarg371 png width 570 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 966c13ab4754a1fa66069d72fd810412c823986d Moving on to the daily chart candle 1 is a very important candle I see a very long white body with rising volume which is excellent I want to bring your attention to candle 2 When I compare these two candles I see that candle 1 has a way bigger body than 2 but only slightly higher volume This tells me that bears have capitulated at these levels 35 36 and price could move smoothly without much resistance which is very bullish Keep in mind that long white candles on very high volume offer a lot of support at around half the real body if a retrace would occur around 50 The upper wick suggests some selling was happening here but nothing that concerns me Candle 3 is a black spinning top and suggests indecision by market participants It coincided with a lot of FUD being laid out there and investors were trying to digest all the information that was being poured out by the media by the way trading the news is a bad idea just saying I like that the lower wick is longer than the upper wick which suggests more buying than selling is happening I believe a lot of weak hands were stopped out of their positions during this day for the newbies out there placing your stop loss too high will most likely result in closing your positions in highly volatile stocks as you may have experienced The spinning top closed at 51 34 suggesting the 50 region acted as support here I am not surprised of this pullback because we hit around 90 on the RSI Wednesday and a lot of traders look at this indicator to book profits Candle 4 is an inverted hammer and suggests weakness It acts as a bearish continuation 65 of the time but it s really not a candle I find very reliable Although the current price action suggests some weakness in the last 2 trading days the good news is that the volume is dropping significantly and thus suggests this is a short term pullback in a major uptrend remember Wyckoff s law of effort and result We can confidently HOLD our long positions in this stock because the likeliest outcome is for the uptrend to resume soon once all the weak hands are weeded out of this stock Some could argue that the start of a bull flag is being printed on the chart as well which is good news once it breaks out to the upside amp x200B 30 minutes chart

lower wick on the down candle at the 42 region on above average volume This short term downtrend was stopped at the 40 region with a hammer candle on high volume at 2 Shorter candle on higher volume suggests a lot of buying is happening at the 40 42 region and thus this is very strong support for us Professionals were buying heavily here amp x200B 60 minutes chart https preview redd it

on declining volume suggesting divergence in Wyckoff s law of effort and result This downtrend is weak and will not last very long For those who have not yet jumped on this rocket you have another opportunity to hop in at an interesting price currently around 48 I still believe we are currently trading at a discount on AMC For conservative traders I see very strong support at 40 42 but you could miss out on the rally if we do not retest this region For those of you already strapped on your rocket ship seat we HOLD THE LINE This stock has A LOT more upside risk than downside risk at this point and we are merely in a small consolidation zone which is normal after a significant rally Stocks do not trend in a straight line During the whole week I did NOT sell any of my call options even though they reached 1000 at some point This is not the action of greed but confidence that price action and volume support a lot more upside on this stock Selling too soon is as bad as selling too late I am so confident in this trade that I will be buying the dips next week to average up on my position AGAIN TLDR Volume and price still in harmony Buy the dips Strong support at 40 42 Short term downtrend in a major uptrend still intact WE HOLD THE LINE Cheers AMC 20 07 16C AMC 30 07 16C AMC 40 08 20C

has increased from the 1s to now 3 32 in just a few days Which is good because it means if a run up were to happen then the shorts would have a hard time exiting their position making a short squeeze more auspicious According to Fintel io https Fintel io the short share availability has only decreased and stayed today indicating that very few shorts have covered today even with the price up significantly This is because the less short shares the brokers have to lend out the higher amount of short shares that have already been lent out meaning that the people those short shares have been

N G O s Saphyr does optical genome mapping and they do it better than anyone According to the company itself gt 500bp detection in SVs with Saphyr compared to the CMA FISH and KT competition is cost effective requires less hands on time and has a faster turnaround time Not to mention it has more accurate readings and has less false positives LOH and SNV detection are said to be in the works currently zero of the three competing methods can detect these Nor can FISH CMA or KT detect the wide range of variant classes Saphyr can With this knowledge one wonders why Saphyr has not already been adopted in all 2 500 cytogenetic labs most of this can be attributed to resistance of change and relatively low academic praise and exposure of Saphyr s capabilities but with FIVE large clinical studies in the works on NIPT postnatal screening hematological malignancies in leukemia and lymphomas and solid tumor research that is sure to change all in due time Not to mention cost per genome reducing from 450 550 currently to 100 by at maximum 2023 Saphyr is already cost effective just imagine how cheap it will be compared to other methods once the price more than halves per genome Throughput to increase by 14x from the already immense maximum of 5000 genomes per year with the current Saphyr system Throw in in the nanonozzle release that may include SNV detection and will fill

TLDR This company has a high short interest that is only continuing to increase according to Ortex https public ortex com along with a days to cover that has essentially tripled in the last week alone Fundamentally they are better now than ever before yet are trading at more than a 60 premium from ATHs Shorts have hammered the stock and I think an opportunity may have presented itself if you all agree TLDR for the TLDR This stock is good and has a higher SI than BB and has an extremely auspicious likely to succeed business model with innovations that guarantee and justify a price target that is nearly 4x the current share price by EOY Where I got all this info will be listed High SI Of the shares outstanding the short interest of this stock is 36M shares 13 12 per the last settlement date May 14th BUT the estimated short interest according to Ortex is now 42M shares a fairly substantial increase from the current as of last publication 36M short interest Days to cover has increased from the 1s to now 3 32 in just a few days Which is good because it means if a run up were to happen then the shorts would have a hard time exiting their position making a short squeeze more auspicious According to Fintel io https fintel io the short share availability has only decreased and stayed today indicating that very few shorts have covered today even with the price up significantly This is because the less short shares the brokers have to lend out the higher amount of short shares that have already been lent out meaning that the people those short shares have been lent out to have not covered given that the short share availability has done nothing but go down and sideways all of Friday Not only does this stock have a high SI but it has increased recently meaning a squeeze opportunity may be perfectly aligning Fundamentally Undervalued Most high growth stocks have gotten obliterated since February 16th and this one is no different in that regard However the fundamentals of this company have only exponentially increased with essentially zero price action reaction There is proven manipulation in this stock s price action imo Just to name a few of the catalysts the price action practically utterly ignored ALL of these were after February 16 the peak of high growth 2 revenue beats 1 EPS beat CEO and 3 C suite members getting LEAPS with share exercisability valuing in the hundreds of millions WITH an exercise price of 7 83 which is ABOVE the current and then stock price announcement of 5 studies that in the company s own words would act as important marketing events that would likely lead to increased sales CFO projection of substantial double digit revenue growth along with his 20 40 YOY operating expense increase projection for the next few years According to own company estimates as far as sales and adoption profitability chances based on their numbers are likely to come at least one year before analysts are projection imo MORE bullish insider transactions in the form of the CMO picking up more LEAPS after her original one mentioned above CEO and COO being awarded tens of millions of dollars in profit in the form of hundreds of thousands of shares 840k to be exact and as of now they have not sold any new EXTREMELY innovative product confirmation nanonozzle imo added to MSCI index confirmation of several large sales several studies proving 100 concordance and increased accuracy of their main product compared to gold standard of the market this company is trying to disrupt HUGE institutional ownership increase from around 4 5 at lows up to 15 60 currently This document https docs google com document d 12jAjUCFcVm7447LKvB4gQPg2BRT 1SxILV 2jNXpxB8 edit usp sharing explains more in depth why this company is extremely fundamentally undervalued and WILL do great things in the future Interesting Healthcare Revolution A higher life expectancy for everyone in the aggregate along with a better quality of life is what would happen should their goal of global Sap adoption be effectuated Chemotherapeutic drug enhancements is one of many of the revolutions that we could see specifically because of what this company does Paraphrasing the CEO we believe that the next big wave of innovation in Biology will derive from optical genome mapping which is what Bio na no Geno mi cs B N G O s Saphyr does optical genome mapping and they do it better than anyone According to the company itself gt 500bp detection in SVs with Saphyr compared to the CMA FISH and KT competition is cost effective requires less hands on time and has a faster turnaround time Not to mention it has more accurate readings and has less false positives LOH and SNV detection are said to be in the works currently zero of the three competing methods can detect these Nor can FISH CMA or KT detect the wide range of variant classes Saphyr can With this knowledge one wonders why Saphyr has not already been adopted in all 2 500 cytogenetic labs most of this can be attributed to resistance of change and relatively low academic praise and exposure of Saphyr s capabilities but with FIVE large clinical studies in the works on NIPT postnatal screening hematological malignancies in leukemia and lymphomas and solid tumor research that is sure to change all in due time Not to mention cost per genome reducing from 450 550 currently to 100 by at maximum 2023 Saphyr is already cost effective just imagine how cheap it will be compared to other methods once the price more than halves per genome Throughput to increase by 14x from the already immense maximum of 5000 genomes per year with the current Saphyr system Throw in in the nanonozzle release that may include SNV detection and will fill in the gaps of what current NGS is missing and one has a strong case to make that this company will revolutionize healthcare and the entire genomic sector as we know it So What I hold 1623 shares and a LEAPS call option I plan on yoloing another 10k shares in B N G O by EOY at the latest I will not sell anything for years I am hodling regardless of what market headwinds come to fruition in my mind the company will do great things but it is hard to predict when they drop PR and harder to predict when other people will react to it There is a short squeeze on the horizon and I believe gt 10 is the true current fundamental value of the company easily If my fellow retards want to burn the shorts of B N G O then I will lead the charge by yoloing in the rest of the current BP in my account enough for about 300 400 more shares There IS a short squeeze on the horizon and I am willing to hodl with diamond hands for however long it takes If WSB were to agree then I think I have an idea of what may happen https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nlua3m the fellowship of the saphyr LMK what y all think is B N G O next up Need to know terms Nanonozzle innovations or product that would enable sequencing capabilities along with maybe single nucleotide variant detection Basically when this releases we don t know when the stock price will probably go up anywhere from 30 500 depending on how innovative it is and how much it makes NGS obsolete which is what the C suite has implied it will do NGS next generation sequencing competition with OGM OGM optical genome mapping what B N G O s main product the Saphyr does TLDR for the TLDR for the TLDR B N G O is good fundamentally has a high short interest proven manipulation in the price action and would be put in a more auspicious https www merriam webster com dictionary auspicious position to revolutionize healthcare were we to squeeze the shorts All my sources can be found in this document https docs google com document d 12jAjUCFcVm7447LKvB4gQPg2BRT 1SxILV 2jNXpxB8

compelling buy at these levels here s why 1 They rose capital in February at 1 50 which traditionally acts as a floor for the stock 2 Trades at 2x tangible book value compared to 12x tangible book value at cgc and acb 3 Had a nice high volume spike in February It s very common for the big mountain rise to come roughly four months after the initial mole rise on big volume We re roughly 4 months from when the initial run up happened implying the Daddy run up could near 4 Daily short volume remains very elevated with average daily short volume consistently around 50 although we were about 40 on Friday which is still quite high https www shortvolume com t SNDL Short interest is 13 78 as of May 14th implying shorts are shorting selling shares they don t own in the morning and rebuying in the afternoon in hopes of spooking others out of their shares This implies the short interest is quite underreported If longs can hold strong and bring higher price action towards the end of the day these shorts are going to be overwhelmed with the sp not to mention potential margin calls as SNDL increase it s volatility and holding requirements Once we see potentially see the automatic covering is when the party really starts 5 We had nice big volume up days of 622 million in May 28 and 894 million in June 3rd compared to Friday s down day with only 372 million shares traded Another bullish sign that the big volume days were also very green days while the red day was on muted volume 6 Stick with equity if you can I predict the big institutions who are buying into SNDL are selling a boatload of options and ensuring the price stays under their expiration so they can collect premiums while lowering their cost basis It s happened the last two weeks This can t go on forever as the stocks price should match it s value which imo is in the 4 range about 8x tangible book value sooner rather than later 7 SNDL has only announced positive news and quality acquisitions since its peak in February with preferred debt and 19 equity stake in Indiva which owns many brands including the 2 gummy producer in the U S WANA Gummies Sundial also acquired a large stake in The Valens at a deep discount compared to today s price Furthermore SNDL acquired all of Inner Spirit which has the most retail cannabis stores in Canada at 80 stores Sundial will undoubtedly replace current inventory with their own solidifying their strength as the only true vertical cannabis operator from growing processing and extracting to store front selling As the industry continues to mature the margin increase Sundial will see is out of this world Not to mention the free publicity for Reddit and Robinhood For SNDL to consistently be a top 5 stock on Robinhood with a market cap of 2 billion is unheard of The excitement around the stock will continue to help its real world performance 8 Sundial could very likely be acquired at any moment with 0 debt over 1 Billion in assets including 900 million in cas SNDL is a massive acquisition candidate at a fundamental level as it trades only trades at 2x book value with positive operating profit last quarter compared to CGC and acb which trade at 11x book value 9 As mentioned Sundial had positive operating profits for the first time this quarter primarily through passive security appreciation which shows no sign of stoping If SNDL can continue the trend it will be picked up by more and more non weed hedge funds that require multiple quarters of positive operating profit before they can be incorporated 10 When someone buys potx or other weed etfs they automatically purchase 4 35 sundial and 5 6 of the Valens as those are the current weighting s in the fund Not to mention Indiva at a lower For every dollar that flows into PotX more than 10 or more goes to SNDL related companies Every dollar that flows into weed funds in the future will help sundial Imagine the money that will flow into weed companies and these funds once federal legalization is passed 11 The share count of 1 86 Billion is no more than Palantir or NIO which sit at 1 88 and 1 7 Billion shares respectively 12 SNDL currently has 4 79 institutional ownership compared to over 15 at CGC and acb As time goes on this will continue to rise It s pretty normal for a developed company to have over 60 if not 80 institutional ownership especially at a book value like Sundials Book values traditionally act as a permanent floor for the stock especially with SNDL s positive operating profit and expected earnings growth and sales growth of 50 in 2022 13 The meme stock craze is not close to over It s just now being reported again on tv Excitement is brewing and as normals continue and hear about it and get in the avalanche should build higher than February s peak Sundial differentiates itself from the other meme stock with it s strong balance sheet and excitement around the up and coming industry To me investing in Sundial here combines level head value investing with the excitement of a new industry and the loyal meme craze Hope some people found this background on the company helpful Sundial seems to have a great runway to take off fundamentally and technically not to mention future catalysts like potentially breaking into the drinks market and as well as having many more medicinal and mental health uses It s undeniable that weed is losing it s negative stigma and is way more popular in entertainment and social settings than it has ever been Only a matter of time before you can order it at a bar or sporting event It s the trend of the youth and it s just getting started I m here to answer any questions

factors comparables and more, Overview WPG has a very large short percentage momentum positive economic news It was trading near all time lows from an exaggerated pandemic push down that is now being lifted as real estate is priced at all time highs and demand is rapidly increasing There is a 500 upside gap to fill even without accounting for the fact that the assets should actually be worth MORE than they were at the time the prior prices existed Short Squeeze Fast Upward Movement Factors Over 30 short as of Friday Low 24 million share float Volume has been EXTREMELY high compared to the average yet shorts have failed to push it down starting with 106 million June 1st and ending with 19 million on Friday June 5th The vast majority of shorts underwater The chart is curling now Every time shorts tried to push it back down the price bounced back which makes their situation worse When a move up doesn t correct back down in the face of volume and shorting shorts must cover or be margin called With shorts already underwater any gap up or move at open will cause immediate covering and stop loss triggers Shorts may even have to convert to longs to recoup losses as the price spikes Similar Squeezes IHT RHE AHT and others have capitalized on the economy finally opening up and shorts getting caught off guard The short percentage of IHT and RHE are comparable to WPG and look how they moved IHT and RHE don t have the huge gaps to fill that WPG has but they have gone parabolic on low floats AHT has a much larger float than WPG which limits it s ability to run as WPG can Chart and technical factors The pandemic caused the price to drop in an exaggerated way that left major gaps to fill In fact the gaps to fill are huge with the PPS being at 40 in late 2019 pre pandemic and over 30 in early 2020 The past stock prices don t even account for the increase in real estate value overall that we ve seen with supply being at lows and demand being very high WPG has prime real estate in it s REIT When it breaks resistance it can sprint up dollars at a time For example breaking 6 in the past has led to a move above 12 very quickly The initial 100 million share move only barely went down and curled back up into Friday Bullish after hours trading occurred Friday indicating the sentiment for the coming week There should have been profit taking on a Friday that causes a dip but it didn t happen Strength seems to be growing Volume has remained strong through the week with shorting having no successful effect on the price Resistance levels are rising The MacD RSI and other technical measure cooled off as needed while maintaining a strong price and curling up against short pressure Non overextended technicals are an important factor to allow the next leg up next week to go 100 plus and still have room amp x200B Quality of WPG Blackrock Vanguard Charles Swab and other MAJOR players are invested in this WPG is NOT some speculative trash stock without real intrinsic value or interest They have property in major metropolitan areas across the entire US with quality tenants including Home Goods Aurora Macy s and more They are adapting to new consumer trends and earning new forms of income for entertainment experiences to replace any shopping facilities that became vacant The value of location cannot be replaced and tenants are paying for that Industry momentum Retail real estate is filling vacancies quickly even redeveloping for a new generation of shoppers with new types of entertainment sports and dining experiences for example https

s what I think about it and why I bought TLDR at bottom amp x200B There is a TLDR after each section for more in depth details Or a very broad TLDR at end The Drone CON 1 Horse Fly is Work Horses last mile delivery drone launched from their delivery vehicle Sounds great in theory and this is exactly what we expected the future to hold right Sure As a consumer though do you really want your package to be dropped in your front yard https youtu be 05BaPqBXNT0 t 207 and have to walk to pick up your package or have a person put in literally in front of your door A loud drone is also a huge HEY COME STEAL MY PACKAGE alarm 1 Horse Fly Me the OP being a student Pilot I knew about airspaces and can Horse Fly even fly in the majority of US Airspace Turns out they actually can they claim on their website they have worked with the FAA to obtain permission which is a major PRO As stated on their website The HorseFly system is designed to conform to the FAA guidelines for UAV operation in the U S 1 However you cannot really use this system in any densely populated area like new york for the simple fact you don t want drones flying around 10lb packages above thousands of humans heads all day That s a lawsuit begging to happen 2 The drone is limited to a 10lb payload this even further reduces the actual amount of packages it will be able to deliver Ultimately this drone is pretty fucking useless as it s only use is in very sparsely populated areas or small suburban areas 1 Tl dr The drones cannot be utilized everywhere in the USA which greatly restricts their abilities considering the majority of the US population lives in just a few different locations http ecpmlangues u strasbg fr civilization geography maps US 20Population 20density 202010 png anywhere dark red would likely be unable for this drone Drones are maintenance heavy and seem to still require human intervention I just cant see the ultimate viability of drones compared to a human Would be loud and attract thieves and annoy customers Continued Revenue CON 2 How will Work Horse continue to make money after i e UPS buys all the trucks they want Obviously UPS is not interested in buying the newest model every year which means no new revenue for Work Horse So what about maintenance It appears as though Work Horse contracts out maintenance through Ryder Systems https ryder com locations https ryder com locations This would imply Work Horse will not be making money from maintenance 1 Drone Maintenance I haven t found anything on their website about this but would it really be worth it for UPS to have to be constantly shipping these drones back to Work Horse for repairs and needing to keep extra drones on hand and constantly accessible Or just pay a driver who is significantly more reliable amp x200B 2 Tl dr Theres no real potential for continued revenue after workhorse sells a company their initial fleet workhorse wont be the ones doing maintenance and the customer company wont be interested in a new fleet of the newest model each year amp x200B Charging Costs CON reuters com https reuters com Did an article about workhorse charging costs Developing the battery plants and charging infrastructure to fund an electrified global vehicle fleet could require an investment of 2 7 trillion by manufacturers and governments Workhorse does not have anywhere near the required capital to build charging stations which would likely leave the cost for UPS to cover Not to mention EV doesn t change a god damn thing we will create the electricity for the EV s by burning coal LOL https www reuters com article us ups workhorse group electric vehicles ups workhorse electric van deal shows progress on charging costs idUSKCN1G61RZ https www reuters com article us ups workhorse group electric vehicles ups workhorse electric van deal shows progress on charging costs idUSKCN1G61RZ 3 T l dr Infrastructure required will likely be so significantly expensive that the cost would never be recouped over any realistic time frame from the money being saved between electricity and petroleum costs by a customer company like UPS Besides electricity on this size scale will be significantly more expensive than petroleum which just means you re consistently losing money by switching to an EV fleet amp x200B Why Q4 FY 2020 Was so high CON Sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 were recorded at 652 000 compared to 3 000 in the fourth quarter of 2019 The increase in sales was due to a higher volume of trucks produced and delivered https www globenewswire com news release 2021 03 01 2184359 0 en Workhorse Group Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Results html https www globenewswire com news release 2021 03 01 2184359 0 en Workhorse Group Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Results html The majority of this large increase was actually due to an investment workhorse made in RIDE The only quarters that will generate a profit is those that WKHS made a good investment or sold vehicles they have no recurring or stable revenue source amp x200B The MOASS MAJOR PRO This stock has a huge potential for the Mother of All Short Squeezes From marketbeat com https marketbeat com they claim 38 5 of workhorses shares are shorted This is massive and literally we just caught the shorts with their pants down https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments ns4bqz amc ceo shows us he isnt wearing pants amp x200B So why the fuck did you buy it then Because bitch do you really think Tesla would ve been able to do anything without their price surging Fuck no but the unlimited money glitch Elon discovered unlocked so many opportunities IF WKHS Gets squeezed to the moon they can raise a massive amount of capital to dump into R amp D and make their company an actual viable alternative option to petroleum vehicle fleets But as it stands now it s a really dog shit company with a dim future no scalability and no continued revenue amp x200B Overall TL DR Workhorse is a shit company in the long term and will never be able to scale appropriately given their current capital but the short term short squeeze could provide capital to make it a not shit company and allow for workhorse to build their own maintenance shops charging stations and dealerships around the US which will provide a stable revenue source amp x200B DISCLAIMER Don t sue me because of your own personal
