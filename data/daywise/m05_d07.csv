22 amp restrict sr 1 G1 Therapeutics first in class drug Cosela against most common side effect of chemotherapy myelosuppression was recently approved by FDA and no doubt has a blockbuster potential Management has positioned the company to succeed in their commercialization efforts researches clinical trials and approval process passed smoothly On March 2021 COSELA was Added to Both the NCCN Treatment Guidelines for Small Cell Lung Cancer and the NCCN Supportive Care Guidelines for Hematopoietic Growth Factors it will definitely boost it s sales Massive sell off after FDA approval has created a buying opportunity in the stock If you ever met CANCER you must know how tough it is tough to fight with it tough to watch how your beloved struggle and sometimes the only thing that can help is chemo But chemo also not easy to go through thats why you need to know about G1 Therapeutics and Cosela Investing in a start up biotech company is an absolute roller coaster clinical trials can both bring highs and lows but not in G1 Therapeutics case beacuse it s key drug COSELA trilaciclib has been approved by FDA at 02 12 2021 Simple profit taking has snowballed into a huge sell off with the stock dropping more than 40 So COSELA is the only FDA approved therapy that helps proactively deliver multilineage myeloprotection to patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer being treated with chemotherapy Myeloprotective efficacy of COSELA resulted in reductions in the incidence and duration of severe neutropenia and impacted anemia and the need for rescue interventions such as growth factors and red blood cell transfusions M yelosuppression is the most serious and life threatening side effect of chemotherapy or damage to the bone marrow resulting in reduced white blood cells red blood cells and platelets Chemotherapy induced myelosuppression may lead to increased risks of infection severe anemia and or bleeding These complications impact patients quality of life and may also result in chemotherapy dose reductions and delays To date approaches have included the use of growth factor agents to accelerate blood cell recovery after the bone marrow injury has occurred along with antibiotics and transfusions as needed By contrast trilaciclib provides the first proactive approach to myelosuppression through a unique mechanism of action that helps protect the bone marrow from damage by chemotherapy In the U S approximately 30 000 small cell lung cancer patients are treated annually Cosela s price has been set at 1 417 per vial G1 estimates that treatment will average roughly 34 000 per patient Running the numbers by management s estimates of treatable patients gets us to peak sales estimates of around 1 billion per year On June 2020 G1 announced a three year co promotion agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim biggest private owned pharmaceutical company for COSELA in small cell lung cancer in the U S and Puerto Rico G1 will lead marketing market access and medical engagement initiatives for COSELA The Boehringer Ingelheim oncology commercial team well established in lung cancer will lead sales force engagement initiatives First sales data will be released on 5 may G1 consensus price target is about 50 per share as of April 30 2021 the price is 21 07 at 04 09 21 Needham amp Company LLC sticked to their buy rating with p t of 68 which is three times higher than the current price However the stock is currently undervalued against peak sales for only one of its usages and I feel that commercial success in the next few quarters will bring a revaluation in the stock price Management has itself positioned right and has the right group of leaders to really make a name for Cosela as well as make G1 a market darling over the next few years The Company expects its current financial position to be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditures into 2023 The company is also not a one trick pony as Cosela is undergoing multiple other clinical trials in different cancers with larger addressable markets G1 also has another compound in clinical trials called Rintodestrant an oral SERD that it expects phase 2 data on in the second quarter of 2021 And the latests news BCBSNC will provide coverage for trilaciclib Cosela when it is determined to be medically necessary because the medical criteria and guidelines noted

price is going up When the price is going down no one is selling their stock We have a faith in this stock Big short players you can keep fck us I could lose more in this CLOV Where can you go 6 31 or 6 Are there any institutions and insiders following your steps So only 25 losing compared now If we win the shorts even just up to 13 00 it will be 56 profit compared now I will wait for the final results I will not fcking leave from CLOV These days the volume is less than 10 Million daily Big players you can keep manipulating the price with your personal shares I will not sell even a share to you I hope this post could help some people like me as a newbie If we stay strong no one sells their stocks Will this CLOV dead 0 volume The answer to this question is impossible which means they have

stuff today 1 We have video evidence of manipulation 2 We have the US House Committee acknowledging the presence of dark pools 3 And we found out why AMC is being attacked more than GME right now and other stocks Let s focus on number 3 WHY WAS AMC BEING ATTACKED MORE THAN ANY OTHER STOCK ON MAY 6TH ANSWER The reason is because there are over 60 Thousand Option Calls that would expire if AMC were to close over 11 That would be over 6 MILLION SHARES that would need to be bought back so if the NSCC proposal is implemented as it is should be this could propel a HELL OF A FREAKING GAMMA SQUEEZE that would then lead to a certain somebody being margin called which would lead to yes you guessed it MOASS The hedge funds cannot let the price of AMC go above 11 They really can t They wouldn t survive Period If tomorrow you re looking at your computer screen or your phone and it says AMC closed at 11 They lose That s it So Apes probably want to know what the fuck can we do Maybe you re thinking I sound like a nut but son of a bitch I m in and now you don t know what you can do Well once again in opposite day language I will tell you EXACTLY WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO The last time AMC went up all the way to 14 it happened most likely because apes got together and started trending the hashtag for AMC on Twitter It was freaking EVERYWHERE So the first thing is DO NOT SPREAD THE MESSAGE OR GET AMC TRENDING ANYWHERE Another thing hacker apes amp other institutional apes should absolutely NOT TO is use a certain way to combat SPOOFING Spoofing for those who don t know is When a person trading uses a displayed limit order to manipulate prices and obtains an improper trading advantage One must also consider Dark Pools Again Dark Pools are exchanges that are PRIVATE and NOT KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC Watch Simulate amp Trade s video to see EVIDENCE OF THEM USING DARK POOLS amp SPOOFING But you ve probably seen it all over Twitter It s all over the freaking place You ve also seen some weird shit with the VOLUME gt They are using an imperfect algorithm the allows for these random occurrences gt The thing about this computer algorithms is that they ARE FLAWED CODING gt They can be tricked And there are ways to counter this gt Those who understand the algo know this amp x200B https preview redd it nwjbj1kv7mx61 jpg width 392 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 5e52d7e241dac983d1d41ddd265bcff0d140153f They behave in tandem with us We are the attack and they are the defense They re ACT to US We strike they dodge We dodge They strike price This part will be confusing to some and really fucking abundant to those who can FUCKING NEO THIS SHIT THE BEST TIME TO BUY IS DEFINITELY NOT IN BETWEEN 11AM AND 1PM IT IS NOT WEAKEST DURING THOSE 2 HOURS GME FAIRED BETTER TODAY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ALSO ATTACKED BUT FOCUS ON THE TIMES IT WENT UP TODAY AND WHEN AMC WENT DOWN They laid off of GME and started attacking AMC with EVERYTHING THEY HAD which allowed GME to recover a bit The 2 fucking twins split up And that is likely due to 2 reasons Reason 1 I already TOLD YOU Today and Tomorrow AMC IS PRIORITY Reason 2 is the best one though Reason 2 is THE REASON WE CAN FUCKING END THIS WHOLE SHIT TOMORROW REASON 2 IS ENDFUCKINGGAME And it s all thanks to Adam They ve always been able to attack both GME and AMC aggressively but today they just couldn t keep them both down at the same time Why Resources In anticipation for all the Catalysts that BEAUTIFUL ADAM set up perfectly their resources are DRAINED They still have A LOT But they DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH Not for this WAR And that s it I m not going to lie I have calls expiring tomorrow OTM so I am biased as shit right now But I have way more fucking calls in June and even further out in 2022 I ve also already made a shit ton on calls so IDGAF about losing 5k more tomorrow I came home from a late ass day at work and wrote this shit up in under an hour because this is fucking it THIS IS FUCKING IT TENDIES HERE WE COME HEDGIES KISS MY ASS SO EVERY APE I THINK IT S ABOUT TIME WE WRAPPED THIS SHIT UP But that s just my 2 cents What do I know Apparently according to most of the hearing I nor any ape here knows a fucking thing Anyway good luck my apes I ll see you retarded sons of bitches on the moon LOVE YOU ALL amp x200B https preview redd it 7lk4rccw7mx61 jpg width 675 amp format pjpg amp

reliable place TD Ameritrade although they had futures exchange connectivity issues in 2020 and were not entirely reliable Anyways As we had heard from Vlad during the testimony in January Robinhood s goal is always to bring maximum utility to his platform and to to democratize finance Whilst democratizing finance and ostensibly giving away something for nothing we have become the product In this

Alternatively this is your market tuition if you re learning to trade And it s all determined by how much effort you put in Make your own stimulus and spread the word I currently own AMC in my free stock proceeds account it s important to do your own diligence and understand the risks again not investment advice just what I feel is best of my own financial situation This is a small table scrap in the financial system I believe that compound interest is the eigtht wonder of the world and it is amazing what a small amount of money can turn into The banks have scraped decimals points off of our money in settlement for years 2 days for a check to clear and all the other bullshit Will you settle for the double cheeseburger or will you try and grow it to rent an engagement ring or beyond I challenge YOU to grab the five dollar bill that is lying on the ground The approach is a bit like credit card churning There was a subreddit back in the day for those of you who were around then Those who don t know it is utilizing signing up for credit cards and structing debt to take advantage of credit card offers to maximize your ROI What I have done is much simpler and I have provided my unique diligence the guarantees a positive ROI Just open your app Do you have a mother father sister aunt uncle cousin friend girlfriend etc that doesn t already have a robinhood account Anyone with a social security number and meets RH s age requirement can take advantage The limit as per the documentation i ve provided is 500 per calander year per customer household You are only allowed one account The goal to abide by the law I repeat DO NOT FUN AFOUL Do not be like my college roommate who made 10 email addresses to get Quizno s coupons Seriously don t fuck around I like look at job postings for a company I m looking at and RH is hiring a lot of security experts at the moment which means they can easily catch you Additionally any shares or gains and will be lost So be sure to read the documentation if you think you are running afoul We have an opportunity to impact RH s bottom line within the scope of the law and by leveraging their own policy using our unique competitive advantage This is kind of like a magazine drive in elementary school or popcorn sales or whatever your school had if you grew up with that sort of thing I have provided a breakdown of a rough table to

ticker EHTH report positive Q1 Results on April 29th see their stock price jump 10 on April 3oth and then on that same day see their stock price drop back down to close to its open price Well I used the one wrinkle in my silky smooth brain to Value EHTH over 100 per share and Speculate that HIG Capital might be pushing the stock price down Who is eHealth eHealth is an insurance brokerage Insurance companies use brokerages like eHealth and its competitors to sell insurance to individuals families and small businesses As long as the people stay active aka pay their premiums to the insurance companies the insurance companies pay a commission over to the brokerages So the more people they enroll into a plan and the longer they stay the more they earn eHealth operates their business in two segments 1 Medicare and 2 Individual Family and Small Business The Medicare segment represents the majority of the business and constituted approximately 89 and 88 of revenue in 2020 and 2019 respectively Medicare related health insurance plans including medicare advantage medicare supplement and medicare part D prescription drug plans The biggest bulk of their business is from the Medicare Advantage Insurance Plans so I ll talk about that market really quickly Medicare Advantage is a health insurance alternative to the Original Medicare These Plans may have lower out of pocket costs than Original Medicare which is why people prefer this over the original Generally people aged 65 and older are eligible for Medicare So how big is the total addressable market Well according to their annual report there are 10 000 people on average turning 65 every day over the next ten years This translates to approximately 3 65M new potential enrollees per year eHealth and its

ticker EHTH report positive Q1 Results on April 29th see their stock price jump 10 on April 3oth and then on that same day see their stock price drop back down to close to its open price Well I used the one wrinkle in my silky smooth brain to Value EHTH over 100 per share and Speculate that HIG Capital might be pushing the stock price down Who is eHealth eHealth is an insurance brokerage Insurance companies use brokerages like eHealth and its competitors to sell insurance to individuals families and small businesses As long as the people stay active aka pay their premiums to the insurance companies the insurance companies pay a commission over to the brokerages So the more people they enroll into a plan and the longer they stay the more they earn eHealth operates their business in two segments 1 Medicare and 2 Individual Family and Small Business The Medicare segment represents the majority of the business and constituted approximately 89 and 88 of revenue in 2020 and 2019 respectively Medicare related health insurance plans including medicare advantage medicare supplement and medicare part D prescription drug plans The biggest bulk of their business is from the Medicare Advantage Insurance Plans so I ll talk about that market really quickly Medicare Advantage is a health insurance alternative to the Original Medicare These Plans may have lower out of pocket costs than Original Medicare which is why people prefer this over the original Generally people aged 65 and older are eligible for Medicare So how big is the total addressable market Well according to their annual report there are 10 000 people on average turning 65 every day over the next ten years This translates to approximately 3 65M new potential enrollees per year eHealth and its competitors all claim that the market is growing quickly and that they ve barely tapped the market In 2020 eHealth approved only 387k members approximately 1 of people eligible Its direct competitors

typically a person who posts to subreddits like this one I invest but generally buy and hold and don t really bet big on the market or particular stocks I just buy companies I like and hold them forever I don t even belong here so obviously this is not financial advice So how did I get here In 2019 I looked at my portfolio and looked at the state of the world I m a meteorologist I ve spent most of my career looking at climatological and environmental data I knew our global economy would have to make a shift to greener energy and fuel sources in the near future otherwise my portfolio wouldn t matter and we d be trading in bullets and or bottlecaps before I ever got to retire I did what any idiot would do with this information I shifted a massive amount of my portfolio to green energy in all forms on the hope that in 30 40 years it would either be a boatload of money or a bunch of kindling for our new smoke signal based communication system I didn t really do much research outside of a few Google searches I bought ICLN I bought SPWR and I bought lithium miners namely ALB and SQM https i imgur com yKU0u2K png In the last year everything has done reasonably well In the long term I m sitting at 100 or more gains on my initial investments ICLN and SPWR have had a rocky 2020 but I m still green long term It s fine but that s not why I m here I m here because SQM specifically is about to explode Catalyst ALB Q1 earnings Yesterday morning I woke up and took a daily look at my portfolio and noticed ALB taking a massive dump It s the second largest lithium producer in the world lithium prices are at all time highs Why would it be down 10 Oh yeah it reported earnings yesterday https finance yahoo com news albemarle alb earnings revenues top 111511816 html Earnings beat expectations so naturally prices are down The market doesn t make sense we all know that But damn 10 is a lot So I look a little deeper and find this nugget gt Albemarle has a volume challenge in its lithium and bromine businesses with executives saying on a call about quarterly results the company is sold out for those products for the year and it doesn t have excess inventory in stock https i imgur com 4OQuYOU png To repeat lithium prices are rising rapidly https i imgur com VJskaD7 png The second largest lithium producer in the world can t sell more lithium and take advantage of these record prices The entire lithium sector took a shit on this news for some reason This REALLY doesn t make sense Someone has to be able to capitalize here Enter SQM the world s 4 lithium producer SQM Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile mines lithium and other agricultural minerals in Chile naturally I own a relatively large stake for me a poor millennial in both because I m investing in the sector but SQM is in a hell of a unique position right now They post earnings on May 16 where they can say loud and clear WE RE STILL OPEN FOR BUSINESS BUY OUR LITHIUM So this could be an earnings play but they re also in it for the long haul They offered a bunch more stock last month for business expansions including lithium mining https finance yahoo com news shareholders chilean lithium miner sqm 153014609 html So essentially not only is their price artificially low right now they re also expanding to meet the demand while ALB is unable to And the public offering is now closed so that dilution is no longer weighing down the stock price There s even some potential for a buyout here with IG4 Capital trying to buy the majority shareholder s stake in the company https www nasdaq com articles exclusive brazilian buyout firm ig4 capital bids 24916 mln to become large shareholder in Other plays There s also some smaller plays to make maybe higher risk higher reward if they re your style Most of those are too small for WSB by market cap Lots of players in this game and all could benefit from ALB s supply shortages Even ALB is probably a good long term hold and I intend to continue holding them Obviously a company is going to keep doing well if they are sure to sell everything they produce They just won t be as good of a short term buy because they can t take advantage of their own supply shortfall Bear Case There s a bear case of course Maybe SQM can t keep up either Maybe the small cap plays do a better job of capitalizing on the supply shortfall Maybe we ll find new battery tech that puts lithium out to pasture unlikely as even newer high density solid state batteries still use lithium Even if we do SQM probably mines the minerals we need for the new tech too Positions Shares in ALB 19 SQM 101 low cap lithium producers https i imgur com 3VHPFRS png I have no exit strategies or price targets because I m bad at this and I intend to hold nearly forever That being said I believe SQM has a lot of potential as a earnings play for a quick pop or a 6 8 month hold with potential to eat into ALB s market cap while share dilution is no longer weighing down the price moving the stock into the 60 65 range by summer

and Cons, Disclaimer Using options and trading with high leverage implies massive risk This material is for educational purposes only TL DR Civilians can trade with high leverage over 6x in risk based portfolios or portfolio margin accounts There is no magic to it and the risk can be LOWER than trading at 4 6x using directional leverage CFDs or Total Return Swaps Using net credit option trades to do it increases the difficulty and requires time spent actively in the account every day the market is open The charts show you how bumpy it can be day to day More on this below Introduction Three weeks ago I posted something similar about chasing convexity and using risk management specifically hedging to increase leverage in a portfolio margin account I did not expect the smart questions and comments I got then so this is Part Three these posts started over a year ago I will provide a summary of pros and cons from trading using this approach as I am moving to new things It is unlikely to post about it anymore the topic is exhausted as far as I am concerned Prerequisites This is a list of phrases to research the best I can come up with while writing this post option pricing option strategies dynamic hedging portfolio margin TIMS margin margin stress test risk convexity weighted vega option market makers strategies long term short term capital gains tax You also need to be comfortable with macro economics financial analysis and valuation methods monetary and fiscal policy SEC FINRA exchange rules and goes without saying you need to use portfolio margin Core trade concept You need to think of cash and volatility as assets When you make a trade you swap assets stocks options futures FOPs indexes cash You can be long or short assets Your portfolio has to be designed in such a way it is balanced at spot Search delta neutral as a proxy to grasp the concept Research long short strategy That should give you examples of balancing a portfolio A lot of hedging strategies and a market maker specifically delta hedging are about protecting the PnL I look at my account from three angles 1 PnL 2 Risk margin requirements 3 Tax liability There is no freely available opportunity to structure a trade in the public markets where all three are protected from downside risk aka free lunch In order to get value from this post you need to accept that first You can however focus on two out of the three above and disregard or postpone dealing with the third My personal priority order has always been Risk Tax Liability PnL As long as you don t need to realize losses or are forced into liquidation PnL volatility can be ignored This is easier said than done you need mental game and conviction to handle the drawdowns In summary to achieve high leverage and low risk while chasing convex returns you will experience stress and delayed gratification This is the price Application You must do fundamental research analysis and identify assets that have relatively high share price are marginable experience high volatility and have a deep liquid option chain available for you to trade It is essential that you choose something with a hard floor on value NAV gt zero from an accounting point of view Examples SPY TSLA SQ GOOG FB MRNA etc An options straddle buy a call and a put contract with the same strike and expiration is the simplest example of a positive convexity risk profile You can use the put call parity formula C P S K to define a convex trade including long and short options across the term plus a position in the underlying For extra benefit you can try to define the options structure in such a way it s net credit you collect more premium from short legs expiring worthless than you pay for the long legs The long short aspect of the portfolio comes from exploring the concept of being long the underlying and short the same using options synthetic short risk reversal ratios etc Since you are not focused on delta hedging being market neutral at all times the profit comes from having a view on the underlying direction for example delta positive for a bull view The leverage is the result of managing risk Think of finance as the art of pricing risk When you add a position to your portfolio margin it will increase you collateral requirements if you take on more risk or decrease them if you achieve the opposite Leverage is just a number the ratio between the gross position value and the net liquidation value in mark to market terms of your positions One dollar of liquidation value in assets can in my case controls almost 30 dollars of market exposure long short If you got this far you should have understood already that this leverage is not linear Nor are your potential returns if the position has positive convexity like I am showing you below from my account screenshots from my Interactive Brokers TWS interface and the FundSeeder connected account Pros You can use this approach to build a bigger position that you would normally control in the market The dynamic adjustment hedging cost of transactions and time commitment plus the margin cost I am paying approximately 22bps above the 10Y treasury note rate at the time of writing must be factored in You have a certain amount of delta hedging around spot but as the account becomes larger and more complex the tradeoff between the three components mentioned above is more obvious There will be move volatility in your PnL than in your underlyings at times This is actually a con If any of the underlyings you have exposure to moves aggressively up or down you profit from it more than 1 for each 100bps move convexity If it trades sideway you should be able to get a some net credit from your premium writing Cons Any trading strategy works until it doesn t For example if rates go up or volatility across the market goes down this loses its effectiveness and operators have to adapt or experience low performance or losses A position using both stock and options which capture different levels of implied volatility across the term has to be entered over time Liquidating the account extricating yourself from the daily management can be a complex project with unmitigated risks if market moves aggressively while unwinding positions Same applies to margin calls while the broker usually does a stellar job trimming down your positions to bring the risk down it does not have the mandate to open new contracts Letting them run unsupervised in a high leverage setup can mean dealing with a small crisis now in the wrong way can set the scene for a massive blowout at the next one maybe in the next minute The skill time and mental game requirements make any succession planning difficult Finding a buddy to take over for you can lead some to posting at length on public forums Conclusion The charts are speaking for themselves High NLV volatility massive recent drawdown but no realized losses If trading tech I call them controversial stocks like me it s worth putting the past couple of weeks in context The broad index is fine All the high beta tech stuff that has no multiple support is getting wrecked Hedge Funds long retail long ARKK long Mix of unwinds and shorts pressing coupled with exogenous factors like Prime Brokers tightening control after the Archegos disaster are just amplifying the noise Fiscal and monetary policy is accommodating but the new tax policy will have an impact on high risk assets even if not enacted Fed and Treasury working well pay attention to what they do not what they say Daily Treasury Statement FRED H 8 Reopening the economy is the current theme The supply chain disruption playing on the front month of commodity futures prices is expected but you want to apply critical thinking when you hear the argument for inflation Another phrase to google and do deep research on Mainstream media is not the ideal place to get financial education This is it written in a single go I m not selling a strategy I am not an educator I am sharing because explaining things scrutinizing the HOW and WHY are the best ways I know to invite critical thinking and overcome your blind spots

all just my speculation and not financial advice I have no idea what I m talking about when it comes to stocks and I ve only been doing this for like a couple months I am not a financial advisor or professional What I am is a physician with at least some literacy though not expertise in oncology In fact I am hoping to become an oncologist once I m done with all my training Without further ado I present my first DD I was working the overnight shift at my hospital last night and was doing some late night reddit browsing when I saw someone post about INO filing a new patent and potential for a buyout from Regeneron https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments n6q9v0 regeneron rgen is rumored to be buying out ino https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments n6q9v0 regeneron rgen is rumored to be buying out ino The guy who posted it is a 5 year user and his name had MD in it so it caught my attention but he has almost no post history other than asking 4 years ago about making a career out of consulting for EPIC epic is the 1 electronic medical chart for those of you unfamiliar and anyone asking that probably 1 is actually a doctor and 2 doesn t want to work in medicine because it s toxic af and I can totally relate the sort of person who would have interest in using their knowledge and training for picking stocks instead of being a clinician not much unlike the famous Dr Burry That said his post just looked weird and sus af so I decided to do my own DD as they say Now I am not 100 sure OP above is a real doctor but I do know that I m a doctor so I should be able to interpret this ish pretty well ok just a little well right Background I open the patent application and read up on it My first impression Lol you can t treat GBM For those of you unaware GBM is a horrible horrible brain cancer read more here https en wikipedia org wiki Glioblastoma https en wikipedia org wiki Glioblastoma that is one of the few death sentences that exist in medicine I had the unfortunate experience of having not just one but two of my friends in medical school have a parent die from GBM and it was absolutely devastating to watch Because of the nature of brain cancer there s basically nothing that can be done to treat this Currently patients undergo radiation which is horribly morbid and doesn t help much Patients die within a year basically 100 of the time even with advances such as gamma knife radiation I have personally witnessed the treatment of GBM as a medical student and the prevailing sentiment is that it s basically untreatable But then I read more about their tech and the patent and wait a second this actually sounds legit So now to break down some of the science behind this Methods INO s patented tech is that they use a unique delivery system to basically deliver their drugs through impermeable membranes To put it in non doctor terms they trojan horse medicine into the walled off city of your brain Your brain is particularly difficult to treat with chemotherapy and immunotherapy two of the main methods of medical cancer treatment due to what is called the blood brain barrier Your brain is reasonably so walled off from the rest of your body to avoid bad shit getting up in there Unfortunately that means we can t get medicine up in there either In particular the medicine they have developed INO 5401 is a PD 1 inhibitor but delivered into the brain As soon as I saw PD 1 this peaked my interest hard anti PD 1 drugs are immunotherapy medications that uncloak cancer from hiding from your immune system The same mechanism of action is used in the very successful drug Keytruda aka Pembrolizumab read more here https en wikipedia org wiki Pembrolizumab https en wikipedia org wiki Pembrolizumab which has been used in other very deadly cancers like Sarcoma and Melanoma The idea of being able to use this same class of drug on a brain cancer is crazy smart and the problem until now has been delivery of that drug That s where INO comes in with their patented tech Results Go to the patent link above and click images This is the money shot MRI on left v bad cancer MRI on the right cancer is dead What Yep Their patent describes necrosis of the tissue with complete resolution Mind blowing Now I m sure this doesn t work that well in EVERY patient because response to PD 1 inhibitors is varied Most of the time it s a long shot but when it works IT FUCKING WORKS I have literally seen melanoma and sarcoma MELT away but only in some patients I have seen patients with Stage IV terminal cancer be literally cured Every GBM patient in the world should have access to this treatment Oh and did I mention the lead inventor on the patent is a pediatric neuro oncologist that worked at a very prestigious hospital in NY previously Google her Conclusion Ok so I m now convinced of the science side but how does this all equal money I go look up the study This is a phase 2 trial meaning that they are looking to see if the drug is effective phase 1 is the drug safe phase 2 does the drug work did I mention that before I was a doctor I ran clinical research studies I saunter over to clinical trials gov https trials gov the federal website where all clinical trials are listed and notice that the trial for this drug is set to be complete June 2021 The completion date is when the final patient has completed study protocol meaning they have 99 of their data and the study is essentially complete I then saunter over to google com https google com the worlds largest search engine and look for other data they have Turns out they have ALREADY PUBLISHED EXTREMELY PROMISING INTERIM DATA https www prnewswire com news releases inovio demonstrates 80 6 month progression free survival in phase 2 glioblastoma multiforme gbm study with ino 5401 in combination with pd 1 inhibitor libtayo cemiplimab 300951433 html https www prnewswire com news releases inovio demonstrates 80 6 month progression free survival in phase 2 glioblastoma multiforme gbm study with ino 5401 in combination with pd 1 inhibitor libtayo cemiplimab 300951433 html Overall survival and Progression free survival are the holy grails of results in cancer research The fact that they have 80 progression free survival less than halfway through this study is mind blowing I can only imagine what sort of data they have now considering they included an image of complete resolution of a GBM tumor on their patent But again how is it that this is gonna moon soon Well because INO just signed up to present their findings at not one but two upcoming conferences https s23 q4cdn com 479936946 files doc news INOVIO to Present at Upcoming Investor Conferences in May 2021 pdf https s23 q4cdn com 479936946 files doc news INOVIO to Present at Upcoming Investor Conferences in May 2021 pdf Dates May 12 May 18 Not just a one tiered moon shot but a two tiered moon shot Discussion In conclusion their study showing the delivery of a highly effective drug to a cancer that is otherwise a death sentence and currently has NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS is coming to an end and results are imminent Two upcoming conferences to disclose their findings I don t know what I m more excited about a potential game changing treatment for a devastating disease that has personally touched people I love or this rocket ride to the moon I like the stock I like the tech I like the implications to cancer treatment Disclosures No affiliation with any of the above companies I bought lots calls this morning I have no idea what I m doing In fact if anyone wants to tell me how to make money from this information please let me know

something for your handful of brain cells Let s quickly recap the Cyberdunk 2077 release Awesome teaser trailer 8 years ago Insane hype train accelerating over the years I mean just look at videos like this from 2019 WhatAPromoVidSoCoolDisGame https www youtube com watch v l2KozvzdKr4 Keanu Reeves Stock hits 128 Release postponed to December Stock drops to 88 rises again to 119 Release Bugs bugs bugs Bad graphics on old consoles Big shitstorm Stock dips and dips and dips and dips Now around 42 Ok just sounds like they totally botched it But did they 1 Bugs everywhere Does anyone remember the Witcher 3 release though It was also pretty buggy Ok maybe not AS much But still CD Project has a history of releasing buggy games and fixing the issues later on Witcher 3 is now one if not the most iconic RPG games Search Reddit https www reddit com r witcher comments 36ewbt official bug thread sort confidence browse Youtube https www youtube com watch v KpAGtIdANK4 or whatever to get an impression of the bugs For Cyberpunk they have plans for fixing and free DLCs already released https en cdprojektred com news cyberpunk 2077 our commitment to quality Given their history I trust CD Project to fix the game and make it one of the best 2 13 7 mio copies sold in 2020 https www cdprojekt com en wp content uploads en 2021 04 management board report on the activities of the cd projekt group and cdc projekt sa in 2020 pdf 65 This is the number of copies sold in 20 days To put this into some relation CD Project sold 20 mio of Witcher 1 2 and 3 together https www cdprojekt com en wp content uploads en 2016 03 FY 2015 results presentation pdf 4 in the whole year of 2015 the release year of Witcher 3 which was released in may so 8 months of selling Also worth mentioning Only with the pre orders https www cdprojekt com en wp content uploads en 2020 12 current report no 652020 pdf of digital distribution channels 8 mio CD Project covered all development cost of Cyberpunk 2077 as well as all marketing and promotional cost until the end of 2020 So the revenue on more than 5 mio is solely going into the pockets So overall some damn good numbers And there is still potential Consider that some degenerates like myself didn t buy the game yet but probably will when most bugs are fixed CD Project also wants to massively extend the Cyberpunk universe 3 The refunding campaign Following up to the disastrous release CD Project started a refund campaign for Cyberpunk 2077 I couldn t find the number in official documents but some sources https www ign com articles cdpr issued some 30000 refunds for cyberpunk 2077 say 30 000 copies were refunded This is 0 2 of the sold copies Doesn t look like a bad game to me I wouldn t be worried if the refund numbers would exceed 1 or more and even that is so far from where we are Sounds a lot for shitstorm and media cryout 4 The hack CD Project got hacked https twitter com CDPROJEKTRED status 1359048125403590660 And the attackers stole the source code from Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk Ok cool down Pick up your banana again CD Project gives a shit about copy protection None of their games have any because they believe that people who love the games will pay for them Their Backups weren t compromised So again just negative media coverage 5 The Witcher Is not suddenly gone The games sell and there is more in the pipeline A next gen version of Witcher 3 and an AR mobile game hunting monsters in the real world instead of throwing Pokeballs at them are announced this year You probably also watched the Netflix series in your basement missing some action of your wife and her boyfriend upstairs It was the most successful series on Netflix until then CD Project has all rights on Witcher So guess what s gonna happen when the second series is released in August 6 The financials I don t want to overload your brain cells Just let me tell you the company is rock solid Liabilities could be paid right away Net margin of gt 30 since 2015 If you think you can handle more numbers check the report https www cdprojekt com en wp content uploads en 2021 04 consolidated financial statement of the cd projekt group for 2020 pdf 7 Conclusion It seems to me that the sky high anticipation paired with the disappointment was the best food for the media journalists click baiters and everyone who could profit from a dramatic coverage And boy they did If it was such a bad game more people would have used the refund campaign so it was probably trashtalked it into oblivion That s why the numbers speak a different language Cyberpunk seems to be a success and the Witcher was always gonna continue So looking at the whole picture what has happened what is going on and what is coming I can only see this stock going upward 8 Positions Holding 30 87 08 30 74 49 and now bought another 30 47 27 TL DR Cyberpunk was financially a huge success despite the bad media coverage The Witcher will fuel the rockets with a Witcher 3 overhaul a mobile AR game release and the second season on Netflix Solid financials Ticker is OTGLF If you find anything about the short interest that would be something interesting to look at too I just found this https otcshortreport com company OTGLF stating that the daily percentage of volume shorted in April in some days was lt 2 and some days gt 96 Can anyone with a brain help me Do your own DD and

DD ET First off I don t write DD s However a user in the daily thread questioned my commitment to r wallstreetbets So here we go Fuck you for making me do homework Also I m not going to mention short interest because you should invest in shit for better reasons my personal opinion Energy Transfer ET Background Lets start this bitch by telling you who these guys and gals are ET is basically a pipeline company that move processes and stores natural gas They also do similar shit with crude oil ET has great diversity in their portfolio with no single segment contributing more than 30 of the Partnership s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the three months or full year ended December 31 2020 The vast majority of the Partnership s segment margins are fee based and therefore have limited commodity price sensitivity Lets get the bad shit out of the way ET built itself into one of the largest midstream energy companies However being a big dawg comes with big risks They became a financial regulatory and political liability So when that nastiness with the Dakota Access Pipeline happened they got hit pretty hard and a judge ordered a review HOWEVER the army is allowing the pipeline to stay open during the review which should last till March 2022 ET owns a lot of shit Only provider with export facilities on both the U S Gul Coast and East Coast Owns the largest above ground oil facility in the U S controlling interests in Sunoco LP 100 of Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations L P the general partner of USA Compression Partners L P 100 of Lake Charles LNG which owns an LNG import terminal and regasification facility 9 400 miles of natural gas transportation pipelines 3 natural gas storage facilities in Texas 12 200 miles of interstate natural gas pipelines 36 4 of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline 60 of the Bayou Bridge Pipeline 50 of the Florida Gas Transmission pipeline 100 of the Trunkline Pipeline Transwestern Pipeline Panhandle Eastern Sea Robin Pipeline Revolution Pipeline and Mariner East Pipelines 32 6 of the Rover Pipeline Renewable stuff if you re into it 20 of electrical energy purchased by ET originates from

Developments Operational In January 2021 the first Very Large Ethane Carrier VLEC was loaded under ET s joint venture with Satellite Petrochemical USA Corp Orbit Gulf Coast NGL Exports LLC The Seri Everest the world s largest VLEC departed from Orbit s newly constructed export facility at our Nederland Terminal in Nederland Texas as the largest single shipment of ethane to date In December 2020 the Partnership completed the expansion of its Nederland Terminal LPG facilities to increase its export capabilities Also during the fourth quarter of 2020 the Partnership completed a new 20 inch pipeline directly linking its fractionation and storage facilities in Mont Belvieu Texas to its Nederland Terminal In October 2020 the Partnership released its Community Engagement Report which highlights ET s business achievements and safety programs as well as its stakeholder outreach and community investment initiatives Strategic In February 2021 the Partnership announced the acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners LP Enable in a 7 2 billion all equity transaction In November 2020 the Partnership announced its first ever dedicated solar power contract which will reduce the Partnership s environmental footprint by integrating alternative energy sources when economically beneficial The Partnership continues to increase its focus on near and long term alternative energy projects aimed at reducing its environmental footprint throughout its operations In February 2021 the Partnership announced the creation of a new group that will focus on alternative energy initiatives With the addition of ethane export facilities at our Nederland Terminal the Partnership now owns two of the three U S ethane export terminals and is the only company with export facilities on the Gulf Coast and East Coast Financial In January 2021 ET announced a quarterly distribution of 0 1525 per unit 0 61 annualized on ET common units for the quarter ended December 31 2020 The distribution coverage ratio for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 3 30x As of December 31 2020 Energy Transfer Operating L P s ETO s 6 00 billion revolving credit facilities had an aggregate 2 79 billion of available capacity and the leverage ratio as defined by its credit agreements was 4 31x Energy Transfer completed 2020 with full year Adjusted EBITDA of 10 53 billion which was above the high end of estimates provided in August 2020 For 2021 the Partnership expects Adjusted EBITDA to be 10 6 billion to 11 0 billion excluding any contribution from the recently announced Enable acquisition For the year ended December 31 2020 the Partnership spent approximately 3 05 billion on growth capital expenditures The Partnership expects to spend approximately 1 45 billion on growth capital expenditures in 2021 including approximately 250 million of 2020 growth capital that was deferred into 2021 The fee based cash flow contributes to 95 of their EBITDA The fees come from transport and storage fees duh Insider Ownership 14 5 as of Dec 2020 which is pretty significant Average Daily Volume 17 86 mil so pretty liquid But has bee above the average lately due to the blowout earnings Last

Median 11 71 Morningstar 5 stars 18 Why I think it s good I m getting bored so I m going to keep this part short I think ET is good because they have a strong balance sheet and are starting to rebound

after 2 today didn t write my homework edition ,No unique stock DD this week guys I had a senior moment and my brain was a day off Probably for the best because this market is off the rails broken right now anyways Literally down is up and up is down amp x200B Instead let s do an update on the Nrd ETF for the month I ll go over some of my trades and as I have time maybe read how some of you played them and offer some not financial advice on how to optimize the plays amp x200B For those who want to go to the original discussion you can find it here https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments n225dj because people keep asking the nrdrage etf may I ll quote box the positions below and then go into it amp x200B gt My long list both established positions and sentiment momentum trades I ll make 1 CLNE Positions established look at DD 2 MA 3 BABA Positions established look at DD 4 BE Positions established look at DD 5 CAT Positions re established today in fact July 230c s that I timed perfectly 6 EXPE 7 AAPL 8 ALGN 9 PSFE Positions established earlier 10 CVX 11 ENPH Positions established today 12 TSCO Positions established 13 CAR Positions established 14 KMI September 18s 15 BB Positions established see DD gt The Short watch list gt gt Note that when it comes to shorting I do a lot more scalping and very short term swing trading May is typically a month of low volume so you have to be agile Puts are generally 2 steps out of the money at open Do your own DD This is also not a complete list just a daily watch list of companies that I feel are going to fare roughly or whom have typically underperformed this time of year This is also not a short and hold list If you don t know what I m saying you should stay away from these 1 TSLA Established today an average cost basis of 712 11 2 UPST 3 TWTR Established April 28th 66 08 4 CLOV always good for an intraday scalp when the capuchins go full retard 5 SPCE 6 PTON 7 TSM 8 BLNK 9 GS Established yesterday 10 PINS 11

ugly Volume completely dried up which gave the shorts free rein to walk it down into oblivion all week They had an earnings call on Thursday which was actually quite good missed on top line EPS but beat on revenue upgraded forward guidance and opened up more about the 1 5bln AMZN contract which sounds better and better the more I hear about it It actually traded up for a while this morning but then just got absolutely assaulted the rest of the day because everybody was sitting it out I ve averaged down hard on this one at this stage to make sure that I m always within a day or two s striking distance of at least breaking even on the June calls I have started buying September calls at the same 13 strike I also started buying up more shares at 8 85 this afternoon I love a sale I m going to re evaluate how I feel about the June calls in the coming week Given that this stock has had 6 red days out of 7 any moves I make right now would be reactionary Further one interesting thing I noticed was that in the last 5 or 10 minutes or so other whale buyers showed up HARD at the 8 79 price For a stock who s order book all day was just a series of 3 digit and low 4 digit offers to see 50 000 share bids show up tells me that the shorts who had been fucking this thing all week were covering AND the buyers were coming back in probably the same assholes who shorted it 2 MA I m still yet to open a position here I just haven t liked the price action and the charts have been very choppy If you ve played it let me know how it worked out for you Looking back at the weekly I see some openings NOW but they weren t real clear in the moment 3 BABA I took the opportunity at 226 to finish filling out my call position as referenced in the last solo stock DD I know I said in that DD it was impossible to screw up but apparently I underestimated the internet some because I ve had people messaging me saying they bought in at 234 and are down and feeling pain when I explicitly said not to buy at those levels It s interesting to me that the Chinese stocks which are universally accepted to be underpriced are moving in sympathy with domestic growth stocks That s broken 4 BE Bought more August 31 s on Thursday when it was at the bottom Sub 20 was too good of an equity price to pass up I really liked the price movement on it yesterday and today Their earnings call was SPECTACULAR and their leadership said all the right things I feel really good about this one to finally start moving independently of the rest of the green energy sector Loser for right now but I m not getting shaken out 5 CAT Those July 230 s were made of latinum Closed out today for fat profits I consider this trade over until CAT comes back down into the 220 s 6 EXPE Bought in yesterday morning Closed my position at about 2 pm EST today I sat on this trade a little too long and left about 3 a share on the table but profit is profit It was a very nice trade This trade is closed 7 AAPL I never actually got into my long position I closed my pre existing short on Tuesday and have been eyeing an entry but haven t found one I like yet 8 ALGN In Tuesday 575 ish out today at 600 Trade is closed 9 PSFE As discussed in last week s post I ended up removing this because the apes started trying to meme stock it and I replaced it with CVS which has made me enough tendies to spring for the top shelf lube for when I fuck The CVS trade is still ongoing and a good one to eye an entry IMO 10 CVX Jumped in Monday and I m still in the trade I like the movement on this one Still a good trade to enter IMO 11 ENPH I m upside down on this one largely because I ve been unwilling to average down on it My bags aren t super heavy but I do have some Samsonites right now Going to just store it away and let it marinate The price action is still downwards here so if you re eyeing this one let it come in further 12 TSCO The price action on this has been amazing I ve actually been holding this for quite some time so my entry is way in the rear view mirror But I love how smoothly it s run and feel it s still got a lot more room to till 13 CAR This is another one I ve been holding forever and just don t want to create a taxable event on The price action has generally been flat if you remove the fact they had earnings this week and we all know what earnings means in this market I still like this one for a buy and hold 14 KMI We don t talk about KMI But if you re interested maybe go look at a chart because it ll make you wet 15 BB I haven t done anything with this and honestly couldn t even tell you how it s performed Probably poorly amp x200B The shorts 1 TSLA I jumped in at 712 11 Everybody in the daily told me I hated money I got out at 666 even though I was swearing up and down it was going to 650 The price action just looked like it was turning so I took tendies Then it went to 650 like I thought it would Could have done it better but profit is profit I m eyeing a re entry to the short side on this one I m thinking 685 690 I ll likely re establish 2 UPST My most reliable short I m twenty some dollars a share in the green already and still holding 3 TWTR It s been SUUUUUPER choppy this week I got out at 52 80 for a nice gain but I ve hated the price action Staying away from here on out 4 CLOV Never had a good opportunity to play it Still watching 5 SPCE Death taxes and SPCE tanking Still holding for a modest gain with stop losses in place Been pretty flat Probably still a good short if you can time it 6 PTON God bless that Shortbus All Star kid who got eaten by the treadmill Lambo squad trade Closed out and consider the trade done unless I see it in the mid 90 s again 7 TSM Never entered I thought I had a price target in mind but I wussed out at the last moment Doesn t matter Theta Semi living up to its name 8 BLNK 30 gain I ll look for re entry at 35 9 GS Defying the odds Trimmed my position to hedge losses but this one isn t working out so far Will look for weakness to re establish in full 10 PINS Closed half my position at 60 for a nice gain Holding the other half with tight stop losses but I m optimistic it s got further to fall 11 BMBL I missed it Kicking myself for it too I knew it was gonna fall Not sure how much downside is left 12 EGHT Oh the sweet sound of an equity dying This one is printing for me hard and I think it s still got another 3 4 dollars to the downside in it 13 MDB See EGHT Exact same story 14 PCG Riding it down like a submissive whore I ll probably run this one the entire month Printing nicely still plenty of room to drop 15 DASH LAMBO SQUAD Oh man this one has been magnificent And it s still got downside Fair value IMO is 80 It ll never hit it but I think 110 is entirely doable 16 GRUB Reliable gainer to the downside but not as nice as DASH Still holding 17 WORK Quietly dropped on no news Just shows how broken the market is because the buyout price is baked in I was following this so I could see news to potentially short CRM but none came CRM however fell nicely on the week but I wasn t there to catch it Trade is likely running out of breath 18 CAN Never entered it which is sad because it could have been a good gainer I ll rectify that mistake on some upwards momentum 19 BYND Yacht squad What an amazing loser Still holding I want to see 95 20 AFRM I love the concept but I hate the business model This one has been a great gainer for me but I want to see 44 Still room to drop 21 COUR Inadvertent earnings play Didn t realize t hey were reporting this week Happy accidents 2 bagger excellent play I covered this afternoon I think there s probably still another 10 to the downside possible but I actually like the model and don t want to tempt fate This trade is closed to me 22 HEP Got in and got out at dead even Thought I had a good entry but then things got choppy and weird Removed it from my watch list This trade is dead to me with a draw 23 CSCO never entered Which is good because it s run up I m eyeing an entry 24 PLNT Another great winner I wanna see another 4 dollars to the downside Trade still live 25 QS Patently obvious this was gonna drop like a rock Ask me when it s at 10 and I ll probably still be shorting it 26 WMT I got cute and walked into a flat trade Will exit next week win lose or draw 27 ADT Took the L here Entered at 9 27 got scared off this afternoon with a small loss Took it off my watch list trade is dead to me 28 TW RTX COF NOC ADM AAL WHR LUMN didn t enter any of these COF AAL and WHR are the only ones I m even still tracking The others are dead to me amp x200B

players of Wall Street Real Estate prices Home prices are hitting record highs Record low supply of homes New listings selling on average in just 18 days also a record pace 48 of buyers are confident now is the right time to buy real estate Where are these people getting the money from you ask By taking MORTGAGES High lumber prices high copper prices high home prices Yup all that money comes from mortgages Power to those who buy houses with cash but most of the people need a mortgage And guess who is in the mortgage business You betcha UWMC RKT s earnings were a dissaster UWMC s will too Ummm did you know Mat Ishibia the CEO of UWMC gave an ultimatum about a month ago that brokers must choose who they want to work with Either RKT or UWMC Guess whom they picked Listen to the CEO out of my

but in the real world where you actually do get to drive a lambo consistent predictable income like dividends are a big deal You see UWMC pays 0 40 per year for every share you own This is fixed It does not matter how much the stock price is However what matters is that you dividend yield depends on the price you pay to acquire those shares Confused Let me give you an example 0 40 dividend per share UWMC at 10 a share 4 00 annual dividend yield 0 40 dividend per share UWMC at 9 a share 4 44 annual dividend yield 0 40 dividend per share UWMC at 8 a share 5 00 annual dividend yield 0 40 dividend per share UWMC at 7 a share 5 71 annual dividend yield WE ARE HERE 0 40 dividend per share UWMC at 5 a share 8 00 annual dividend yield 0 40 dividend per share UWMC at 3 a share 13 33 annual dividend yield 0 40 dividend per share UWMC at 1 a share 40 00 annual dividend yield Basically it s a gift from heavens to be able to buy a dividend paying stock at low levels because you are locking in a higher return Now some of you smartypants will say don t buy a stock just for the dividend and I agree In some cases when the company does not generate cash flow they will have trouble paying the dividend and will be forced to cut it However UWMC has no problem with cash flow meaning 0 40 dividend per share is here to stay for the foreseeable future Fun fact RKT pays no dividend Institutions know this They care about predictable stream of cash a k a dividends BlackRock knows this hence why they reported on May 2 owning 11 15 of UWMC s float https preview redd it s4oibshivrx61 png width

deceive opponents I know what you beginners fear What if my stock goes to zero Do you hear yourself America s largest wholesale dividend paying mortgage broker soon to join Russell 1000 going to zero Are you that dumb Did Wall Street pros managed to fool you that much Remember bluff stories like We covered on GME No you did not The stock ain t going below 100 and it s been months since you covered AMC is going bankrupt No it s not It went up 348 since January 2021 UWMC is worthless You should buy real estate at all time highs let s us buy this shitty dividend paying stock that s going to zero Are you gonna fall for it again Mathematical pressure You see when you deal with single digit stocks like AMC at 2 in January 2021 GME at 5 in August 2020 there is a point at which there is just no meat left There is only a bone You can t short stock into an oblivion There is nothing left to short You are running a risk At some point the rewards from going long way outweigh the risk of going short on a beaten down stock Melvin did not understand this concept and that s why he lost billions Simple as that You wanna buy low and sell high Not short sell low and buy to cover high Summary UWMC America s largest wholesale mortgage lender is at all time lows Real estate is at all time highs UWMC is paying dividend 5 7 is the yield at the current share price RKT is not UWMC issued an ultimatum

Business Microsoft is a technology titan focused on commercial and industrial applications with software and solutions such as Office 365 Azure Microsoft Teams Dynamics 365 Linkedin Windows 10 They also provide platforms for developers via Visual Studio Code and Github A smaller segment of Microsoft are their devices and their games division powered by Xbox Next Moves Healthcare Applications The healthcare sector is characterized by massive bureaucracy and opportunities for growth It is one of the rare sectors where real future growth is possible by innovation Microsoft has established itself as a corporate and industry suite but now it seems that they are taking their whole Eco system and moving on the healthcare industry This is pure speculation but it can be one of the boldest moves yet as healthcare facilities operations education training quality control are large complex systems that can benefit from the tools and services that the company offers We have seen Microsoft positioning for a certain client type and taking over most of their business As the opportunities for growth in the corporate sector decrease Microsoft might just turn to one of the most complex industries with high barriers to entry and large upfront investment costs On 11 April 2021 they entered into an agreement to acquire Nuance Communications for 56 per share or 19 7 Billion Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence AI software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience and the acquisition will build on our industry specific cloud offerings This is effectively their foot in the door to the healthcare industry Value I think that the company is trading around its intrinsic value with potential for growth in the future There is inflation related market risk that can push down value but with proper management and pricing flexibility they can at least sustain current value levels Microsoft solidified the cloud for the corporate amp business sector and decreased the risk of their sales by adopting a continuous subscription model for most of their services Their business model seems to be growth trough innovation as they are positioning themselves precisely in segments where innovation is lacking and are integrating those segments within their high barrier to entry complex systems Product Breakdown AZURE The backbone of the productivity suite for most of the western corporations Office Stabilized revenues for essential business tools Windows 10 Declining bloatware built upon old architecture LinkedIn Well positioned profitable social network with long term commuted users Dynamics Viva A major competitor for CRM ERP market share with potential for innovation PowerApps The future tool for cutting operating expenses and bureaucracy for companies Devices Uncertain potential for a better experience for Windows users Augmented reality done right with industry application GitHub VS Code The platforms that will keep MSFT on the cutting edge of development tech Gaming Xbox Large but risky potential for growth if the devices and games are improved Microsoft has a wide and complex set of products and services which can be understood as cost cutting tools for businesses system architecture utilities productivity and effectiveness tools They have created a well thought off interconnected Eco system that is nothing like the company was even five years ago It is now apparent that they are well positioned as a market leader for industrial and business applications and will further solidify their position in the future Competition We are already witnessing the convergence of competitive advantages between the technology titans of Amazon Google Microsoft Facebook and it is clear that all of them are fighting for market share in similar technologies and industries It seems that every company is fighting for their specific industry positioning within technology For example Facebook Microsoft and Google all experiment with Virtual Reality tools such as Google Glass Oculus Rift and the HoloLens Headset from Microsoft However MSFT seems to be the most successful as it is positioning for industrial military and hybrid workspace applications for the headset the others had less luck in the consumer gaming sector application of VR Google Amazon and Microsoft are likewise competing for cloud dominance where Amazon AWS is positioning as a cost effective player for developers MSFT is positioning as a stable and secure platform for companies and Google is positioning as an advanced cutting edge option for new technologies and companies that are able to scale The last example is between MSFT and GOOGL where they competed for the use of virtual conference apps driven by the new hybrid work culture from the pandemic Both of the competitors had a variant starting off MSFT had Skype Teams and Google had Hangouts Meet It is evident that Microsoft had the right approach with Teams and took over the commercial sector for online communication Side note Skype is a drain on the Microsoft brand since the appearance of the pretend close feature It is irredeemable and should be retired DISCLAIMER I do not own a MSFT position I am planning to go long on MSFT next week THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL I AM NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT YOUR GOALS AND SITUATION
