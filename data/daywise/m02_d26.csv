know Scotts Miracle Gro was the main financial supporter of push to legalize weed in New Jersey https mjbizdaily com scotts miracle gro leads funding to legalize adult use cannabis in new jersey gt The Scotts Miracle Gro Company has emerged as the primary financial backer of New Jersey s cannabis legalization effort donating 800 000 to two campaign committees formed to back the Nov 3 ballot question that would amend the state constitution to allow cannabis to be bought and sold for recreational use gt Our viewpoint cannabis legalization Forty six states have now elected to end prohibition of cannabis and adopt alternative means of regulating its production and distribution within their jurisdiction Their ultimate objective is responsible production distribution and consumption of cannabis and combating illegal drug abuse There are now roughly 15 000 licensed cannabis businesses in the United States 200 000 people employed in the industry and more than 2 million medical cannabis patients served by the industry We believe the time has come for the United States to create a legal marketplace as other countries have already done Given the current political backdrop however we recognize this is unlikely in the near term That is why we believe at a minimum Congress should honor the principles of federalism and states rights by passing legislation that respects the will of voters and state legislatures that have elected to adopt their own approach to authorizing the use of cannabis within their boundaries We also believe the federal government should allow this industry to function like any other business This means state licensed cannabis businesses should have access to banking and other financial services operate with the same tax structure as other businesses and not be threatened by federal prosecution if they comply with state laws They got what they wanted 3 days ago New Jersey governor signs law decriminalizing marijuana use for those 21 years and older https amp cnn com cnn 2021 02 22 politics new jersey marijuana legalization index html Further in markets where cannabis is legal it allows law enforcement resources

were for possession crimes which generally involve only small amounts of cannabis Prior to any state legalizing adult use cannabis states spent a combined 3 6 billion per year enforcing cannabis

the good ol days before segregation where ice cream cones were a nickel and muscle cars were an icon of the era Cool Edit Segregation is not cool But muscle cars are Kinda I mean I d drive a 2006 CTS V if I could afford one Anyway cool I can think of two particular American auto manufacturers which were popular at the time Ford and GM Yes there is Tesla but Biden is a boomer or maybe even older And I forget what comes after two anyway so Ford GM and whatever comes after And what s more is Ford and GM are already cozy with the U S government meaning that both have already received either large government contracts or and bailouts And President Biden is a bona fide G Man and good ol boys tend to do business together Case in point I did not know this until writing this DD but oh look Oshkosh Truck has the USPS contract to build all the new Electric Vehicles and who is sourcing them materials fucking Ford When asked if the sub systems are engines and might Ford have a piece of the contract as an engine supplier Quigley said The vehicle will be built from the ground up by Oshkosh to fulfill the unique needs of the postal service We will share more information about the supply

administration is ALSO printing a fat fucking 1 7T stimmy contract for EV charging stations too and other things Biden s 1 7 trillion clean energy plan includes more than 500 000 new EV plugs nationwide by the end of 2030 along with new tax credits and incentives for EV purchases https mashable com article biden electric vehicle charging adoption https mashable com article biden electric vehicle charging adoption All part of the Biden Clean Energy Plan here https joebiden com clean energy https joebiden com clean energy Why else do I think Ford or and GM will get EV and EV charging station government stimmy contracts Because Ford and GM have UNIONS And Boomers fucking Love Unions and according to the administration s Clean Energy Plan any company which has a union or will form one seems likely to receive Uncle Sam s rich uncle money Auto Industry Create 1 million new jobs in the American auto industry domestic auto supply chains and auto infrastructure from parts to materials to electric vehicle charging stations positioning American auto workers and manufacturers to win the 21st century and invest in U S auto workers to ensure their jobs are good jobs with a choice to join a union Transit Provide every American city with 100 000 or more residents with high quality zero emissions public transportation options through flexible federal investments Yes it s the lowest bidder which gets contracts but they Have to be American through and through and probably have to be a Union shop which certainly narrows down the choices of companies even eligible to bid So let s take this from the top Government owns the money printers Government gives out stimmy in the form of government contracts Biden is replacing all government fleet vehicles with EVs about 650 000 https www government fleet com 301786 federal vs state local fleets https www government fleet com 301786 federal vs state local fleets Biden is a Boomer Boomers love their Ford and GM brands Biden is a G man Ford and GM have already gotten the G And like a horny ex Big Government prooobably wants to give them The Big G again possibly at the same time e g multiple simultaneous contracts giggity because EVs EV infra and unions are sexy Also Ford is already a supplier to the USPS EV stimmy contract And now the government needs to charge all these fucking granola EVs but there s not enough infra Well there s stimmy for charging stations in this admin too The Biden Admin is also printing stimmy contracts for EV chargers 500 000 by 2030 And GM has a kinky new partner who has been working out EVgo which has already built out EV charging infrastructure and is also going public Q2 2021 And I don t want to speculate but if EVgo unionized President Biden would have to worry about more than just ice cream stains on his suit pants and EVgo would have to worry about what to do with all of rich Uncle Biden Uncle Sam s money What I mean is GM might also be able to be a part of the EV charging contract like Ford is a part of the USPS EV contract or maybe GM gets an infra contract and is EVgo s sugar daddy Again I ve noticed a pattern the government has a ton of fucking money they even print the money shit they even own the money printers follow the money anticipate the money stonks only go up and if you choose the right stock stonks go Way up like private utility bills

get it now It s not one or the other squeeze It s all of them together driving each other Congress just had them testify about round 1 but they don t even know round two is gonna bigger They turned the issue into even more discussed worldwide news That may not be the catalyst but it is aerosolized fuel in an enclosed space ready for a spark The Armageddon only statistically possible but completely unimaginable scenario we re heading towards We all know the shorts exceed the number of available shares and the original SHORT SQUEEZE thesis But now we have the GAMMA SQUEEZE taking part Retail figured out how to counter synthetic shorts by forcing institutions to honor call options Every call option that has been written and is in the money MUST purchase shares in the open market even though THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH SHARES IN EXISTENCE TO DO THAT And not just the shares in the market This would mean the entire share count held by hedges and clearing houses being transferred to retail and etf ownership through options being exercised Retail countered the naked shorting in way that not only negates it but exponentially increases the squeeze process It ll be like using a market order to cover a short squeeze gobbling up any share no matter the cost remember the 5k snipe orders last time except at a market wide level the entire float PLUS forced shares bought for ITM contracts How much can something cost when it doesn t exist but HAS to be bought The ultimate lesson in supply and demand It ll be like taking the strength of pliers and adding a hydraulic press We were all looking at it like round one Over extended hedgie shorts vs retail holders forcing a cover But the dynamic has evolved to a MULTI FACETED INFINITE SQUEEZE CYCLE This is the moon play This makes that AI suggestion of 130k a share make sense I m not saying the AI is right necessarily in terms of price I am saying it s gonna take a deeper look at what happens when institutions owe more than they can t deliver and resulting price movement further exacerbates the original step The machine takes information and EXTRAPOLATES It went to 5k when it was retail using available shares to force shorts to cover How multiplied can it get when that happens again while institutions are forced to buy 100 share lots for contracts There won t be enough open shares on the market They ll have to sell their own to the option holders just to honor them They ll have to buy more from other brokers and clearing houses having the same problem And all of this is compounded even further because the higher this drives the stock the more option contracts are ITM more forced buying and giving their own shares more squeezes more contracts ITM repeat repeat repeat repeat That s the important part Not just the squeezes The cycle Because it s self perpetuating past a certain point like a dying star reaching the critical mass it takes to become a black hole I saw someone even mention that once and I didn t understand but they were right It would literally crash the stock market and effect all foreign markets involved An upwards crash that sucks all capital from the largest players I see people mentioning rational thought or rational behavior of the stock But it s not rational Holding something beyond its suggest value breaks with the notion of rational value systems It s mass irrational behavior to cause extreme hyperbolic stock movement I feel like hyperbolic is the right word over parabolic You know how when you buy a call it technically has the potential for unlimited gain because the stock can theoretically go up infinitely This is exactly that situation being played out on a grand scale I think it s kind of amazing because this is the defining characteristic of using the the stock market instead of gold It increases the amount of perceived wealth beyond the physical capabilities of the world There s not enough gold or precious metals to equal the world economy It s made up to represent something that can t exist but is necessary to facilitate the notion of unlimited growth And now that very same principle may be inadvertently used to either destroy the system or force an evolution of financial theory The entire point of this idea is that the mechanics are being broken by players refusing to acknowledge parameters They learned to cheat the system back at us the first time Shorts are creating shorts of shorts They don t exist They re making unlimited shares to maintain their position So buyers are gonna do the same thing but purposely do it in an arena that can t be expanded indefinitely They can make up the shorts they borrow back and forth with each other and through unknowing retail stock lending program participants but there are only so many real shares They are inarguably finite by definition Could they force a reverse split or force dilution by issuing new shares against shareholders and the company s will I don t know All we have to do is hold Hold on to your sense of wonder as the story plays out Hold to your courage I m not a financial advisor and don t know what I m talking about I just like this stock and stories about the end of the world I don t even care about the money that much I just want to take control of my own life I can t wait for us to read about this moment in history someday and each think about what small parts we played and how we remember it Apes together strong

become reality if Hedgies didn t overshort with fake shares more about that in a second Why do I tell you this I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended Just a heads up Those are PREDICTIONS they can be faulty at times especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things that no Data can predict again more about that in a second So please for the love of god don t harass me insult me or send me death threats when something like that happens I understand your frustration but don t target me amp x200B Now the juicy stuff What exactly happened yesterday Here is a timeline amp x200B 9 35 AM The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume Hedgefunds shorted over 18 363 000 Shares over the first 5 minutes The amount of shorting was so aggressive that trading got halted twice within the first minutes https preview redd it w8qgdhc52tj61 png width 1174 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4

brings the price down to 126 At that point in time between 5 000 000 and 7 000 000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye What stood out for me at that point in time is that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack between 100 and 125 That tells me it was really important to get the price down in that direction more in a few seconds https preview redd it

e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787 NOW THE ANALYSIS WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE So how could no one forsee this It s simple Hedgefunds didn t borrow shares to short they created them out of thin air When the market opened yesterday ALL available GME Shares to borrow were gone already see my second edit from yesterday EDIT2 10AM 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR GME RIGHT NOW THEY BORROWED OVER 2 100 000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY https fintel io ss us gme https fintel io ss us gme https iborrowdesk com report GME https iborrowdesk com report GME What does this mean Well no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now because they are not using real shares to short GME They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious If we add up the three big short attacks 18 363 000 right at opening 5 000 000 to 7 000 000 at noon and about 10 000 000 right before close we get 33 363 000 shares sold short over the day Why is this funny and obvious Check the latest FINRA report It states that yesterday more than 33 000 000 were sold short That s almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips https preview redd it d3vuakyd2tj61 png width

115 and 150 over 44 000 Call options would ve become ITM If exercised that would ve driven up the price AH PRE or today in the high hundreds maybe even thousands Why is that so bad The higher the price gets the more calls get exercised so called options chain the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical 800 mark where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next

single fuck anymore Even when all the data available states that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS You know what they say There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that s trapped in a corner and s got nothing to lose anymore That s what we re seeing right now No one can give accurate predictions anymore that is based on data This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions They don t care about the long term results of their illegal actions they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days IN SHORT BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING DON T BE SCARED OF DIPS THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES amp x200B TL DR Hedgies are so fucked that they just shorted GME with more than 33 000 000 non existent shares yesterday keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening The price would ve jumped up to a few hundred maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn t do it which would ve started the real squeeze today They have nothing to lose anymore so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don t get scared by fake dips amp x200B EDIT 1PM EUROPEAN TIME According to this site http shortvolumes com t GME http shortvolumes com t GME the short sale volume was 61 percent yesterday with a short sale volume of 50 959 384 That doesn t mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33 000 000 If it s more than that even better https preview redd it lmtsuxki0uj61 png width 830 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf amp x200B EDIT2 TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING COUNTERFEITING STOCKS HERE IS A GREAT READ http counterfeitingstock com CounterfeitingStock html text In 20the 20context 20of 20this the 20company 2C 20is 20considered 20counterfeit http counterfeitingstock com CounterfeitingStock html text In 20the 20context 20of 20this the 20company 2C 20is 20considered 20counterfeit Quote Naked Short This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares In the context of this document a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company is considered counterfeit This is not a legal conclusion since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today s rules The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares which leads to widespread stock manipulation the lynchpin of this massive fraud Returning to our example everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else s account There is no borrowed share instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC Without a borrowed share behind the short sale a naked short is really a counterfeit share amp x200B EDIT3 9 30AM THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS https iborrowdesk com report GME https iborrowdesk com report GME amp x200B EDIT4 How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares It is possible that some retail traders sold but if you take a look at the Short volume 61 yesterday with 51 000 000 shares being sold short and then take a look at the overall sell volume it doesn t add up If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 short volume the price drop would ve been much much bigger Most retail held through therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting because no one was selling amp x200B EDIT5 I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place ALMOST certain but I don t want to make false promises so please take it with a grain of salt because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date If I am able to finish it today I ll link it here as well This actually feels like a conspiracy theory because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true amp x200B Another edit to blueball you guys even more The crazy last minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight Again connecting to that specific date But that s just a theory a Game stop theory Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is amp x200B UPDATE I HAVE ALL THE DATA YOU CAN T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW 3PM EST 9PM CET amp x200B I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post If I made some mistakes or missed something feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date

out or to hold out for more money This phenomena is known as greed Knowing your greed and mastering it is knowing when you want to stop printing Sun Tzu not shang stung once said If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of a hundred battles If you know yourself but not the enemy for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat If you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle P6 tomorrow Self Psychology Trading appears deceptively easy When a beginner wins he feels brilliant and invincible Then he takes wild risks and loses everything Trading is a fascinating intellectual pursuit chess poker and a crossword rolled all into one A trader keeps odd hours and puts his capital at risk Many traders are loners who abandon the certainty of the present and take a leap into the unknown The goal of a good trader is not to make money His goal is to trade well If he trades right money follows Successful traders keep honing their skill If you become half a percent smarter each year you ll be a genius by the time you die Focus on trading right and improving your skills so that money no longer influences your emotions The trouble with winning is that many people self destruct soon after Accident prone drivers keep destroying their cars and selfdestructive traders keep destroying their accounts Traders who are not at peace with themselves often try to fulfill their contradictory wishes in the market If you do not know where you are going you will wind up somewhere you never want to be A successful trader is a realist He knows his abilities and limitations He sees what is happening in the markets and knows how to react to them Analyzes the markets without cutting corners observe your own reactions and make realistic plans Once an amateur takes a few hits and gets a few margin calls he becomes fearful instead of cocky Losers buy sell or miss trades thanks to their fantastic ideas or fears They act like children who are afraid to look under their bed Our fantasies influence our behavior even if we are not consciously aware of them A successful trader must identify his fantasies and get rid of them I lost because I didn t know trading secrets Those ladder attacks Many losers have a fantasy that successful traders have some secret knowledge this is called the brain myth Losers do not know that trading is intellectually fairly simple It is less demanding than taking out an appendix building a bridge or trying a case in court Good traders are often shrewd but few of them are intellectual Often after the amateur is sold out the market reverses and moves in the direction he expected Losers take this reversal as a confirmation of their methods They earn save or borrow enough money to open another small account The story repeats The loser gets wiped out the markets reverse A loser is not undercapitalized his mind is underdeveloped He overtrades and his money management is sloppy He takes risks that are too big whatever the size of his account A trader who wants to survive and prosper must control his losses You do that that by risking only a tiny fraction of your equity on any single trade Give yourself several years to learn how to trade Do not start with an account bigger than 20 000 and do not lose more than 2 percent of your equity on any single trade Learn from cheap mistakes in a small account Amateurs neither expect to lose nor are in any way prepared for it The notion of being undercapitalized is a cop out that helps them avoid two painful truths their lack of trading discipline and their lack of a realistic money management plan Most human activities call for an exercise of judgment Machines and systems can help but not replace humans Just look at accountants Airlines pay high salaries to pilots despite having autopilots They do it because humans can handle unforeseen events Traders who have the autopilot fantasy try to repeat what they felt as infants Their mothers used to fulfill their needs for food warmth and comfort Most people give lip service to their wish for freedom and independence But in reality they want to be relieved from the need to think for themselves Some gums call important market turns Others promote unique methods new highways to riches Still others have escaped criticism and invited cult following through the simple mechanism of departing this world The broad stock market has normally spent 2 5 or 3 years going up and 1 or 1 5 years going down A new market cycle gum emerges in almost every major stock market cycle once every 4 years A gum s fame tends to last for 2 to 3 years The reigning period of each guru coincides with a major bull market in the United States When you see a hot new guru follow their advice because sheep are following him and you can ride the wave but get out while the sheep still follow Everybody wants a dark model or a woman with a birthmark on her face A model does not change public tastes do Institutional employees play it safe and never achieve spectacular results because each uses similar methods a guru is surrounded by a mob of admirers If you ever find yourself in such a crowd notice that a guru is seldom asked questions about his theory His admirers are content to drink in the sound of his voice They brag to their friends about having met him A guru remains famous for as long as the market behaves according to his theory usually for less than the duration of one 4 year market cycle The market changes and marches to a different tune When you recognize that a successful new gum is emerging it is profitable to jump on his bandwagon It is even more important to recognize when a guru has reached his peak When the media takes notice time to inverse Mass psychology being what it is new gums will certainly emerge An old cycle gum never fully comes back Once he stumbles the adulation turns to derision and hatred An expensive vase once shattered can never be fully restored Losers look for a strong leader They look for a parent like omniscient provider They walk with their umbilical cords in hand looking for a place to plug them in As an intelligent trader you must realize that in the long run no guru is going to make you rich You have to work on that yourself Read Dr Alexander Elders work

and mapped out the OPEN and CLOSE of the market during the last squeeze as well as included charts to that may help us in forecasting what may happen in the following days I wanted to compare that event to the current one to perhaps extrapolate some patterns behind the charts I found some interesting things while doing so and I though I would share All of this is routine for a lot of people who read charts but for those that aren t so great at doing so I figured this would help Maybe others can extrapolate some bonus data Down below is a chart that shows how volatile the days were leading up to the shut down by RH We can also see that the further the pull back was the higher the recovery was when it rebounded back up For example the downtrend between 1 27 and pre market 1 28 led to the price going to 490 on the pre of the 28th something that would have shot up like a rocket if it weren t for the halts by brokers amp x200B DAY DATE OPEN MACD CLOSE MACD AH OPEN PM CLOSE WED 1 20 2021

properly run its course so those numbers are irrelevant If you notice you see that some days blasted off while others dipped we quickly forgot how much of a roller coaster it was so this should ease your mind DIPS ARE NORMAL EVEN NEAR THE PEAK OF THE EVENT Yes dips will happen and they are normal so don t freak out when they occur diamond hand that shit because when they go up they go up big Now I took some screenshots that will help us compare some key dates taken at a Month view with 1 Hour Candles First we have this image of 1 20 1 25 amp x200B https preview redd it xwh53s43ltj61 jpg width 1373 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 0b98af0b100849f7ae3f2488ff814486e762ad55 If you notice the MACD is about to cross above the Signal line now I m no expert but these lines help us understand if the market is gonna be bullish or bearish trend You can see the lines dance a bit with one another pulling away and crossing every once in a while but overall they stay in the same range THAT IS until the 22nd during the premarket we see that the lines cross into bullish territory in a big way You can also note that they had a good pull back after the first day of the squeeze which is currently where we found ourselves yesterday SO THIS IS A GOOD THING PULL BACKS ARE HEALTHY AND AS WE CAN SEE ABOVE ITS WHAT WE WANT TO SEE We can compare this to the days leading up to today If you look at the chart below you can see that the lines dance with one another we have pretty much traded sideways just like the chart above until the last couple days when we crossed over and under We can use this to identify and compare the beginning of this squeeze or rather map it out to the last one and possibly give a rough forecast of what may happen in the upcoming days amp x200B https preview redd it kqxeihybltj61 jpg width 1375 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 2f6d68d8cf8624fcb41b42ac854a5230753bf4c3 As you can see the MACD just flew past the Signal line indicating that we are in bullish territory before crossing again and bringing down the price Now one thing that sticks out out to me is the size of the gap between lines on 2 24 it looks almost double in size to the last 1 20 1 25 cross and rise in price Another thing to note is the fact that the last immense rise took a couple days while this one rose in less than a day which explains the size of the MACD gap As you can see below the MACD would make shorter bursts up and down as the days kept going consolidating into an explosion we saw in the premarket of the 29th when RH and OTHER BROKERS ALL RESTRICTED BUYS DONT FORGET THAT RH WASNT THE ONLY ONE TO DO IT amp x200B https preview redd it i35fpkp7ltj61 jpg width 1388 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 540e8ea977bc4d4bd29f1ea7afda173385ca3096 So IMO remember I m not a financial advisor so take everything here with a grain of salt I think we can get a rough forecast of what we can expect in the coming days by looking at the charts above and comparing the MACD crosses in the last days to what s happening now Remember not to panic and remember that this wont be a one day event it will most likely play out through several days What or when we will hit the zenith who knows because we cant see the full data thanks to the brokers who backed up the HFs but we can see that even through pull backs were set up for a nice rise There is A LOT of pent up pressure that the HFs are trying to cover up Eventually all that pressure will have to escape and run its course and as long as we hold and keep it up we will win THE BIGGER AND LONGER THE PULLBACK THE HIGHER WE GO Again all of this is just conjecture and my humble opinion not financial advice amp x200B EDIT Forgot to include my thoughts lol but I think we will have a slow beginning with a healthy rise near the end of the day Hopefully it ends up going that route To quote u Ev1L GeN1uS From a broader perspective using the daily chart our first macD cross was under 20 bucks this time we are converging around 100 bucks Now let that sink in Its gonna get fun YES its 5x bigger

autists and retards this is my very first DD and actually this is not about getting quick tendies and much more about a mid term or even long term value play So if you do not want that please skip this post and go back to focus on GME Otherwise keep on reading Please note this is an old throwaway account of mine because I do not want any relation to be made between my person and this DD So this DD is about the German supplier company Schaeffler SHA015 Be aware of some currency switching between and as well as a wall of text Key facts about the company This is their website https www schaeffler com content schaeffler com en index jsp https www schaeffler com content schaeffler com en index jsp They employ roughly 83 000 employees worldwide Generated 14 4 billion in sales in 2019 17 5 billion Net revenue of 428 million in 2019 520 million 881 million in 2018 which decreased because of the car crisis pre corona Growth in sales and in revenue outperformed all supplier competitors AND automotive manufacturers in the past years As of today they have 4 5 billion market cap 166 million shares publicly traded For 2020 figures see below What is the business model Schaeffler is one of the biggest automotive and industrial suppliers worldwide It is a German company with solid financials read more below Their focus relies on high quality and precision components and systems in the Automotive and Industrial sphere Now what does this mean Is Automotive not Industrial Let me explain that Schaeffler has three divisions Automotive which is supplying almost all automotive manufacturers in the world even Tesla Industrial which is supplying stuff for machine tools industry 4 0 and IoT solutions of mechanical form and renewable energy generation they are inside almost every windmill in the world afaik Automotive Aftermarket which is essentially the division that is supplying all the car workshops with spare parts for cars You can see they are setup in a broad way I have more information on the individual divisions down below Now those divisions rely on the same knowledge and manufacturing lines more or less which generates lots of synergies in the company and creates additional value instead of just catering to all industries at all costs About the family shareholders and the stock Schaeffler is more or less a family company which is listed at all major stock exchanges A couple of years ago they had their IPO with a listing of 12 50 15 18 I think that was in 2015 They then rocketed pretty quickly to 16 17 Currently only 25 166 million shares of its shares are free float and publicly traded Their traded shares also have no voting rights but have a nice dividend to them 30 40 of the net revenue The other 75 of shares have a voting right but are all owned by the family Schaeffler by a Holding company The family Schaeffler the Holding company also owns 46 of Continental Another supplier company that is almost triple the size of Schaeffler and currently has a market cap of 24 billion There is quite a lot as to why this is the case but in my opinion that is not really as important for this DD Long story short in 2008 Schaeffler tried to buy and swallow Continental then the financial crisis hit and they had to take on lots of debt Automotive Technologies division With Automotive Schaeffler is generating the largest part of its turnover and revenue I do not have to add that this is also hurting them right now because it is obvious However when Auto is back to business Schaeffler always outpaced its competitors and even the OEMs with its growth and revenue share Schaeffler has parts in almost every car in the world In the Automotive division Schaeffler is manufacturing and developing all sorts of stuff for vehicles This obviously includes combustion technology boring Exciting is what new stuff they have on the shelves First of all that is a technology for 100 autonomous cars and they are currently the only company that has the permit to use this technology on the road in a lot of countries already right now Google Space Drive Next is technology for electric cars They acquired a smaller company that is known for its extremely efficient electric motors their wiring technology and know how is superior It seems like every other month Schaeffler is acquiring new orders for its electric motors whether it be in pure electric cars hybrid cars or heavy duty vehicles They are also on the forefront of developments for the usage of hydrogen in cars and other applications also Industrial Besides the obvious business with European OEMs they are in quite large business with US and Chinese OEMs Chinese business growing the fastest according to their recent releases Industrial division The Industrial division is where they are manufacturing stuff for typical industrial applications Like bearings for wind mills they are inside almost every wind mill worldwide afaik or machine tool stations Here they are also working on developing smart bearings that know when their life span has ended This is crucial in large scale manufacturing lines where a bearing failure can result in multiple million of damages Schaeffler s solution for that is essentially marketed under the brand Optime condition monitoring Obviously incorporating all sorts of Industry 4 0 applications as well as Internet of Things By the way Schaeffler is also active in aerospace where they are actively helping to reduce the CO2 emssions of planes I could see them maybe work with drones in the future and rumor has it they even work on adapting the e mobility motor technology for the aerospace industry They are also inside many space applications such as space rockets and the rovers Automotive Aftermarket division Aftermarket is where Schaeffler is selling stuff and spare parts and repair kits to automotive workshops to fix cars essentially Honestly I have no idea about the division and they make up for the smallest part fo the turnover revenue What is cool here is that afaik they can sell their stuff to all workshops and it can then be put into cars where applicable that were not even equipped with Schaeffler parts originally Which would mean that is quite a huge market The margins also seem to be quite good Current financial numbers and cost efficiency measures Now that we all have a very rough understanding of what Schaeffler is about and what they are doing let us talk a little bit about risks current financial numbers and what Schaeffler is doing to increase their flexibility and financial basis Initially Schaeffler lowered their expected results for 2020 in January they then published an AdHoc release saying that they unexpectedly outperformed their planning and can close the past year better than expected See here https www schaeffler com content schaeffler com en investor relations events publications adhoc releases adhoc releases detail jsp newsID 2059430 https www schaeffler com content schaeffler com en investor relations events publications adhoc releases adhoc releases detail jsp newsID 2059430 From my point of view they will end up with 10 less turnover compared to 2019 which would be 13 billion 15 7 billion and a margin of 6 4 which is incredibly good for the current times if you are asking me Might be that I read the release wrong lol How did they achieve those results Let us talk about cost efficiency measures they have initiated even BEFORE the automotive crisis started long before Corona Obviously I am not too fond here and we can only learn about this from their own publications They are laying off people closing plants that are no longer as profitable as before they are moving manufacturing to lower cost countries and they are digitalizing and optimizing all their processes According to Schaeffler their initiatives are working and their preliminary figures underlign this Risks Well obviously if the car market or industry market keeps crashing and does not recover then this will plummet again The floor around 6 60 held quite good though and we had a run up to 7 the last days The thing is this company is heavily investing in new technologies now and tries to reinvent itself They recently announced an investment in a new central laboratory for R amp D If e mobility doesn t get big well then Schaeffler is excellent in combustion tech If e mobility kicks in which is what we all expect aren t we then Schaeffler has all the right equipment knowledge and tools at hand They even already get lots of orders for emobility stuff check their press releases from the past months In my opinion this is pretty fail safe Another risk is that Schaeffler got approval to issue new shares in the coming 5 years if the need arises Approval was given in the last shareholders meeting in 2020 obviously the only one allowed to vote is the family shareholder So this is an obvious risk in the next 5 years Stock price compared to other supplier and automotive stocks So yes as written beforehand the company is getting some flack for the boring combustion engine technology for having lots of employees and so on But how does their performance compare to other companies We can compare that with Continental Timken a much smaller US supplier and some Automotive OEMs like VW GM and the like Comparing their stock s charts reveals something super interesting All of the above pretty much all car manufacturers as well as suppliers started plummeting in 2019 because of a lack of car sales and then started a slow recovery until Covid hit in March 2020 Today most Automotive OEMs are almost back to 2019 levels Talking about suppliers the situation is a little worse but almost all of them are dealing with their stock being traded 10 20 below pre Covid levels However Schaeffler is at a much higher discount Now if you factor in the performance of Schaeffler in 2020 and the preliminary figures from above paragraph you notice that a more or less fair value of the stock would be something around 9 while it is sitting at 7 at this very moment So from my point of view there already is an upside of 28 in the short term once people realize this is trading at a discount Not even factoring in what they are doing in terms of future growth with emobility and Industry 4 0 stuff in the mid term What else is going on From here on this is more speculation than DD but nevertheless I wanted to mention it So last but not least there is something interesting going on lately Besides the typical insider buying of shares which happens on a regular basis from almost all Executives especially the CEO the family shareholder Mr Schaeffler recently gave ALL of his shares in Schaeffler so 75 of the company as well as all COntinental shares so 46 of Conti in pawn I don t know the exact English wording for that for a bank credit line Essentially the shares serve as a security for the credit line Now how much is that in terms of money More than 8 2 billion almost 10 billion at the time this took place at the beginning of February So 10 billion in securities plus his other securities privately owned stuff would result in a credit that is atleast 10 billion from my point of view Now why would you need that if you still have a positive cashflow even during Corona and an Auto crisis This is indeed a very good question So to answer this question I first had to research why anyone would have to put that many securities in the bank for a credit line and why would anyone use shares as a security The result is in 9 out of 10 cases this is typical behaviour for a loan that will be used to purchase and swallow another company I then researched which other companies competitors could be relevant and are in the ballpark of 8 12 billion Honestly I couldn t find any But then I remembered that Continental will bring its entire drivetrain division conventional combustion engine tech PLUS all the e mobility stuff and electronics and mechatronics to the stock market with a spin off And coincidentally this part of Continental is worth something around 8 10 billion 9 5 12 billion according to Wikipedia You can google Continental Vitesco spin off However Schaeffler already owns 46 of Continental and as such also 46 of the supposed spin off company Nevertheless this was the most reasonable thing they could do with such a huge loan in my opinion The Schaeffler CEO always refuses this option and typically answers questions in that regard with agility is more important than pure size In his latest interview with a German financial newspaper couple days ago he said this again and also said they are more looking into acquiring something in the Industrial sphere and not Automotive also they would favor smaller acquisitions rather than bigger ones So take all that with a grain of salt Target price Nope you are not going to get this from me as I am not educated enough for it On March 4 they are going to release the 2020 full year results as discussed in the earlier paragraph the numbers are basically already published and are above expectations Depending on the capital increase with new shares and or the purchasing of another company I can not predict any prices for this stock However I am on there with 600 shares at 12 yes pretty sad I know lol but looking to average down Personally I expect a potential increase in the share s price of 30 60 in the mid term range TL DR Schaeffler is a solid German supplier with solid financials and a good business model Compared to its results it is highly undervalued especially considering its current measures for cost efficiency as well as lots of orders for electric mobility projects from major automotive manufacturers in the billions for the next years Fuck me because I jumped in around 12 share but it is a long term hold for me amp x200B No financial advice I like the stock

following the USPS contract drama Everything that I am posting here is partial speculation I am more than happy for you to shit on my post or downvote me to oblivion I would just like to kindly ask you to post your positions Full Disclosure I still have 4 16 115 Calls I have put TLDR s in the beginning and after each key paragraph because I know you are all lazy cunts TLDR WKHS was on the brink of going BK so there was massive manipulation in the market to make sure the suits would lose less money OSK was thrown as bait causing its price increase from the USPS contract to fall straight back down The reason is that OSK is a sustainable company with great financials and can withstand it Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor of any sort This is my opinion and it should not be taken as the word of God Full disclosure I am also fucking retarded and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself This is also based on my theories and speculation As some of you may know OSK Oshkosh was awarded the USPS contract for the new fleet of vehicles It was a contract for 480M to finalize production for next generation Vehicles The total contract can be worth up to 6B to supply 50 000 to 165 000 over 10 years Once the news broke out OSK went from 103 to 118 high This is about a 14 5 increase in the company s value which is 1B in market cap value With OSK s TTM revenue of 7 2B it gave them a multiple of revenue of 1 12x The TTM EBITDA 668M which calculates 11 9 times multiple These multiples do not account for the projected revenue and EBITDA with the new USPS contract The industry average on EBITDA multiples is around 13 8 times for manufacturing companies The average multiple for auto amp trucking is 45 73 times according to NYU Stearns http pages stern nyu edu adamodar New Home Page datafile vebitda html Without the projections of EBITDA gains from the USPS contract it is already significantly undervalued based on Enterprise Value EBITDA TLDR Even if OSK was at the all time high of 118 per share it was still undervalued by approximately 32 times using TTM numbers No projections and based on USPS gains This is based on the auto and trucking industry standards for public companies In other words it didn t matter if OSK got the USPS contract or not It was still way undervalued I am screaming at the top of my lungs that OSK is undervalued so you are probably wondering why OSK fell like a ton of bricks back to 104 when the News about One House Democrat cried foul play on the USPS deal Whatever I am going to say now is partially theory pulled based on available information online I would love for anyone to call me out if I may be wrong but post your positions also This is where Workhorse plays a significant role in the movement of OSK stock As some of you might have noticed WKHS s value dropped by nearly 50 after it was announced that OSK was awarded the contract rather than WKHS Some may agree and some might disagree but WKHS was banking on the contract to essentially survive In other words it was a Hail Mary that would have saved them from all their struggles I will not go into enterprise value and EBITDA ratios with WKHS or any of that because they only have a TTM revenue of 500K You read right 500k not 500M It would just be a waste of my time This is really scary because WKHS has a lot of debt on its books As of 9 30 2020 WKHS had a net debt of 123 228M Additionally WKHS raised an additional 200M https www freightwaves com news workhorse gets 200 million to advance electric van production This adds up to around 323M in debt assuming they did not pay any off from 9 30 There was no way for WKHS to service that debt without bringing in new revenue If they cannot service the debt based on historical numbers how are they going to service the new debt The Creditors approved debt as they were betting on WKHS getting the USPS contract WKHS either had some excellent investment bankers or the underwriters need to be fired because this was pure speculation which is a big bet for debt financing When the news came out two days ago that OSK was awarded the contract WKHS went tits up Even though the terms on the loans did not require WKHS to repay Debt until 2024 creditors felt the pressure as WKHS lost the contract Additionally the company s value decreased by half leading to any debt convertible to stocks being less valuable If creditors do not feel that a company is capable of servicing a debt they can recall the loan anytime Correct me if I am wrong This probably was going to happen They were flirting with insolvency https finance yahoo com news workhorse share collapse raises pressure 131704051 html and all their investors would have lost their investment The largest investor before all this drama was not ARK It was your big institutions and mutual funds ie Blackrock Inc Vanguard Group Inc The and Seaport Global Asset Management LLC https finance yahoo com quote WKHS holders p WKHS and they would have lost a lot of money TLDR Paragraph WKHS was close to being insolvent if creditors decided to pull the plug They had all the reason to with WKHS losing the race for the USPS contract Disclaimer this is Speculation and Theories What does this have to do with OSK going down They both have the same largest institutional investors backing the stock Blackrock and Vanguard https ca finance yahoo com quote OSK holders p OSK Within a day after the news Blackrock would have lost 185M in value and Vanguard would have lost 137M assuming they did not sell any shares after 12 31 2020 They both would have made only 70M from the OSK stock price jump This leaves them with the choice of the small gain from OSK or large losses from WKHS If these institutions let WKHS sink they would have lost all their investment which was approximately an additional 150M for Blackrock and 100M for Vanguard These are just calculations for 2 of the institutional investors Institutions would have to bear a larger cost letting WKHS go BK without some gains rather than allowing OSK to jump up from the news The Creditors also would have lost a lot of money if this were to happen as there will be unserviced debt and a loss in value in the convertible stocks Even if OSK went down the suits would not have lost much money because OSK can sustain itself without the USPS contract With OSK s management OSK has grown year over year This is not just enterprise value They increased revenue and EBIT every year before the Covid since the CEO has been in place TLDR Paragraph Big money and Creditors would have lost big by letting WKHS go BK It is okay for OSK to fall in the short term because it is undervalued and they proved they could grow year over year This is where a lot of manipulation might be happening behind the scenes There was a bunch of shorting and options activity during this time This was probably institutional investors hedging their bets to make up for losses For example ARK bought multiple dips on WKHS as the stock plummeted from the news They nearly doubled their position By the timing of god himself news came out merely hours claiming House Dem will push back hard on USPS decision to choose OSK This is apparently one House Democrat crying foul play not the whole house where the title tries to mislead you into thinking Since OSK was linked to the USPS contract it fell with regards to the news In my opinion way too much as I believe it is extremely undervalued There might also be additional selling to exacerbate the WKHS dump As I finish writing this WKHS was a clear Buy then Sell scheme with news that was over exaggerated and probably paid for to minimize huge losses that would have come with WKHS insolvency The people who would bear the pain are people who believed that WKHS is a good company I have seen people comparing WKHS to Nikola stating how it was undervalued compared to each other What they don t understand is that they were comparing garbage to garbage With this belief that Wood can do no wrong a bunch of people jumped over the cliff TLDR Paragraph OSK had to take the fall for WKHS while the markets were manipulated to prop up WKHS so the suits would not have to take as big of a loss The pain will be transferred to the retail investors as a sea of retailer investors followed Cathie Wood into buying the dip Positions OSK 4 16 115 Call

will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now Premise Equities are selling off due to rising treasury yield https www treasury gov resource center data chart center interest rates pages textview aspx data yield The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex But let me try to explain nonetheless 1 People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff Now yields being that low it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and more appetite for risk assets https www reuters com article us usa bonds markets idUSKBN29Q2NR Plus bonds were already at a price where yields couldn t have gone any lower meaning existing bond prices couldn t have gone any higher Thus this lower demand lead to a rise in yields 2 This created a feedback loop due to mortgage backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher They do it due to convexity hedging If you have no idea about what I said read this one up https www bloombergquint com onweb convexity hedging haunts markets already reeling from bond rout This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield Overall this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy Thus the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher 3 JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time Specifically until we reach full employment Thus they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2 These are based on their publicly stated statements which means it may mean something 4 Now consider the scenario real interest rate will remain negative the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario While we know that long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously over the last 20 years article data till April 29 https www nytimes com 2020 05 01 business bonds beat stocks over 20 years html With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8 while S amp P 500 having only 5 5 that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks The same picture emerges for the last 5 years since 2015 dataset ourdated https www bloomberg com news articles 2020 03 17 long dated treasuries crush s p 500 performance over five years 1 This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century And as yield continued to fall the bonds rose in price as is customary Now as the yield slightly rises it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price This also attracts more bond investors as a result I suspect that yields will not rise too much Plus it is a very crowded trade 2 As a result of bond having this superb risk adjusted return stocks saw huge outflows According to Cathie Wood stocks saw 300B in outflows excluding repurchases since 2018 and bonds saw 1T in inflows https www marketwatch com story stocks arent in a bubble but heres what is according to fund manager ark invests cathie wood 11612958113 So if there is actually any bubble it is in the bond market Think about it for a second Sure bonds provided absolutely superior risk adjusted return compared to stocks but because of this everyone and their mother are in bonds Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets 1 Now bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market In this scenario we won t be seeing any negative rates while continuing to experience negative real interest rate being a bond investor would be painful If you are a bond investor already you want the yield to go lower potentially negative but that is not happening either If yields rise you are losing money If you are a prospective bond investor you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on 5 Liquidity is present in the market Bonds aren t that attractive stocks are a good bet in this scenario Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don t go Weimar republic style After all you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here Question is which stocks I think boomer stocks are your best friend look for the things BRK buys And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn t be a bad idea either I think 6 US Dollar has been declining after March It is overall good for the stock market and the global economy in general For one it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets One could say EM stocks are a potential good source for risk adjusted return and I also think the same Although short USD have had been a popular crowded and winning strategy for the last year one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher However in the long run I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for Especially India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently 7 Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation and not specifically supply crunch Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage which would be bad for the market But I disagree We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy Stagnating wages high unemployment technological innovations cheap labour based production in foreign countries demographic challenges etc Some supply crunch is definitely there but to say that production won t normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind 1 Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us so before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low I would suggest you to read how and what are the weights of each consumption factors https www bls gov cpi tables relative importance home htm Also stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn t really counter the loss of employment income 8 Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt Thus our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low while also allowing inflation to rise You may think how can this be a free market if basically this is capitalism with USA characteristics Add to that direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is well the various companies Conclusion Using my crystal ball which cost me 0 to buy I can say this This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds USD is accommodative for the stock market Global economic recovery especially in EM economies will be good thus helping our companies Deficit financing Inflation will be good for most stocks Liquidity is present Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops No deflation There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds Thus I think while we will have lower overall rate of return in this decade I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me Disclaimer This is not financial advice I eat crayons and stuff This is a casino Don t listen to retards on the internet please don t I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating other events and starts quantitative tightening We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon Yields also goes to the moon Black swan events Think of something yourself man This was a long ass post and I am getting late for finishing my day s work

x200B I believe in a time like this a lot of people need a fresh glass of some ice cold water Splashed right into their faces amp x200B Tl dr Ape explanation I want GME to moon but I am concerned about people being fed false information 1 The claim Melvin said they didn t close their short position at the hearing is a lie Their opening statement specifically had them saying they DID close it 2 The strategy of ITM calls boosting the price was tested last time amp failed last time These are covered calls 3 There isn t enough of a short interest to force the price up by holding The profit comes when HF close positions but you won t know that happened until it s over amp x200B I would love to see GME rocket to the moon And I believe there is a scenario where that can be possible But I want to go over the popular scenarios that will deceive you into believing THEY are the scenarios that will lead you to the moon This is not a bear post against GME This is reality This is for those of you newcomers who thought you missed out on the last GME wave This is for those of you who were stuck holding the bag last time me included and are looking at profiting from this time to make that money back This is for those of you who just didn t learn your lesson and need a reminder of what went down last time amp x200B As I said there are scenarios where GME can be squeezed But what scenario is that And what scenarios are not that amp x200B 1 First thing first I want to stop a lie that I have seen spread like wildfire The blatant lie that Melvin Capital during the Gamestop hearing admitted to not closing out their short position on Gamestop This is not true Now I am going to assume whoever came up with this lie did it as a valiant effort to help boost the price of Gamestop and probably hoped no one would call them out on their BS because nobody else decided to waste their time watching a 5 hour congressional hearing about stocks Those are about the two most boring things in the world combined But you don t even have to get that far into the hearing to call this lie out for the BS that it is In Melvin Capital s opening statement within the first minute of it they state they closed out of their short positions in GME days before any restrictions were put on it You can look up videos of the opening statements yourself I won t baby you that much So in conclusion don t rely on the scenario that Melvin never closed out their short positions It s a lie and it needs some water doused on it amp x200B 2 Scenario Two possibly the most believed strategy on GME Thursday Friday Keeping the price over insert dollar amount here by Friday close makes insert number here of calls ITM and when they cover the price is going to rocket Now I am not going to say this scenario is impossible but it is not very likely and it is what got many people burned the last time Yes it is true keeping the price over a certain price making a lot of calls ITM can be good for the stock IF those calls aren t covered calls which I believe that almost all of them are The week ending Jan 22nd there are probably a lot of naked calls That hurt the sellers bad when GME closed at a very high price Nobody expected it That helped it a lot the following week when we saw the big spike But then let s run down what happened that following week Yes RH restricted buying on Thursday 28th which I do believe stopped the biggest of the squeezed but it would not have played a role in the ineffectiveness of the Calls ITM strategy that followed That Thursday the price plummeted into the 200s That Friday you heard a lot of chatter of As long as we can get the stock up to 310 a lot of calls will be ITM and we will be golden my fellow apes Get it to 320 and that s bonus points That will be 90k calls that will be ITM and have to cover That s 9 MILLION SHARES And yeah A lot of that was true There were 90k calls that would be ITM if we closed above 320 And you know what we did We closed above 320 We closed around 328 in fact This was it Come Monday that price was going to the moon 10k isn t a meme We chanted We couldn t be wrong We did the maths We had the DD Diamonds don t crack baby Well come Monday there was no lift off It was the Space Shuttle Columbia all over again The stock fell and it fell hard Going back into the low 200s dipping into the 100s even before closing in the 200s That s okay though That s fine They had until Wednesday to actually close on those Calls you d hear So Tuesday came and went Then Wednesday too We never saw 300 again In fact by Friday we were barely even seeing 100 So what happened What went wrong We had maths AND anime on our side Well what I believe happened is those Call contract sellers learned their lesson that first week that ended Jan 22nd when they got screwed They didn t let their calls be naked the following week They bought up GME stocks when it was low at the beginning of that week if they didn t already have them This allowed them to resell those stocks at 320 and under making them the big winners in all of this But that meant these weren t NEW stocks that would help us go higher No these were stocks bought on the way up They helped us peak but wouldn t help us go over the peak So when those calls executed there were suddenly a lot of new holders of GME stock Holders who saw their stocks were worth 300 320 These weren t diamond handers like you or I These apes wanted their bananas NOW So they sold when they got them Gotta cash in those profits at some point As WSB loves saying You can t lose if you don t sell Well you also can t win if you don t sell So now flash forward a month later and the same theory is being pushed Keep the price over 100 and we will rocket to 800 come Monday No scratch that 1000 No wait even better 69 420 You hear in the echo chamber bouncing off the walls like GME does in the first 30 minutes of market open That s not going to happen These are covered calls that are ITM You re not forcing anyone to buy new stocks at the current price You are just buying stocks for 50 100 that were already bought at 40 60 and are keeping the stock price stagnant And none of this is even mentioning that the amount of ITM calls this time is like a third of what it was last time So do not rely on this strategy amp x200B 3 Scenario Three tHeY hAvE tO cOveR tHeN wE cAn sEt oUR oWn pRicE This is probably the most ignorant reason and is why I typed it out like that Yeah I m mocking you Get over it it is true they do have to cover eventually But not with your stocks GME short interest is somewhere around 45 50 too lazy to relook up the actual number and this is after new reports showed 1 3 million more shares were shorted on Wednesday Now yes that is a high amount of short interest But that isn t high enough for the Diamond Hands approach There s still 50ish percent of shares out there not shorted And yes Diamond Handers hold a lot of those most are going to be held by institutions and those institutions are about the money not the message They see a 3x profit They sell They sell to whoever is willing to buy Could be more Diamond Handers could be hedge funds But eventually Apes are going to run out of money to buy and hold with That s when the Hedge Funds can swoop in buy up these stocks cover their short positions The people they borrowed from might not be Diamond Handers and end up selling to more Hedge Funds When the short interest is only around 50 you can t win with the Buy Hold strategy When the short interest is 50 the short squeeze happens and you don t know it happens until it is over and the Hedge Funds have covered You win by riding the wave up as Hedge Funds cover and then you get out near the top That s the end of your ride The ride doesn t just keep going up You can only set the price when you own most of the market and in this case we don t And on top of all of that you also have people who are doing this with their bill money The 1st of the month is coming up that s a lot of rent needing paid No shame in needing to sell so you can pay your bills But that s more shares that will flood the market Probably a fraction of the actual amount of shares out there but pennies add up to dollars eventually amp x200B And those are the three scenarios in which you have a higher chance of losing than winning Again I cannot stress this enough I DO believe a short squeeze can happen with GME But I do not believe it is any of these three scenarios that will make it happen I m just tired of seeing people being fed these these delusional optimistic claims that throw truth history and REAL DD amp common sense out the window treating GME more like a PnD than an actual short squeeze it s okay to drink the Kool aid but maybe check to make sure it isn t spiked first amp x200B Edit I ve been trying to reply to as many people as I can If they took their time to indulge me read my post and then spend their time writing a rebuttal to it I wanted to respect that and give them a proper response but it s getting a bit tiring and I have other things to do so I will not be replying to any further comments I might keep going with the fun conversations but for the rest I will not be

wrote some basic advice I ll repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paper handing Paper handing is fundamentally bad investment practice especially if you re a new investor I ll explain why DISLAIMER I ve only been trading for a few years and I only know this shit because I have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff and he hasn t steered me wrong yet So take it for what it s worth But based on all the fact that paper handing is even an issue here you apes clearly need this advice EDIT These are fundamentals to the way I trade but obviously everyone s trading strategy is different Note that this is a quantitative approach to investing which doesn t encourage YOLO ing This is ONE WAY to invest which does not require you to outsmart the general public by spotting opportunities value before the market does I feel it s particularly relevant to the GME play The ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it There are other approaches which often require more experience but I feel this is most accessible to new investors GME is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything Well everything that you don t think will go bankrupt or get delisted New traders or people who are thinking of becoming new traders should read this Especially if you re new I think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market This applies to all stock not just GME If you re experienced it might just sound like I m explaining at length why 2 2 4 but since a friend of a friend told me he paper handed on GME sold the dip I feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea I would encourage people to buy GME but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while edit in addition just to reiterate keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down By this I mean NEVER SELL AT A LOSS Simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down All newbie investors IMO should adhere to this rule just in general Buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground or don t buy it at all Many investors myself included follow this rule religiously not just with GME but with all stocks I have never lost money in the stock market because I never sold at a loss I just held or bought more COVID crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out I just held and was fine should have bought more If everyone bought into GME with this mindset I bet it would go to Pluto easily If you sell at a loss you are donating to the save the short sellers fund out of your own wallet fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes and you re not even following sound investment practice Just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy If you re thinking of investing so much that you ll wuss out poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red just don t Emotion and the stock market do not mix well Stop losses below purchase price are also for pansies and genuine idiots I ll sell you some stock but only if you give me a bad enough price on it Your plan should be to BUY when the stock goes down if you feel like you need a stop loss you re investing more than you should Instead of being stupid maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips Side note personally in the case of GME I don t have any limit sells either From what I can tell on past short squeezes the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down So as long as you keep an eye on GME when it actually does skyrocket you should have plenty of time Set price alerts and relax No need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket mid launch Although if you want you can try to profit off GME volatility Some people are getting shamed for taking profits but I m not sure they deserve it As far as I know buying low and selling high doesn t really help HFs it drives the price up just not as much as buying and holding But personally my philosophy is I can take baby profits anytime who knows when something like this GME rise will happen again So I m holding 101 shares at cost average 106 share Want to get into the game now You could always just buy a few shares and keep the rest of what you re willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip And buy a little bit more each time it goes down more bringing your cost average down Ideally you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero Always try to keep cash in reserve Locked yourself in at a high price That s why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down Didn t keep any cash in reserve Guess you re stuck waiting for one of three things 1 the short squeeze which will likely though not certainly happen 2 for the price of GME to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases or 3 you get your hands on some more cash you re willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS and you will never lose edit well seldom if ever Unless the company goes bankrupt a rare occurrence This is why you don t put all your eggs in one basket and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero it won t swallow your portfolio Also if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson Hedge funds and billionaires know this that s why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic They bought the dip while regular folks paper handed and got even poorer One more little trick If you manage to scoop up a nice juicy 100 shares then even if your position goes underwater you can always sell calls at above your average cost bring DOWN your cost basis and make money off your stock risk free while still following the rule of never sell at a loss Although if you did it right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze Bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen and you ll need to be patient and like I said before say goodbye to your money for a while EDIT Just to reiterate there are many trading strategies and I just feel this is one of the best for newbies Trade however you want just don t paper hand GME I would also note that you can sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price It still follows the rule of don t sell at a loss Buy one share at 90 and sell it at 100 doesn t matter if you still have 100 shares in the red from earlier You can even slowly take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down 5 and sell one when it goes up 5 EDIT Yes I know about opportunity cost It does apply if you know something the general public doesn t rare if you re just a low IQ ape but GME was is an exception Many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesn t it could be a coin flip whether you ll hit rock bottom In an ideal world you can keep some money in reserve so you don t have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities Yes I know about and agree with the sunk cost fallacy My point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal lowering the cost basis not doubling down on sunk cost Tl dr buy don t give unless give more than pay for Not financial advice I am literally a zoo ape that somebody dropped their phone into the enclosure of

T that earned your wife a boyfriend Trading chip shortages for top shelf tendies ON MRVL NXPI and a special surprise ,Hi all NrdRage here You might remember from such recent hits as buy PLTR 25p s as it s ripping here CLNE June 13c s are literally free money sell your NCLH leaps in the 33 area and buy back later the next day near 29 you re welcome btw as that trade probably saved your week and NVDA June 580c s are going to make you rich Today we re gonna talk about the semiconductor chip space Fluff content B b b BUT NrdRAGE you called NVDA you already talked about them I really didn t Be honest when I say chips semis the first things you think of are NVDA AMD and INTC Those are a wholly different thing than what s on everybody s lips these days in relation to the vaunted shortage dealing in high performance silicon that is being produced at full blast They re not going to be given a ticket to the feed trough of free taxpayer money supposing somebody informs Buyden that by chip shortage they re not indicating he needs to send his interns to the snack aisle of the grocery store to hoard Not a sure thing What we re going to be talking about are the lower grade ASIC application specific chips that are used more in infrastructure These are the commodity level products that are used for things like the computers in vehicles mobile phones wireless towers specialized digital binary money mining and so Elon can implant them in chimps for evil genius mind control experiments Placeholder Chart for expected 5G tower growth Placeholder Chart for automotive chip demands and supply bottleneck chart to Q3 Your bigger players here are going to be Taiwan Semi TSMC Lam LRCX and ST STM 2 of them are boring to trade and Lam I m not allowed to talk about because of a conflict of interest w my VC Let s talk about the government for a minute OK be honest Half the reason you re here is because you heard Buyden is going to dump loads of free money into these companies so they ll make more chips After all that s what CNBC has told you and they never lie right Right That s actually not what has happened in Washington and god help us that line about Buyden thinking the chip shortage has to do with potatoes was only half joking What the government has done was signed up to spend money STUDYING why there s a chip shortage The concern here is that even the US based semis outsource out their chip production to places like China and Vietnam and there s a growing push to incentivize companies to bring production domestically This is especially spurred by NXPI who is bottlenecking the automotive industry by selling too much overseas Now let s be honest It s about 75 that all they do is waste money on the study and never actually make the investment because getting things like this done is hard and it s much easier to focus on social issues that are already covered by other laws but make it look like something is getting done We have talkers and not doers right now that s just the nature of the beast Speaking of let s talk about NXPI The Laggard NXPI represents the only true foreign company we re going to examine today based in the Netherlands MRVL is technically based in Bermuda but they re a US company more on that later At the time of this writing they re trading in the low 180 s with a market cap of about 51 billion Their specialty is in chips that power infotainment systems for cars So when you hear F whine about how they can t get enough chips they re low key throwing shade at NXPI The only reason they re being included in this list is because as a big automotive chipmaker in spite of the whole Buy American virtuing from the current government if they spend money to ramp up manufacturing they re going to hand money to NXPI to set up factories here and will be dumb enough to not make it contingent upon NXPI keeping the chips here in the country so they ll continue to sell them to the rest of the world Looking under the hood 47 of their money comes from cars another 13 comes from phones 20 comes from infrastructure think wireless towers and about 20 of their money comes from selling chips to AMazon and Google so their virtual assistants can spy on you and listen to your wife s boyfriend having sex on your dining table with his balls rubbing right against where your plate of Hungry Man frozen dinners sits when he takes her out on a date she goes out with the girls Hey I think one of those peas fell on the table Pick it up and put it in your mouth Yeah roll it around in there tastes like taint doesn t it They re b asically a smaller representation of Trevor s nuts or a life size version of yours you dirty little bitch So one could say they ve got a pretty good product mix and were one of the earlier players in the sector to recover yet still lagged behind them overall unlike the other players we re gonna talk about later Or you could say that they re a bunch of flip flopping non committers who create a schizophrenic company in some weird attempt to not be cyclical They trade at a lower multiple to their competitors but this is largely due to the fact that they re leveraged more deeply than the rest The best comparison to these guys would be TXN if you want something else to track it by Placeholder I might put a chart here later in an edit that compares price in relation to EBITDA Placeholder I might put a chart here later in an edit that shows forward earnings estimations based upon the increase in auto and IoT chip costs What do they think they re going to be long term That s the thing it s impossible to tell if they re going to become a big player in cars or IoT they re not compelling in infrastructure because What makes NXPI interesting here in spite of the fact that everybody is pissed at them for spreading themselves too thin is the fact that they re such whores with who they sell to that they ve become something of an interesting M amp A speculative play as it s entirely possible a company just comes along and buys them to bolster their supply chain for chips once and for all In particular there is a strong indication that Samsung has been kicking the tires for over a year OK moving ON get it Dad joke ON The Overachiever On represents the only true domestic semi on this list so if you re playing the corporate welfare trade you ll be interested here If NXPI is the BPD afflicted ex who loves strongly and that s why she lit your car on fire ON is that super focused new girlfriend who s dating you because she knows somewhere in your contact list is a local celebrity she can use to get her closer to being the Bachelorette after she dumps your ass ON is all in on 2 things the vehicle revolution and 5G They re positioning themselves as the place to go to if you re making EV s or autonomous cars as they are focused on LIDAR sensory chips and power management Why It s simple ON was is and always will be interested in the highest margin businesses possible cyclical nature of them be damned Sure they stick the tip of their johnson in the industrial sector cross selling their sensory chips for purposes of machine vision think automated Amazon warehouse part pickers but it s not something they spend a lot of time on Does this strategy work at least for right now Let s look under the hood They had a MASSIVE beat last quarter and then upgraded forward guidance by 8 and this stonk has already had quite a run more than 30 to date which has outpaced its competitors by almost double The automotive section of their portfolio rose 17 and represents about 33 of their revenue at this point but it s clear to see that if we have this conversation in a year that number will be well over 50 Their infrastructure revenue wireless towers lagged but that was due to their vendors and actually represents a forward opportunity They beat in spite of a major part of their portfolio dumping So the answer is yes How Simple Mind control and cancer technology from the lizard people who s secret society is bustling under the ice of Antarctica aka 5G The telecoms as a result of the virus really slowed down their rollout of 5G last year It was suspected that might carry through this year as well You may have noticed the news a day or two ago that T and VZ caught downgrades because of unexpectedly high prices paid in the most recent bandwidth spectrum auctions That changes all of that Since everybody had to pay so much more for the spectrum space look for these players to be very aggressive in trying to shorten the ROI frame on those expenses by aggressively expanding out their 5G infrastructure There are 3 companies that this is very good news for SWKS another stock I can t comment on because of conflict of interest so do your own DD with them ON and the next participant in this which we ll get to in a moment So there are about to be a lot more chips from ON in your kid s school shooting ovarian cancer rays into that boy You likely won t see this reflected on the balance sheet until their Q3 earnings but since everybody knows it s coming it s going to get baked into the price Which is why you re very likely to see a melt up over the next months The one thing that sets ON apart from the rest of the equities on this list is that they re not a a mini fab That meaning they re not a company that simply outsources chip production to other people overseas and who has shown a willingness to keep some production in house Matter of fact their CEO recently came out and affirmed that he wants to maintain a balance between outsourcing and in house Which means when it s time to get some of that sweet sweet taxpayer money to build out US production they ll have their hands out TL DR If you re bullish on EV s self driving cars and the Illuminati you re bullish on ON If you re playing the gubmint corporate cheese play ON MRVL The Duke Brothers Marvell is functionally a US company Santa Clara but is technically headquartered in Bermuda because they re filthy tax dodgers If you re one of those ethical investors stay far away from this company because they re as dirty as they come in a lot of ways They also trade at a lower multiple than the others On the upside if the government starts offering money to Build American sell to China they will elbow their way to the front of the line to take the free money and then build a 3 person operation somewhere in Iowa that makes hard drive chips and pocket the rest which will definitely pad their bottom line One thing that s different with MRVL here is that they completely outsource their chip production right now so if they were to take government money they would have to build their infrastructure from the ground up and figure out how to make it work Anyways let s look under the hood 40 of their revenue comes from the storage sector Meaning the lion s share of their money is legacy selling chips that go in hard drives On the consumer side it s in platter discs their SSD play is in the enterprise space because they re not high performance chips BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO RIIIIIIIIING But NrdRage I can hear you saying That means they re gonna be huge in the cloooooouuuuuuud Sure except margins in t he cloud computing space keep shrinking at exponential rates as it becomes more commoditized so it s a lot like investing in EMC in 2014 They ve invested heavily in automotive in the last year but they re a day late and a billion dollars short there It will take at least 3 years before that investment starts bearing fruit so they re not an interesting play in that aspect and likely would use that free taxpayer money to try and close their gap there because they weren t forward thinking in that regard They ve been active in acquisitions lately most recently buying Inphi which serves to just attempt to keep up with NVDA in the ARM chip space for data centers For the record they cannot keep up with NVDA in that space so don t think you re paying for a dominant player there It s a high profit sector but not exciting and dependent on their continued contract winning in the whitebox space All this sounds like they re big spenders but that s not really true They ve actually been excessively cautious in leveraging debt which is why they re so far behind in the auto space As only 4 or 5 of their revenue came from things like industrial or IoT MRVL is actively winding down t hose sectors of their business and abandoning t hem What they are that s interesting however is almost exclusively a 5G play and in that regard they are fucking rock stars 5G alone represents about a billion dollars per quarter as things get more heated there because they re not just a domestic 5G play they re really well positioned to be the dominant chip maker in both the Land of the Hentai Sun and for the Europoors If you re investing in MRVL this is the SOLE reason you re doing so and it s a compelling case There s no chart data I can provide as yet that can accurately project their positioning in the market in this area but rest assured when that data can be quantified they re going to be a big time player in it Matter of fact just yesterday they announced they were partnering with Fujitsu in a 5G baseband agreement with regards to Fujitsu s base stations Bad day to announce that news since the best performing stonks were the ones that only closed down 1 Placeholder Chart goes here for 5G chip earnings and market share Placeholder Chart goes here for telecom expansion analysis So to summarize The entire sector is very cyclical and presently it represents a perfect storm of an upgrade in telecommunications technology automotive advancements and IoT Don t bet on them just because you hear Buyden is virtue signalling some bullshit about solving Ford s chip crisis because it s probably going to be another example of lifetime politicians being all talk and no action They re all healthy financially none of them are heavily shorted and pressure is to the upside albeit not in any sort of extreme adrenaline releasing way If you really want to bet on government the real bet here is the stimmy money getting handed out again DC is basically telling everybody to go buy a new phone with the next installment of checks and those phones are going to be 5G capable and the people are going to want to leverage that Don t tell the lizard people I know about their secret base That s all well and good fucker but how do I play them Can I FD NXPI You actually can You can expect daily movement of between 2 4 with some regularity with a ITM Delta of about 58 and a Gamma approaching 2 and a half spoiler alert All these are going to have garbage gammas just a nature of the industry Don t go crazy out of the money but weeklies are absolutely something you can do here ON You can t really This is really more of a melt up play You don t necessarily have to play leaps but weeklies are gonna be a bad idea Stay close to in the money and go 2 or 3 months out at a time Currently I m sitting on 4 16 41c s which I will roll over into June calls as we get closer to expiration You always want to stay a little in front of these dudes ITM Delta is almost always sub 50 and Gamma is often times about 12 short term Stay a little ahead of them and it improves dramatically MRVL They re OK there but like ON you re probably going to want to stay ahead of them though you can fiddle with this a bit Delta is pretty good but the gamma is absolute dogshit If you target something about 10 one direction or another you should be happy as long as you pick the right side of the coin flip Outlook and Price Targets NXPI I m neutral on them bordering on bullish They re the biggest reason we keep hearing about this silicon crisis right now but they re being coy about whether the reason they re not keeping up is because they don t or won t produce enough or if it s just because they won t sell enough to us They represent a potential speculative play if somebody who really needs chips for their business decides to just solve the problem by throwing money at it and bringing that development in house 3 month price target 200 210 ON Bullish They re laser focused and well positioned to take advantage of all the highest margin business in this cycle and as the demand for these products ramps up their outlook is going to exponentially outpace everybody else in the space even the chips I didn t talk about today exempting gaming chip makers 45 in the short term but if you manage to stick your dick in your wife when she s sleeping one night and dribble your Downs afflicted swimmers into her you could very well see 75 80 by the time that chromosome hoarding bundle of joy licks your wife s vag I expect to see this one in triple digits at some point A darling MRVL Bullish for 5G ONLY Once you start seeing the telecoms advertise they ve got 97 nationwide 5G coverage and research studies to back that up their cycle will be over and they ll go back to legacy revenue but expect big things from them as T and VZ try to keep up with T Mo s breakneck pace Short term price of 75 long term eh whatever Positions NXPI I don t hold a position with them and don t anticipate doing so unless a strong momentum trade forms I think they can move but they re not interesting to me Some of you will like them especially since you can FD them because of the occasional spikes and craters ON 1000 4 16 41cs and 500 7 16 44c s I also have 85 000 shares at 30 59 I grabbed some weeklies for next week at 38 during yesterday s

keep making those Buyden hears chip shortage and thinks Frito Lay is in trouble jokes but the thing is I m only half kidding That has nothing to do with this equity other than it got me thinking about my favorite snack brands A week ago I had no idea this company was even publicly traded I always knew them as a family run northeast niche thing One thing I did notice however was a couple of years ago their chips started showing up in grocery stores near my Colorado homes which I had been assuming meant they were having things shipped from the East coast And when we spent a couple of weeks at our LA home recently so I could get in some motorcycle riding and away from the snow I found them on the shelves out there too Somewhere along the way they decided to become a national brand and have started penetrating markets all over the place I have no idea what their financials look like or any other solid DD besides knowing that they re fucking delicious and if you re a believer in the product then believing in the company shouldn t be hard So I bought a thousand shares at 24 35 in solidarity with them Then I saw Cramer hyped them a couple of nights ago and cursed myself for starting to turn into a shitty Boomer Maybe they become a big player in the snack food space on their own maybe a company like PEP comes along and buys them out Regardless if you like the product go out and buy some equity you fat fuck Plus there s always a non zero chance Joe gives them a bailout by mistake amp x200B All my love amp x200B Chad Dickens

to bull run all the way to the 9th March after its beautiful earnings and it s time to burn some shorts Yesterday pre earnings I posted some DD https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lsdpuz rkt to the moon dd and short squeeze opportunity on why RKT Rocket Companies was a buy I was right the earnings were a blowout and at time of writing the stock sits up 10 from highs of a 20 gain during the day To someone that has not followed RKT this may seem like a missed opportunity WRONG Welcome to the Amazon of the Finance World well near enough Rocket by all traditional measures should ve risen to 25 previous close of 19 90 minimum today Their undoing was their own lack of volatility in the past Practically since the IPO institutions and savvy retail traders alike have sold calls some covered some not to either make a decent return on the stock stuck between 19 and 21 or to average down from a bag holding position above These players had a huge amount to lose today from a massive price increase a potential gamma squeeze if it did so Hence they have done everything in their power alongside weak hands to keep the price below 22 Next week things start to change But before that let s just go over the insane earnings they just report 1 EPS 1 09 analyst prediction 0 87 an insane beat and a rise in quarter net income from 754 million to 2 84 billion 2 A special dividend of 1 11 per share to Class A common stock holders on March 9th note this is important autists 3 Partnerships with a multitude of companies including JP Morgan 4 Stock buyback not taken place yet but still intended 5 There s more little nuggets but that s enough for ape brain to take in So what happens next week Firstly the dividend at current stock price is just over 5 yield An insane amount This provides a catalyst for the price in two ways Firstly who doesn t want any easy 5 return This is hardly priced in let s be realistic These earnings give RKT as PE of 5 Way below industry average if you consider them a financial stock and around 3 to 4 times too small if you consider them a Fintech More importantly let s have a look at RKT s short interest It lies somewhere between 35 and 40 Now let s be clear this isn t going to be a Reddit retail investor driven short squeeze RKT has a mkt cap of 40ish billion not 400 million BUT if long institutions pile in we could potentially see a lot of upwards pressure Shorts have to pay the dividend an instant 5 loss is not a good look and who knows if there ll be more to come in later earnings With call holders less in the equation the shorts have lost one of their biggest allies It s time to make them pay for dogging this stock since the IPO Everyone on here knows what happens when shorts have to cover and 40 of the float having to cover sounds pretty damn good to me A huge difference between RKT and other meme stocks is that the price could stay above 30 indefinitely or higher Shorts don t like to be stuck indefinitely losing unlike holding other meme stocks which they expect eventually to collapse not that they will unless you all have weak hands Expect raving analyst upgrades all next week hopefully around 30 to drive the price up more With all this in mind expect a huge run up to the 9th of March I have a genuine PT after that earnings of 40 but if the wind blows in our rocket ship s favour the moon is only the beginning This Rocket is going up Uranus like your wife s boyfriend s is up hers Rocket is recruiting diamond hands I am sure retail investors helped the shorts today by bagging their lame 10 profit BUT autists and apes we can get 100 200 or more RKT closed at 21 85 today It is my firm believe RKT is a brilliant buy after these earnings under 24 and if the bull run starts all the way to 30 Management want these shorts out and that s good enough for me the CEO laughed at the shorts on CNBC I am willing to put my money where my mouth is as I averaged up from 30 per cent equivalent CfD contracts at 20 30 to 41 per cent equivalent at 20 91 In other words get us to 46 because this autist wants his first 100k trade These values are actually GBP but I presumed you only know dollar due to autism I just like the stock So buy shares squeeze shorts RKT TO THE MOON Earnings Call Transcript https www fool com earnings call transcripts 2021 02 26 rocket companies inc rkt q4 2020 earnings call tra EDIT VERY IMPORTANT POINT some people have pointed out the float is actually around 100 million shares as 95 is held by insiders in a holding company which puts the tradeable mkt cap at around 3 billion

the price has been adjusted to scale logarithmically to make the trend easier to see and enable us to see all the data points at once For all you apes out there all that means is the higher you go the faster you go higher This trend started in August It will likely continue as long as Ryan Cohen and the folks he brought over do good work Now lets address those large spikes amp x200B January Ape

png amp auto webp amp s 2e65377fc7cfcbd212a6ff8ca714ca330fedf02e So a speculation bubble occurred but why What caused it and what does that mean going forward Especially with the recent activity yesterday and today Firstly I am not a financial advisor and I don t give financial advice Secondly to answer is pretty simple this was caused by millions of apes rushing to the stock market to buy GME duh News goes viral about the squeeze the apes buy paper hands sell Ok but that sounds really bad right Again not necessarily Bubbles like this happen all the time on all just about anything that can be traded over time scales ranging from a few hours to a few months One of the things that makes GME such unique opportunity is that there is an incredibly tiny number of available shares relative to its market cap This important for the squeze but it also means the price is more susceptible to dramatic price fluctuations In fact it is this property that make a squeeze possible its the nitrous in your gas that turns it into rocket fuel Imagine you and all your neighbors are on a life raft in the middle of the ocean and everyday you get 10 gallons of water to share between you that no big deal but what happens when 10 gallons turns to 9 then 8 then 7 and so on the less water available shares the more volatile you and your neighbors get until eventually everything goes MAD MAX and you have all the water to yourself so the speculation boils down to is this the Squeeze did it squouze am i too late So what does that mean for the apes that boarded at 200 250 400 Well nothing the Price is going to jump around a lot and every time it should settle a little bit higher than before all the while costing the shorts more and more interest until the squeeze goes off or the market value has reached your cost basis and you re wishing you bought more dip so you could have averaged down and made a profit by now Additionally if you assume the price jump was in fact speculative bubble it means the shorts couldn t really have covered without guaranteeing rocket launch those arrogant entitled assholes would have had to look in the mirror admit they lost and launch the rocket themselves OR they could lie to you and double down Historically they double down because its not their personal money and the hate being wrong almost as much as they hate losing money Personally I don t think the shorts will ever capitulate on their own I think that it will end in one of 3 ways 1 SEC will turn up some smoking gun of some kind in an investigation that cant be swept away and a scapegoat will be offered to the public 2 their clearing house will call their the short positions in and they ll go belly up 3 the shorts are right and we re either too dumb or too distracted to out last them Just to be clear these are all short term endings The long term end is basically Cohen and Friends save GAMESTOP and turn it into a digital platform powerhouse or they don t They got a pretty good track record though I mean Chewy sells pet food and toys and its valued at nearly 6 times what GAMESTOP is don t get me wrong I love my dogs but I spend way more on video games each year than I do on pet food and supplies and I don t think I m the only one OK so that covers Jan but what about today and yesterday Well yeah short answer is I m not sure but my best guess is that as a result of some options trading practices someone had to buy a bunch of shares to hedge those options and because the available supply is being restricted by all you apes the price reacted extra sensitively kicking off even more hype This would be a good sign as it means that the fuel mixture volatility is getting super powered and just waiting for the right ignition catalyst amp x200B Just so you know I where I

Technical similarities compared to last time If you look at the volume activity 1 13 1 19 there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump it s actually big but it s GME we re talking about so I m speaking in relative terms Then volume decreases and the price levels off Then on January 21 Friday we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day However this only raised the price to about 70 The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about 150 Then on Jan 27 and 28 that s when we see the price get to its highest points ever but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days After that we all know what happened Now compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar I think that this week s price action and potentially next week s and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1 13 1 19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off stabilized Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1 year chart just had a bullish convergence For those of you autists who don t know what that is it means that the price action has started a bullish trend The last time it did that on the 1 year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form It s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation Because of how option expiry works Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren t obligated to exercise a larger number of options so that s why today was pretty red although not horribly Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind Similar market conditions Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time SPX down massively VIX up massively then and now Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year Fuck no it s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting Some sites say it s 41 which is still huge others say its 15 20 The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month so most of this data is reflective of the post squeeze when short interest was lower HOWEVER Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don t learn their lesson and that once it is updated we will see that short interest is back up sky high yeah I bet that ll get a few more people interested in this The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest possibly massive short interest and that many funds still have not covered from last time The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly https iborrowdesk com report GME https iborrowdesk com report GME This is exactly what happened last time and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need Just as a little side bar also look at AMC It s also repeating the same pattern as GME Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME Probably not I think that AMC just rises with GME but this is just another interesting similarity to last time RH As I said above the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time unless it goes above 1k because A they are much more liquid as of now and B they do not want another one of these press nightmares Obviously if this gets too high they re gonna have to restrict again but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would ve gone up to over 1000 if the brokers didn t halt buying so don t underestimate our power I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again whether this is their fault or not so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true However we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I m saying comes to fruition IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500 DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU Short interest Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100 This time it seems to be about 40 BUT these statistics don t get updated very often so it could be even higher Therefore there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time however because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40 which would still lead to a massive jump potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like 300 and are trying to make it go to 0 If this is the case that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting because they don t update often sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update In this situation however the short interest is not as important as the options activity How OTM calls can multiply this The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM meaning they had to buy more shares However at the time the most OTM strike was something like 200 300 eventually getting up to over 500 Now because of the last squeeze we have OTM calls with strikes of 800 This means if the price keeps going up there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time Like I said above a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float unless the numbers are inaccurate but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover which could trigger a small short squeeze Catalysts One of the most important things that I ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership As we know the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone As Andrew Left from Shitron said he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires appointing himself ceo acquisitions more tweets etc MOST OF ALL we have earnings on March 25 thankfully after hours which is when this thing likes to jump I m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short gamma squeeze This would happen the next day March 26 That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls which could trigger a gamma squeeze Quite honestly because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock I could see this type of thing happening every single time there s a catalyst especially at the end of each month The Point The point of this is that IT S NOT FUCKING OVER This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it s very short https investorscult com 2021 02 26 gme short squeeze https investorscult com 2021 02 26 gme short squeeze The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze If we know anything it s that wall street doesn t learn after it fucks up i e 2008 and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero STAY STRONG APES IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK I m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice I m just a dude with a small penis EDIT WOW thank you for all of the replies I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs especially XRT That makes me even more bullish on this If GME continues to rise these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price I also loved the comments about all of the artificial phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it s over 100 shorter HOWEVER This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this why are they trying to push it down so much If this is out of rage from last time or if they re still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time then they still clearly haven t learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over Finally our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th 12 strike so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM 100 chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys and probably buys more options stock which will just provide more upward momentum I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage For those of you who say HF won t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes 2007 2008 has entered the chat Like I said I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one but could easily be bigger I can t emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be Be strong apes don t get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong There s some shady stuff going down God this is intimate I feel like I m financially inside of you or something I m jacked right now I M JACKED TO THE TITS I ll be reporting back when our tenddietown rocket launches past the moon HOLD THE LINE APES I LIKE THE STOCK
