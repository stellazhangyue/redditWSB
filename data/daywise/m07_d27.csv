price risk on this trade The movement of the stock was largely irrelevant and the trade we set up would profit no matter where the stock went There was some assignment risk on the short calls we sold which we discuss in the second to last paragraph This is entirely a broker imposed risk which we were able to solve without too much issue It is an important distinction to make though so I ve added that up here to the top of the post I ve been trading options for a while but about a month ago I saw one of the most unique opportunities I ve ever seen in the market Here is an explanation of how I set up a trade that gave me a trade where the worst case scenario was that I made a little over 2 500 https imgur com 7K4Z5MH jpg This is about to be a wall of text so if you re a more visual learner here s a quick video I threw together explaining it also TL DR VIDEO https youtu be ui2HxTDByY4 UPST first caught my eye back on June 9th when I came across news of its upcoming share lockup expiry on June 14th For those who are unfamiliar a share lockup is a pre determined period of time where certain initial investors in a stock usually institutions pre IPO are not allowed to sell their shares This is to prevent a mass selloff at IPO since these institutions are typically able to get shares in a company for far below what it ultimately is offered to the public at Once that pre determined lockup period expires those entities covered by the share lockup are free to sell their shares as they wish Now a share lockup expiry doesn t always mean a stock will drop For example if an institution owned a huge number of shares at 22 per share and the stock was trading at 25 headed into a share lockup expiry there probably wouldn t be a sell off because it s not worth it to unload a large position to lock in such a small gain However if an institution had a bunch of shares for 22 apiece and the stock was trading at 160 headed into the share lockup expiry then there would likely be a decent sell off because they would be locking in a monster gain and that s exactly what we were seeing with UPST This stock had run up from 22 to 160 between the IPO and lockup date so you could bet that investors with a basis around 20 would be itching to close their positions out and lock in a huge gain So with that in mind we knew that we wanted to play UPST down but the question was how I m going to walk you through the thought process that ultimately led me to discover the risk free trade we entered Idea 1 Covered Puts If you re familiar with a covered call you know it s a bullish strategy where you buy shares and sell a call hoping that the stock runs up to the strike of the call that you sold What we tried to do was basically the opposite a covered put where you short stock sell a put and then hope it drops to the strike of the put you sold Here is how that looks https imgur com Zc6MUXz jpg and this is what the return profile on that looked like https imgur com gcbExAz jpg using www optionsprofitcalculator com http www optionsprofitcalculator com So this trade accomplishes what we want because it makes us money if the stock goes down But let s take a look back at the setup really quickly There is one issue With this play we re shorting the shares but the shares for UPST were listed as HTB meaning hard to borrow This occurs when a lot of people are trying to short a stock and the supply of shares available to be shorted becomes constrained This is a problem because 1 a broker may close out the short position without notice and 2 brokers charge high borrowing fees on hard to borrow stocks which would have cut into our profits So how do we solve this The answer is to open a position that is synthetically the exact same as shorting shares which we did with our second idea Idea 2 Replacing short shares with an option We solved the issue posed from shorting shares by selling a call with little to no extrinsic value We did this by selling a 45 strike call which was deep in the money This 45 strike call had 111 25 of premium which if you add those two numbers together 45 111 25 comes out to 156 25 almost EXACTLY the price of the stock at the time we calculated this indicating that there is basically zero extrinsic value on these calls that we sold Here is what that setup looks like https imgur com bwZqJi8 jpg and here is what the results look like https imgur com wq16xVa jpg You ll notice it s very similar to what we first laid out minus the risks associated with shorting shares of a hard to borrow stock So why does this work the same as shorting shares Let s say the stock drops 1 If you re shorting 100 shares you ll make 100 If the stock drops 1 and you ve sold 45c like we have the price of the 45c will drop from 111 25 to 110 25 resulting in a 100 gain So synthetically these are the exact same position with the added benefit that we don t have to worry about paying borrow fees or getting our position automatically closed out during the day by the broker So that leaves us with these potential outcomes https imgur com wq16xVa jpg however there is still a ton of risk if the stock shoots up And this isn t quite the zero risk play we ve teased for this video So let s work on that part What s the best way to hedge that risk What would protect us if the stock ran up The answer is buying a call Idea 3 Hedging upside risk by purchasing a call We wanted to play UPST down but the level of upside risk wasn t within our personal risk tolerance so we decided to hedge that by purchasing a call This is what the setup on that would look like https imgur com U1t1S6N jpg The important thing to note here is that we purchased calls at a 2 1 ratio to the call and put that we sold for the first two legs of this trade This turns infinite upside risk into infinite upside returns and actually skews the trade bullish This is what the potential outcomes of this 3 leg trade look like https imgur com Ys4TtUL jpg and you can see that this trade is basically risk free at this point as movement below 45 is virtually impossible in such a short timeframe However the title of this post would be a lie if we didn t eliminate ALL price risk so we re on to Idea 4 Idea 4 Hedging the downside risk by purchasing a put Similarly to our upside risk hedge we hedge our downside by purchasing 45p That way any move below 45 is recovered on a dollar for dollar basis by the puts These were going for 0 05 apiece so it was basically a 10 hedge to fully eliminate the downside risk which gives us this setup https imgur com b0jVFl1 jpg And finally that gives us these potential outcomes https imgur com 7K4Z5MH jpg The website we re using doesn t even know what color to shade the boxes because there isn t a scenario here where we lose money All in all this took about 16 000 of collateral and resulted in a trade where the worst case scenario was that we made 2 600 which is a baseline return of 16 25 Not too bad for a few minutes of work So now you re probably wondering Why did this work and what s the catch This works because we ran into a position where the extrinsic value on the deep ITM put that we sold far outweighed the price of the calls that we purchased to hedge the position Extrinsic value is the portion of the option premium that is subject to theta decay and will be fully eliminated by the time the option expires The value of our play was derived from the roughly 19 of extrinsic value on the 280p that we sold which is really uncommon for such a deep ITM option There was roughly a 17 difference between the extrinsic value on the 280p that we sold and the premium that we paid for the 240c that we used to hedge which is what made our hedge turn our entire trade profitable This is NOT typical to see in an option chain The fact that the share lockup expiry was coming up for UPST provided a huge put skew meaning that puts carry more premium at comparable strikes This is what allowed us the opportunity to create this risk free play You also might be wondering if we had to sell exactly the 280 strike on the puts and buy exactly the 240 strike on the calls for it to work We modeled out a ton of different possible trades and strikes and this is the one that I felt gave us the best trade off between minimum base level return and maximum return At the end of the day as long as the extrinsic value on the put we sold was at least 4 5 greater than the calls we bought to hedge we were going to find ourselves in a risk free trade I give the 4 5 number because it s tough to open all of these legs at once so you might have 1 or so of slippage in getting the orders filled A 4 5 gap is what I would be comfortable with for a trade like this in the future In this situation the difference was roughly 17 And last but not least there is one little catch I m sure you ve heard there s no such thing as free money but this is really really close Since the 45c we sold were deep ITM and had zero extrinsic value we were at risk of being assigned early During the first week we were holding this trade that happened But there s no need to panic Getting assigned on the 45c now means that we are just short 100 shares which is the original position we wanted in the first place so we ll remember that the risk was our broker could close them out at any point and completely shift the return profile of the trade To address that risk we reached out to our broker let them know our plan bought back our short position and sold another 45c with no extrinsic value There is zero price risk on this trade but rather a little broker imposed risk that can be mitigated So there you have it An example of how we can use option selling strategies to take advantage of special cases in the market and set ourselves up with virtually risk free trades Thanks for reading and feel free to let me know if you have any questions in the comments I d be happy to answer This is one of my favorite trades I have ever placed and thought it would be interesting to share TLDR 2 UPST 6 18 45c 113 60 2 UPST 6 18 280p 138 60 4 UPST 6 18 240c 1 88 2 UPST 6 18 45p 0 05 This 4 leg trade created a trade that had zero price risk due to differences between the extrinsic value in the 280p and 240c
