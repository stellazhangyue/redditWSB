ton of cash in the future The Deeply Undervalued Stock That s The Supreme Anti Inflation Play ,Alright I am going to show you guys a company that is deeply undervalued by the metrics of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffet to make you a gangbuster return I know right that is SO DIFFERENT than like 97 of the companies that get hawked here You see unlike the money losing companies that get hawked here with the expectation that they will lose slightly LESS money next year or even better the ones that just lose even more money as the years go on this one not only makes a shit ton of cash but will make a METRIC fuck ton of cash next year and EVEN MORE the year after Golly that would be a sight am I right So what is this magical stock called Well say it with me it is Century Communities Stock CCS What does it do It is a homebuilder The 9th largest one across 17 states One that was gasp profitable in 2008 18 years of consecutive profit They operate through two home building segments The first is called Century Communities which is their flagship brand offering everything from single family floor plans to condos and townhomes Enjoy the freedom to build and personalize your new home from the ground up or find the perfect quick move in listing These homes are 1 To be built and quick move in homes have2 full smart home packaging and 3 can be reserved online The second offering is Century Complete which are affordable and streamlined homes that Century makes that offer built in savings through a groundbreaking online purchase process and a versatile selection of quick move in homes This segment offers quick move in homes starter smart home packaging and the ability to buy them online They also do home loan title insurance and home insurance Let us do a highlight reel before we get into the nitty gritty They have delivered 10 386 new homes for the last twelve months through quarter 1 of 2021 and 80 percent of their deliveries are to entry level buyers the largest segment of purchasers Those home deliveries helped them notch 3 6B in total revenues for LTM 1Q 2021 Valuation Metrics for CCS for Q1 2021 Century Communities reached a net homebuilding debt to net capital of 19 9 from 52 in 2018 Their homebuilding debt to LTM EBITDA is 2 0X Their Book Value per share is 40 74 and tangible book value per share is 39 83 Yes you see how they do not have much of that squishy goodwill or intangibles This stock is a straight shooter That entails a 1 52 Price to Book Ratio and a 1 55 Tangible Price to Book ratio The trailing P E ratio for this company is a stunning 7 54 P E ratio with a dividend yield of 95 60 cents a year Fully year EPS for 2021 on an average basis is 11 64 and 12 72 for 2022 That means a Forward P E ratio of 5 32 for 2021 and 4 875 for 2022 Their price to sales ratio is 47 Analysts have an average price target of 92 It is a steal and I am going to explain further down why I believe analysts are wrong and it is even more of a steal than they say But before I do that I am going to compare this stock to its peers Comparison to Other Homebuilder Stocks Lennar has a P E Ratio of 9 10 After recently reporting its Q2 Earnings on Wednesday a 2022 Forward P E ratio of 7 41 and a 2023 forward P E ratio of 7 23 Toll Brothers has a P E Ratio of 13 38 a 2022 Forward P E Ratio of 6 70 and a 2023 Forward P E ratio of 6 91 But Hani the market cap of these companies is much bigger Fine fine let s look at home builders with a market cap similar to CCS then Meritage Homes has a P E ratio of 7 54 a 2022 forward p e of 5 46 and a forward 2023 p e ratio of 6 62 The only home builder that comes close is M I homes but it has a future P E that lower than that of CCS and it is in slightly less markets Still it is a strong buy as well I cannot be bothered to compare every homebuilder stock but suffice to say it is better than KB homes NVR D R Horton Tri Pointe Homes and PulteGroup In short it s undervalued in a sector that is being undervalued by the markets The only stock that comes close or slightly edges it out is M I Homes which doesn t offer a dividend Lennar s Earnings to shed light on the earnings of CCS On Wednesday Lennar destroyed earnings with adjusted quarterly earnings of 2 95 per share Stripping out items it reported earnings of 2 65 which handily surpassed analyst estimates of 2 38 per share They also beat on revenues and issued an update to its homebuilding outlook for the third quarter and is now anticipating new orders in the rage of 16 000 16 300 units and deliveries between 15 800 and 16 100 units for the new quarter The Macro Commodity Outlook amp Home Price Appreciation FY 2022 Timber prices have made homes about 30 000 35 000 more expensive to build but ever since they peaked on May 7th at 1670 a unit they have gone down and they have gone down fast It closed on Friday at 904 and analysts believe it will continue to go down to roughly around 600 There are some analysts however that believe it could go as low as 500 to 550 and I share that sentiment That is because DIY builders have largely stopped buying timber with the great opening home builders are not going balls to the walls with their home building and because sawmill operators are increasing capacity Building construction accounts for nearly half of all copper use and residential is roughly 2 3rds of building construction and with China having announced it is releasing its metals reserve and trying to tamp it down copper has been coming off its highs faster than usual Interestingly Copper also peaked on May 7th at 4 75 and it is most recent close was at 4 14 Aluminum is used as an insulation layer of building roods for windowpanes etcetera It peaked on May 7th as well and is now sitting roughly at 2384 I believe it will continue to decrease due to China s attempts to moderate the prices by releasing its reserves as well as due to eventual balking by customers at the prices Meanwhile home prices will increase in 2022 Freddie Mac predicts that home prices will rise by 4 4 in 2022 In 2021 Higher building costs longer delivery times and general unpredictability in the construction supply chain are now having measurable impacts on new home prices The median sales price of new houses sold in April 2021 was 372 400 20 higher than a year ago The average sales price was 435 400 The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of April was 316 000 This represents a supply of 4 4 months at the current sales rate What am I getting at here Well there are currently bidding wars and Lennar s earnings calls will reinforce that Homebuilders are passing off the cost and the consumers are taking the increased cost What is more homebuilders are INCREASING their margin HUGE undersupply of homes and a huge ongoing need for new homes Freddie Fannie have predicted that there is a 3 8 MILLION undersupply of homes and home builders will need to build 1 2M homes a year just to keep up with year on year demand When I say 1 2M homes that does not actually chip at the backlog To cut into the inventory shortage of 3 8M they will need to build more than 1 2M homes a year But homebuilders are being cautious and so it will take 8 to ten years to fill demand unless they ramp up significantly Currently Housing Starts are only 1 572M units on a seasonally adjusted basis Furthermore permits for future homebuilding fell 3 0 to a rate of 1 681M units in May Let me be clear then that this is not a cyclical play but a circumstance of over a decade of concentrated underbuilding by home builders that is now leading to a golden age for them in the coming years What does this all mean for when CCS reports earnings in Q2 and for Q3 and Beyond August I am going to throw some quotes from Lennar s earnings and you can spot the goodies READ IT ALL but I will bold some things Jon Jaffe Co Chief Executive Officer Q4 of 2020 is when we saw the first significant increase in lumber costs which impacted primarily our Q2 deliveries The lumber increases which occurred in Q1 and Q2 will mostly flow through our deliveries in the second half of the year But as we noted and Diane will cover more detail we believe that Lennar s pricing power will more than offset this and we expect to deliver stronger gross margins Looking forward we expect to see some limited relief on our lumber costs for our July starts as more expensive lumber works its way through the system And if the current downward trend holds we ll see a more significant benefit for August starts Diane Bessette CFO And now let me provide some high level guidance for the fiscal year We still expect as we mentioned our deliveries to be between 62 000 and 64 000 homes but with a now higher gross margin guidance of 26 5 to 27 for the year and an even more efficient operating platform with SG amp A guidance of 7 3 to 7 5 for the year So as you can see this is fantastic news The reporting period for Q2 for CCS ends on June 30th which means I expect them to revise guidance upward for Q3 EOY in terms of margin because that is when the housing starts will start to fully benefit from decreased lumber prices As well as other commodity prices Furthermore consumers are taking the price increases on the chin and allowing margin to expand as you can see in Lennar earning call as well as government data and this is going to be seen as soon as this upcoming quarter as you can see by Lennar s earnings beat I expect earnings to be at least 3 EPS and maybe even more beating the analyst consensus of 2 73 I expect FY EPS in 2021 of at least 12 dollars in earnings per share which beats the analyst consensus The Anti Inflation Play The rise in housing prices accounted for over a quarter of the overall increase in inflation in May An inflation storm is coming for the U S housing market Morningstar https www morningstar com news marketwatch 20210619290 an inflation storm is coming for the us housing market Guess who that benefits That is right this stock Furthermore purchasing a home is the quintessential anti inflation play because the mortgage stays the same over 30 years while rents increase to match inflation Furthermore your home appreciates roughly at the same rate as inflation when you are a home buyer So to beat inflation People buy homes Finally building costs are decreasing with commodity prices going lower but margins are expanding HMMM Debt CCS was upgraded to B1 by Moody s on Feb 22 2021 and put their outlook at positive This is one step below investment grade They have no debt on their revolving line of credits but they have two senior notes 495M worth of notes due May 2027 u 6 75 and 397M worth of Senior Notes due July 2025 u 5 875 The 6 75 Notes means annual interest payments of 33 412M while the 5 875 senior notes give an annual interest payment of 23 324M This equates to roughly 56 74M in interest expenses If they got rid of the debt they would add an additional 1 68 to their EPS in the full year by removing that interest expense Alternatively they can get upgraded to investment grade by EOY and then choose to refinance for better rates and save on interest expense After all their set to almost reduce their net homebuilding debt to net capital to 0 by the end of this year and that is if they only meet and do not surpass analyst expectations I believe it s only a matter of time before they are upgraded to investment grade debt due to the strong financials here Russel Inclusion On May 8 of 2020 was the Russel Ranking Day for reconstitution The stock was 23 87 at that time clawing its way back from the doldrums of the pandemic lows The Russel Ranking Day for 2021 was May 7th The price then was 79 84 That is a 334 4 increase in the share price The market cap therefore would have been 3 46B on ranking day It will remain in the Russel 2000 with a much larger weighting as the higher on the list you are the higher your weighting is Since then however it s decreased roughly 28 percent to 62 01 which means that the weighting will have an outsize impact on the share price on the reconstitution date Institutional Ownership and Insider Ownership Institutional ownership is 89 54 Insiders own 11 9 of the company as well This is pretty fucking bullish CCS 62 90 0 19 0 30 Century Communities Inc Yahoo Finance and

down to 7 66 a pop I intend to open a further significant amount on Monday provided there is not an explosion in the stock price as this is severely undervalued Additionally I think I m going to open a smaller parallel position in M I Homes Price target by analysts is 92 dollars for CCS The great homebuildergeddon of June 8 11 Save for Lennar which boomed the day of earnings and the day after when JPMorgan initiated a price target with 50 upside happened for literally no reason It was just a sector bloodbath and CCS was hit the hardest of them all by far Be aware that the bid asks for options is quite different though not as illiquid as CNNE My poor CNNE calls are getting slaughtered but I have till August This company is super undervalued and doesn t deserve to be where it is This isn t a fucking pump and dump don t make it one because it doesn t deserve to be tarred by that association This is a deep value play I would have mentioned the 10 buyback authorization they have but i don t care to because their focused on increasing earnings and making money hand over fist Also they should probably focus on removing all their debt notes before doing share buybacks because it gives a

make a lot of money with a minimal amount of risk This guide will help you get started on your path to financial freedom Some definitions Calls Calls let you call your broker and tell them how much you want to pay for a stock Say Tesla is trading at 700 You can call your broker and tell them you want to buy it at 300 If it s a new broker that just passed his series 7 he might say something like Do you mean 300 strike sir mam Calmy tell this noob that you know about options from WSB and want to talk to his manager If they still wont let you participate in call options to purchase Tesla at 300 you will need to report this to FINRA Here is their help line Phone 240 386 HELP Puts Puts much like Calls are insider trading tools used by many Wall Street firms How a put option works is that you call your brokerage and tell them your want to put or give back your shares for their original purchase price Puts are what you use to get a refund if things went a little awry Lets say you smooth brain bought GME at 440 after looking at shitty memes all day tell your broker you would like to use a put option to get a refund You choose the price however one firm rule of puts is that you cannot put your shares back for more than you paid for them So in this case you can put your shares back into the share pool for 440 apiece Covered Calls Covered calls are normally only for elite wall street veterans but I will help you trade just like they do Selling calls should not be done over the phone with your brokerage Don t worry Robinhood traders this isn t a problem for you You are going to want to do this online after you sign your margin contract with your brokerage Covered calls are a sale of the aforementioned call options where you essentially sell something you don t own and make money for just knowing about this trick Its like being able to sell your neighbors car without him knowing Its really important when selling calls to not have the underlying stocks in your account For example if you want to sell covered calls on Tesla do not purchase the security first You dont want to get them called away do you Another quick tip to maximize profit always look for the most volatile stocks possible meme stocks are great for this Remember keep it online just click the sell button go a little bit out of the money more on this below and you will get the biggest bang for your buck In the money ITM is how wall street traders congratulate each other on a successful call or put option Lets say you used a put to return your shares for a refund when the money hits your account you can post it on WSB to let others know you are in the money You will most likely be showered with awards from wall street bettors Wall Street bettors are very nice folks who are there to support you Its their way of saying welcome to the club Here s some gold Also be sure to let us know what brokerage you are using so we can transfer our 4 GME shares over there Out of the money OTM refers to trading noobs who don t know how to trade options Us wall street insiders consider most of retail out of the money but now that you have found this guide you will no longer be part of this lower class of human Trading is easy when you have the power of insider knowledge on your side Strikes Your brokerage works on a 3 strike system If you lose on three trades or try to buy boomer dividend stocks like GE you will be given one strike Strikes fall off on a rolling 30 day basis So if you absolutely have to buy JP Morgan cause they were Epstein s bank brokerage and defended by their 2nd in command Mary Erdoes and you like that they got caught with a cocaine boat https www cbsnews com news ship seized in 1 3 billion cocaine bust is owned by jp morgan chase https www cbsnews com news ship seized in 1 3 billion cocaine bust is owned by jp morgan chase you can only do this three times a month Only trade options and meme stocks and you will be fine Ive heard stories of what happens to people at with three strikes I am not at liberty to say what happens but lets just say goatse s ass looked better than people who were punished by their brokerages for getting three strikes Expiration If you don t use your options after Ive given them to you here they will rot In order to keep your options fresh its always wise to sell more covered calls described above or call your broker to buy new calls or puts Intrinsic Value refers to what you think your options are worth If you have options that have gone to zero but you really really like them well then there is a lot of intrinsic value in them Extrinsic Value refers to the value of options that you used to own You would say I am an extrinsic holder of Amazon options and they would be worth millions of dollars right now This is very useful information to share with others in the DD section Extrinsic value can also refer to the value of your wife after she ran away with her latino pool boy boyfriend For example My wife s extrinsic value at the moment is the price of a Costco hotdog while she is away on her extended vacation Hope this helps get you started Welcome to the wall street insiders club Special thanks

figured I d share the DD with y all The sector is emerging from a decade long bear market and has the most upside of any segment in the market in my opinion tl dr shippies go zoom and make boatloads of moving commodities Plays posted at the end Get on the boat now Perspective When we first started talking about commodities 6 months ago our commodity index looked like the following https preview

context that s the highest in a decade The commodity inflation trade has seen significant gains since March April 2020 and honestly metals physical commodities are not trading at a deep fucking value anymore There is still upside but there s better plays elsewhere Like MASSIVELY better plays One of those plays is moving commodities Currently shipping sectors are experiencing massive demand increases post covid delayed routes due to covid e g quarantine before offloading low order books e g few ships being ordered new environmental regulations which leads to ships moving slower increasing fleet values as steel prices go higher and increasing rates Shipping is a cyclical business as ships take years to make and we can expect the boom to be strong and last a few years There s plenty of research about this on Seeking Alpha if you want more insight Inspiration https preview redd it hlvlv5f3rg671 png width 1052 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

discounts to valuation but funds cannot buy them yet Let s take a look at shipping one of the sectors Burry is alluding to in particular containers and dry bulk I believe that there s plays in this space that have the opportunity to be 10 25x In fact many already have been 10 15x and as they increase in value are more likely to attract more buyers Dry Bulk https preview redd it od40bho4rg671 png width 1514 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 2b3f7af7bb6e1aeb06c29f45f65b9fcdbf27382e For those that are interested here s a basic summary of the dry bulk market Dry bulk shipping involves bulkers moving commodities typically grains iron and coal all around the world It s broken into 4 major segments Capesize very large Panamax largest ship for Panama Canal Supramax Suez alternative routes and Handysize small local routes These ships typically trade in the spot market meaning a commodity producer e g Vale will charter a ship in the spot market to ship iron on a particular route e g Brazil to China There s also Forward Freight Agreements FFAs that are essentially futures for charter rates on these ships Most of that info can be found on the Braemar Screen https braemarscreen com home The Baltic Dry Index BDI is a big picture index for the overall spot market Currently BDI is at a decade high and quickly climbing FFAs indicate that future prices will be higher than today e g it is more expensive to book a boat in Q3 than today Here s a closer look at how rates have moved over the past year courtesy of Joakim https twitter com JHannisdahl s 20 Baltic Dry Index by Ship Class

even better news is that most stocks in this sector are leveraged to the tits These companies take on significant debt to build ships to move commodities Anything over their breakeven price is PROFIT Let s take a look at an example gt Company A owns 16 Supramax ships and 15 Handysize ships Their breakeven rate is 10k day Currently they make 30k day per Smax and 25k day per Handy This company is currently making over 500k day in profits Assuming you ignore that Q3 FFAs are 10 higher than current spot rates and assume these rates maintain for a year you are looking at the company making 182m in annualized profit That company s market cap is currently only 213m There s a lot of great names in the dry bulk sector that print cash One name that has been a clear winner is Star Bulkers up 5x from May 20 They are the largest name in the space and are Capesize heavy which should enable them to outperform in the event of a dry bulk super cycle Containers Harper Charter Rates All Time https

ships will be chartered for many months to years sometimes even over a decade Their charter index Harpex https harpex harperpetersen com harpexRH do timePeriod Total amp amp dataType Harpex amp floatLeft None amp floatRight None is at an All Time High and show no signs of slowing down 50 weekly streak of gains Unlike the daily boom bust of dry bulk container lessor companies e g companies that lease ships are locking in their gains for years currently most charters are in the 2 3 year timeframe That means these companies are locking in massive profits for years On the flip side you have container major companies aka liners who move container boxes that charter ships from lessors and move containers These companies are making crazy amounts of money moving boxes and are willing to lease these ships at all time high prices because they are short space Here s a quick look at container rates on a few major routes https preview redd it pt07f2p9rg671 png width 1100 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 8a8019ba665eec728ae60fed93d37a4ccb55133b A container is referenced as a TEU Twenty Foot Equivalent Unit and ships are referenced by how many TEU s they carry Currently the going rate for an 8 500 TEU container ship is 68k day meaning a liner is paying a lessor roughly 25m year for their ship currently the ship purchase price is 100m However a liner may make 55m for a shipment from Shanghai to LA at current rates for that ship Assuming that liner makes a few runs annually you can see where there s money to be made playing both sides of the container trade For container liners ZIM is the only NYSE listed play I know They recently IPO ed and have gone from 10 to 45 in the span of a few months For container lessors DAC presents the most value and best options They ve recently run from 2 50 to 72 in under a year What s Next The recent run up we ve seen in containers and dry bulk is during the low season e g rates are typically low in Winter Spring Summer months are coming and there s a few catalysts to send rates even higher 1 China s Yantian port is currently operating at limited capacity due to a Covid outbreak There s over 100 container ships sitting for 2 3 weeks waiting to offload This is a major bottleneck for global trade and more impactful than the Suez Canal blockage a few weeks ago 2 Industry insiders are saying it is impossible to find ships containers Currently demand into the US is 3x more than demand going out of the US creating a scenario where ships are in the wrong place or sailing empty and where containers are in the US and not in the ports needing them to ship products Home Depot for example just chartered their own boat which is unheard of because prices were going crazy and they couldn t find space through their traditional means 3 China continues their trade war with Australia over coal which means that coal needs to be shipped from the Americas Africa Those are longer routes and disrupt typical supply chains Likewise Australian coal needs to be shipped elsewhere leading to longer routes 4 Vale s Brazil iron production is expected to increase in the second half of this year requiring more Capes to be chartered to send iron to China Steel demand continues to be bonkers over there which is keeping healthy demand and prices for iron and coal into China 5 There s a global drought going on specifically in the US and Brazil meaning global grain output should be lower or at least displaced and will need to be shipped Keep an eye on soaring agriculture prices to indicate that there s significant demand for corn wheat in net importing food countries These products are typically moved in small midsized ships I ve done a very basic job outlining shipping if you are interested to know more I highly recommend you start following folks on twitter there s a small but vocal crowd to follow joining us on Seeking Alpha and also attending sessions at the virtual Marine Money Week https www marinemoney com forum MMWeek21 conference next week This industry is super fun to learn about and has very predictable cash flows meaning there s great opportunities to find absolute steals in the market Also many of these companies trade below the 1b market cap and cannot be discussed on WSB so you ll need to look elsewhere for the consensus top plays Plays I currently have a 6 figure equity position in the unnamed company I talked about earlier No options available but I expect it to 3 4x this year I m buying the 75c for July and 80c for October on DAC I ve had a number of 3 4 baggers on DAC already and have been rolling profits I ll post more small cap plays in the comments Enjoy the ride gang shipping is the hottest play in the market at the moment

be a long one A lot happened this week yet despite all the turmoil the SPY closed down less than 3 on the week IWM a little worse off at under 4 and QQQ about unchanged As we ll discuss there s a different story lurking beneath the surface and it s questionable just how much this volatility can be contributed to the Fed s comments on Wednesday Fed Reaction At the risk of being labelled a Fed apologist I have to ask what were people expecting Those recently screeching about inflation risks should be happy the Fed has taken note https www ft com content 0bf83e29 5ee2 415e 9e03 0edb38218bf3 though sticking to the narrative seemingly supported by the bond market that it s transitory they are guiding for possible rate hikes in 2023 two years from now Though this view could change in the coming months as supply chain issues resolve and data normalizes this recent adjustment in guidance shows that the Fed seems to be acknowledging current data and willing to quickly adjust it s long term view Like what more do you people want This is not a bad thing and given their current intention is to create some inflation but not too much I think they ve been dead on in their approach Market Reaction From a market perspective we had two catalysts this week the Fed notes on Wednesday and a quarterly Opex on Friday that involved a massive gamma roll off https spotgamma com quad witching gamma pinning Both caused noise in the markets and I think it s important to understand what affected what in order to have an understanding of what to watch in the next week or two To do so we ll need to look at the reflation trade that s recently been in vogue bonds and index action So let s dive in to the charts Charts Sector Performance Sector Compare 1y Sector Compare 1m The last week has marked a significant downturn in certain sectors specifically those of the reflation trade XLI XLF XLE IWM all took big hits this week Zooming in on the chart adds to this story since the volatility in mid May they ve been flat and underperforming with downward momentum picking up into June All that time unprofitable growth stocks represented by ARKK have been on the up Reflation Trade Breakdown XLF 1y XLI 1y BCI 1y IWM 1y For a few weeks now the reflation trade has seemingly stalled Wednesday and Thursday quite obviously attributed to the Fed s commentary this trade had a major breakdown Commodities represented by BCI which tracks the Bloomberg Commodities BCOM index sold off alongside major reflation themes in financials and industrials Energy slid as well and IWM small caps followed through on that failed breakout Looking to bonds US10Y yields shot up post announcement and then came right back down TNX 5d But the action in the 30Y 5Y spreads is what s most telling as they got absolutely hammered flattened indicating that investors are pulling back on expectations of inflation remaining sticky and are beginning to price in a more benign inflation outlook in line with the Fed s forecast of a transitory or temporary increase in inflation source is marked as spam US30Y less US05Y So suddenly the market is realizing the Fed is actually going to react to continued bad data inflation wise exactly what we mentioned above and is pricing that in Opex Volatility Contrary to the action above SPY and QQQ held up Wednesday into Thursday and then had moves to the downside Friday though the latter held up well which I think is more a result of the massive Gamma roll off rather than reaction to the Fed SqueezeMetrics SPY DIX GEX SPY 1y QQQ 1y Takeaways Summing It Up The violent reaction to the Fed s comments relative to bond spreads and the reflation trade I think is overdone as usual It is worrying that this trade has lost steam prior to this week but the sudden pivot by markets to think that we won t have any inflation does not line up with what the Fed has been indicating with it s average inflation targeting we ve just gone from the markets thinking the Fed won t be able to control or prevent runaway inflation to the Fed crushing any inflation at all i e the last decade I think we re gonna be somewhere in the middle or the former wage increases aren t going to reverse and the Fed wants some inflation stickiness in the short term it s a good thing We ll need to watch this trade for the next few weeks to see if it is truly done with or this is just a reactionary pullback The Gamma unwind sets us up for possible volatility and downside risk remains Analysts have been suggesting a pullback towards the 10 range for some time now but markets have remained resilient overall This could continue but the specter seems to loom larger the longer we go Pullbacks are normally a healthy thing and a buy on dip opportunity if we get one Overall one or two days does not establish a trend and I think we need to watch closely over the next week or two to see how things resume after this past week s furor Bonus Charts In one of my previous posts I highlighted a possible breakout breakdown in ATVI and APPL respectively and wanted to revisit these charts ATVI 1y AAPL 1y ATVI broke above my signal line at the 98 99 range and then immediately broke down seemingly on news of a delay on a shareholder vote concerning the CEO s pay package Not a great look for the stock https www ft com content 2049c3fc bee9 490a a317 f406a7419d57 Meanwhile AAPL flirted with breaking below it s 200DMA and then immediately reversed and established an upward trend It s hitting resistance around the 130 level and I d say we d need to see this break out above the 135 136 level to be legit Previous https reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nz9rkk market perspective recent trends and performance

I made my post my account shot up to nearly 90k I actually think it went over 90k but Robinhood s all time chart isn t very exact on the numbers Side note one thing I want to mention about these charts is that the percentages are not accurate according to my account value at the time because I have been depositing over the years For example when I was 90k here that was actually around a 300

so many gains Well this was a long time ago and I make hundreds of trades per year so I will just focus on some of the highlights in this post and hopefully that ll be good enough for the mods My biggest gains during this time were AMZN calls prior to the 2020 crash and INO calls and SPY puts during the crash Here s a screenshot I took of one of my AMZN positions amp x200B AMZN gain 1 31 2020

during the 2020 crash Yes and no As I mentioned I made a lot of money on SPY puts during the crash I likely didn t screenshot these because it was a bunch of small quick trades I actually only made money during the initial crash and completely dodged that bullet So what did happen Well after the stock market rebounded significantly from the bottom I bet heavily that it would go back down And well as you know it didn t So I lost all of my massive gains to TSLA and SPY puts after the rebound only kept going up I managed to find a screenshot of some of those losses amp x200B Some SPY put

in late 2020 early 2021 I lost to TSLA puts and GME calls Both of these were good buys I just sold them too soon My TSLA puts were bought when TSLA was over 800 but I got impatient and sold a few weeks before it would ve made me money GME Well I don t want to talk about GME I sold just before it went crazy My position would have made me a millionaire I took a screenshot of my position before I sold because I had a feeling I would regret it amp x200B GME position 12 9 2020 https preview redd it zknq2bklch671 jpg width 1440 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s e6ac53d8bbc8970c5c322b4ae27d68ede8ea613d I bought in on the GME squeeze thesis posted here in WSB and I still believed in it at the time I sold But I had commented here that I was in on it and I started to worry about the legality of it and decided it wasn t worth it What an idiotic decision The TSLA puts and GME calls weren t actually the majority of my losses though That honor goes to my next position PFE calls This was actually another well timed buy that went wrong because I sold too soon I bought PFE almost exactly at the bottom in late Feb stock wise but as the stock kept rising my options kept deteriorating Eventually I couldn t handle watching my options and account fall to near zero while the stock kept rising and I gave up and sold Had I held on another week I would have made all of my money back Another 2 weeks and I would have had big gains I didn t screenshot this disaster and would have to dig through my history for details but I feel like no one would care to have these details Suffice to say it was about 1 000 call options the decayed despite upward stock movement And thankfully I made back all of my losses anyway as you can see from my all time chart After all of my disasters I decided I was done with short term trading and was just going to invest via LEAPs in some high growth companies So I did some DD and bought LEAPs on companies I thought were undervalued most notably SPCE XPEV and WISH I bought these planning to hold long term and didn t expect these would rocket higher immediately after I bought them I didn t screenshot full positions but here are some of the trades in my history if you feel you need proof for the recent gains amp x200B SPCE buys https preview redd it fr4u3i62dh671 png width 716 amp format png amp auto

to the same value now I could go into detail telling you why I like WISH so much right now but there are plenty of DD posts to be found What it boils down to is that this thing is still at less than half of its IPO value and I think it s severely oversold for a growing e commerce site regardless of what some people might think of the products You think the quality of products is too cheap to be successful I ll just kindly point you in the direction of DG and its chart Note I bought a lot of WISH shares here even though I don t usually buy shares The premium on WISH options is a bit high and I m trying to chill out a bit after my massive unexpected gains this last month I also have smaller positions in ACAD AYX QS and RUN I like a lot of other stocks right now but I just have my money tied up currently For example I want to start new positions in PLTR OPEN SNOW F AEVA and VIEW when I get a chance I also want to get back in SPCE and XPEV if I get a dip as well as hoping for a dip in some others like DIS and DDD and a ton of other companies whose stocks are just too expensive for me at the current moment I also don t think you d be wrong to be into metals especially nickel Hopefully I haven t mentioned any banned tickers here There are a lot of multibagger opportunities out there right now imo assuming hyperinflation and rising interest rates QT don t cause a massive bear market of course Although I feel like I m decent at this I also felt like I was decent at it before I lost 150k in 2020 and 2021 from high to low To be fair to myself the measures the government and Fed took to prop up the market economy were unprecedented when I bought those SPY puts and most of the recent losses on TSLA and PFE were good buys but bad sells i e sold too early But that doesn t change that I ultimately made a bad trade Anyway you can ask me for options or trading advice and I ll try to answer but honestly right now I m still not feeling the most qualified One last thing a lot of people down 50k which was like 90 of my account at the time or my recent 65k losses would have thrown in the towel on options completely I m proof you can turn it around I ve done it twice now That said I m also proof that you can lose it all quickly in the options world I wouldn t advise most people to do this I have separate retirement funds college funds for my children and make a decent living with a relatively secure job I would be okay if I lost it all This is just me trying to win a ticket to early retirement But don t do it if you can t afford to lose it

the worthless PnD and fake short squeeze DD that has overtaken our beloved home I am presenting a play that is not a short squeeze candidate not a pump n dump candidate and not some barely 1b market company I m hoping WSB can move This is a rock solid company entering a demand spiked growth phase that could see a 40 50 rally between now and eoy whether WSB is on board or not TLDR at the bottom GNRC 1 Silently taking over the solar market 2 Will benefit from power strain caused by what is becoming the hottest summer ever 3 Will benefit from an expectedly wild hurricane season Fundamentals Boring shit Keep scrolling if you want One thing is certain This company makes a fuck load of money especially in comparison to their small market cap Their EPS sits at 7 12 and their P e ratio is around 50x These may seem underwhelming but GNRC competes with solar companies For comparison RUN PE 0x EPS 83 SEDG PE 101x EPS 2 4 Basically GNRC makes lots of money selling generators and has ample cash flow to expand their solar market share against competitors that make no money Fully manufactured here in the US All parts and components are made and developed in house No chinese trade bs to worry about Recent Rapid Growth Generac Holdings net income for the quarter ending March 31 2021 was 149 million a 235 12 increase year over year Gross sales q1 2021 up 70 to 807 million compared to 476 million q1 of 2020 Thats a lot of fucking growth Massive growth potential 4x projected growth over the course of 3 5 years per company earnings releases There is currently a 4 6 month back log meaning a fuck ton of generators are being ordered and production must ramp up to meet demand To meet this demand Generac is expanding manufacturing out of Wisconsin with a new manufacturing plant in South Carolina completion expected in Q3 2021 The spike in orders will be reflected in future earnings Demand spike In addition to the solar boom hurricane season is fucking coming We ve already seen the idiots in Texas lose all their power and hopefully the dumb fucks like me in Florida and other hurricane states are taking notes The answer to power outages More fucking generators Example The tropical storm over the weekend has left hundreds of thousands of houses without power Missouri had nearly 50k houses lose power Example California power companies used power cuts this weekend due to the fire hazards and heat waves They will continue to do this to avoid another disaster like last year Housing market Unless you live in your mom s basement you probably know the housing market is booming California is basically requiring new homes to be built with solar panels and offering 10s of thousands of dollars in rebate if they buy home solar generator systems The PwrCell Generac s version of the tesla power wall is the best in terms of efficiency and power In Texas ERCOT is basically forcing people to buy home generators and solar systems Rolling blackouts are being used to curb energy usage so if you don t have a home generator then you lose power once a week Get Generac or get fuked i guess Is that bullish for all solar companies Yes but Generac makes the fucking best home solar system Better than tesla we ll get to that and can actually afford unlike other solar companies to meet demand Lack of competition there s two types of competition One is solar companies aka broke not profitable companies with massive expenses Then there s the other competition boomer shit like Cummins and black and decker who compete to be the knock off option in the generator sector None of these companies specialize in generators and none are in the solar market Generac is its own fucking thing positioned to make money from boomer shit like machinery and future shit like solar Merger and acquisitions GNRC acquired Deep Sea Electronics Jun 1 Deep Sea Electronics is one of the world s top manufacturers of generator controllers automatic transfer switch controllers battery chargers and vehicle amp off highway controllers Deep Sea Electronics employs over 160 people across four continents and sells products to over 150 countries direct from their UK head office through a comprehensive distributor network With a foothold in the UK this opens the door for expansion out of the U S Key Product in demand the GENERAC PwrCell is the most customizable and therefore affordable solar battery backup system PwrCell offers up to 13Kw can store up to 6 batteries for variability purposes charge is actually insanely faster more energy conservative and overall cheaper to install For comparison Tesla s solar unit can only provide up to 7 Kw of battery backup is 250 lbs and has only one model you would have to purchase multiple tesla units in order for it to actually power a home making it insanely expensive installers are moving away from product because not many people can afford it and they are chunky to install making labor much more It s actually a bitch and a half to install I ve been told Analysts fucking love it many raised Pts many from 400 410 some 410 These 400 price targets were stated BEFORE acquisition of Sea Electronics Price target jumps will continue as raters take global expansion into account 80 buy ratings 20 hold ratings 0 sell ratings 90 shares are held by the institution with a 4 0 ratio of insider buying to insider selling it means 4

is poised to benefit greatly from the hot temperatures of summer hurricanes power strain and housing boom Demand for Generac products has never been higher They make the best home solar power system and can afford to meet production and turn significant profit Additionally they re close to completion on a new manufacturing plant in South Carolina expected q3 2021 and have acquired a UK company to

876,o4gsps,t2_82mpba0w,1624228358,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o4gsps/bb_ape_due_diligence/,1, BB Ape Due Diligence,Yah we all got our dicks beaten off the last couple weeks from a juicy 20 price tag Did you sell it for a quick profit Maybe you did which is still a fair play Is this shit just going to bleed back to the 8 equilibrium like it always does I mean do you really think they have enough revenue to justify going higher than that I personally don t They will but not until IVY next year most likey However if you didn t do the above quick 2x move or if you happened to anyways and want to replicate another quick profit Stay in BB I ll tell you why 1 Inflation fears the fed J pow wow poo poo head tapering and interest rate fears We are in tumultuous times People are ready to pull out at the slightest sign of even discussing tapering and raising rates In addition there is a shit ton of uncertainty for inflation You can t really do anything for this other than try to time the market which we all know historically doesn t work well People are wondering where the most productive place to put their money is Is it gold Equities Global markets Do you just sit on cash There s tons of strategy here that hinges on unknown data which I quite frankly don t feel comfortable with How does this have anything to do with BB Well unless you are blind and deaf actually retarded you are well aware that BB got sucked back into the WSB movement Mixed feelings from people here Some believe this makes for a poor public image for investors since it is being portrayed as another meme stock which is bad for the company Some think even bad publicity is good publicity plus bag holders get converted into long term investors which is good for the company Regardless of where you stand though you can t deny that having the price pumped up in the short term provides a good opportunity to make money It gets to irrational levels that no longer follow fundamentals It is a pump and dump social movement that tries to get gamma squeezes and short squeezes to happen But this is no ordinary pump and dump We are in unique times where the dump is not so abrupt it actually keeps snowballing sometimes and finds new and higher floors Look at GME AMC These have been going on for 6 months 6 fucking months My lord That is insanely long And the sentiment is STILL THERE I m not saying that BB is going to be GME and AMC but I think it has a really good chance to It was part of the original 3 in January and got forgotten but reappeared It is the only one that hasn t seen it s gains This is why I think it is the most likely out of other tickers to gain legit long standing momentum None of this bullshit like WISH CLOV WKHS CLNE etc These will come and go Okay so what does this have to do with rates and Jpow the bad man that hurts us over and over again Remember the nasty growth and tech correction we saw in last few months Go to any tickers chart and you see massive losses of 20 80 That s fucked Okay now look at GME and AMC THESE MOTHER FUCKERS HEDGED A CORRECTION That is crazy That is something I would have never expected but here we are with them at even higher levels All because of WSB So if you are wondering if there is any ticker that can withstand another correction it would be a WSB pumped one BB has a good shot 2 Earnings week Yeah I just said up above that we won t have lots of revenue until a year from now A lot of us here likely know that this earnings report will be ass like always However these smooth brains in WSB don t They see it as a catalyst They see it as a reason to post and hype up BB Besides most WSB stocks got their ass gaped just yesterday The whole sentiment of the sub is crushed and filled with bag holders They need something to look forward to and pretty much the only thing in my eyes would be BB for earnings So even though BB has been decreasing in trend for their sub I highly believe it will become a prime target again In addition it is at lower levels that they would perceive as a dip to buy at relative to the 20 it got to earlier 3 Patent sales We all are waiting on this This is NOT priced in They have been discussing this for ages and this shit literally went to 8 months ago That s lower than it was in December when they announced AWS partnership We know this is coming soon We know it s massive We know it will be in the billions We know that it will add recurring revenue for years to come The market forgot about this That s why it went down to 8 and that s why a lot of smart people in this sub loaded the fuck up on BB even at sub 10 levels Now once it does get announced AND with WSB interest again you can only imagine what that would do to the price So what am I doing I m holding shares and buying more at these 12 13 levels with DCA I don t know what happens this weekend or Monday but let s just say I am not feeling super optimistic about accumulating more at these relatively lower levels to our recent run up because I really do think people will hype up earnings and it won t go lower in price However even with that if it still goes lower I am definitely buying more I might get hate for saying this because of the HODL mantra but I am going to incrementally lock in profits if it has another short term run up Until we have IVY or patent sales I just can t justify this being over 15 Some would even say 10 If it goes to 20 quickly I m locking some profits However let me say this This thing has serious potential to run up way higher I m talking 30 40 50 and hell even 100 If this becomes the lost one from the OG trio of AMC GME BB that gets its finally deserved attention it can most definitely run to such astronomical levels Let s be honest GME AMC are not fair value right now They have raised some money with selling shares but their companies don t have very bright futures compared to others BB is different It is a legit beast that is a sleeping giant and can become a tech giant This thing can definitely go very very high in a short while With that being said that is why even at a 20 run up I am not selling that many shares of BB I m going to sell in bunches incrementally at these different price points I set that make sense to me We are facing an opportunity of a lifetime with the WSB movement and BB The downside is way way less than the other stocks they pump too Use this as a short term opportunity to lock in some cash but also recognize the probabilities of it continuing to run up are actually not that low You will feel like an absolute tool if this thing goes to 50 and you sold all of your shares at 20 People didn t think AMC would go past 12 after it quickly doubled from 5 5 but look where we are today Make some quick profit Again I am very very bullish and long BB but this thing needs years of time before it fills its own shoes Use this opportunity though as a time to take advantage of easy cash and play the probabilities Tl dr BB can be a short term hedge to corrections as a WSB stock is the best WSB stock that is a legit company with promising future and has tremendous once in a lifetime short term opportunity for making a quick profit Earnings this week and recent beatings of WSB stocks cleans the slate and makes it a likely candidate for another pump Little downside and not being a long term investor in this company is kinda dumb
