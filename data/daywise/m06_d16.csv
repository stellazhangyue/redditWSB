DD is complete without thinking about the bear case Most recently Chewy a competitor of BARK reported profits but warned of labor shortages and supply disruptions Even though BARK is vertically integrated it is likely that it will have the same labor and supply disruptions as all businesses are facing Shortly before it s IPO BARK was accused of selling a chew stick that killed a pet There is no evidence the chew stick was responsible Instead of ignoring the allegation Barkbox immediately addressed it via social media and said it was working with the manufacturer to look into the death Barkbox immediately stopped distributing the item Their emphasis on doing the right thing speaks loudly to their ethos and means we can trust them to do the right thing and continually expand with their consumer base Market Reaction Buy rating and 16 PT from Cannacord Genuity analyst Maria Ripps Buy rating and 14 PT from Jefferies The stock IPO ed at 10 and has slowly risen and is at 11 35 on 6

goes This past year has been insanity and I think it has caused quite a bit of disillusionment and will also be detrimental to many bank accounts as we move increasingly closer to higher inflation and a rising rate environment Hear me out So some context following my trading style I was all over GME in late August when Cohen released his 13D GME was already on my radar because of Burry who s investing trading style I try to mimic DFV Raging Kitty Rod and others were also a big inspiration in spreading good solid DD It was a true deep value play When GME released its Q2 2020 results on September 8th it was terrifying because we dropped almost back below 6 however one thing shined through and that was the almost 1 billion in free cash flow fcf The big push after that ER drop of course was the Microsoft partnership That showed exactly how committed the console vendors were to keeping GME in business making a console is actually not profitable its the sales after the console and GME is a huge part in reducing Customer Acquisition Costs for console vendors Of course the SI was always the big thing 140 but it wasn t what made many of us have diamond hands it was the business and its crucial role in the gaming industry hell what made Burry go deep in GME When he got confirmation that the new console cycle would include disc drives Anyways my whole point is this what made GME GME was its deep value that it was in the infamous words of Burry A long term franchise trading at a significant discount from growing intrinsic value Which always is the preference when you are looking for the best possible trade to execute So what does this have to do with ViacomCBS VIAC Well it is precisely that it is a long term franchise trading at a significant discount from growing intrinsic value How so Ok first the basic test is this what is its margin of safety based on discounted cash flow analysis dcf what is its enterprise value divided by earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization ev ebitda and what is its price free cash flow This basic first pass test shows VIAC has 49 margin of safety 8 0 ev ebitda and 7 8 price to free cash flow These are all really really good for what is a long term franchise and they have over 3 billion in fcf a big fat number Yes debt is 19 billion but they have total assets of 54 billion Oh yeah p e is 9 8 which is not in my opinion the best metric for value but its pretty damn good Ok so they pass the basic deep value screener But the real clincher is this They aren t just value but are also showing GROWTH Burry pounds this home and he learned it from Graham amp Dodd and Buffet You don t look for just value or growth you find BOTH So how is VIAC doing this Well look at how aggressive management is with their streaming strategy which they are being extremely aggressive First we know they released Paramount in March rebranding CBS All Access Was it good no It was shit However they made it clear they are and did improve it They recently dropped 1 000 movies will drop a new movie every week starting in 2022 and importantly they will CEASE to license their content to third party streamers No more movies shows going to Netflix Amazon Besides CBS and Paramount Studios VIAC owns Nickelodeon Comedy Central BET MTV CMT VH1 and several other networks that have hugely popular series When they get all of that content exclusive to Paramount woah For instance look at Disney it took them about a year to get all the Marvel and Star Wars movies all centralized on Disney and when they did subs went through the roof Better believe ViacomCBS will get ALL their HUGE number of big movies and shows streaming exclusively to Paramount This is a big deal Of course VIAC owns Showtime doesn t hurt to mention they had the huge Mayweather PPV event this quarter and between Paramount Showtime and BET they have 36 million monthly active users MAUs I think we will also see a bundle of Paramount and Showtime and they just released an extremely cheap and competitive limited ad service for Paramount for 4 99 They are also being extremely aggressive with international markets you know the other billions and billions outside the United States Then there is Pluto TV their AVOD ad video on demand Paramount is an SVOD subscription on demand free TV streaming service literally free and excellent check it out if you haven t They paid 300 million for it back in 2019 it now has over 55 million global monthly active users MAUs and rising AVODs are the future and it is projected Pluto will bring in ONE BILLION in ad rev by 2022 That is huge Also over the top OTT advertising is the future and ViacomCBS owns the best OTT technology OTT is basically this based on your browsing history connected devices they will target you with ads that might be of interest to you not simply the ads that everyone sees This is the way all advertising will go and VIAC is leading the way with one of the biggest free AVOD services Pluto TV Finally Pluto TV is a super funnel to Paramount Everyone in the streaming business will tell you the gold standard is to have a strong AVOD and SVOD and that is what VIAC has Then of course there is Paramount Studios They just had the highest grossing movie of the pandemic A Quiet Place II But even more important the studio is fully reopened and in full production Huge Then of course CBS Sure older viewing audience but don t balk at that They have 6 of the top 10 shows in primetime TV That is HUGE ad revenue Also this quarter they had March Madness Finals Masters and the PGA Tour Finals that Mickelson won Then they have the NFL Champions League and so much more in terms of sports as well as the number one news network All that can be streamed live on Paramount That is just more growth more revenue and advantages other streaming services don t have The real important point is this however VIAC is the second largest content creator in the world second only behind Disney That is right the second largest producer of shows movies and sports In fact that is all they do They aren t a cable or phone company they don t run an amusement park They just make content and content is KING in the streaming business which is where we are all moving towards They are the only major content producer that is vertically integrated that is left standing i am not going to talk about merger and acquisition rumors but Shari Redstone is more amenable to selling than we all think and it makes VIAC incredibly valuable incredibly valuable VERTICALLY INTEGRATED That means they don t just produce content but they can distribute it via their own networks MGM bought by Amazon recently was not vertically integrated Now when you look at their market cap 26 billion relative to all the content they own and their networks to distribute that content they are INSANELY undervalued Bottom line this is a rare event like GME was If you re getting concerned about what is happening in this market what has happened over the last year and get a feeling the party is about to end Look even more into VIAC I m not going to pander and say I am a retarded autistic ape who eats crayons However I do eat a shitload of chicken tenders

Fidelity to TDAmeritrade but will be opening a YOLO position for July 16th amp Oct 15th My 9 option sweep for June 18th played in my favor already my money already made so this info is here for YOU IF YOU DON T LIKE READING YOU CAN STOP NOW If you recognize this stock you probably remember me messaging you last month since my karma rating was low I m back I made money with it I m not bag holding and I m here to tell you more Let s talk about oil I know oil companies aren t your favorite We all want to believe in and invest in renewable energy because we re all good people deep down inside I feel the same But I also know why you re here You want the Tesla Let your oil stocks buy you a renewable energy vehicle Shove it in their faces But if we re gonna be environmentally friendly while investing in oil lets talk FTIs progress Their greenhouse gas emission 3 YR average is significantly lower than the average for an oil company Despite working in regions with lower standards in 3rd world regions they have continued to reduce emissions and develop new technology to manufacture and implement subsea and land based oil extraction products Inevitable Inflation When you hear oil these days you hear a lot about inflation A few industries are more resilient to rising inflation and typically businesses and individuals will invest in commodities such as gold and oil or real estate to maintain their asset value through bad times On the other side of this traders often will turn to companies that produce such products as a hedge against inflation as the commodities maintain value so will their manufacturers Morningstar Ratings Morningstar has given 2 reports this year giving this company a fair value rating of 25 I m a little baffled that this has been sitting here between 7 10 this entire time but then again I know nothing about how this works But I know the reason behind it FTI has eliminated most of its debt by splitting its unprofitable company into another public company with less value This has allowed FTI to be poised in a much better position to lower its remaining debt over time This split led to its first profitable quarter Now it wasn t a whopping profit but it was profitable nonetheless Since that day the value of the stock has been rising on a fairly consistent basis and the upcoming earnings report on July 27th is expected to be a much higher profit than the last quarter given the last one was when the company had split off in the middle Given the fair value rating you re looking at a stock with a 150 gain possibility And we all know what happens if theres some unusual activity on the way to a fair value Volume The average trading volume of this company is fairly low Activity has increased tremendously over the last month not only in the traditional stock purchase but in options purchasing I ve been watching and purchasing this stock since March My first pick based on my own DD its my baby and its been good to me and I ve seen my own bids dramatically effect options prices and have seen single orders shoot the price in one direction or the other This could cause a very volatile stock with increased volume and could even see a massive increase from a single whale alone One More Thing I m tired of typing so you re on your own from here amp x200B https preview redd it mvcsi6ayrj571 png width 3230 amp format png amp auto webp

the good guys in the mortgage game as compared to the big banks amp x200B Ultimately there is some good long term value here but I think there is something kinda special here for the short term I want to quickly go over a few of the potential short term catalysts for this stock and some of the longer term ones Potential Short term Catalysts Options expiring in the money MMs forced to buy shares We re all familiar with the GameStop and AMC stock rallies as a large number of calls quickly became in the money from late January and early June respectively where GME went from 40 to 60 and AMC went from 30 to 60 I m NOT saying that that will be happening here but this would be the same mechanism A short recap on this mechanism and the requirements it occurs when there is a huge influx of short dated call options buying on a stock which forces the market makers like our favorite market maker https www youtube com watch v kaoBTbzR4Zs that sold the options to buy shares in order to hedge their short position link https www nasdaq com articles what is a gamma squeeze 2021 01 28 longer explanation We currently have about 55 000 in open interest calls that have been opened on 11C that expire this Friday link https finance yahoo com quote UWMC options p UWMC This is pretty substantial open interest and other OTM strikes also have high open interest The options market on this stock is not huge so the next options expiry date is on July 16 in other words this catalyst will no longer apply after this week as the next expiry date becomes too far out It seems that there is also a whale in play who was possibly making an intraday play but did purchase about 11 000 11C for 6 18 last Friday link https twitter com realwillmeade status 1403370227342233601 I know the source mentions Cramer and I fucking hate the grifting Cramer https www youtube com watch v pUmu0VJuwOA amp t 71s but we re not sure if that was what the whale was looking for in any case the Cramer appearance was very bullish So we have one of the requirements for forced market maker buying lots of short dated calls what we still need is additional buying this week to push the stock over the edge and force buying from the MMs It remains to be seen if we ll get this additional buying but I am optimistic Curiously enough on early Monday morning during the pre market this stock was over briefly over 10 80 which likely would ve triggered heavy buying from options sellers This was the same day that we had about 30 of the day s trades being short sells link https archive is wip 27nfA and a Wedbush downgrade

education and believe this is the future of education Even though I try to be critical in my research confirmation bias is a real thing Coursera research and valuation Thesis Due to the world experiencing COVID Coronavirus pandemic starting in 2020 regular life and how we view it changed radically One of the biggest sectors touched was is Education schools and Universities had to shift from in person to fully remote learning Even though e learning EdTech was one of the fastest growing markets the pandemic forced the adoption of technology faster and changed the education market forever There are 2 main factors for the growth of e learning Massive Online Open Courses MOOC industries People are looking for a higher pay change in a career Universities Education needs to move online or at least to offer a hybrid model of education People are looking for a higher pay change in a career Average number of jobs in a lifetime 12 Average job tenure is 4 3 years for men and 4 0 for women 75 of the workforce says they are planning to go back to education at some point in their life Only 14 of the U S workers believe they have the perfect job and more than a half want to change careers Universities Education needs to move online or at least to offer a hybrid model of education The value offered by universities and campuses has always been in question the pandemic pushed universities online and made them recalculate their fees and costs gt The pandemic pushed universities online The change was long overdue Harvard Business Review September 29 2020 Education is one of the least digitized sectors which suggest future technology disruption gt Measuring the Digital Economy SCB May 2019 Problems 62 of people identified money as a barrier to gain knowledge skill to advance or switch their career 60 of people identified time as a barrier to gain knowledge skill to advance or switch their career gt EdX survey July 10 2018 MOOCs is an answer to both of these problems it is not bound to schedule and usually is self paced so a person can do it on their free time while keeping a full time employment and in this way not lose income and it is eliminating campus and staff costs which makes it a lot cheaper When it comes to university education it offers more than just knowledge it offers networking campus life experience a chance for students to leave their parents home and get independent life experience This is something MOOCs cannot compete with and loses a big chunk of potential customers Market size The Massive Open Online Course MOOC market size is projected to reach 67 18 Bn by 2027 from 7 34 Bn in 2020 with a CAGR of 37 2 between 2021 2027 2020 has been the 9th year of modern MOOC movement and has crossed 180 million global learners excluding China 2020 provided 60 million new learners globally half of them is just by Coursera Company overview Coursera Inc operates an online educational content platform that connects learners educators and institutions It offers online courses that include data science business computer science information technology health social sciences logic project management and digital marketing services campus student plans degree courses and certification education Coursera Inc was formerly known as Dkandu Inc and changed its name to Coursera Inc in April 2012 The company was incorporated in 2011 and is based in Mountain View California How does it make money Coursera revenue is broken down into 3 segments Consumer learners paying monthly subscription fee 59 Entreprise companies buying packages to provide education to their employees 28 Degree universities using Coursera platform to provide full remote bachelor and master degrees 13 Revenue Growth Consumer Employers view online degrees credentials differently Online credentials are now mainstream with a solid majority 61 of HR leaders believing that credentials earned online are of generally equal quality to those completed in person up from lower percentages in years past Educational Credentials Come Of Age Center of the Future of Higher Education amp Talent Strategy December 2018 The value of education continues to increase which will drive an interest in people to gain new skills credentials Change in value of education in hiring vs 5 years ago 48 HR says the amount of education required for the same position increased 29 says stayed the same 23 says it declined gt Educational Credentials Come Of Age Center of the Future of Higher Education amp Talent Strategy December 2018 Another growth trend is attracting college dropouts 33 of students dropout every year The reasoning varies from financial issues and time constraints to dissatisfaction in education level Coursera offers addition of credits so students can pick up where they left off and do not need to start from the beginning This allows attracting not just new students who want to gain credentials in new fields but people who already started and would like to finish gt College dropout rates amp statistics 2021 Admissionsly 2021 Coursera total learners 2020 2021 increased by 56 The challenge will be to keep the growth after the pandemic Few of the factors it depends on Management experience in the continued growth of online services Reinvestments into growing the content library and keeping it updated with market needs Efficient marketing to target customers Penetration of Rest of the World markets 51 of all revenue comes from USA alone Enterprise Microcredentials and upskilling employees is essential to keep the company competitive 44 of employers report that they increased the level of education required for the same job roles over the last 5 years This will force companies to provide education knowledge updates to their employees to stay competitive in the market Another factor is employee retention rate 2019 LinkedIn Workforce Learning Report showed that 94 of employees would stay longer with the company if they helped them to learn and invested into upskilling That is a huge factor which will drive the growth of the enterprise education market and Coursera as a leader of the market is positioned for the big growth The enterprise revenue for Coursera grew by 47 from 2019 to 2020 and it is the second fastest growing revenue after degree service Degree 2019 2020 Degree segment grew by 97 this is mainly due to the pandemic universities were forced to find ways to deliver education to students Coursera offers online management services for universities helping institutions to launch online degree programs and share the revenue from tuition The further it goes the more universities will move online some will create their own platforms but only 5 college budget spending is dedicated to IT spending 2017 EDUCAUSE Core Data Service Benchmarking Report and creating the platform needs substantial investments Coursera as a market leader and recognizable name is positioned

financial advisor I am just an another Ape like you So please do your own research before following my analysis or any analysis presented to you by anyone for that matter Reopening of economy 1 Vaccination count is going up everyday and Covid 19 cases count has gone down drastically now daily Avg of new cases per day is below 10k 2 People have already started traveling for fun and going to their offices for work you can see the traffic on the streets and freeways 3 Also you can observe the price per gallon of the gas you put in your car whenever you go to refuel it it is way higher than what you used to put in pre pandemic time 4 Labor is back and factories will soon run at their full maximum capacity 5 There is 1 and half years of pent up demand for consumption travel and tourism which will unfold in next 1 year at least So there will be super huge demand for OIL going forward As it was pandemic caused slowdown recovery was K shaped Y2020 was good for Tech stocks But Y2021 is of companies who will benefit from Reopening of economy We all can observe that in our surrounding the economy is reopening explained above Moreover Economies around the world is not just reopening it is coming back with vengeance due to all the fiscal stimulus provided by Governments all around the world and quantitative easing programs run by central bank of all the developed and developing countries There is massive amount of money in the world now compared to its pre pandemic levels This massive liquidity is going to send prices of all the commodities higher in near future causing the INFLATION Now lets come to the main point OIL and GAS Short term outlook on OIH For next 2 years Lets look at the price chart of Oil price and compare it with the OIH amp x200B https preview redd it

Actually OIH follows the Crude oil rig counts and rig counts follows the OIL price So ultimately there is direct correlation between OIH ETF and OIL price Note Rig Count means the number of active drilling rigs Oil rig counts are steadily increasing due to higher oil demand and Elevated levels of oil price https oilprice com Energy Crude Oil US Oil Rig Count Rises As Crude Prices Climb Higher html https oilprice com Energy Crude Oil US Oil Rig Count Rises As Crude Prices Climb Higher html Also if we believe the trend and what OIL field analysts are saying that Oil price could reach 80 this summer https oilprice com Energy Energy General Oil Could Reach 80 This Summer But Theres A Catch html https oilprice com Energy Energy General Oil Could Reach 80 This Summer But Theres A Catch html Looking at the chart comparison anyone can easily guess that OIH ETF is extremely discounted at its current levels As per my analysis OIH deserves the price in the range between 440 to 480 and should regain that level very soon So OIH has at least 100 upside Plus considering current Oil price and its forecasts OIH might deserve more than above price range With oil demand projected to reach pre 2019 levels by the end of 2022 and supply tightening our oil and gas business is on the verge of an exceptional growth cycle Given our unique position and strategy we are positioned to deliver outstanding returns in the short and medium term Schlumberger CEO Olivier Le Peuch says at Bernstein conference Schlumberger represents 22 of the holding of OIH ETF https www nasdaq com articles why schlumberger stock surged 15 8 in may 2021 06 07 https www nasdaq com articles why schlumberger stock surged 15 8 in may 2021 06 07 amp x200B There are still many investors who have parked their money in Tech stocks Before Fed JPowell makes his move to stop QA many of those investors will rebalance their portfolio and move to Energy and other reopening stocks I am sure this is going to happen in next couple of months So my friends in wallstreetbets be the first and grab your pie in OIH ETF Risk factor for the OIH Biggest risk factor to OIH ETF is falling Oil prices In current conditions Oil price might fall due to 2 main things 1 If OPEC increases the Oil production above what is expected 2 If Oil demand falls due to Covid 19 coming back IMO Chances of occurring 2nd thing looks slim with availability of vaccines and approval to vaccines from different drug companies Long term outlook on OIH As per my analysis longer term outlook for OIH is still looks good Because Oil demand is not going anywhere at least for next 10 15 years You might ask what about the Wall street favorites green energy companies they might eat all the investments coming into the Oil sector In my opinion The current trend about the green energy companies Solar wind hydrogen EV is just a bubble like 1999 dotcom boom and following burst of tech stocks in Y2000 So sooner or later it will burst and that investment flow directly into Oil and Gas sector in short term I am not against the investments done into the Green Energy it is the need of the hour to stop global warming I am actually pro green energy companies but we can t ignore the demand for Oil and Gas Oil and Gas is our present Green Energy is our future We can t suddenly stop investments into Oil amp Gas its not feasible and practically viable Some ecologists and politicians urge for a hasty energy transition yet it requires an unrealistically fast launch of renewable energy sources and faces issues with storage ensuring reliability and stability of power generation CEO of Russian oil giant Rosneft https www worldoil com news 2021 6 4 russia s rosneft projects global oil shortages during hasty energy transition https www worldoil com news 2021 6 4 russia s rosneft projects global oil shortages during hasty energy transition SUMMARY Till now OIH ETF train had a good run in 1st half of Y2021 and now it has slowed down for some time This is the time you can catch the train before its too late The train will speed up soon in 2nd half of 2021 its next stop will be 340 and then 460 and beyond Note I have position in OIH stocks and Calls

gained a lot of popularity because of Wallstreetbets and rightfully so in my opinion They sell computer peripherals gaming and studio accessories custom made PCs components services and so on effectively offering customers a one stop shop for anything related to computer hardware gaming software and other computer services The company believes that they can address a market size of up to 46B or about 24 times larger than their current market share of 1 9B and they are expanding rapidly to make this happen Over the last 12 months Corsair acquired 3 new companies and launched 84 new products while showing a 47 growth in revenue in the latest quarter as compared to last year 104 growth in gross profit and a staggering 197 growth in adjusted EBITDA So how are they achieving this massive growth Essentially Corsair is trying to tap two of the fastest growing markets right now gaming and eSports plus digital content creation which can be seen in their two main revenue streams Gaming Component and Systems and Gamer and Creator Peripherals which were split relatively evenly last quarter in terms of sales Corsair is using the growth in the eSports market which is estimated to grow 11 annually over the next 5 years to kickstart their own growth If you think about it all of those millennials that grew up playing games are now able to afford specialised gaming gear which is what Corsair is offering We re also seeing a big number of Generation Z entering the labour market and being able to afford more expensive gaming gear Gaming and esports have already become mainstream with professional gamers earning serious cash and rivalling mainstream sport athletes in earnings so we can tell that this is just the beginning of it The digital content creation market is also growing at an annual rate of 13 across the board YouTube Twitch and other video streaming and podcasting platforms are experiencing a massive surge in both creators and users Corsair wants to use to this to drive their sales using their Creator Peripherals products Working from home has also led a lot of people to improve their home offices and that trend is here to stay which provides even more opportunities for Corsair to tap into yet another growing market Finally the company wants to convert existing customers into loyal customers that come back to buy again and again and again To do that they are driving engagement through social media and they currently have a combined following of over 20mln across 4 different social media websites plus they are represented by over 800 different influencers with a reach of over 1 3B people They also offer customisation and personalisation in their products they are focusing to be the best in class hardware and on selling solutions services and software that will cater to the needs of gamers and creators Customer retention is always a winning strategy for companies when it comes down to optimising earnings and it is good to see that Corsair is focusing on it although I would also like them to start sharing some KPIs that track this Bullish Thesis Before I go into my bullish thesis I want to point out that the current stock price that I am looking at is 36 Alright so the company doesn t really have any strong rivals in my opinion which is a strong bullish argument There is Pegatron but the company has suffered a lot over the last year due to labor violations Another is Razer but they haven t shown a lot of promise over the last year either The closest rival is probably Logitech but their business model and strategy are much different than Corsair s and I think that Corsair has a much better positioning to tap into the growing markets Still both Logitech and Corsair have performed amazingly over the last 12 months although I see Corsair as having a much better potential for growth Right now it is only a seventh of the size of Logitech with a 3 3B market cap versus Logitech s 21 7B although Corsair s revenue is less than 3 times smaller than Logitech s with a 1 9B vs 5 2B in revenue Their Price to Sales ratio is 1 74 for Corsair and 4 14 for Logitech so we can see that Corsair is actually undervalued in terms of sales The main reason why Corsair is lagging behind is their net income which is still relatively low but as I mentioned earlier in this video their growth is supercharged and off the charts Plus this is completely understandable for a company that is in its early growth phase Another bullish argument is the fact that a lot of hedge funds and institutions are betting AGAINST Corsair which gives us the opportunity for a short squeeze About 18 of Corsair s share float is shorted which is extremely high and completely unjustified in my opinion The company is performing extremely well and they are trading at a low price Their forward PE is only 17 9 which is tiny for a growth company as opposed to Logitech s forward PE of 27 Plus Corsair absolutely CRUSHED their latest earnings beating earnings per share by 0 25 or about 75 They also beat their revenue estimate by 76M or almost 17 AND to top it all of they raised their guidance but the price still dropped Analysts keep revising their earnings estimates up which is yet another bullish signal Plus Corsair has enough current assets to cover their current liabilities and has a low debt so financial health is not really a problem They have one Venture Capital fund EagleTree Capital hold 62 of the company and insiders hold another 4 which gives us a massive absolutely massive opportunity for price growth especially when we look at their tiny market cap I honestly think that Corsair can easily double in price and still be a relatively good purchase The company is that good Finbox s DCF model currently gives us a 43 upside with a target price of 51 5 and SimplyWallstreet s DCF model gives us a fair value of 80 3 a 123 upside so we can see that there are some decent bullish arguments behind Corsair However you look at it Corsair is a beast of a company and an absolute bargain There is no point in technical analysis right now WSB boosted the stock and distorted all the signals The only thing that s worth looking at is the 50D MA which is currently around 32 33 and whether it will act as support for the current price We can reasonably expect 40 42 to serve as a resistance at this point Final thoughts Honestly out of all the companies that I ve been researching recently this one looks the most promising Corsair is one of my biggest holdings right now and I will just keep adding to it

have jumped 5 in May making it the fastest increase since summer of 2008 and the Federal Reserve s June meeting is expected to conclude on Wednesday they might tweak their forecasts for interest rates I figured it was time to dive deep into What are the best strategies we can use to hedge against inflation Data https preview redd it 9v1yt7xcrm571 png width 1057 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 44706a74f62cee1bd1f263e8aa2d69d4b13629fe Even though slightly higher inflation was expected due to the stimulus checks and the reopening of the economy the current trends are worrying As we can see from the chart even though inflation trends till March were manageable now it seems to be picking up pace May 21 CPI is almost 2 8X May 19 CPI 2020 CPI was down mainly because of the strict lockdowns following the pandemic Keeping an inflation hedged asset class in your portfolio during this transitionary period can work out well in case we go into a steeply rising inflation This brings us to what are the Best asset classes that can be used as a hedge against inflation Stocks Stocks are a good long term investment to hedge against inflation Even though you might have a short term impact due to the uncertainties surrounding inflation great companies would be able to pass on the increasing price to the customers You must look into companies with pricing power think Apple to raise prices on their customers without significantly affecting their overall sales One important type of stock to avoid is high growth stocks as the valuation of the company is heavily based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company thereby detracting a lot of value investors Commodities Commodities are raw materials used for creating the products consumers buy It provides both inflation protection and diversification to your portfolio Because commodities are real assets they tend to benefit from rising inflation As demand for goods and services increases the price of those goods and services usually rises as well as do the prices of the commodities used to produce those goods and services As you can see from the below chart commodities have a weak correlation to both Equity and Bond markets https preview redd it icm0brnerm571 png width 363 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 754c5ee41a429861f4cfe25acef728f31c8a2618 Real Estate and Real Estate Investment Trusts REITs Real estate income rises with inflation As inflation rises so do property value and the amount you can charge for rent Given the normal forms of real estate requires high initial investments an alternative could be REITs A REIT consist of a pool of real estate commercial residential and industrial properties that pays out dividends to its investors According to this study https realestate wharton upenn edu wp content uploads 2017 03 716 pdf conducted by the Wharton School of Business gt Consumer price inflation CPI in the U S was 13 5 during 1979 the worst year since 1947 Dividend income from REITs traded through the stock exchange averaged 21 2 that year and total returns amounted to 24 4 more than preserving for REIT investors the purchasing power that they had lost to inflation Treasury Inflation Protected Securities TIPS Never in my wildest dreams I would have imagined writing about treasury bonds in wallstreetbets Yet here we are TIPS are a type of treasury security issued by the US govt which is indexed to inflation As inflation rises TIPS adjusts in price to maintain it s real value To make it simpler if you invest 100 in TIPS and the coupon rate is 1 if there is no inflation you will receive 1 for coupon payments that year If inflation rises by 5 they will adjust the coupon so that you get 1 05 instead of the 1 International Diversification There are several well developed economies outside the US that do not rise and fall in relation to the US market Italy Australia etc Adding stocks bonds from these or similar countries can help hedge the portfolio against sudden local swings Gold Gold is often touted as one of the best methods to hedge against inflation I have kept it last as the performance of gold during previous inflationary periods has been spotty https preview redd it gdwkgb9grm571 png width 624 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f0785e15a993d10e35490f424afa862fa9a45e44 Gold investors lose 10 on average from 1980 84 when the annual inflation rate was 6 5 and lost 7 6 from 1988 91 when inflation was 4 6 But the performance of gold was spectacular during the period of 1973 79 when the inflation was 8 8 The mixed record raises some concerns about using Gold as a hedge against inflation Conclusion Whether we like it or not inflation is here The only question right now is whether it s going to transitionary as the Fed s explained or whether the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force Fed to increase their interest rates The Federal Reserve meeting that concludes today will finally give us some insight into how they are going to tackle the current spike in inflation Whatever their decision may be it s a good idea to prepare some hedging strategies for your portfolio Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor

saying I ve invested nearly 6MM in what I believe to be a generational investment opportunity brought about by significant cost disruption in satellite launch costs innovations in marrying satellite technology to low earth orbit LEO applications and advances in LTE network architecture We are early in the commercialization of LEO and ASTS is at the vanguard Inside of SpaceX most investors rest their hat on the value of Starlink which will provide FIXED POINT broadband to customers albeit at very high costs and with unclear quality They value is at 40bn This equates to 200 per share for ASTS by way of comparison So there is a there there in terms of what we are playing for here Just like Facebook found out after it s IPO the real market is and always will be in MOBILE Starlink cannot translate to mobile unless you intend to haul a trailer behind you with a satellite dish See below for an artist rendition of Starlink s mobile solution vs ASTS actual mobile solution your existing handset amp x200B Haha let s get back to business read on https preview redd it g1qny0og6k571 png width 918 amp format png amp auto webp amp s a6899104fbe13f6bf1e69417ade25940a9aee38b ASTS AST Spacemobile has re imagined what s possible after the significant cost disruption in satellite launch which has allowed it to marry two key innovations to provide satellite connectivity to A REGULAR MOBILE DEVICE amp x200B 1 Because launch costs are just a fraction of what they used to be ASTS is launching satellites 10x as large as those of traditional satellite phone satellites This allows the satellite to do the work not the phone 2 By innovating with software ASTS can make the satellite connection work with existing LTE networks by only working with the carriers ground terminals to compensate for the Doppler effect importantly ASTS works with any normal phone without requiring any modifications Here is the overview of the FACTS PRODUCT ASTS is building the first of a kind and only space based cellular broadband network that is direct to device a consumer s existing handset will work with ASTS s service in tandem with traditional terrestrial mobile service ASTS also works with IoT enabled devices The constellation utilizes low and mid band frequencies shared with partners on a non interference basis ASTS does not use mobile satellite spectrum but instead delivers service over spectrum allocated for terrestrial mobile use ASTS utilizes high throughput backhaul to terrestrial networks The service will eliminate coverage gaps is compatible with all phones provides broadband data speeds and is accessible via one click on a user s device MARKET ASTS is targeting the large mobile 5G market specifically in markets where terrestrial infrastructure e g towers is less developed ASTS is a beneficiary of the following secular trends i falling launch costs ii high smartphone penetration iii broadband demand iv 5G IoT proliferation ASTS cites 3 3BN people who are covered but not connected to cellular broadband and another 700MM people who are not covered by existing networks and not connected Key regional opportunities include India Africa and Equatorial regions The service is well suited for low medium density sites as well as for emergency back up during natural disasters MANAGEMENT CEO Avellan holds 18 patents and was the founder of Emerging Markets Communications sold for 550MM in 2016 The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK Globecomm NASA and Maxar The team has 161 scientists and engineers 34 of whom are PhDs COMPETITION ASTS competes with high cost legacy providers including Iridium Legacy satellite providers require unique handsets for users to connect ASTS also competes with the build out of standard terrestrial 5G mobile equipment Competitor Lynk advertises a similar product but appears significantly behind both with respect to commercial financial and technical milestones OTHER Investors include Vodafone Rakuten American Tower and Samsung all of whom recently invested in the Company s latest financing The Company s own coverage banker at Barclays QUIT his job to join ASTS The dogs are eating the dog food TIMELINE April 2019 BW 1 was launched the test satellite validating system architecture and proving they could connect a mobile phone to a satellite and connect to an LTE system 2H 2021E will launch BW3 which is a scaled version of the constellation satellite 2H 2022E 1H 2023E first commercial launches of 20 satellites for Equatorial coverage with 110 satellites by YE 2023 and 168 satellites by YE 2024 ANALYSIS THIS IS MY OPINION AND SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION AND DISAGREEMENT ASTS is an exciting event driven story stock with open ended upside that is cemented in reality by proven entrepreneurs significant industry backing and bone fide strategic agreements in place that address key commercial aspects of the business Management funded the seed capital for the business highlighting their confidence and skin in the game Targeting mobile 5G is a big idea that augments that excitement generated by fixed broadband players such as Starlink while addressing the cost accessibility issues that are likely to be present in developing markets The stock benefits from a dynamic where it cannot be disproven leaving investors free to speculate and discount key assumptions including service penetration among partner carriers and ARPU The investment set up is favorable since a high capital intensity space venture is poorly suited for private markets yet requires the capital available in the SPAC market the set up is not a foist by private market investors onto unsuspecting retail investors but instead a legitimate capital raising exercise to fully fund the project and remove financing risk With 1 year lock ups on existing investors and PIPE investors there will be limited free float in what amounted to a public Series C financing Given future CAPEX Wall Street banks will see a large future banking opportunity and likely initiate favorable coverage on the Company RISKS While the BlueWalker satellite provided proof of concept there are questions around whether ASTS will work at scale when the constellation is deployed Users might experience significant battery drain on their devices when using the service reducing appeal for full tower placement Realized user penetration and ARPU remain uncertain as well as the ability to raise future capital for full system deployment at prices that avoid excessive dilution ASTS will depend on capital markets to fully fund its growth and is susceptible to potential funding risk INVESTMENT CHECKLIST Good hygiene to make sure something can make money as an investment BUSINESS MODEL ASTS will receive a 50 50 revenue split with its carrier partners including Vodafone and AT amp T given its large fixed cost base the Company expects to generate 90 asset level EBITDA margins that provide significant operating leverage and cash flow GO TO MARKET In place binding agreements with carriers provide ASTS with access to gt 1 3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers or directly bear the cost of churn Phase 1 will target key Equatorial regions and cover 1 6BN people subsequent phases expand into Europe and N America the total system will require 168 satellites by 2024 DEFENSIBILITY ASTS has 750 patents as well as a first mover advantage Commercial progress reinforces the Company s technical lead in the market CAPITAL ASTS is capital intensive and subject to capital availability to complete its full system Once the constellation is complete the Company benefits from extreme operating leverage and should have extremely high cash flow conversation TRACTION ASTS appears to have extraordinary commercial partnership traction however it is yet unclear what end user uptake the usage will be Technical traction was proved by the April 2019 launch of the Bluewalker 1 test satellite FINANCIALS With a market cap of 1 8bn the company is expected to generate gt 1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched 27MM total

to provide direct to device service to normal phones BOOMBOX IN SPACE ASTS satellites are 10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell phone towers in space With a 900 square meter array the system is a large loud system that can connect with a regular mobile phone Traditional satellite phones listen hard whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones SOFTWARE ASTS system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial spectrum and telecom networks The magic of the technology is the back end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum seamlessly interconnect over existing networks and talk directly to an LTE system ASTS is 6G forward compatible BACKHAUL Once the signal is collected from a handset ASTS sends the data back on B Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system The phone satellite connection is native to the carrier s terrestrial spectrum CAPACITY Each satellite can handle 1 2MM GB per month extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area WHAT DO WE KNOW What has ASTS done to prove its system o Bluewalker1 proved the RF could close e g the power was sufficient to connect a normal phone and that an LTE connection was achievable utilizing ASTS magic software ASTS launched a handset into space with the satellite on the ground to cost effectively check an important element of technical diligence Bluewalker1 allowed for end to end connectivity testing which has been reviewed over the last 1 5 years o Bluewalker3 2H 2021 launch will be a scaled version of the system which will de risk components and demonstrate the full technology BW3 will allow for software debugging to tune the full system RISKS Most of the risks are timing risks For instance Bluewalker3 could spur the need to tune microns which could delay the system deployment by months The troubleshooting required will be the beam forming in patterns to maintain a connection while managing handoffs A launch vehicle delay could delay the testing by 60 to 90 days BENT PIPE The satellite itself is not complex it is bent pipe in the sky most of the design relates to distributing power The satellite itself is not involved with processing or routing DISCLOSURE I own 500 401 shares of common Yes this is a huge position You only live once invest carefully and with great vision To avoid accusations of being a shill below is proof of my position I m grateful for the moderators working

46213501992f1d2b9a2a4ee67a015eb6a5bc9231 Essentially SBTech creates the platforms for sportbooks They are the data analytics They don t own psychical sportsbooks rather they create the software for websites to lease out and use for their own branding HR believe s that SBTech has been leasing their software to illegal sportsbooks in Asian via a pseudo company BTI company kind of ironic right the man who used pseudo accounts to spew false information is now accusing another company of using a pseudo name all because of their locality their offices are close they offer a picture of google maps to show this lmao they have similar source code they literally went into google chrome and inspected their website code you can find similar script comparing source code for ANY website and their CEO BTI Company is friends with the founder of SBTech people who are in similar business tend to work together But the factor of the matter is a quick google search from Bit Core Tech http bitcoretech com and SBTech can tell you that the two companies are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT Lastly they use hypothetical sources stating that they talked to prior employees of SBTech saying everything they do is illegal

January and early February The inflation rate collateral issues and reverse repos are all factors that lead me to believe that investors are inching ever so closer to creating heavy losses for hedge funds and short sellers As you may be aware during the AMC shareholder count that occurred on June 2nd CEO Adam Aaron stated retail investors comprise 80 of AMC shares with each individual averaging about 120 shares each As of 9am EST this Wednesday morning AMC has seen 1 76 million trades and despite no new huge news it s already seeing a gradual decrease from yesterday s close So why are so many people selling That s the thing I don t think we are Earlier this morning Jim Cramer commented on AMC s price action in a tweet https twitter com jimcramer status 1405138423741100033 Meme people AMC is down I think it s time to burst in Now this is entirely speculation on my part but I believe that this could be serving as a cover for a short ladder attack which is something that many GME AMC and other tickers are familiar with That being said I do expect the rest of today and this trading week to be rather ugly However no one said that a ride to the moon would be a smooth one In the past 5 months alone retail investors have caused billions of dollars worth of losses to hedge funds and overall people that want to screw over working class people In fact this past Monday the 14th when AMC surged 15 it caused over 515 million worth of losses This is chump change compared to some of the other numbers we ve seen but they add up Another interesting piece of information I learned is that recent reports showed that AMC is the most traded stock on Fidelity and Freetrade and the 3rd most traded stock on Robinhood Just take look below amp amp amp x200B https preview redd it

you can see sentiment for AMC remains high across multiple brokerages amp amp amp x200B https preview redd it ji7s761s0n571 png width 1940 amp amp amp format png amp amp amp auto webp amp amp amp s 3d5937d5adab17070ada855f0ec8beb31a600bf8 As of June 2nd AMC has managed to remain above 42 72 and this has continued for two whole weeks This has resulted in devastating losses for short sellers It went as far as touching 70 just two weeks ago And although it is currently in the mid 50 s range I believe that bullish sentiment from traders will allow it to continue to climb even in the face of short ladder attacks According to the data on Webull AMC has seen more large scale orders recently This might be due to the amount of options expiring this Friday the 18th Down below I ve listed the large scale buy orders placed and executed in the last 5 trading days 6 09 1 829 580 6 10 4 826 810 6 11 6 961 840 6 14 5 458 670 6 15 9 946 860 Mind you this is the net value of all large scale orders that were placed those days In other words it took the difference from all the large scale buys as well as the large scale sells The final numbers for all of those dates came out to a positive number meaning there were more buys than sells That doesn t even take into account people buying from RH Etrade Fidelity etc Needless to say buying pressure is immense right now which may the reason there has been an increase of FUD shills and bots trying to direct people away from AMC and into other tickers and ultimately tricking them into losing their money into a pump and dump In terms of good news AMC is currently poised to become the dominant movie theatre chain in L A which would include two shopping mall locations With both tourists and locals visiting during the summer and with more and more Americans receiving the vaccine and the desire to return to normal coming along with it it wouldn t be a surprise to see significant increases in revenue as time goes on This change might not be an immediate one of course but it does force investors to consider the long term plays that come with it Short sellers can t hold forever but investors can Short interest will slowly eat away at them and one day as we all know they ll be forced to cover When this happens it ll be every man for himself Seeing as to how many of us control the stock though we could in theory just not sell which would cause an unprecedented rise in stock price It should be common sense by now that we know that this cannot be accomplished by a single individual hence the phrase Apes together strong TL DR I feel as though bitch boy Cramer and his ass kissing gay bear friends are working extra hard to get people to paper hand He wants our bananas but I refuse to give it to him I think there are plenty of catalysts that not only make the current price sustainable but on the verge of further increasing As always I m not a financial advisor Do your own research before making any investment decisions I just like the stock AMC to the moon my friends

play that should satisfy your summer shart desires From the degenerate behind The WOOF of Wall Street https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nzq2ke the woof of wall street a shart play dd and TX Latin America s Balls of Steel https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nx74mo tx dd ternium it up latin americas balls of steel I introduce to you LESL A S H A R T DD The Poolpercycle To give context behind why I decided to look into Leslies Swimming Pool Supplies I will first educate you retards on the ongoing Poolpercyle pool supercycle Housing prices are at all time highs lumber prices skyrocketed and every commodity is rising in price faster than your dicks on Viagra JPOW continues to suppress inflation as the money printer goes brrrr with my suspicions being that him and Yellen are making love to the sounds of the money printer going brrrrrr jk Chlorine is a prime commodity that has undergone severe shortages recently and Leslie Swimming Pool Supplies is about to take full advantage of every penny faster than Krabs can say money money money As reopening continues in the United States many Americans are still at home and in a rush to build pools in their backyards to avoid the local summer crowds New homeowners who had to deal with inflated housing prices are seeking to get pools built on their own rather than purchasing a house that already has one Past the one time expense of getting a pool built most companies such as Leslie capitalize on the everlasting maintenance and servicing needed to ensure your kid s pool piss is cleaned in time Currently there are approximately 5 2 million residential inground pools and 255 000 commercial pools across the United States Of these approximately 65 necessitate the use of chlorine tablets These tablets are used in the filtration and sterilization process to ensure each pool is void of disease and bodily fluids that your 5 year old cousin dumps into the ecosystem Within 2020 and through 2021 there are an estimated additional 200 000 new residential pools being installed Additionally the sale of permits required to operate certain pools has risen by 32 nearly 85 more than the previous year Coincidentally and to the advantage of this DD the Bio Lab factory which produces pool and spa treatment products experienced a devastating fire last summer after Hurricane Laura To this date the nation is experiencing a chlorine shortage as a result of this fire As given by chlorine analysts IHS Markit predicts chlorine prices could jump 70 this following summer after already doubling in some areas in the months following the fire at BioLab The real effects of that fire haven t been felt as it took place right before Labor Day when many pools close for the end of summer What this shows me is that there is still a large upside and that the worst of the shortage s impact on pool prices is yet to come My research has led to one conclusion What we are seeing is an unprecedented intersection between rising commodity prices shortages and high pent up demand for summer pool builds The time has never been more perfect to invest in companies dealing with the Pool Boom aka Poolpercycle amp x200B So who is Leslie and why the fuck is she selling pool supplies Leslie s Swimming Pool Supplies is the largest direct to consumer brand in the U S pool and spa industry Operating since 1963 at the dawn of the age of suburban pools Leslie has nearly 940 physical locations and an expansive e commerce platform that rivals most local brands They specialize in residential pools and spas as well as commercial pools and even custom builds The company sells maintenance items such as chemicals equipment and parts and cleaning and maintenance equipment as well as safety recreational and fitness related products Their diverse array of expertise caters to clients of all needs and wants proving their business model to be quite adaptive 80 of their sales are non discretionary which in autist terms means necessary essential purchases By solidifying a model that is almost completely based on necessary purchases Leslie stands to profit from the Pool Boom for years to come Finally you can profit off of the Chad poolboy banging your wife Leslie s also benefits year round as pools need to be maintained even in the winter Failure to do so results in imminent degradation of the pool s foundation and ultimately risks collapse or inground flooding Additionally without maintaining a clean filtration and treatment system the overall pool system could be damaged and need further replacement incurring unnecessary costs As a result most residential and commercial customers prefer to buy those sweet sweet essential chlorine products from Leslie s Cock and Ball torture sponsored by Leslie Chlorine Pellets https preview redd it ny2izwzcdn571 png width 170 amp format png amp auto webp amp s ebc2c67167d991f52cd9de0a2523b32377985cfe Piss In The Pool Look Ma I m Peeing proceeds to

profit 2 simple reasons When little James sharts himself in the pool you re not cleaning that up yourself Leslie is vertically integrated and produces its own chlorine pellets By being its own manufacturer and reseller Leslie incurs no additional costs that other pool companies have to pay when buying these pellets wholesale As of now 45 of profits come directly from the pellet sales Their main competitors such as Holiday Pools have been severely impacted by the Louisiana chemical plant fire and face in store shortages Leslie does face chlorine pellet and product shortages as well which I highlight in the Case but I believe that by producing their own products a shortage at Leslie means a shortage at every other pool store There would simply be no other place to shop from save for paying high premiums on overseas products Leslie s futher offsets costs to its customers with a fuck you pay me approach similar to what TX has done with steel Buying stocks that directly deal with chlorine distribution can be more risky if commodity prices suddenly fall or shortages are resolved LESL gives zero fucks as it will profit regardless while one thing remains constant demand With Love amp Loyalty From Leslie Leslie may be increasing costs on the consumer end but it recognizes the pool demand boom and continues to expand rewards and education programs to help its customers make better purchases and improve their pools quality Leslie s Pool Perks is a new loyalty program that boosts its e commerce presence by offering free shipping on all orders 5 rewards points on every purchase and special discounts through its app including many extended warranties With inground pools costing 35 000 and above ground pools near a cost of 3 000 rewards points alone would range from 150 to 2000 all of which would cover future chlorine pellet necessities Leslie has also started a joint educational program this summer with the YMCA to teach safe pool maintenance and usage practices as well as the risks associated with inground pool play That ll teach your wife to not fuck her boyfriend in the water Based on this information I believe that the investments Leslie is continuously making in its customer base show it is dedicated to provide a quality experience while racking up profits in the process The H A R T Play Hype LESL has been mentioned here before if minimally There was also a Pool Gang in the past who got shit on due to bad market timing and suppressed price movement I will discuss this soon IV is moderately high ranging from 50 to 80 as of writing this which tells me this is still a good options play if you believe that Leslie is a good buy Availability As mentioned in past DDs when I say availability it is meant to measure the demand of the goods and services provided by said company Leslie s products have extreme demand and not enough supply In the short term this may seem detrimental as customers won t always get enough supplies but in the long run this is extremely profitable Plus who else are they going to buy from Raj from Pool Support Really Memeable LESL is quite memable for 2 reasons 1 For fucks sake Leslie sounds like Becky s side bitch who takes two shots and falls asleep 2 LESL and pools can coin the phrase Drown the Shorts amp x200B Timing This may be the best entry point in a long time With the FOMC meeting today and JPOW shenanigans LESL may dip further bringing its price point down to levels not seen since December Additionally LESL put call ratio continues to grow giving a golden opportunity to catch price action off guard Financials My bathtub the size of swimming pools Future https preview redd it ymle9yuldn571 png width 344 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 8040f02d502b3fb86a256281b1c4c3fbc1e4a225 LESL is smart and went public this past fall right when chlorine shortages started to impact supply across the nation Over the past 57 years they have had consecutive sales growth at 7 1 CAGR since 2001 For Q1 of 2021 Leslies was expected to have a 0 1 EPS but ended with a 0 02 EPS indicating a 80 beat For Q2 of 2021 the expected EPS is 0 53 or nearly a 2600 increase over one quarter Additionally just yesterday Leslie released forward guidance indicating an expected EPS of 0 75 which would indicate 3750 EPS growth Leslie s physical footprint through retail now exceeds all 20 of its competitors combined This is essential to sustained growth because when looking at P E growth as well it is clear competitors may be overpriced relative to LESL Pool Corporation has a P E ratio of 40 75 and serves as one of the largest competitors to Leslie s due to its vast network of clients If we calculate Leslie s P E ratio based on the expected EPS of 0 75 the predicted P E is approximately 36 However the stock price does not reflect this value correctly Leslie s adjusted EBITDA of 9 5 million compared to 8 1 million in the prior year quarter showed an improvement of 17 6 million They also raised their fiscal 2021 sales outlook by 75 million Adjusted EBITDA by 25 million and Adjusted net income per share by 0 10 Gross profit increased 79 6 to 71 7 million from 39 9 million in the second quarter of 2020 and gross margin was 37 2 compared to 31 6 in the second quarter of 2020 an increase of 567 basis points Following the news of forward guidance that beat analyst estimates by 50 LESL dropped 1 and an overall 13 this month as the massive red dildos annihilated calls Considering the immense growth LESL has gained over the past quarter it s stock price should be around 32 35 at fair value Price Action Here s where things get interesting with the price action The price point of LESL continued to grow upwards as shortages began to impact consumer goods early 2021 However despite increased earnings higher EBITDA and large scale customer improvements LESL IS AT THE SAME PRICE AS IT WAS IN DECEMBER HOW is it that a company that has a 3600 higher predicted EPS over the past 6 months due to increasing chlorine prices is STILL AT THE SAME SHARE PRICE AS IT WAS IN DECEMBER The day earnings come out LESL will blow away everyone with its balance sheet and numbers Analyst ANALysis The consensus between 10 different analysts is that on average LESL has a price target of 34 On the upper end it is predicted to be 41 and on the lower end 28 Given the nature of analyst targets even if the minimum value of 28 is considered LESL is still being suppressed under its fair value Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley s current PT is a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 38 from my understanding with several firms giving a Strong Buy rating Although ANALysts can be quite wrong the general consensus across the industry indicates to me that LESL is severely undervalued and is one of the best long term and short term summer plays in the market Case Blackrock buying up America right now https preview redd it k5pvm5yudn571 png width 542 amp format png amp auto webp amp s a3650b9158f78fceeda6359569d4c72e5c3712f0 The primary bear case for Leslie s is a sudden drop in demand As I mentioned earlier even if chlorine supply chains magically started producing enough for the global market LESL would still have thousands of new pool owner customers who will need their product for years to come If the coronavirus is somehow eradicated within the summer and public sentiment about public pools grows more positive this might slow down demand and result in less new pool builds than expected Additionally other competitors may invest into their own chlorine pellet facilities to become vertically integrated but not only would this require large initial capital investment but time By the time such a facility would be made 1 2 years the Pool Boom could be over Finally there are always disruptors to consider in the overall macroeconomic environment The current housing boom is driving the Poolpercycle and rightfully so However this could change at any moment A housing market crash would most likely cause many new homeowners to rethink their pool purchases and potentially depress the overall market in the short term The main reason I do not think this will happen is because in 2008 the factors of subprime loans and irresponsible lending essentially self fucked the average citizen and banks In the 2021 market we are seeing large investment firms like Blackrock who manage trillions in assets buy up hundreds of properties across the nation and rent them out to those who can afford it The risk here is significantly less and not dependent on any one individual However it is important to consider this aspect of the bear case Conclusion Through these findings I believe that LESL is a massively undervalued company Its strong fundamental financials and continued pool supply consumption leads me to believe that it s due for a large run up in the next month fueled by other institutions I see Leslie hitting a PT of at least 32 within the next month or two My position is 100 contracts for 30C July 16th contracts and I will slowly build this up depending on price action throughout the month I believe that Leslie s will be fucked up her butt with massive green dildos

wife getting blown out for the weekend by her favorite day trader bf Cause personally it s been far too many times for me and that s why I have developed a plan to finally make enough tendies to retire off of Fuck squeezes I ve had it with those DDs and honestly I don t think buying a stock bc another idiot dumber than you told you about the new Tesla he bought with AMC tendies is a good investment thesis Instead I want to invest in something real something that has a backbone in the actual world that isn t empty movie theaters and that something is the TESLA your fellow ape just copped Back in the day 1 yr ago when there were only 1 million retards instead of 10 an individual known as u WSBgod showered us with his glorious TSLA gain porn Today I am going to tell you why and how you can get your own glorious TSLA gain porn and finally fuck your own wife for once amp x200B DD The only reason TSLA has the market cap it has today is the potential it has in the autonomous driving market If TSLA was only priced for cars it sold it wouldn t be a multi billion dollar company worth more than every other automaker This is because TSLA isn t just an automaker and realizing this will be your greatest asset High conviction in a stock strengthens the diamond hands holding it Anyway Musk himself believes that when they solve FSD Full Self Driving and update all their cars overnight to be able to drive autonomously that TSLA will see the largest overnight asset increase in history IDK about you but that sounds way better than a squeaker screaming squeeze about the latest stock they saw on somebody s shirt Elon has reiterated in earnings calls that he is extremely confident they will solve FSD this year and my own knowledge of watching FSD driving videos they have now along with Elon saying the next new update has 100s of improvements and is supposedly coming out this month tells me that autonomy is much closer than most people realize TLDR FSD gt Stock to the Moon DD Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving ever is the company now worthless No TSLA announced and showed on their Battery Day all the manufacturing and engineering improvements they made to producing batteries which reduce the battery cost by almost 2 3rds 66 They already have a pilot plant of these new battery cells along with new battery production plants being build at their new Gigafactories in Austin and Berlin Hopefully by now you can tell the world is transitioning to sustainable energies and EVs are becoming much more prevalent across society All the EVs made by other car companies will require battery packs to make and operate The only problem is these other car companies do not have the battery technology that TSLA has Currently TSLA is unable to produce cars like the SEMI due to a lack of batteries as they wish to prioritize vehicles with a smaller battery pack like the 3 and Y Once they get all their battery plants online they will produce more cars than they ever have along with SEMIS and CYBERTRUCKS Other car manufacturers will run into the problem TSLA is in right now They will not have the batteries to produce all the vehicles they want to make and if they try buying excess amounts of batteries that are 200 more expensive than the batteries TSLA is using they will not be able to keep up in margins pricing This is why the high end F 150 Lighting is more expensive than the high end Cybertruck TLDR Batteries gt Stock to the Moon DD Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving and they blow up all their own battery facilities is the company now worthless No TSLA has all the top engineers in the world working for them this is an underrated aspect of the company in my opinion and they employ these engineers to do whatever they need to be done One important team working for TSLA right now is the AI team TSLA is currently in the development of DOJO a neural net trainer I m not gonna pretend to know everything about this because it is way beyond my realm of understanding but what I do know is that AI runs on DATA The more data you have to train your NN the smarter your AI is Currently TSLA has the largest data lead as their cars have billions of miles driven on the road whereas the runner up of Google s Waymo has a laughable millions When DOJO is available TSLA will be able to train its NN with all its data which will result in the best autonomous driving technology available Beyond training FSD Dojo can be used to train any NN that Tesla or other companies will have uses for Dojo is one of the most valuable assets for AI that will exist and that should be valued extremely high in my opinion as I believe AI will be the next largest breakout in society TLDR AI amp DOJO gt Stock to the Moon amp x200B The crazy thing about this DD is that I still haven t covered many of Tesla s massive opportunities such as its entire energy business or the future MODEL 2 that will eventually come out Note that the MODEL 2 is a 25k Tesla which after factoring in the cost savings and any EV incentives that may come out will be the most affordable and best EV for its price and utility will hopefully be autonomous as well I think basically anyone with a brain will buy the MODEL 2 and it ll kinda be like Apple unveiling the iPhone Basically everyone uses an iPhone for their phone now and I think once an EV like the Model 2 comes out everyone will be whipping a Tesla for their car More points if somehow you still aren t convinced Giga factories almost complete in Berlin one more month and Austin by end of year this will result in crazy amounts of cars being made and more importantly CYBERTRUCKS Gigapresses at these factories will manufacture cars faster than anything that has been done before This translates into the CYBERTRUCK ramp being extremely fast Tesla sells every car they make and yet many terrible news sources say TSLA has demands problems Elon himself has stated demand is the least of their worries SEMIS are being slept on they will start coming out by the end of this year and probably take over the trucking industry the next year Autonomous truck convoys are the future as they are so much more cost effective Overall TSLA is trying to save the world and make it a better place by transitioning to sustainable energy and solving crazy intense real world problems like FSD which will reduce the driving death count drastically If you disagree with this please comment cause I would like to understand your perspective on how I am wrong WSB says they like meme stocks so much well what other CEO is constantly posting memes on Twitter amp x200B If you actually read all this and still think TSLA is overvalued please reply why after buying puts or if you really are a man sell some naked calls POSITIONS TSLA 1 21 2023 1500 1600 1700 strikes note that u gotta buy leaps not weeklies cause ELON loves to lie about the timing of things Although they might be late they always come you just gotta diamond hands till then The man literally made rockets land I think he can make cars drive

stocks over the past two days using the SMELL system invented by my new messiah u pennyether If a stock has a 1bn market cap and 20 short interest I ve got an opinion on it now I disregarded tickers that are already popular because I wanted something I had never heard of before Enter GOGO TL DR Passes the SMELL test https www reddit com user pennyether comments nzd2zi whats that smell 3 straight

before doing my SMELLy research probably because I ve never flown Basically Gogo Inc provides in flight internet for business aircraft at a cost to the user They re present on airlines world wide so you already know they ve got opportunity in the expanding third world airline markets Gogo used to service commercial aircraft as well but they sold that portion of their business last year for 400m cash to survive the pandemic It s not that big of a big blow since they service 2 64x more business aircraft than they did commercial amp x200B https preview redd it wf2aj00tlo571 png width 574 amp

to take dramatic moves to stay agile and pivot towards a company s strength during emergencies In terms of numbers Gogo is projected to do 318 5m in revenue this year and 352m in revenue next year According to Robinhood they ve beaten EPS projections for three straight quarters recovering from COVID 19 much more strongly than expected Per ORTEX says they ve got an EV EBITDA of 14 31 in line with the industry mean and a positive EPS change of 16 21 Plus an analyst price target of 13 25 so it s still under fair valuation In other words this company is perfectly fundamentally sound it that kind of thing matters to you amp x200B https preview redd it ai9kmn8ulo571 png width 609 amp format png amp auto webp amp s d8f012bb5fc6e3aa3114ee677df117fe5268b005 So why is it shorted Well short interest has actually been falling from peak levels pretty consistently since March 2020 despite a short lived surge where they got fucked in September 2020 and a recent uptick in shorting last week Still SI is 30 so let s use the https emojipedia org bear case to consider reasons not all shorts have exited their position Some airlines like Delta are transitioning to free internet to differentiate themselves from low cost airlines But budget airlines have been rapidly expanding worldwide and one way they remain budget is by letting services like Gogo handle the internet so I actually see a huge opportunity for growth in that sense Some of the shorting could be fears that SpaceX s Starlink might hurt their long term growth but that s a pretty fucking big maybe at the moment Daddy Musk is a master of over promising so I think Gogo is safe in the air for a while It could also be the fact that they currently have the investing equivalent of an ambulance chaser lawsuit filed against them but they already defeated an almost identical lawsuit in 2019 so I m not worried amp x200B https preview redd it i7hueryvlo571 png width 1263 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f8cdcdfbb46939cbfcb0ddff83c6893387c82b77 GOGO SMELL Test If you ve been keeping up with the DD that gets posted you know that the SMELL test is the best new method for determining undervalued potential meme stocks So how does GOGO do with the SMELL test Short Interest SI of float is currently estimated to be 31 37 by MarketWatch If you re familiar with the SMELL system you ll know that the purpose of SI isn t to create a squeeze but to add a possible extra source of buying pressure Based on ORTEX data 1 4 of that short interest is new as of last week when the price was around 14 50 If the price rises again shorts have already shown that they re willing to end their position In fact most 2020 shorts had already been unwinding their positions since at least January until they came back last week Market Cap Market Cap is 1 3bn per Yahoo so it s legit Extremely Memeable The name is literally GOGO the thing it s going to do over the next 6 months Of course it s fucking memeable Low Liquidity Average volume is just 2m shares according to Yahoo or 1 8 of market cap Institutional ownership is 46 11 According to Yahoo investors like Vanguard JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have all recently added 20 compared to their previous investment Per ORTEX insiders have added 10m more shares total over the past twelve months Low Risk IV is 66 so not great but not terrible It was difficult finding any SMELL test candidate with IV under 60 However volatility is within the 4 percentile rank meaning that IV was only lower 4 of the time in the last year So this is as safe a time as ever to get in https preview redd it o6xn9drxlo571 png width 1263 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5181dafd91d9b7cb80836d9f460164a25b34fd76 Expectations Previously the stock exploded in Sept 2020 and climbed up to it s 52 week high of 17 23 in January of this year Apparently this stock already has a small following of short interest hunters and got caught up in the January madness although I don t remember reading about it After Jan 28 it fell down to 10 in April Since April however it was steadily rising until last week when approached 15 at which point SI increased by over 50 estimated 10 8m https emojipedia org right arrow 17m and the price quickly tumbled back to 11 50 Based on history indicators and fundamentals I believe the stock will repeat it s climb back to 15 as most

wallstreetbets comments nzbdz8 lev lion electric the new king of the jungle If you aren t I invite you to take a look to learn about the company Stock price has fallen since my DD I did add more to my position yesterday now with 40K in warrants I believe that it s an irrational selloff and that we will continue our journey to the top There has been an investor s presentation update and some news in QC so I m making a second DD with all the missing info amp x200B Little background I m from Quebec Canada I have invested in Lion since December when the merger was announced and have been following ever single detail news on this company I did not sell on the pump to 35 because I think that 50 PT is not out of reach in a year Sadly the market died and took down LEV with it as well for now But good stocks will bounce back LEV will bounce hard I ve visited the manufacturing site in Quebec exclusive picture proof https preview redd it f30bxk024o571 png width 1057 amp format png amp auto webp

about 130 270 although Etrade says 120 This is indeed a huge borrow rate and a good short interest for such small cap and float company Well as mentioned already on Sunday Lion is also shorted for 20 of the Float with a cost to borrow also around the 130 mark according to ORTEX and my broker https preview redd it uwpqpv7x3o571 png width 1041 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

a4f2f18e95c6e811d76007fa838f523739160152 I m giving you this info but I m not here for the short interest play All this indicates is that the price is heavily forced down because the company is being put in the same batch of the SPAC EV disaster Current share holders are in for the long run shares are hard to borrow because of that Any good catalyst could make this stock fly because of that 3 Valuation My Golden Goose LEV is currently sitting at about 3 4B market cap Lets compare this to other EV startups ARVL 13B market cap No revenues until 2022 still working on their prototypes for the

to it ,Last week I wrote a post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nw17ne in honor of pride month a bold gay bear dd outlining a very gay bear thesis and called a 10 correction The FOMC meeting and data that was released today confirms this expectation As the week continues we will see the losses accelerate as volume picks up As I m writing this I m watching a bounce from intraday lows This bounce is fake Let s talk what the Fed did or didn t do why it s bad and what will fuel the correction through the second half of June The Fed did not announce a plan to taper asset purchases As I talked about in my previous post the Fed was between a rock and a hard place going into this meeting On the one hand announcing tapering of treasury purchases was thought to run the risk of inducing a taper tantrum as liquidity was removed from the market On the other hand leaving Fed policy unchanged ran the risk of further increasing inflation expectations and drawing out bond vigilantes https en wikipedia org wiki Bond vigilante who sell bonds to protest inflationary fed policy and cause yields to spike By leaving policy unchanged and announcing no immediate plans to slow asset purchases I would argue that the Fed chose the greater of two evils in this scenario The lack of policy change should indicate to investors that A The Fed does not see the recovery going as well as they did previously and B that the risk of inflation and losing control of inflation continues to grow In certain highly important parts of the economy such as oil https www investing com news commodities news oil inventories fell by 85m barrels last week api 2533142 and housing https www marketwatch com story an inflation storm is coming for the u s housing market 11623419869 inflation is hitting hard and looks to have some staying power I also saw a McDonalds near me hiring at a starting wage of 14 per hour This is anecdotal but wage gains are not fucking transitory The Fed also raised its inflation expectations https www washingtonpost com us policy 2021 06 16 fed powell inflation unemployment june meeting which will further drive algorithmic selling of treasuries Short term volume driving downward momentum Today was a high volume day and the rest of the week should continue to see high volume The bounce off intraday lows was on low volume buying and we should see

png width 413 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 10b2448f666bfed14d61956e981567999ba5c50f The low volume of the BTD indicates that most investors namely institutions are not falling into the bull trap that is being set by algorithms who buy dips based on arbitrary daily volume and strength factors The indexes should fall again tomorrow if not by the end of the day I expect we ll be down at least 3 by the end of the week as the indexes test the 50 day moving averages I will be bold in predicting a test of the 200 day before this correction is through Bonds disagree with the bounce Despite the short term bounce the bond market which I said in my previous post is far larger and more important than the stock market does not seem to be experiencing a similar rally and looks to be on a the downward move causing yields to rise We should see the 10 year yield break back above 1 6 in the near future Look at RSI for the short term treasury ETF amp x200B Short term treasuries did not catch a

Quadruple witch should be pretty spooky I will also point out that a quadruple witching day https en wikipedia org wiki Triple witching hour is coming on Friday During uptrends this is a good thing as institutions reposition and rebalance for the quarter ahead However during downtrends it can exasperate an issue Markets typically perform better in low volume as melt ups occur Indicating that volatility is low A quadruple witching hour is the last thing the market needs right now and will drive further downward momentum I haven t looked at the data but based on recent experience with the quadruple witch the trend set on that day tends to follow through with momentum for a few weeks after Summary Strategy The gay bear thesis is intact Look for bond yields to reach new YTD highs as this correction takes place and start thinking about buying when the VIX gets back into the 30s the real VIX not bullshit VIX future instruments TLDR I was right last week the intraday bounce is an obvious trap and a high volume selloff will cause momentum on the downside inflation projections are up yields are stabilizing at higher levels technicals are currently shit and still overbought coming off relatively high levels where selloff normally occurs and the treasury selloff is not complete as treasuries were very overbought going into the Fed meeting

of July For those unaware WKHS has a 10 stake in RIDE https chargedevs com features retooling a shuttered factory to build electric trucks qa with lordstown motors ceo steve burns so WKHS will benefit greatly as RIDE climbs Additionally if WKHS were to get a piece of the USPS contract to build their delivery vehicles https www theverge com 22423179 usps mail trucks electric oshkosh the trucks would be built at RIDE s facility so both stocks would continue to jump My preference of the two is RIDE as it gives you backdoor exposure to WKHS through their 10 stake I also believe RIDE has many more short term catalysts After all on Tuesday 6 15 the RIDE President who was a former Tesla executive said RIDE is willing and able to build Postal Vehicles in conjunction with WKHS RIDE is also rumored to be talking to other Tesla executives as potential CEO candidates RIDE s short of float is 32 https www marketbeat com stocks NASDAQ RIDE short interest and I have seen other sources that claim it is as high as 35 I have not seen a company with more upcoming catalysts than RIDE with this high of a short interest I ve noticed a huge jump in OI for 7 16 20 calls and many other calls expiring on 7 16 RIDE also has billions in assets around 500m in cash and 0 debt They are currently in talks with strategic investors and the Dept of Energy ATVM loan program same loan that Tesla got as a start up to obtain more cash and ramp up commercial production In their current cash state they can begin production and produce 20 000 vehicles by next May but a loan or strategic investor would accelerate increase commercial production RIDE Overview Tech and Batteries RIDE is currently ramping up for mass production of their full size all electric Endurance truck https lordstownmotors com pages endurance With the backing of GM along with their automotive plant RIDE believes their facility will be able to produce up to 600 000 vehicles each year https www carscoops com 2020 05 lordstown motors ceo thinks ev startup can build 600000 vehicles a year at max capacity They have the 3rd largest automotive factory in the US which is vertically integrated with robots welding vehicles and will soon have the 2nd largest battery assembly plant in the US Additionally RIDE signed a multi year supplier agreement with LG Energy Solution https cleantechnica com 2021 02 03 lordstown motors electric pickup will use tesla batteries from lg text Lordstown 20Motors 20Electric 20Pickup 20Will 20Use 20 E2 80 9CTesla 20Batteries E2 80 9D 20From 20LG amp text Lordstown 20Motors 27 20CEO 20Steve 20Burns Model 203 20and 20Model 20Y a global leader in battery cell technology to broaden their high quality diverse battery cell supply chain It s also worth noting that GM and LG are building a battery plant less than a mile away from RIDE s facility https businessjournaldaily com gm lg chem select lordstown site for plant which will help them with any supply chain bottlenecks from a battery perspective Growth Potential for RIDE The simplistic approach RIDE took with their skateboard chassis https www greencarreports com news 1130616 lordstown thrashes the skateboard for its endurance electric truck in wheel motors and all will allow them to create several vehicles using the same skateboard including their Endurance truck an ERV an SUV Postal Vehicles etc RIDE also announced an agreement with Holman Enterprises https www holmanenterprises com news holman enterprises lordstown motors announce co marketing agreement and expanded alliance a leader in the fleet industry that currently has over 2 million vehicles under management In addition RIDE mentioned they have seen interest from government and military fleets and they received a GSA listing to be able to sell to those entities https www fleetforward com 10135588 lordstown motors gains gsa listing Looking at the current demand a 6 15 interview from RIDE s management confirmed that they have enough binding orders to fill 2021 2022 production targets Competitive Landscape Electric Truck Startups RIDE often draws comparisons to two other EV startups Rivian and Nikola NKLA Nikola is pre revenue and seems to be much further out from mass production yet still has a 7B market cap Amazon backed Rivian is the clear leader in terms of EV startups and are likely to be valued at or above 70B https insideevs com news 511272 rivian seek 70billion ipo underwriters this fall when they IPO It is worth noting that RIDE s replacement value for their facility is 3B and they have over 400m cash on hand https investor lordstownmotors com news releases news release details lordstown motors reports fourth quarter and full year 2020 When looking at the monster valuations of competitors relative to RIDE s current 1 7B market cap it just goes to show that other EV companies in general seem to be trading at significantly higher multiples than RIDE In fact most trade at more than 5x future revenue In RIDE s March earnings call they announced their plans to re tool their facility with additional funding to be able to produce 60 000 vehicles in 2022 in response to increased customer interest for their Endurance truck Selling 60 000 vehicles would result in over 3B in revenue which with a 5x multiple would lead to a market cap of over 15B for RIDE 100 share Conclusion The EV market is flooded with competition but RIDE is taking a unique approach in their business model by targeting commercial fleets They also have one of the most productive automotive facilities in the whole United States which bodes well for the Buy American initiative that the current administration has been echoing in the past several months Sure there are risks investing in any startup but RIDE presents a very nice risk reward setup at current levels Short sellers and lawsuits have caused the stock to lose 60 of its value from all time highs With a current valuation of only 1 7B when RIDE is mass producing their commercial fleet pick ups in 3 months the only problem investors will have is that they didn t buy more TLDR Over 31 of RIDE s float is short and they are now just 3 months away from mass production with an automotive facility capable of producing 600 000 vehicles each year RIDE has several catalysts in the short term Lordstown Week from June 21 25 https www globenewswire com news release 2021 05

Cano Health Cano Health is a Florida centered value based care provider serving 103 000 people in America across 12 markets That number is projected to grow to 300 000 by 2023 Cano Health is a primary care provider compensated through a fixed per member monthly fee from insurance companies Because of this Cano Health and comparable companies assume all risk and reap all benefits from costs of treatment This structure incentivizes preventative care to stop health issues before they happen which means lower costs for patients and Cano Health This can be seen in action through Cano s lower than average mortality rates hospital admissions and ER visits Cano Health recently went through a reverse merger with Jaws Acquisition Corp and now trades publicly as Cano Cano Health presents us with an investment opportunity that has more than 100 upside all the while allowing us to invest in a high growth and high TAM company with great institutional backing Cano has seen massive growth

How do Medicare and Medicare advantage work for senior citizens Medicare is a government run taxpayer funded health insurance program for primarily senior citizens over the age of 65 barring some exceptions Medicare allows senior citizens to go to any care provider who accepts it and receive treatment care Medicare is broken up into 4 key parts which are the following 1 Medicare Part A Medicare Part A covers Inpatient Care in Hospitals Skilled Nursing Facility Care Hospice Care and Home Health Care This is generally at a low cost to most seniors provided they have paid Medicare taxes for a long enough period They still may have some coinsurance payments and deductibles however 2 Medicare Part B Medicare Part B covers Services from doctors and other health care providers Outpatient care Home health care Durable medical equipment DME like wheelchairs walkers hospital beds and other equipment and Many preventive services like screenings shots or vaccines and yearly Wellness visits Patients using Medicare Part B generally have to pay a monthly fee similar to normal health insurance and in doing so any care received by the patient is covered and paid for by Medicare 3 Medicare Part C Medicare Part C is also known as Medicare advantage This is essentially an all in one package that serves as an alternative to Original Medicare Parts A and B Medicare Part C is fulfilled through private companies which are vetted and approved by Medicare These packages generally include the benefits offered in Medicare Parts A B and D but may also include other services such as vision hearing and dental 4 Medicare Part D Medicare Part D is an optional Medicare program run by private companies who are regulated by Medicare It s primary purpose is to Help Cover Costs of Prescription Drugs and Protect Patients Against Future Increases in Drug Prices Currently there are 24 1 million seniors on Medicare Advantage plans representing 30 of all Medicare patients This creates a massive TAM of tens of millions of new customers representing billions of dollars https preview redd it l3t86646tp571 jpg width 850 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s

care model differ from a fee for service FFS model Traditionally Medicare has run on a fee for service model This model operates like such A patient comes into a Medicare accepting facility for a routine health checkup 10 tests are run on the patient whilst they are there In the fee for service model Medicare is billed for all 10 of these tests individually This model creates incentive for more individual services Volume to be done on patients rather than high quality and important care Under fee for service models cost variations for procedures and tests increased and the healthcare industry was spending more to treat patients even though patient outcomes were not necessarily improving The model also challenged provider workflows because physicians were seeing more patients and each claim had to be processed in a fragmented network On the flipside Value based care models create a much better environment for everyone Value based care models are based on patient outcomes not quantity of services provided to patients Unlike the traditional fee for service model value based care is driven by data because providers must report to payers on specific metrics and demonstrate improvement Providers may have to track and report on hospital readmissions adverse events population health patient engagement and more Cano Health has successfully lowered Mortality Rates Hospital Admissions and ER Visits despite Covid 19 and all the challenges brought with it which proves the model s success https preview redd it 1ox6pubbtp571 jpg width 850 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s

annual membership growth with additional growth from acquisitions 2 Has strong tailwinds in an industry with increasing pressure for cost reductions and a shift towards value based care from fee for service care 3 Cano currently serves 113k members in 15 different markets With this they only have 6 penetration in existing markets The overall TAM is enormous at 24 1M Medicare Advantage enrollees in 2020 with that set to grow in the future years This leaves Cano with plenty of runway to grow organically and through acquisitions 4 Extremely favorable comps to OSH which put a fair value for this at 30 dollars based on revenue multiples 5 86 revenue CAGR 6 Raised ebitda revenue and membership guidance from management 7 Recent acquisition of University Health Care increasing their market share and exposure in Florida a place which is among states with the highest enrollments in Medicare Advantage in the country 8 Reputable Analyst Nephron Research initiated a price target of 22 dollars with more to follow from other institutions in the near future 9 Great institutional PIPE holdings from the likes of Fidelity Blackrock and Third Point who in addition purchased shares from the open market

connection and exposure to the hispanic population in not only Florida but other states as well 85 of their employees are bilingual and 80 of Cano s members are minorities Most of the largest states for Medicare have substantial minority Spanish speaking populations which gives Cano lots of room for expansion and a moat over other companies such as OSH How Do The Charts Look amp x200B For many
