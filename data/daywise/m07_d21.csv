As of December 31 2020 Desktop Metals has 595 4M in cash cash equivalents and short term investments It has enough cash on hand to support operations for another 3 years To help with the cash position it also completed redemption of all outstanding public warrants which contributed to 170 7M In the first quarter of 2021 Desktop Metal expanded the portfolio to over 225 materials To help with the

be continued investment into commercialization and new product development It has attracted employees but the ability to train and retain an effective team will be in question As the market grows so will the demand for upgrading and maintaining information technology and the portfolio Timeliness is important in this aspect and there may be delays in the design production and launch of solutions This is due to several plans still being under development Although there is enough cash on hand to support operating costs for the next 3 years it will require additional capital to support business growth CONCLUSION I am bullish on Desktop Metal and will hold this position as the 3D printing market grows Although it has not been profitable since inception I believe the upside for it is massive

existing WISH app user and also a WISH investor My views may be biased and this is not financial advise in any way My current WISH positions https imgur com a pBnvoYY https imgur com a pBnvoYY To start this off here are some of my favourite hate comments that I read about WISH and my thoughts 1 WISH sells cheap trash products I don t disagree with this I mean even if 2 genius level intellect professors consummate and have 10 kids one of them kids is bound to be not so bright I reckon With WISH we re now looking at over 800k merchants and hundreds of millions of products there are bound to be trashy stuff this is the same with Amazon same with Taobao 2 I don t invest in Chinese stocks Maybe this stupid ape mixed up WISH with another company We can actually Wiki this WISH is an American online e commerce platform based in San Francisco United States that facilitates transactions between sellers and buyers But they do have a very significant number of merchants from China this is the same with Amazon same with Taobao 3 WISH sells Chinese junk Similar to point 1 but will just like to bring us back to reality that made in China products are here to stay whether we like it or not I can t think of another country with a bigger population of people that works as hard fast or cheap China produce about almost everything from cars to smartphones tablets stupid plastic toys big city skyscrapers etc you name it Look around your home and you ll probably find something that s made in China Tesla cars Iphones and many more big brand names are also made in China 4 Scam You re going to wait months for something which may never come As a WISH user I m going to have to say that this is a myth WISH is not a scam and 2 5b revenues in 2020 projected 3 2b revenues in 2021 and over 100m monthly active users are facts If the product you want is not available it will be reflected as sold out When you place your purchase for an item which is available it will come from my personal experience Like most good e commerce platforms you ll be able to check your order status processed shipped arrival date etc via the WISH app If you want your items urgently you can pay more for WISH Express If you re like most WISH users that are buying not through a search query but instead from personalized browsing it s basically impulse buys and not need based you can probably wait for your items to arrive which lowers the cost base which is one of the main reasons for the impulse buys PRICE And no it won t take months WISH quotes me an estimated 2 3 weeks for my items to arrive and I usually get them before the actual projected arrival date 5 Goodluck with your imitation crap This comment reminds me of the time when I was studying as a kid my teacher used to say that copying from my classmates was wrong As an adult now I will like to share with her a quote from Oscar Wilde Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness The next quote is from me In the business world no amount of copying is bad unless we re copying crap Why I m a happy user of WISH app For WISH users the satisfaction really comes from finding the gems which is also probably the main reason why the average time spent per user on WISH app are more than any other e commerce platforms unlike fucking a dead log it is just so much more interactive and fun shopping with WISH app Gems are basically good quality products with very cheap prices A recent gem I found from WISH was a soundbar for my gaming needs which costs 24 it s about half metre long and I m serious when I say the sound and bass is SOLID I would encourage anyone to just log into WISH app to discover the gems for yourself to truly understand what I m saying just search under WISH select and there are already tons of solid products which are cheap and good with many verified user reviews Just be warned Once you are a WISH user it all starts with WISH app prompting users to log in to the app with gamification flash sales etc And when you eventually do decide to see what they have to offer with no obligations of course The software prompts further discounts for immediate purchases adding in similar or complimentary product recommendations based on data and advanced algorithms it s like a dollar store on steroids Most users and especially existing users like myself with address payment details done make the purchases sooner rather than later and when we do we potentially buy in quantity because of the low prices In summary I strongly believe that WISH is a sleeping giant with tons of cash on hand in their balance sheet that is going to give the big boys in e commerce a good run for their money especially once they achieve the following 1 To have a fully comprehensive catalogue of products with different price ranges moving upstream to touch a wider demographic audience 2 Filling in the gaps for product categories which are lacking right now in WISH app such as grocery products that are used daily by average consumers that require routine replacement or replenishment such as food beverages and household products 3 Increased WISH user demographics that prioritize services products speed of delivery etc over savings this in turn potentially allows for rapid expansion on their logistics platform and also accelerated growth in logistics and transaction revenues 4 Establishing WISH as a global brand and in house WISH products WISH seems to be trending more than just a cool ticker it s also trending as a cool brand with items such as hoodies t shirts charging cables bags etc going for flash sales on their platform Back in the days who knew a tick mark with the word Nike would move on to become a global top selling brand Personally I love the cool simplicity of the WISH logo and their mission to bring affordable and entertaining mobile e commerce to consumers around the world including the underserved With over 300 000 WISH T shirts sold currently in my mind it hints the potentiality of what WISH might become in an internet world of social media trendings and smartphones 5 Tapping on Jacqueline Reses expertise and experience to accelerate their entry into payment and financial services which will further monetize their growing merchants and user base Imo their user base is likely to grow rapidly regardless of what haters are saying As a WISH user myself I can only say that my experience with WISH is just starting and it s worth referring my friends I believe this experience is not unique to me and that I m just one out of many users that loves my WISH app and the branding With over 100m monthly active users over 500m total WISH users over 3m of items sold daily most downloaded app globally for past 3 years we can t be getting it all wrong As the saying goes it only takes a spark to get a fire going 6 Expansion in WISH Local Merchant base WISH stores their inventory orders with WISH local merchants saving costs on storage and last mile delivery This also translates to reduction in time taken for delivery and further cost savings for consumers WISH local merchants get to increase their personal product sales through WISH inventory pick ups as it translates to increased customer footprint and potential sales opportunities Wish local Merchants can also tap on the millions of WISH users by advertising their products through the platform This business model seems underestimated and is a good alternative to Shopify It can potentially create a sustainable ecosystem and rapid revenue growth for WISH while offering a lifeline for brick and mortar retailers to succeed in an era of disruptive tech and innovation fast forwarded by the pandemic

existing WISH app user and also a WISH investor My views may be biased and this is not financial advise in any way To start this off here are some of my favourite hate comments that I read about WISH and my thoughts 1 WISH sells cheap trash products I don t disagree with this I mean even if 2 genius level intellect professors consummate and have 10 kids one of them kids is bound to be not so bright I reckon With WISH we re now looking at over 800k merchants and hundreds of millions of products there are bound to be trashy stuff this is the same with Amazon same with Taobao 2 I don t invest in Chinese stocks Maybe this stupid ape mixed up WISH with another company We can actually Wiki this WISH is an American online e commerce platform based in San Francisco United States that facilitates transactions between sellers and buyers But they do have a very significant number of merchants from China this is the same with Amazon same with Taobao 3 WISH sells Chinese junk Similar to point 1 but will just like to bring us back to reality that made in China products are here to stay whether we like it or not I can t think of another country with a bigger population of people that works as hard fast or cheap China produce about almost everything from cars to smartphones tablets stupid plastic toys big city skyscrapers etc you name it Look around your home and you ll probably find something that s made in China Tesla cars Iphones and many more big brand names are also made in China 3 Scam You re going to wait months for something which may never come As a WISH user I m going to have to say that this is a myth WISH is not a scam and 2 5b revenues in 2020 projected 3 2b revenues in 2021 and over 100m monthly active users are facts If the product you want is not available it will be reflected as sold out When you place your purchase for an item which is available it will come from my personal experience Like most good e commerce platforms you ll be able to check your order status processed shipped arrival date etc via the WISH app If you want your items urgently you can pay more for WISH Express If you re like most WISH users that are buying not through a search query but instead from personalized browsing it s basically impulse buys and not need based you can probably wait for your items to arrive which lowers the cost base which is one of the main reasons for the impulse buys PRICE And no it won t take months WISH quotes me an estimated 2 3 weeks for my items to arrive and I usually get them before the actual projected arrival date 4 Goodluck with your imitation crap This comment reminds me of the time when I was studying as a kid my teacher used to say that copying from my classmates was wrong As an adult now I will like to share with her a quote from Oscar Wilde Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness The next quote is from me In the business world no amount of copying is bad unless we re copying crap Why I m a happy user of WISH app For WISH users the satisfaction really comes from finding the gems which is also probably the main reason why the average time spent per user on WISH app are more than any other e commerce platforms unlike fucking a dead log it is just so much more interactive and fun shopping with WISH app Gems are basically good quality products with very cheap prices A recent gem I found from WISH was a soundbar for my gaming needs which costs 24 it s about half metre long and I m serious when I say the sound and bass is SOLID I would encourage anyone to just log into WISH app to discover the gems for yourself to truly understand what I m saying just search under WISH select and there are already tons of solid products which are cheap and good with many verified user reviews Just be warned Once you are a WISH user it all starts with WISH app prompting users to log in to the app with gamification flash sales etc And when you eventually do decide to see what they have to offer with no obligations of course The software prompts further discounts for immediate purchases adding in similar or complimentary product recommendations based on data and advanced algorithms it s like a dollar store on steroids Most users and especially existing users like myself with address payment details done make the purchases sooner rather than later and when we do we potentially buy in quantity because of the low prices In summary I strongly believe that WISH is a sleeping giant with tons of cash on hand in their balance sheet that is going to give the big boys in e commerce a good run for their money especially once they achieve the following 1 To have a fully comprehensive catalogue of products with different price ranges moving upstream to touch a wider demographic audience 2 Filling in the gaps for product categories which are lacking right now in WISH app such as grocery products that are used daily by average consumers that require routine replacement or replenishment such as food beverages and household products 3 Increased WISH user demographics that prioritize services products speed of delivery etc over savings this in turn potentially allows for rapid expansion on their logistics platform and also accelerated growth in logistics and transaction revenues 4 Establishing WISH as a global brand and in house WISH products WISH seems to be trending more than just a cool ticker it s also trending as a cool brand with items such as hoodies t shirts charging cables bags etc going for flash sales on their platform Back in the days who knew a tick mark with the word Nike would move on to become a global top selling brand Personally I love the cool simplicity of the WISH logo and their mission to bring affordable and entertaining mobile e commerce to consumers around the world including the underserved With over 300 000 WISH T shirts sold currently in my mind it hints the potentiality of what WISH might become in an internet world of social media trendings and smartphones 5 Tapping on Jacqueline Reses expertise and experience to accelerate their entry into payment and financial services which will further monetize their growing merchants and user base Imo their user base is likely to grow rapidly regardless of what haters are saying As a WISH user myself I can only say that my experience with WISH is just starting and it s worth referring my friends I believe this experience is not unique to me and that I m just one out of many users that loves my WISH app and the branding With over 100m monthly active users over 500m total WISH users over 3m of items sold daily most downloaded app globally for past 3 years we can t be getting it all wrong As the saying goes it only takes a spark to get a fire going 6 Expansion in WISH Local Merchant base WISH stores their inventory orders with WISH local merchants saving costs on storage and last mile delivery This also translates to reduction in time taken for delivery and further cost savings for consumers WISH local merchants get to increase their personal product sales through WISH inventory pick ups as it translates to increased customer footprint and potential sales opportunities Wish local Merchants can also tap on the millions of WISH users by advertising their products through the platform This business model seems underestimated and is a good alternative to Shopify It can potentially create a sustainable ecosystem and rapid revenue growth for WISH while offering a lifeline for brick and mortar retailers to succeed in an era of disruptive tech and innovation fast forwarded by the pandemic

originally introduced in 1919 and a privately held company for the majority of its history During the time they became an American icon in the snacking scene Making Twinkies cupcakes dingdongs etc The original company Interstate Bakeries filed for chapter 11 and a new company was formed through a SPAC in 2013 You can read more HERE https en wikipedia org wiki Hostess Brands but the important bits are they reformed the company with new backers The Gores Group and went public with an offering valued at 2 3 billion Since then they have been doing good work on increasing market share increasing

thing for us in this case It tells us that at least some of the shorts have recognized that bears R fUk They have been buying in with more short selling and the price has been continuing to put them underwater Check out this one year graph where we can see a great trend right up until the price crosses 16 dollars Some of you who are better with crayons can probably also draw us a channel that it

2b4b8dbcb219470c44769c7726d1315d7735ffb9 The stock started trading sideways with some extremely hard support and resistance The longs are putting in a ton of volume any time it drops below the 16 mark intra day The shorts do a classic short selling price crash any time it crosses the 16 50 line They have shown their hand that this is a critical threshold for their position If you look at the volume bars you can start to see some of the battles being fought at critical support and resistance lines between the heavy hitter long shorts This is not retail trader stuff Those larger spikes are 1 5 2 million shares in a few minutes That s about 2 5x the daily average volume in just a couple of minutes There is further evidence to support the theory that 16 50 is a breaking point SI was starting to decrease until it crossed into the current channel Since then SI started increasing again as they NEED to hold down the price That brought the current SI back up to a new peak just recently as they try to beat it down Earnings Wed August 4th Earnings are upon us and things are looking good Here are a few quotes so you can listen to someone besides me talk for a bit gt Four analysts have made estimates for Hostess Brands earnings with the highest sales estimate coming in at 277 49 million and the lowest estimate coming in at 268 85 million Hostess Brands reported sales of 256 23 million in the same quarter last year which would suggest a positive year over year growth rate of 6 3 TWNK Analyst Ratings https www nasdaq com market activity stocks twnk analyst research gt Based on analysts offering 12 month price targets for TWNK in the last 3 months The average price target is 17 67 with a high estimate of 18 and a low estimate of 17 Forward guidance from last quarter gt Hostess continues our strong profitable growth with our 13th consecutive quarter of revenue growth in the first quarter and very strong momentum leading into the second quarter Turning to our outlook Given the strength of how we started the year we are increasingly confident in our ability to achieve our full year guide We continue to expect to drive net revenue growth of 3 to 4 5 and expect adjusted EBITDA between to be between 255 million and 265 million with adjusted EPS of 0 80 to 0 85 per share Looking forward we feel confident in our ability to manage margins as we move through the remainder of the year So we have a price that has been heading up for a full year short sellers that are under water and under a lot of pressure a last ditch effort to hold the price down below 16 50 and long whales that are fighting the good fight and holding a strong floor at 16 Analysts are predicting a good earnings report and the price target is consistently above our 16 50 magic number amp x200B WSB So why no squeeze Do you have so many bananas in your ass it s affecting your brain function Well maybe but what I do in my free time isn t your concern A true squeeze needs 3 things 1 High short interest check 2 A catalyst earning check 3 Low liquidity womp womp womp The last point there is the only reason I don t think this will be a classic squeeze play that lands on Uranus So why are we talking about this Because there is still a ton of short interest that has to be bought back that will dramatically accelerate what is already great momentum once the price breaks out of the current channel I expect a significant jump higher The low and slow unwinding of the short interest will make this a more stable but still very lucrative play The price has plenty of room to run with 25M

past few years with the rise of 0 commission trading and the pandemic we ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of retail investors and particularly those young investors While greater market participation by younger people is great we need to consider these peoples personal risk tolerance and where these people are putting their money and how this could be creating inefficiencies in the market Over the course of this write up I want to show we are in a bubble retail is young overleveraged and naive and want their voices heard big funds like JPMorgan and Blackrock want to support these habits and are exacerbating the problem 1 We are in a bubble We are in a bubble 2 Retail is young overleveraged and naive With the rise in 0 commission brokerages and the greater access to complicated investing tools through apps like Robinhood WeBull SoFi and many others there has been a dramatic increase in the number of young retail traders This combined with the increasing popularity in financial based social media such as Reddit Stock Twits Twitter and many others have made it easier than ever for retail to discuss learn and organize Obviously I don t need to explain how social media has increased retail s appetite for leverage to the tits because well you re here but I would point to this article https markets businessinsider com news stocks millennial gen z investors borrow money to invest in stocks 2021 6 highlighting how a significant number of these young investors are borrowing money and taking out loans to invest Margin debt is currently at an all time high see chart with pretty colors https www advisorperspectives com images content image data ce ce611246fdaf4041d3b02d0f1b28e6cc png this is not due to retail but rather the current policies of the Federal Reserve however I bring it up because it shows how markets are leveraged to the tits and pushing forward earning out further and further As young traders conjugate they have come to realise their power and particularly their power for good and want to leverage this to have a positive influence on the world and they are doing this through ESG investing 3 Big banks like JPMorgan Vanguard and Blackrock want to support these habits and are exacerbating the problem Big banks such as Blackrock Vanguard and JPMorgan have realised this trend over the past few years and have been evolving to cater products more to this crowd and people are eating them up I would point to the linked interview https www youtube com watch v 6NJIX sJjaw by Blackrock founder and CEO Larry Fink and this report https www jpmorgan com insights research build back better esg investing from JPMorgan highlighting how ESG funds grew 3 trillion dollars in AUM in 2020 I believe that this dramatic increase in ESG investing is due to young investors righteous desire to do good in the world While this may be a good thing for the world I believe it is creating what I like to refer to as dry tinder because when there is a spark it catches on fire While many of the companies which comprise these ESG funds are doing good in the world they are not doing so profitably and eventually someone has to pay the piper I would particularly look at the top stocks in Blackrock s ICLN ETF many of which are hugely unprofitable Yet despite this many of these companies are up 100 s of of the past 18 months and ICLN together is up 162 and this is a similar story for funds such as USSG and VSGX Now you may be asking if these companies are shitty then why are they up Well that has 100 to do with the current interest rate environment by the FED While interest rates are near 0 this lets funds borrow money and push earnings forward to a point where they can price in decades of growth but if anything were to change with interest rates we would see funds go from pricing in 10 years of growth in wildly ambitious companies to 2 years in 0 revenue companies Now this applies to every stock not just ESG so why am I singling them out Because these funds have the most inexperienced investors biggest run this year and are the most detached from fundamentals In conclusion I believe in addition to the 0 interest rate multiplier combined with retail s money and these funds insane run up this past year these funds have the most to lose and the least to gain Going back to the dry tinder analogy just the smallest change in the FED s policy could have the spark which turns into a forest fire Further reading https www jpmorgan com insights research build back better esg investing https www jpmorgan com

group has a mcap of 3 3 billion and 57 are owned by the Strauss family Although one of Israel s biggest food companies it generally isn t being discussed much because of its structure lack of

several years Strauss Group is running a FoodTech incubator https www thekitchenhub com for start ups with promising business concepts So far this has been very successful multiple projects completed the incubator as autonomous companies amp x200B The usual process is that Strauss provides the production equipment and labs along with a budget for reseach while bringing together experienced industry veterans university researchers and sponsors The final products can then be connected to global partners Pepse Mitsubishi Haier Danone to nam a few for distribution and potentially local mass production Symbiosis with internal projects would also be logical and sensible however in most cases this is not a primary goal In some cases Strauss will also be funding later rounds if a project requires further capital Unfortunately there is no overview available over current investments It is also uncertain what general strategy Strauss is following with these investments IR only mentions

million in total now A bio 3D printing process allows production of Ribeye steaks but can also be used for chicken pork lamb etc in all sorts of structures while the competition often can only produce faux mince As it s typical for in vitro meat only a small cell sample the size of a sesame seed is required to manufacture many thousand steaks amp x200B The development is advanced to a late stage
