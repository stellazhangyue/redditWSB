about is the stock price attached to that beautiful T S L A When people tell you that TSLA is a bubble usually your reaction is No shit baby tits Or Buy the dip fuckface Elon s sending his cum to mars All fine fuck it whatever but what if I told you that TSLA is guaranteed to go down Let s start with the biggest run of a muthafuck this decade TSLA crashes covid style like all of our favorite tech homies then rises 700 through the rest of the year peaking at almost 900 share Why the fuck would any stock rise 700 Why Two words GAMMA SQUEEZE If you don t know what a gamma squeeze is then you should go back to fucking sleep because it s the only thing pushing up these beautiful companies all year GME Gamma Squeeze RKT Gamma Squeeze AMC Gamma Squeeze TLDR Gamma Squeeze MM Institutions work on a hedging system They sell your dumbass some OTM FD s for pennies in return for pennies in profit but if those OTM s become ITM s then our MM need to be hedged to deliver your ass some shares in case you exercise that shit They do this by staying delta neutral and buying up shares in case your calls go in the money The more calls that arrive in the money the more shares they buy to stay hedged the more calls in the money the more people jump in to make money the more calls that go in the money the more shares that are hedged Endless Feedback Loop I don t know the math and I don t know how but the last two years have shown that equity can move like a rocket due to this shit TSLA gamma squeezed itself til it cummed rockets last year Everybody made fucking money That ride doesn t last forever though and in 2021 we had a very special guy start talking a lot of shit Michael Burry talks a lot of shit on TSLA Grab a bowl of popcorn and read through his archived twitter posts https twitter com burryarchive lang en https twitter com burryarchive lang en Why Probably because he s a boomer who doesn t know that the world is leaving his old ass behind He actually thinks Ford and VW

puts at least until June of next year The only way this is accomplished is if they receive massive purchases along with massive call option buying to produce the squeeze effects they received last year This is asking a lot as liquidity in the market often runs dry and everyone who is in it for the long haul already dropped all their cash in I think they need a fucking miracle personally How Fast does this go and how far down does it drop This could happen slow af or this could happen fast af especially if institutions hop in like they did with AMC and GME to drag this thing back to hell with dollar signs in their eyes There s already some hints of the flow turning predatory if ya ll notice those high volume 1P 50P open for 50k to 100k contracts Could I be wrong Yes but that s exactly

anniversary of the completion of IPO amp x200B PROS According to Bureau of Labor Statistics the healthcare sector is the largest and fastest growing job segment in the US employing over 20 million professionals in 2020 Total US employment between 2019 and 2029 is expected to grow by 15 for all healthcare professionals vs 4 for all occupations Men on average represented 25 of the US healthcare workforce in 2019 while men s business represented only 17 of net revenues of 2020 In 2020 the total addressable market of the health apparel industry was an estimated 12B in the US and 79B globally according to a Frost and Sullivan Study that FIGS commissioned The same study says the total addressable market in the US is expected to grow by a 6 1 Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR over the next 5 years from 12B in 2020 to approximately 16B in 2025 FIGS sells 98 of their products through their digital platform and leverages social media platforms to understand and better serve the community of

54ba3072152142259a79185abd9fa065f7f5c757 amp x200B CONS FIGS relies heavily on word of mouth advertising which can be a blessing and a curse https www cnn com 2020 10 15 us figs scrubs video women do trnd index html FIGS only recently achieved profitability and may not maintain profitability in the future Additionally the recent rapid growth may not be sustainable or indicative of future growth and they expect the growth rate to ultimately slow over time Shipping is a critical part of the business and changes can adversely affect operations There is reliance on a limited number of third party suppliers to provide material for and produce products which could cause problems in the supply chain FIGS also operates within a highly competitive market with 202 employees and will be focused on the healthcare community https www marketwatch com story figs will focus on medical scrubs now but could set its sights on other industry uniforms in the future 11622215256 for the medium term Some

Barco Uniforms 25M in revenue 225 employees Careismatic Brands 221M in revenue 730 employees amp x200B CONCLUSION Given the recent IPO I expect there to be some price movement and for it to drop in the upcoming weeks I will wait for a better reentry price With that said healthcare apparel continuously needs to be replenished resulting in highly predictable recurring demand FIGS has room to grow over the next 3 5 years and I like it as a longer term investment I am not a financial advisor

posting an update Allow me to summarize 1 Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones 2 We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles EV The people want it the government wants it and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen 3 The government wants zero emissions Workhorse trucks are already zero emission Gas and diesel powered trucks are not These petroleum based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up 4 Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies 5 Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks see pictures The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there s no going back Zero emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure Think about it Walmart Fed Ex Amazon UPS Postal Services Supermarkets for food delivery etc 6 350 000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times This number is projected to increase 7 Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management who has been very popular lately google her had purchased a few million shares for her fund She has since sold This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted more on that below Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52 week highs a few weeks ago Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting It s a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them I m not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn t find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless 8 In April Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks That s 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars That s an enormous number of trucks and that s only from one wholesaler 9 Workhorse s main problems are with manufacturing and delivery The reasons why 1 They re limited in part due to supply chain constraints There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components This has impacted the entire industry including Ford and GM This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales In addition Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions Inc to supply their batteries This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world 2 Electric trucks are a relatively new industry Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse s capacity to meet this demand has been limited Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve they teamed up with someone who can They re now partnered with J B Poindexter amp Co a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering construction and assembly 10 There are several EV players Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles 11 Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately 521 000 compared to approximately 84 000 in the first quarter of 2020 That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly 12 Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE which Workhorse was invested in 13 The Company had approximately 205 1 million in cash in March 2021 This helps limit the need to acquire debt 14 The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a 6 billion contract with the USPS last February It s now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company This one time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies Furthermore Workhorse may still win this 6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front In addition the USPS Postmaster Louis DeJoy who influences the direction of the contract is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it s assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr DeJoy s decision of granting it to Workhorse s competitor If this contract once again becomes up for grabs there s a good chance Workhorse will win it If that happens watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock Forget the moon I m talking about GN z11 the furthest galaxy from us 15 Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you re seeing This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in 16 There are 8 analysts who have recently ranked WKHS Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy NONE recommend a sell It s unanimous NONE recommend selling Some of the analysts recommend price targets are even 24 20 20 and 17 Cowen amp Co Colliers Securities Oppenheimer Roth Capital R F Lafferty BTIG B Riley Financial and Wolfe Research 17 You re helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future 18 The stock price is about 30 of its 52 week high 19 This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL It s shorted about 40 of its float It is one of the most if not THE MOST shorted stock out there amp x200B It s very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can t expect it to happen overnight It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you especially now The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens They re accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day They ve learned to process this emotion and not act upon it However they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear They re counting on you selling out of fear the bottom and buying out of greed the top If you wait them out they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares Also the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises So how to deal with fear 1 Accept and expect fear to happen because it will Anticipate it and do not act upon it 2 Do not invest money that you can t afford to lose This way you can let it ride 3 Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC AMC was shorted about 20 on its float it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC Also understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are They don t make their money from making good stock picks They make their money from taking a cut of the money they re investing for other people They make up fancy words algorithms and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can t even beat the Dow Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things Look it up if you don t believe it TLDR 1 WKHS is prime for a short squeeze It is one of the most if not the most shorted stock out there 2 WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced Out of 8 research analysts who follow it all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell Price targets for several were at or above 20 3 Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed 4 Demand for their products has skyrocketed 5 Don t be lazy don t TLDR this one ready the whole thing I am not a financial analyst I am a physician with a love of finance I do not give financial advice This is for educational purposes only and I may very well be completely wrong You can lose all of your money on this stock or any stock for that matter You must do your own homework and research before buying any stock I personally love this stock and I own over 10 000 shares of it

posting an update 1 Workhorse develops zero emission electric trucks and delivery drones that legislation is forcing to happen 2 Petroleum based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up with government requirements 3 Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies 4 Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks see pictures The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there s no going back Zero emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure Think about it Walmart Fed Ex Amazon UPS Postal Services Supermarkets for food delivery etc 5 According to the NYT 350 000 delivery trucks are already sold per year This number is projected to increase 6 Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management who has been very popular lately google her had purchased a few million shares for her fund She has since sold This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted more on that below Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52 week highs a few weeks ago Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting It s a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them I m not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn t find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless 7 In April Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks That s 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars That s an enormous number of trucks and that s only from one wholesaler 8 Workhorse s main problems are with manufacturing and delivery The reasons why 1 They re limited in part due to supply chain constraints There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components This has impacted the entire industry including Ford and GM This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales In addition Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions Inc to supply their batteries This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world 2 Electric trucks are a relatively new industry Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse s capacity to meet this demand has been limited Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve they teamed up with someone who can They re now partnered with J B Poindexter amp Co a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering construction and assembly 9 There are several EV players Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles 10 Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately 521 000 compared to approximately 84 000 in the first quarter of 2020 That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly 11 Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE which Workhorse was invested in 12 Approximately 205 1 million cash on hand as of March 2021 This helps limit the need to acquire debt 13 The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a 6 billion contract with the USPS last February It s now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company This one time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean

to the volatility of this stock I ve taken a perspective from an industry outlook to justify that Tilray presents potential growth as a leading cannabis company in the next few years If you are looking for a cannabis stock to buy then TLRY https utradea com stocks TLRY might be a solid pick The company presents a strong infrastructure with a multinational supply chain and distribution network as well as strategic acquisitions that position them for long term growth in a high growth market Company Overview Tilray Inc NASDAQ TLRY https utradea com stocks TLRY TSE TLRY engages in the research cultivation production and distribution of medical cannabis and cannabinoids The company supplies high quality medical cannabis products to tens of thousands of patients in 17 countries spanning 5 continents through their subsidiaries in Australia Germany Latin America Portugal and Canada They only operate in countries where cannabis or hemp derived cannabinoids are legal and permitted under applicable federal state provincial and local laws Tilray continues to be a pioneer in the development of the global cannabis market and was one of the first companies to be licensed by Health Canada to cultivate medical and to be a licensed seller in Canada They were also the first company to legally export medical cannabis from North America to countries in Europe Africa Latin America etc Brand and Products The Tilray brand is their medical brand that s been established as a global medical cannabis brand and is designed to appeal to prescribers and patients in the global medical market High Park Holdings Ltd is their subsidiary that was established to develop produce sell and distribute adult use cannabis produces for recreational purposes Portfolio and pricing

and products to appeal to diverse sets of patients and consumers Leveraging their production capacity in North American and Europe to meet current and long term demand growth that is to be expected Financial Information Revenue Tilray s operating results are reported in two business segments 1 licensed cannabis and 2 unlicensed hemp Total cannabis revenue totalled 133 605 000 USD and accounted for 63 5 of total revenue Of the total cannabis revenue the adult use channel generated the most at 62 7 followed by international medical use Canada s medical use and bulk sales contributing the least Total hemp revenue totalled 76 877 000 USD and accounted for 35 5 of the total revenue YoY revenue change increased 26 that was driven by 25 growth in the cannabis segment and 28 by the hemp segment General Expenses Tilray s biggest expenses in FY2020 were their general and administrative expenses which totalled 85 883 000 USD or 41 of the revenue Despite this high expense it showed a YoY decrease of 23 compared to 2019 due to the realization of implemented cost savings initiatives that saw a reduced headcount of 258 positions and also a non recurring cost of 4 8 million for severance payments Gross Margin Tilray has a gross margin of 12 for FY 2020 that increased from 2019 comparable period of 14 Gross Margin for Cannabis Tilray s 3 gross margin in 2020 improved from the comparable period in 2019 primarily due to reduced inventory valuation adjustments and overall improvements in their cost of production relating to their cost cutting efforts If excluding inventory adjustments then gross margin increased by 23 from 20 in 2019 and the improvement is attributable to the increased sales in the international medical markets and the introduction of new products into the adult use market Gross Margin for Hemp Tilray s gross margin of 37 in 2020 increased compared to 2019 due to reduced inventory adjustments If excluding inventory adjustments we come to a gross margin percentage of 42 that represents a decrease from 2019 and this is due to the increased promotional activity for their hemp products Recent Developments On December 15 2020 Tilray Inc and Aphria Inc entered into an agreement that would unite two of the biggest names in the legal cannabis industry Under the terms of this agreement each Aprhia share will be exchanged for 0 8381 of a Tilray share and as a result of this exchange ratio Aphria shareholders will own 62 of the combined company s common shares This nearly 4B deal was closed last month in May and formally merged the two companies With Aphria s recreational position in Canada combined with Tilray s strength in the international markets this merger will make Tilray an industry leader in the Canadian pot market and in a position to generate more growth in many more markets Our focus now turns to execution on our highest return priorities including business integration and accelerating our global growth strategy CEO Irwin Simon after the deal was closed Industry Statistics and Outlook The global cannabis market is estimated to be valued at 20 5B in 2020 and projected to reach 90 4B by 2026 representing a CAGR of 28 Market primarily to be driven by the medical use of cannabis and the legalization of marijuana North American accounted for the largest market share of 79 6 in 2020 for both medical and recreational purposes Europe projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period due to increasing legalization Adult use segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 54 6 in 2020 and expected to expand at the highest CAGR during the forecast period The global cannabis beverages market estimated to reach 2 8B by 2025 and grow at a CAGR of 17 8 from 2019 to 2025 Heavily fragmented market due to the presence of medium and small scale companies With Tilray s entry into this market already combined with the Aphria merger with the acquisition of SweetWater Tilray has a strong backing and R amp D to take over a lot of the North American market share The Canadian cannabis industry is worth an estimated 2 2B in annual sales Second fastest growing industry in Canada at more than 28 annually Investment Thesis Strategic Acquisitions and Mergers Aphria s strong balance sheet and financials provide a great platform for future profitability and cash flow generation with many growth opportunities As well the combined company will have access to capital giving the company the power to easily accelerate its growth and deliver attractive returns for shareholders Together with Aprhia Tilray has a portfolio of carefully curated brands with diverse product offerings across all consumer segments Tilray s merger with Aphria will increase its Canadian market share and further diversify its available product offerings Aphria s acquisition of SweetWater Brewing Company a cannabis lifestyle branded craft brewer in November 2020 gave the business a position in setting up to sell cannabis infused beverages once legal in the U S As well Tilray s most recent agreement with Authentic Brands Group and also the acquisition of Manitoba Harvest a leading hemp food manufacturer and pioneer in branded CBD and wellness products will also allow Tilray to penetrate the U S market and enter a new line of products Currently with the merger Tilray will offer products in every major cannabis category such as flower pre roll oils capsules vapes edibles and beverages and establish a stronger brand and presence worldwide With potential legislation changes ahead towards the legalization of marijuana it will give the industry immense potential for growth in the coming years With established segments in cannabis infused beverages through SweetWater and hemp CBD and wellness products through Manitoba Harvest Tilray is positioned with strong financials to execute its growth strategy When marijuana becomes legal in other parts of the world Tilray will be well positioned to compete in the market given its strong brand and distribution system in place Risks Competition from the illicit cannabis market could impact their ability to succeed Competition from marijuana black markets limits Tilray s ability to potentially increase product pricing Despite the legalization of medical and adult use cannabis in Canada illegal dispensaries and black markets are abundant and a direct competitor to their business In addition these illicit market operations may offer products with higher concentrations than what is prohibited under Canadian regulations and may offer lower prices This adversely affects Tilray s market share and potential sales Research of the health effects of medical cannabis is relatively new and subject to further study which could impact demand for their medical cannabis products Research regarding the viability safety efficacy and dosing of cannabis or isolated cannabinoids such as CBD and THC remains in early stages Future research and clinical trials may draw opposing conclusions to Tilray s business and adversely affect the social acceptance of cannabis and demand for its products Sources 1 https www bnnbloomberg ca aphria

Credit Auspicious dissenT squeeeezeem, Credit Auspicious dissenT https www youtube com channel UCSBJrti7OlWO5MZ6uSRSdlQ TLDR This company has a high short interest that is only continuing to increase according to Ortex https public ortex com along with a days to cover that has essentially tripled in the last week alone Fundamentally they are better now than ever before yet are trading at more than a 60 premium from ATHs Shorts have hammered the stock and I think an opportunity may have presented itself if you all agree TLDR for the TLDR This stock is good and has a higher SI than BB and has an extremely auspicious likely to succeed business model with innovations that guarantee and justify a price target that is nearly 4x the current share price by EOY Where I got all this info will be listed High SI Of the shares outstanding the short interest of this stock is 36M shares 13 12 per the last settlement date May 14th BUT the estimated short interest according to Ortex is now 42M shares a fairly substantial increase from the current as of last publication 36M short interest Days to cover has increased from the 1s to now 3 32 in just a few days Which is good because it means if a run up were to happen then the shorts would have a hard time exiting their position making a short squeeze more auspicious According to Fintel io https fintel io the short share availability has only decreased and stayed today indicating that very few shorts have covered today even with the price up significantly This is because the less short shares the brokers have to lend out the higher amount of short shares that have already been lent out meaning that the people those short shares have been lent out to have not covered given that the short share availability has done nothing but go down and sideways all of Friday Not only does this stock have a high SI but it has increased recently meaning a squeeze opportunity may be perfectly aligning Fundamentally Undervalued Most high growth stocks have gotten obliterated since February 16th and this one is no different in that regard However the fundamentals of this company have only exponentially increased with essentially zero price action reaction There is proven manipulation in this stock s price action imo Just to name a few of the catalysts the price action practically utterly ignored ALL of these were after February 16 the peak of high growth 2 revenue beats 1 EPS beat CEO and 3 C suite members getting LEAPS with share exercisability valuing in the hundreds of millions WITH an exercise price of 7 83 which is ABOVE the current and then stock price announcement of 5 studies that in the company s own words would act as important marketing events that would likely lead to increased sales CFO projection of substantial double digit revenue growth along with his 20 40 YOY operating expense increase projection for the next few years According to own company estimates as far as sales and adoption profitability chances based on their numbers are likely to come at least one year before analysts are projection imo MORE bullish insider transactions in the form of the CMO picking up more LEAPS after her original one mentioned above CEO and COO being awarded tens of millions of dollars in profit in the form of hundreds of thousands of shares 840k to be exact and as of now they have not sold any new EXTREMELY innovative product confirmation nanonozzle imo added to MSCI index confirmation of several large sales several studies proving 100 concordance and increased accuracy of their main product compared to gold standard of the market this company is trying to disrupt HUGE institutional ownership increase from around 4 5 at lows up to 15 60 currently This document https docs google com document d 12jAjUCFcVm7447LKvB4gQPg2BRT 1SxILV 2jNXpxB8 edit usp sharing explains more in depth why this company is extremely fundamentally undervalued and WILL do great things in the future Interesting Healthcare Revolution A higher life expectancy for everyone in the aggregate along with a better quality of life is what would happen should their goal of global Sap adoption be effectuated Chemotherapeutic drug enhancements is one of many of the revolutions that we could see specifically because of what this company does Paraphrasing the CEO we believe that the next big wave of innovation in Biology will derive from optical genome mapping which is what Bio na no Geno mi cs B N G O s Saphyr does optical genome mapping and they do it better than anyone According to the company itself gt 500bp detection in SVs with Saphyr compared to the CMA FISH and KT competition is cost effective requires less hands on time and has a faster turnaround time Not to mention it has more accurate readings and has less false positives LOH and SNV detection are said to be in the works currently zero of the three competing methods can detect these Nor can FISH CMA or KT detect the wide range of variant classes Saphyr can With this knowledge one wonders why Saphyr has not already been adopted in all 2 500 cytogenetic labs most of this can be attributed to resistance of change and relatively low academic praise and exposure of Saphyr s capabilities but with FIVE large clinical studies in the works on NIPT postnatal screening hematological malignancies in leukemia and lymphomas and solid tumor research that is sure to change all in due time Not to mention cost per genome reducing from 450 550 currently to 100 by at maximum 2023 Saphyr is already cost effective just imagine how cheap it will be compared to other methods once the price more than halves per genome Throughput to increase by 14x from the already immense maximum of 5000 genomes per year with the current Saphyr system Throw in in the nanonozzle release that may include SNV detection and will fill in the gaps of what current NGS is missing and one has a strong case to make that this company will revolutionize healthcare and the entire genomic sector as we know it So What I hold 1623 shares and a LEAPS call option I plan on yoloing another 10k shares in B N G O by EOY at the latest I will not sell anything for years I am hodling regardless of what market headwinds come to fruition in my mind the company will do great things but it is hard to predict when they drop PR and harder to predict when other people will react to it There is a short squeeze on the horizon and I believe gt 10 is the true current fundamental value of the company easily If my fellow retards want to burn the shorts of B N G O then I will lead the charge by yoloing in the rest of the current BP in my account enough for about 300 400 more shares There IS a short squeeze on the horizon and I am willing to hodl with diamond hands for however long it takes If WSB were to agree then I think I have an idea of what may happen https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nlua3m the fellowship of the saphyr LMK what y all think is B N G O next up Need to know terms Nanonozzle innovations or product that would enable sequencing capabilities along with maybe single nucleotide variant detection Basically when this releases we don t know when the stock price will probably go up anywhere from 30 500 depending on how innovative it is and how much it makes NGS obsolete which is what the C suite has implied it will do NGS next generation sequencing competition with OGM OGM optical genome mapping what B N G O s main product the Saphyr does All my sources can be found in this document https docs google com

manufactures hardware amp software solutions for electric vehicles at large It offers a portfolio of hardware software amp services for corporate public amp residential customers Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries History In June 2017 CHPT took over 9 800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE Prior to that point CHPT managed 34 900 charging stations across Mexico Australia Canada and the United States The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano On November 28 2018 CHPT raised 240 million At the time CHPT maintained 57 000 charging spots In 2019 VW s Electrify America https en wikipedia org wiki Electrify America and CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers Company reached 100 000 chargers in September 2019 while adding more than 2 000 charging locations per month Currently CHPT offers 132k charging station network Which accounts for 72 market share of total level 2 charging in North America New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021 What is the business model of CHPT Charge Point sells hardware amp software equipment amp network subscriptions to property owners The company doesn t own the majority of stations It doesn t monetize energy It only monetizes the driver thus capital light business model BUSINESS OVERVIEW Market Cap 7bn Shares Float 299mln Institutional ownership 13

html analyze fuel ELEC shows that CHPT wields the largest market share at 42 8K L2 chargers out of 92 8K total of which 11 5K are non networked carving 53 market share of networked chargers No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16 8K No3 largest is SemaCharge Network at 5 2K followed by Blink with 3 1k which is 4th In terms of L3 Superchargers where Tesla leads the way with 10 7k of 19 6k units CHPT is competitive with 1 5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2 5k Superchargers account for 22 of the market pie L2 75 and L1 3 of market share People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 amp L2 Well that s wrong L3 is obviously the option for the highways commercial and service transportation Even larger segment though is found at parking lots restaurants cinemas sports arenas malls corporate offices and other mass conglomerations This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install but with longer charging times perfect fit Products Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers Solutions for every use case all vehicle types and brands High efficiency in power and footprint Modular scalable secure architecture designed for serviceability Unparalleled quality advanced testing vehicle functional climate environment for long term reliability Options for site hosts to use custom branding Software Enables Control of who can use stations and when All vehicles to get charged on time Multiple vehicles to share power Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied Roaming integrations with other charging networks Challengers VLTA Claims to go beyond just charging EVs their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with PLTR When company compares itself to the competition they do it all they own the gear they sell the electricity they provide software and networks they do fancy data things they do advertising The things they don t do are manufacture and sell the chargers They cherry pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better engagement but given they only have 1 7k Level 2s amp 6 L3 It s like chargers as billboards selected to prime locations Anyone can replicate it if it provides substantial revenue boost competitors will emulate it SemmaConnect Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant Sema appears not to have a L3 offering nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals single family residential EVGO EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers and base their business largely on L3 chargers AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1 4k L3 which garners 4th market share Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates 0 04 min assuming you spend 7 99 month and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3 EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables What differentiates the company is the L3 focus BLNK Overhyped POP stock Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals Claims to operate on an owner operator model From EC The Company made continued progress with its owner operator strategy the number of commercial Blink owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51 in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period VWAGY Subsidiary Electrify America L3 focused company it enjoys 2 5k L3 chargers EM also sells a L2 for the home EM offers an app membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board Company doesn t appear to build their own chargers instead relying on procurement using third party hardware and software Near Term Catalysts In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill AlixPartners estimates 300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030 including 50 billion in the U S alone It s not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays but you don t know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts Well the biggest companies you might say It s not that clear cut What is clear cut is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure CHPT has the most experienced 14yrs company with largest manufacturing capacity technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states 500k by 2030 Oh yeah one more thing former CHPT board member is in current administration That s only US CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world s renewable energy aka Europe Also Canada Australia UK Mexico among other places You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road Just like railways roads telcoms and internet Long Term Catalysts Fossil fuel bans Transit electrification dates Incentive programs All major auto OEM brands committed to electric Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration CHPT Estimated 1B Revenue at 3 EV Penetration Miscellaneous CHPT Apple Store rating 4 6 CHPT also has the 1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app In collaborations with Daimler Toyota BMW Siemens etc No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies Customers include Google Target IKEA NASA GM Pepsico Disney McDonalds FedEx Stanford etc Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st MOAT First Mover Advantage With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry this is where big contracts will go Asset light business model Selective ownership of charge stations outsources maintenance amp responsibilities to the owner Economies of Scale CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity Network Effect 75 of charging network market share amp operations in 14 countries CONCLUSION All in all CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure with light CapEx business model Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs recurring revenue streams and visibility CHPT finds itself in green friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains EV Ecosystem Hardware Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology Yes most of its network is L2 chargers but it s where most of the money is to be made As users go to restaurants malls sports events concerts office cinema universities or just a Parking Lot There will be L2 charger not L3 due to Charger Cost Basis Time Parked Pretty straightforward formula Why am I interested in CHPT Because it s an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry Because it s a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens And is a home GAS station Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals amp 13 institutional ownership what s going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it Let me use a technical term you ll understand the valuation will go bananas Average target price

of AMC at 2 45 9 45 prices TL DR THE POPCORN WAS A TRICK Retail owns more than 80 of AMC They re attempting to Dilute shares which will allow them to give control of the company back to institutions and if a short squeeze happens they can bail them out at lower prices and make raising the stock harder Share dilution will drop the value of your shares The free Popcorn was just to butter us up VOTE NO FOR SHARE DILUTION ADDITIONAL SHARES To qualify for a vote you need to have owned shares BEFORE JUNE 3rd If you do continue reading Right now we as retail own the majority of AMC and they re attempting to dilute the shares which will change this and lower the price Allowing them to dilute and add more shares will mean they will regain control and are able to bail out any short seller they want AMC is attempting to issue 25 million new shares that means if we as retail own 80 of the company once they issue more shares and institutions buy back we could in theory own only 30 40 percent or less The power of control is up for grabs Their majority shareholders have sold out IF YOU DON T USE YOUR VOTE IT GOES TO THE COMPANY AS YES TO DILUTE Every director of AMC sold off about 30 percent of their shares at around 30 On April 22 2021 WANDA GROUP WAE on filings owned 30 million AMC shares and controlled most the vote On the May 21st they sold out and only own 10 thousand shares as of today Mudrick sold out 250 million shares links to all this bellow It s very possible WANDA GROUP sold out because they knew AMC planned to dilute the shares and we as retail most likely would not know how to vote against this IT IS IN OUR BEST INTEREST NOT TO DILUTE OURSELVES OUR VOTE IS WORTH MORE THAN OUR SHARES It s very rare a company on the stock market is not institutionally owned At this moment we own and control most of AMC We would only be okay with diluting if it meant taking control of shares owned by institutions and putting more control into the power of retail We currently have this power and diluting will remove it 40 percent of the shareholder base sold out before this pivotal vote Now they have no voting control and the stock is up 300 percent The dilution is to drive the price down so their internal groups can take back control In the last 3 4 years AMC has only used Goldman Sachs amp Co LLC and B Riley Securities Inc in their share offerings Now they ve included Citi Bank in their most recent findings I would assume that CITI has a large stake or their clients have large stakes in shorting and are feeling the effects of the short squeeze If the vote is passed to issue more shares it not only makes raising the stock price harder it also allows AMC to bail out institutions by doing behind the door deals with their newly issued stock So instead of short sellers closing for losses at 100 they would be able to close at lower prices that AMC sees fit think 20 a share type loss How do we stop share dilution AMC needs our approval to dilute the shares and drop the price July 29th is the meeting you can only vote if you owned the shares before june 3rd The first question on the vote is about the share dilution You need vote NO IF YOU DO NOT VOTE YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY VOTE YES FOR EACH OF YOUR SHARES You can also vote by proxy if anyone here understands how that works that means you can give someone authorization to use all your shares and vote on your behalf All the other questions on the vote you can vote yes for just make sure you vote NO on share dilution Will AMC die without dilution No us voting no against dilution simply protects our share value as investors and tells AMC to come up and propose a different way to raise capital that does not screw us over 100 and help out big institutions They will amend and propose something that is more favorable to us as investors TL DR VOTE NO to share dilution We ve all invested too much to be screwed over because we didn t know how to stop it AMC Sources WANDA GROUP selling

300 shares of AMC at 2 45 9 45 prices TL DR THE POPCORN WAS A TRICK Retail owns more than 80 of AMC They re attempting to Dilute shares which will allow them to give control of the company back to institutions and if a short squeeze happens they can bail them out at lower prices and make raising the stock harder Share dilution will drop the value of your shares The free Popcorn was just to butter us up VOTE NO FOR SHARE DILUTION ADDITIONAL SHARES To qualify for a vote you need to have owned shares BEFORE JUNE 3rd If you do continue reading Right now we as retail own the majority of AMC and they re attempting to dilute the shares which will change this and lower the price Allowing them to dilute and add more shares will mean they will regain control and are able to bail out any short seller they want AMC is attempting to issue 25 million new shares that means if we as retail own 80 of the company once they issue more shares and institutions buy back we could in theory own only 30 40 percent or less The power of control is up for grabs Their majority shareholders have sold out IF YOU DON T USE YOUR VOTE IT GOES TO THE COMPANY AS YES TO DILUTE Every director of AMC sold off about 30 percent of their shares at around 30 On April 22 2021 WANDA GROUP WAE on filings owned 30 million AMC shares and controlled most the vote On the May 21st they sold out and only own 10 thousand shares as of today Mudrick sold out 250 million shares links to all this bellow It s very possible WANDA GROUP sold out because they knew AMC planned to dilute the shares and we as retail most likely would not know how to vote against this IT IS IN OUR BEST INTEREST NOT TO DILUTE OURSELVES OUR VOTE IS WORTH MORE THAN OUR SHARES It s very rare a company on the stock market is not institutionally owned At this moment we own and control most of AMC We would only be okay with diluting if it meant taking control of shares owned by institutions and putting more control into the power of retail We currently have this power and diluting will remove it 40 percent of the shareholder base sold out before this pivotal vote Now they have no voting control and the stock is up 300 percent The dilution is to drive the price down so their internal groups can take back control In the last 3 4 years AMC has only used Goldman Sachs amp Co LLC and B Riley Securities Inc in their share offerings Now they ve included Citi Bank in their most recent findings I would assume that CITI has a large stake or their clients have large stakes in shorting and are feeling the effects of the short squeeze If the vote is passed to issue more shares it not only makes raising the stock price harder it also allows AMC to bail out institutions by doing behind the door deals with their newly issued stock So instead of short sellers closing for losses at 100 they would be able to close at lower prices that AMC sees fit think 20 a share type loss How do we stop share dilution AMC needs our approval to dilute the shares and drop the price July 29th is the meeting you can only vote if you owned the shares before june 3rd The first question on the vote is about the share dilution You need vote NO IF YOU DO NOT VOTE YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY VOTE YES FOR EACH OF YOUR SHARES You can also vote by proxy if anyone here understands how that works that means you can give someone authorization to use all your shares and vote on your behalf All the other questions on the vote you can vote yes for just make sure you vote NO on share dilution Will AMC die without dilution No us voting no against dilution simply protects our share value as investors and tells AMC to come up and propose a different way to raise capital that does not screw us over 100 and help out big institutions They will amend and propose something that is more favorable to us as investors amp x200B AMC Sources WANDA GROUP selling shares https www hollywoodreporter com business business news

AMC planned to dilute the shares and we as retail most likely would not know how to vote against this IT IS IN OUR BEST INTEREST NOT TO DILUTE OURSELVES OUR VOTE IS WORTH MORE THAN OUR SHARES It s very rare a company on the stock market is not institutionally owned At this moment we own and control most of AMC We would only be okay with diluting if it meant taking control of shares owned by institutions and putting more control into the power of retail We currently have this power and diluting will remove it 40 percent of the shareholder base sold out before this pivotal vote Now they have no voting control and the stock is up 300 percent The dilution is to drive the price down so their internal groups can take back control In the last 3 4 years AMC has only used Goldman Sachs amp Co LLC and B Riley Securities Inc in their share offerings Now they ve included Citi Bank in their most recent findings I would assume that CITI has a large stake or their clients have large stakes in shorting and are feeling the effects of the short squeeze If the vote is passed to issue more shares it not only makes raising the stock price harder it also allows AMC to bail out institutions by doing behind the door deals with their newly issued stock So instead of short sellers closing for losses at 100 they would be able to close at lower prices that AMC sees fit think 20 a share type loss How do we stop share dilution AMC needs our approval to dilute the shares and drop the price July 29th is the meeting you can only vote if you owned the shares before june 3rd The first question on the vote is about the share dilution You need vote NO IF YOU DO NOT VOTE YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY VOTE YES FOR EACH OF YOUR SHARES You can also vote by proxy if anyone here understands how that works that means you can give someone authorization to use all your shares and vote on your behalf All the other questions on the vote you can vote yes for just make sure you vote NO on share dilution Will AMC die without dilution No us voting no against dilution simply protects our share value as investors and tells AMC to come up and propose a different way to raise capital that does not screw us over 100 and help out big institutions They will amend and propose something that is more favorable to us as investors AMC Sources WANDA GROUP selling shares https www hollywoodreporter com business

posted what I thought was a neat illustration https www reddit com r Bogleheads comments mco57x how much gains it takes to recover from market below showing why drawdowns matter sometimes and thus why a 100 TQQQ 3x QQQ portfolio is probably not optimal Then I ve also seen a few posts like this https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments modli5 tqqq is an excellent long term investment even recently praising a 100 TQQQ position Many incorrectly posit that TQQQ s massive drawdowns simply don t matter because it will always recover And I even realize why this idea seems intuitive because its leverage would allow it to climb out of the hole faster As usual recency bias is rearing its ugly head First this post has nothing to do with the oft cited boogeyman of LETFs known as volatility decay or beta slippage of the fund itself In short it s not as big of a deal as it s made out to be http www ddnum com articles leveragedETFs php I m a fan of LETFs I use them myself and I do hold them for more than a day Secondly this is also ignoring the fact that QQQ is basically a tech fund at this point The market is already over 1 4 tech and Growth is looking expensive https www reddit com r M1Finance comments ixpset great video for those who like to bet on large I neither own nor recommend owning QQQ or TQQQ TQQQ just seems to be very popular and is the subject of most of these LETF posts but this concept could obviously apply to 100 UPRO as well which I do own Drawdowns are the kryptonite here Here s that graph I mentioned amp x200B https preview redd it p2vt2i2vcw371 png width 529 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f60ac73b94453fac27093d50a3c313bb4f1ea9ca As a simplistic example using dollars suppose your 100 portfolio drops by 10 10 to 90 You now require an 11 gain to get back to 100 The stellar soaring of Big Tech over the past decade has resulted in huge inflows into the fund and its performance during that time looks fantastic Here s TQQQ s inception in 2010

6dcd0f2ec88933b0e49ce75bb6fa9cadc5c63112 Looks great right But as we know past performance does not indicate future performance Moreover a decade especially one without a major crash is a terribly short amount of time from which to draw any sort of meaningful conclusions So we need to go back further to get a better idea of how TQQQ performs or would have performed at least through major stock market crashes I created some simulation data so that we can do just that by simulating returns going back further than the fund s inception Going back to 1987 when the NASDAQ 100 started for TQQQ vs QQQ tells a somewhat different story amp x200B Source PortfolioVisualizer com https preview redd it 2hq53oizcw371 png width 1788 amp format png amp auto webp amp s c264a2ad929157c9036ebae2bc4924f4af780f34 Notice how buying TQQQ alone is basically a timing gamble that depends heavily on your entry and exit points Basically it can take too long for the leveraged ETF to recover after a major crash After the Dotcom crash of 2000 TQQQ didn t catch up to QQQ until late 2007 right before it crashed again in the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 Had you bought in January 2000 right before the Dotcom crash you d still be in the red today amp x200B Source PortfolioVisualizer com https preview redd it u27r30r0dw371 png width 1790 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 06c45123fe9327b8f5a150f4e76f4503364367f8 So how can we make it work We need to mitigate those harmful drawdowns As usual diversification is your friend especially with LETFs As with the famous Hedgefundie Adventure Google it TMF 3x long treasuries should probably be the primary hedge of choice Yes interest rates falling for the past 40 years has resulted in great performance for long bonds Whether or not long treasuries will provide the same protection in the future that they have in the past is another conversation but here we re just looking for an insurance policy for crashes via uncorrelation and hopefully negative correlation even in a low zero rising rate environment You can extend this idea with other assets like gold too obviously to further lower volatility and mitigate drawdowns which is what Bridgewater s All Weather Fund attempts to do 60 40 TQQQ TMF for effective 180 120 exposure looks the best historically and dominated the funds held in isolation amp x200B
