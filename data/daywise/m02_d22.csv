under the sun amp x200B In every market bubble you always hear the same language the same rationalizations the same absurd arguments These people think they are offering some new unique insight in reality all they offer are the same manic rationalizations that existed in every other bubble market in history Let s address the primary two bull rationalizations today before we set into the bear thesis amp x200B 1 Interest rates are low Nowhere for money to go except stocks When you really drill down into it this is some bizarre logic It s essentially saying you are forced to make more risky bets if less risky bets are less profitable In other words it s a manifestation of the greedy FOMO mindset that occurs precisely during bubbles Ultimately these bull aren t even arguing that we aren t in a bubble They are arguing we are in a bubble but that the bubble is JUSTIFIED The obvious counter is that holding cash is neither impossible nor even undesirable in a low interest rate environment What s the worst that can happen if I sit on a pure cash portfolio I lose 2 per year Not good of course but not the end of the world either What s the worst that can happen if I dump all my money into stocks at all time highs and the market crashes I lose 50 of my funds in as little as a month Ouch The idea that I m forced to risk losing a huge percentage of my capital because losing 2 a year is simply impossible to endure is the sort of logic that can only arise under a euphoric bubble mindset Of course the premise that these bulls are relying on is that the market simply won t crash or that they will be prescient enough to calmly hop out of the market once a crash becomes obvious But the whole point is that the crash is never obvious especially to permabulls They see a dip and they buy it They see a deeper dip what a great opportunity so they buy more And before they realize the dip isn t simply a dip they are already fucked Tale as old as time The funny thing is this argument can be used to justify almost any investment no matter how irrational Why hold cash when bonds pay more Why buy bonds when index funds pay more Why buy index funds when SPACS pay more Why buy SPACS when flipping cocaine pays more After all if you assume that holding cash is simply impossible since it loses to inflation what sort of high risk investment can you not justify What s most interesting is that this argument isn t even new The ridiculously low interest rates set by the Fed in the past were precisely what sowed the seeds for the massive housing bubble that led to the 2008 crash The Fed is ultimately a bubble creator something even WSB is well aware of 2 If you sit out this rally you will end up behind even if you are right This is perhaps the most popular argument of permabulls They argue that if you sat out the last 10 months something this is essentially a straw man argument except in reference to perma bears then you would have missed out on massive gains And therefore the implicit argument is you can NEVER sit out If you carefully analyze this argument you will realize it is literally nothing more than FOMO to the extreme It s Fear Of Missing Out disguised as macroeconomic theory I have to stay in the market perpetually I can never sit out because if I do I will MISS OUT on gains And you better stay in the market with me otherwise you will miss out too dummy First of all I will admit this is a good argument against people who are legitimately perma bears People who do sit out a market in fear for months and months do actually miss out on substantial gains But not everyone signalling the warning signs of a bubble are perma bears There are clear historical signals of an irrational bubble and those who pay attention to such signals are not missing out they are simply protecting their wealth against irrational greed An intelligent investor is neither a bull nor a bear They adapt to the market And when an intelligent investor adapts and becomes a bear in a raging bull market you can be sure there will be no shortage of bulls attacking them as a stupid perma bear The bulls think they will get wise before the crash hurts them but their greed is precisely what will prevent that scenario from playing out amp x200B Let s take a look at some of the signs we are in the greatest bubble in history amp x200B Major Indicators of the Great Bubble amp x200B 1 MASSIVE retail investment Worldwide What are some signs of bubbles historically Well a sure metric is when you get massive public interest and investment in the market Do we have that today CHECK on fucking steroids We ve got people who can t change a fucking tire on their 2008 Civic downloading Robinhood and gambling options on margin Like WTF The 80 IQ mongoloid who was washing dishes at Papa Johns last Tuesday do they even have dishes I don t fucking know is now buying leveraged call options on a fucking electric vehicle company in fucking China or some shit Are you kidding me Do we need any more evidence that the top is rapidly approaching Not to mention the entire short squeeze fiasco which got international coverage and just threw some nitroglycerin into the speculative fire Now everyone from my grandmother to some farmer in Bangladesh is downloading Robinhood to buy calls on fucking SNDL or whatever the fuck Past US market bubbles were largely restricted to the US population It was mostly Americans buying American stocks during the dotcom boom But wild irrational bubble speculation has been globalized Now almost anybody in the world can dump their hard earned rupees into Tesla at a 1 300 PE ratio What s that noise Is that some greedy billionaire goblin audibly salivating in the distance The Max Pain theory which is ironically popular among permabulls argues that the market will do whatever hurts the maximum numbers of investors This is of course bullshit but it s food for thought if you buy into this type of voodoo https preview redd it

The greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities whether or not they are overvalued by selling them for a profit at a later date This is because there will always be someone i e a bigger or greater fool who is willing to pay a higher price If acting in accordance with the greater fool theory an investor will purchase questionably priced securities without any regard to their quality If the theory holds the investor will still be able to quickly sell them off to another greater fool who could also be hoping to flip them quickly Unfortunately speculative bubbles burst eventually leading to a rapid depreciation in share prices The greater fool theory breaks down in other circumstances as well including economic recessions and depressions In 2008 when investors purchased faulty mortgage backed securities it was difficult to find buyers when the market collapsed Basically none of you mouthbreathers are doing fundamental analysis on the shit you buy

takes total market valuation and divides it by US GDP A very high Buffett Indicator suggests an overvalued market and could have been used to predict past bubbles such as the dotcom boom There are two

entire point The point is that future growth estimations can be faulty and lend themselves to irrational greed during bubbles The point is to tie market valuations to some real world metric which is necessarily backward looking The other argument against the Buffett Indicator which holds more weight is that US stocks consist of global companies and therefore aren t adequately represented by US GDP I will say these people have a good point but they are also missing several nuances within GDP and market valuations which are too complicated to address in this already fucking huge post Suffice it to say the Buffett Indicator still has something useful to say about market valuation and can t simply be discarded https preview redd it o40ug9fy3yi61 png width 1780 amp format png amp auto webp

dotcom boom companies that obviously had zero revenue or sales were valued in terms of eyes That is the value of the company was based on how many visits they had to their website This internet thing was a New Paradigm and so obviously we needed New Metrics to determine how valuable these companies were Needless to say the vast majority of these companies many of them worth millions were simply worth nothing and went bankrupt overnight Take your pick of favorite meme stonk that has some bizarre rationalization for its absurd valuation I like to pick on Tesla personally because trolling its

bubbles have been created by Federal Reserve control of currency and interest rates This market is no different They create a bubble and when the bubble pops they hop in to create a new bigger bubble until that pops and so on It s like a fucking meth addict taking bigger and bigger hits until they see fucking leprechauns burrowing under thier house The catch is interest rates can t drop below zero

Roaring Kitty at his stated motivation to invest long and particularly in stock he likes I did not solicit anyone to buy or sell the stock for my own profit Gill plans to testify I did not belong to any groups trying to create movements in the stock price I never had a financial relationship with any hedge fund I had no information about GameStop except what was public I did not know any people inside the company and I never spoke to any insider The reaction from WS Establishment reacted swiftly to curtail free trade obviously due to the Achilles heel exposed by Gill simply exercising his right as an American to Invest in something he believes in What Gill did although he most certainly didn t set out to do was expose a massive weakness in the American Financial Industry that the US Government has utterly failed to prevent Side note I am not a financial analyst I am a DoD analyst I do no give financial advice I don t trade on margin and I don t short stock I hold no GME I do hold AMC If you accept Elitist propaganda they would have you believe there is some redeeming value in taking short positions mostly because they claim it helps correct over valued securities This fundamentally breaks the law of fair trade where the exchange is good for both parties at the time Short trades provided no value added to the investment cycle and incentivize the philosophy that business loss is profitable and an option to reap due to others misfortune The problem with that philosophy is real business loss has real consequences to investors employers employees Econ101 Students learn this Gill was exercising his right as a Goddam American to invest believe and possibly save a good company from bankruptcy despite GMEs management short comings It might have been believable that RH stopped trading because their liquidity was in jeopardy and the collateral required to cover settlement would have broken their bank but there should have been an expectation of restricted trades across the board not targeting GME or AMC And the tell tale sign of collusion may be that other brokers also halted trading why that s not been discovered There are some great postulations here on WSB for instance https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lnvvu3 why gamestop was going to cause a collapse of the https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lol283 theory gamestop was in the process of going https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lol283 theory gamestop was in the process of going https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments ldm13x sign the petition to destroy shorts and get rid If you believe what financial analysts are saying you find yourself admitting that WSB is now wielding a nuclear weapon capable of ripping the shit out of the financial markets Is this even conceivable Take these quotes for instance But there s another level of danger to the gamma squeezes This involves the relentless high volume buying in low priced far out of the money call options to drive a stock price higher by forcing the market maker to purchase the stock as protection against their selling the calls assuming they can t find another party to take the risk For market makers unable to pass the risk they could soon find themselves out of business We could also see market makers begin to abandon stocks Real Money Such damage to general asset prices producing the worst week for the S amp P 500 Index since October pales in comparison to what would most likely happen if one of the intermediaries were forced into a disorderly deleveraging whether it be a broker or central clearinghouse If not handled well this could have much broader effects especially because the nonbank segment of the financial system has been in an unprecedented period of rapidly rising debt leverage and risk taking aided and abetted by too many years of excessive policy reliance on experimental central bank measures and regulatory supervisory gaps This is not just an epic David versus Goliath story that has now attracted worldwide media attention Potentially in play is the democratization of finance tech led disruptions to market hierarchy the overall valuation of markets regulatory and political responses and the market structure itself Bloomberg com The rhetoric coming from WS is quite the Freudian Slip they basically revealed that their business is all about manipulating the markets something everybody knew but didn t really understand how to stop In comes populist investment groups like WSB wielding millions of small buys like a hoard taking on Goliath death of thousand cuts Several analysts on camera admitted openly that GME would have easily gone to 1300 if it were not for the brakes being slammed Regardless of your political leanings big tech censorship should be a concern This is a blatant attempt at squeezing the little guy out letting the HFs act like bulls in a china cabinet If a company is going under and a bunch or private citizens want to save it while making money more power to you The government should be concerned with some State actor with deep pockets using proxy buyers to cause Short Squeeze after Short Squeeze you thought Game Stop was dangerous Given the sentiment it is entirely possible that GME could go moon

futures markets are being speculated higher with volume as traders believe that future prices will be higher and producers will buy at higher levels Historically for commodities spikes with volume indicate significantly higher prices ahead Copper has been the largest winner for commodity traders Big names like FCX and CLF have had significant run ups 80 90 while less exposed copper producers like TECK have seen 50 COPX as a mining ETF saw a 50 run up Most miners recently reported earnings In short it was amazing Miners were able to realize prices at 3 20 pound in Q4 with costs between 1 30 1 40 pound Here s TECK s Q4 financial report https www teck com media Q4 Quarterly 2021 pdf for more info on guidance prices and costs they made 470m CAD in profit on 80k tons of copper Imagine what it ll look like with copper prices between 3 60 4 20 pound FCX expects to sell 3 8b pounds 1 9m tons of copper in 2021 Even if we estimate copper at 3 60 pound for 2021 they d net nearly 9b in profit on just copper for the year Copper has significant headwinds for 2021 increased government stimulus decreasing DXY EVs solar production batteries etc Supply concerns are real given copper s requirements for new technology and I suspect we will see further run up and further stock increases alongside massive dividends Look to 2008 as an expectation on price action and dividends I suspect we will see TECK and FCX both cross 50 share in Q2 2021 and potentially see dividends over 3 share TECK is an equity trade for me given the terrible spreads on options and historically better dividend payouts while I play FCX for options Zinc https preview redd it qp0n1tk3hyi61 png width 2466 amp format png amp auto webp amp s bbf3733f5d811b9bf680b9b38de063a756b13d32 Zinc is fairly unchanged since our last conversation Zinc primarily used for galvanizing steel has essentially followed iron prices However it is testing new highs and could be poised for a breakout given recent volume and price action Zinc is cheap to mine 1 10 pound and higher quantity than copper TECK for example produced 3x the amount of zinc than copper but posted profits only half as much Zinc has a major catalyst as it relates to government infrastructure spending all steel that has exposure to water needs to be galvanized New highways bridges buildings automobiles solar farms wind turbines to name a few all require galvanized steel Any price action for zinc can cause significant profits given it s low mining cost and high volume TECK owns the largest zinc mine in the world Red Dog and generally zinc has limited exposure in the stock market Zinc is testing a critical price level and if it breaks out we could see TECK benefitting immensely in their stock price Iron https preview redd it 5t46pre4hyi61 png width

Chinese Steel demand alongside a new futures market in China providing access for paper trades to front run producers in the futures market RIO recently reported a massive earnings beat alongside a special dividend equivalent to 5 Chinese steel demand should continue to be strong post CNY as seen in the charts and will continue to dictate market prices Iron comes in various forms primarily 62 65 and pellets and dictate different prices 62 iron above 150 ton could well be the new norm for 2021 and continue to provide massive profits to iron miners I want to drive your attention towards VALE who reports earnings this week on Thursday I ve written about VALE previously https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments ksg8nr commodity club nickel for your pickel vale utm source share amp utm medium web2x amp context 3 and their attractive share price given iron nickel exposure Here s an additional thought to provide confirmation bias into what should be a massive earnings beat and 10 gains in equity Processing img 9dofyqp5hyi61 The above image is from Star Bulks earnings report on Feb 17 They are VALE s largest shipping partner Their major callout for investors this year is that they ve seen record growth in China Steel output and supply recovery in Brazil s mining sector This is a primary reason for the 91 run up in Star Bulk s share price over the past 3 months Star Bulk is tiny compared to VALE but should be a good indicator for a massive earnings beat about to come Another parting thought is that VALE is the largest pellet producer which drive the highest prices They produce the highest quality and most expensive iron in the world I ve been studying port data into China over the past few months via mysteel net Brazil consistently has outperformed Australia on import expectations and prices I have extremely high confidence that VALE should meet exceed the higher end of earning estimates and provide a special dividend alongside the likes of RIO and BHP Oil

but has seen significant price action in the past few weeks Decreasing US production and global oil output from OPEC agreements has sent oil into a supply shock as the US has turned into a net importer of oil and global demand returns to pre covid levels Saudi Arabia requires 65 barrel on oil to maintain their government balance sheet and with US oil production down from decreasing rig counts reduced drilling from Biden s policies and recently the Texas freeze Saudi Arabia is solidly in control and will be targeting higher prices in order to capitalize on US policy Oil stocks have not recovered well during covid and create a unique opportunity to buy in at a discounted price I cannot name my plays in oil as I ve been focusing on small cap stocks primarily in deep sea rigs and permian basin output but have been buying ITM long dated calls for Sept 2021 through Jan 2022 My rationale for small cap vs big cap is that small cap is trading at a discount given bankruptcy concerns and should have that eliminated with the recent price action in oil Many oil companies have spent the larger part of 2020 cutting back on drilling costs refinancing debt closing down ineffective rigs reducing management pay and selling off properties Oil stocks are a completely different animal in 2021 vs 2020 they are lean machines ready to take advantage of WTI over 60 barrel I suspect and so does GS that oil will be over 70 in Q2 which should drive significant profits for oil producers Similar to zinc oil is a high volume commodity that provides better benefits to producers on small price movements Another play on oil will be transport While ET stands to benefit from increasing oil prices tankers should also see increasing demand and rates given the US becoming a net importer of oil Thanks are equity plays for me as I see them as benefitting from increasing global demand for oil and the US requiring additional imports to stabilize supply given Biden s policies Nickel https

price action continues to confirm my earlier conclusions From a TA perspective Nickel has just broken out on massive volume and appears to have established support at 18 155 ton That s a 4 000 ton

commodities that deserve further mention e g Palladium Platinum Uranium Lithium Cobalt Steel Natural Gas Coal and Tin Each of those has seen heavy price action and additional breakouts I personally invest in all of those metals as well but feel less confident speaking to their future success Summary I m overweight on all the commodities I specifically went through and have exposure to the others

time posting any DD on here Please keep your insults gentle TLDR at the bottom play monthly calls at the money and reap benefits Pinterest recently jumped due to a strong Q4 ER Here s what they stated about their 2020 gt The company stated that there has been a 35 year over year increase in the number of monthly boards created including a 44 increase in beauty a 95 increase in women s fashion and a 36 increase in home decor categories Literally the entire report is a bull s wet dream Seriously just read this yourself https www nasdaq com articles pinterest pins to report q4 earnings 3A whats in store 2021 02 02 Rather than making this post a cliff notes of that let me tell you briefly in my own words why PINS is going to go bananas 1 PINS advertisements hide in plain site I recommend creating a profile quickly w o ad blocker and give a quick scroll on your home page or search for something you might think about purchasing or doing later I think you ll be surprised at how many ads are in your results but also how well they blend in why does this matter 2 this means better conversion rates Conversion rates are how advertisers can tell if their ROI is worth it to advertise on a platform PINS conversion rates are no doubt excellent we don t have data on this bc it varies from brand to brand and will continue to be because of the large amount of data they have they are a god damn search engine after all you may have heard of other search engines with excellent ad targeting 3 PINS is apolitical this is an advertisers and users honestly wet dream PINS isn t banning politicians on their platform and youre only exposed to the political BS you CHOOSE to see 4 they have a GROWTH mindset they re not dumb they understand what makes them money more active users more money being spent on the platform in SOME fashion to do this they are dedicated on increasing their MAU monthly active users which has already increased 35 as stated above They re also expanding much faster internationally for whats it worth so if you have bias against the platform because you or nobody you know is on it think bigger than that they ve also begun collaborating with Shopify which still has a ton of potential in already very smooth shopping experience try to replicate a shopping experience on PINS you will be surprised at how it acts like amazon in this sense offering you different suppliers and options from varying sources PINS is just different and their executives eyes are on the prize I m a believer in their goals to increase the bottom lines that will increase their revenue and I m all in PS did I mention Cathie Wood is holding a large stake of PINS in her ARKF fund She holds over 2 million shares in her ETF making up 3 65 of the fund https ark funds com fintech etf information on the Shopify partnership https newsroom pinterest com en post pinterest launches shopify app for easy merchant access to catalogs Pinterest Is Unique Among The Social Media Giants https finance yahoo com news pinterest unique among social media 211705148 html gt Brian Feroldi The way I think about Pinterest evaluation is this The ARPU average revenue per user number is the most exciting thing I think Pinterest can at least 5X its average revenue per user like at least gt gt Brian Withers That would be half of Facebook gt gt Brian Feroldi Yeah It would still be only half of Facebook How many users could this platform get It just added 120 million in the last year So they re at just under half a billion Could they get to a billion Facebook has three billion Could Pinterest be one third as popular as Facebook gt gt If you can buy that argument could they double their user base and 5X their average revenue per user That will be a 10X growth in revenue Is that realistic I don t think it s out of the realm of possibility gt gt Pinterest is a 50 billion market cap company How about this for a comparison Snapchat 91 billion Which platform do you think is more monetizable Which platform do you think is more niche If Snapchat is worth 90 billion I think Pinterest is worth at least 200 billion gt gt Brian Withers As they grow that revenue that s significantly scalable They re going to drop more to the bottom line gt gt Brian Feroldi Their gross margin is 82 percent and rising gt gt Brian Withers Yeah already gt gt Brian Feroldi So bullish laughs gt gt Brian Withers I couldn t tell Brian I m glad you clarified that There is so much information out there to confirm the Bull Bias on PINS that it keeps me up at night I tell everybody I know about this stock Assuming this takes off it s probably going to Dox me to many I know TLDR PINS is generating stupid cash from advertisers for being a great search engine and place to shop because they are increasing their user base at a strong healthy rate and are dedicating to making sure the train doesnt stop Positions 85c 3 19 90c 4 16 120c 1 21 22 50 Shares at 80 i like the stock

by internet giants such as Ant Group Co the finance arm of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd Europe and the US should join forces in the fight against climate change and agree on a new framework for the digital market limiting the power of big tech companies European Union chief executive Ursula von der Leyen said Europe will decide whether to extend the suspension of its rules limiting budget deficits and debt known as the Stability and Growth Pact SGP in coming weeks the Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni said on Monday Quick Earnings I m looking for today Berkshire Hathaway B BRKb Royal Carribbean Cruises RCL Marathon Oil MRO Quick Thoughts Europe and the Stability and Growth Pact ok this one is a bit boring The Stability and Growth Pact https en wikipedia org wiki Stability and Growth Pact is an agreement among the 27 member states of the European Union to facilitate and maintain the stability of the Economic and Monetary Union The goal is to monitor members of the EU and to make sure of their fiscal stability If the country s deficit or debt is higher than a certain limit the other members will give recommendations on policy actions to correct this In 1997 at the inception of The Stability and Growth Act the same limit was given to every state members and that was not very flexible In 2004 they ve reformed it to have limits specific to each states This is still not very flexible A country might have a bad year and based on this model will still need to take corrective actions even if there was no problem to begin with Some countries debt and deficit are cyclical and highly variable while some are pretty stable And sometimes a big event might put countries in the red zone and they can t do much about it hum hum the pandemic hum hum So knowing all that Europe decided at the beginning of the pandemic to suspend those rules as they didn t make any sense during this context And in the coming weeks Europe will decide whether to extend this suspension or not This is a key event for countries like Italy or Greece but really mostly Italy So let s talk about Italy Italy might recover Not clickbait Italy s budget deficit reached 10 9 of GDP in 2020 and IMF expects it to go down to 7 5 in 2021 As for their public debt it was at 157 5 of GDP in 2020 and is expected to rise to 159 7 this year If the Stability and Growth Pact was still in place the EU would basically ask Italy to cut costs anywhere it can at this point because there s no way Italy will ever repay its debt And EU wants that knowing full well it s the worst course of action for Italy s sake But Italy and the rest of EU have different objectives Italy wants to recover duh and hopes for a restructuration of their debt The rest of EU sees how fucked Italy is and wants to help them but at the same time wants to make sure that this doesn t bring the whole EU down in the process Right now the Stability and Growth Pact is suspended and Italy is set to get 200 billion euros from the EU s COVID Recovery Fund It s crucial that Italy uses that money wisely There are a lot of things going for them though Draghi is now Prime Minister of Italy He was president of the ECB for 8 years and before that chair of the Financial Stability Board and Governor of the Bank of Italy for 5 years So regarding finance let s say he knows his stuff Also Draghi has a very big majority at the Parliament which will let him do basically whatever he wants If he manages to prove himself capable of creating growth in a economically declining country then EU will be much more open to give them more money Italy however decided to relax their pandemic restrictions https www france24 com en europe 20210201 restaurants and museums reopen as italy relaxes coronavirus curbs which is being criticized by Health Minister Roberto Speranza and the WHO While this can indeed increase the number of cases so far the number of new cases stabilized at 12k per day 7 day moving average in february So if you need your gambling fix you could go long on the Italia 40 index or you could stay on the sidelines and wait to have more informations on the matter Or you could just not care at all I wouldn t be offended Home Depot earnings play Let s see the key points of last year Their revenue was at 33bn in Q3 of 2020 Their net sales increased inside and outside of the US by roughly 18 They expect to have slightly less revenue in Q4 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021 My prediction is that as countries reopen and all the constructions put on hold are resuming more and more their revenue will beat expectations tomorrow My short term and long term bullish thesis people are using their money for esentials only and if you ve started big renovations before the pandemic it s pretty necessary to finish it a lot of people work from home and plan on continuing to do so so That means they will need to upgrade their home in the near future or already upgraded it some people are moving outside of the big cities and buying homes in smaller cities This increases the number of renovations in the US the Stay At Home situation makes people buy more stuff to improve their confort at home While some of this is factored in the price I think investors are still pretty conservative and you can see it in the price action it s flat since august last year So today I will buy some shares If you want to increase your risk you can make a small bet on this earnings and for the long term bet you can buy calls expiring in 6 months Or you could just wait and see what happens I would not be offended Ok Bye Thank you for reading this I m putting a lot of effort into this Before writing those posts I didn t realize how much work it would take I have a much bigger appreciation for

22 , The stock market cools of as technology drops after the treasury yields spike Roku Deere amp Twilio smash earnings expectations while Walmart disappoints Palantir sells off on mixed results so let s talk about this and other stock market news Hello everyone So let s start with the recap of last week as we saw a mixed week for the major indexes with the Dow https imgur com VX5S1v3 gained just 0 11 for the week while the SP500 https imgur com 1uJLQIX lost 0 7 and the Nasdaq Composite https imgur com 5ZVNdNg underperformed losing over 1 5 after the treasury interest rate rose sharply to start the week 7 of the 11 sectors https imgur com xiLEGrH finished the week in the red while Utilities losing over 2 while Energy amp Financials hugely outperformed This stock market movement also pushed the Volatility Index https imgur com uEyhkQu up over 9 in the past week as it rose over 20 yet again Here https imgur com kPFpl23 is the HEAT MAP from last week that shows a pretty divided picture with Technology Communications amp Cyclicals losing ground while the gainers were concentrated in just a couple of sectors We also saw some interest economic data last week with the January core retail sales https imgur com IbeU1ck up almost 6 with the Producer price INDEX https imgur com ZocPeJs also rose by 1 3 its largest spike since it started being recorded So given this numbers and what the FED https imgur com kpGprlk leaders have continued to tell us it s very likely we won t see a sustained inflation rate of at least 2 in the next year or two despite this huge numbers coming in on the economic side It s really hard to see how this numbers can continue to come in at such high levels once we move on to a more normal life even with another round of stimulus checks The other beat on the economic numbers came in from the PMI https imgur com Hrk5SZQ composite which signaled the fastest growth in 6 years while in terms of Jobless claims https imgur com sEbFcJ2 we saw a spike in numbers yet again for the week but the continuing claims manage to drop by more than 50K We also received the investor sentiment survey https imgur com MUk8Vv2 which showed yet again an increase in bullishness which is starting to get very dangerous for the stock market as I said in my previous posts The bullishness is nearing the 50 which we haven t seen since after the November elections so yet again I would pretty much hold my portfolio right now not selling but not buying much right now either as this has worked as a good contrarian indicator in the past This week https imgur com ZPdkzS5 we get some more economic data with the leading economic indicators the consumer confidence index the jobless numbers and consumer spending while on the earnings https imgur com IAIyHIf front we are moving towards the end of the earnings seasons with interesting names like Square Nvidia Moderna Etsy DraftKings amp many others reporting this upcoming week In some other stock market news we saw Ford https imgur com 9X9cqJH continuing their journey on becoming fully electric by 2030 as they will invest 1B in their production facility from Germany This news combined with GM https imgur com SGIF2TL and most other traditional OEM joining more amp more the EV sector will continue to add pressure to the hyped stocks like Tesla Nio Xpeng amp many others I believe there will be a lot of companies that will benefit from this move but not all will succeed so you have to watch out and do your DD on what companies you pick amp chose I think we will see a mixed bag in the future with a couple of hyped stocks like Tesla which just cut the price https imgur com tIxgkLk of the model 3 and Y again amp Nio remaining favorites while I expect OEMs to eat up some of the other new entrants On the earnings side we had Palantir https imgur com EHDqE9f reporting a beat on revenues with the stock selling off pretty steeply after that report despite an in line guidance https imgur com ExRQ4DD for the revenue growth of about 30 for 2021 with a big growth rate in the first quarter of the year It didn t help the stock that the lock up period of 80 of the remaining insider shares also expired but I think this was an interesting buying opportunity for Palantir if you are looking to hold the company for the long term as it already started to recover rising more than 15 on Friday https imgur com TDBDIpw after the ARK https imgur com H8m7HBn Innovation ETF added over 5M shares Twilio https imgur com qhbS8Ln also rose after beating both the top amp bottom line and impressed with a guidance well above the consensus though they followed this with a stock offering https imgur com JALCaI5 of over 1 5B which caused somewhat of a small correction after the big pop One other stock that also rose after the earnings reports was ROKU https imgur com j5gA32i as the company posted a surprise profit while their revenues increased almost 60 over last year They also expect an adjusted EBITDA of around 5 10 for 2021 moving the company into profitability finally But guys the biggest beat on expectations by far in my opinion this week came from the industrial giant Deere https imgur com qoXEacL rising to a new record high for the stock as they beat expectations by 1 70 and increased their revenues by over 20 over last year as they also guided https imgur com OgcZT2b for net income of up to 5B next year compared to 2 75B in FY2020 On the other hand Walmart https imgur com E2a8iOr dropped 6 after reporting a miss on earnings for the 4th quarter while also giving a soft guidance for next year though they did announce a 20B buyback plan and a raise of the dividend yield I think the drop might have also been cause by the news they would increase employee wages with at least 12months of history in the company to 15 hours from the current 11 hour which will affect their earnings in the future So yeah folks let s hope for a better week in the stock markets again Thank

americas malls will disappear by next year jan kniffen html there are roughly 380 C and D rated malls out of the 1 000 And those are considered the most at risk of going dark permanently as they don t generate enough sales to maintain the property and have greater vacancy rates Green Street has said C malls are not viable retail centers long term The population then gets redirected towards the surviving Class A malls which theoretically means that there will be even higher human traffic triggering a chain reaction of boosting sales psf which increases rent levels thus improving dividend

with more than half of the shorts covered the remaining 34 million shares shorted is still a significant 25 of current float And as Macerich improves and eventually reinstate its dividends of 3 pre COVID these shorts will be liable to pay out those dividends coupled with rising stock price causing a double whammy for the bears So when the time comes for these shorts to cover we can expect Macerich s share price to appreciate reasonably Conclusion I believe that MAC has been severely undervalued due to the overreaction from the retail apocalypse and COVID 19 combo and the focus on short

media to identify rising stocks Here is my research for this week , What is it I have built an AI algorithm which helps me identify the stocks that are most talked about on Reddit investment and

comments analysing the sentiment of the chatter whether that stock is spoken about in a positive or negative manner and uses some AI trend detection algorithms to identify which stocks have seen an abnormal surge in conversation I will use my Investment Banking experience to research the most talked about stocks and distill stocks identified into some digestible research for you What is it not This is an early detection tool meaning the stocks can sometimes jump in price as well as sink While I try my hardest to give you solid research no one knows exactly how the stock market behave Please

amazonaws com top 15 stocks html CVS 250 in mentions Market Cap 92 35bn Let s start off with what I feel is a very overlooked stock with very good fundamentals CVS Health Corporation Ticker CVS This stock currently represents the 3rd biggest holding in Michael J Burry s portfolio at 10 of his overall holdings for those of you who don t know him I seriously suggest researching him He was one of the earliest to spot the housing market crash of 2008 his character played by Christian Bale in the film The Big Short and identified the GameStop short squeeze as early as AUGUST 2019 https www businesswire com news home 20190819005633 en Profile CVS Health Corporation is a US based integrated pharmacy healthcare company The Company provides pharmacy care for the senior community through Omnicare Inc Omnicare s operations include distribution of pharmaceuticals related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to chronic care facilities and other care settings It operates through three segments Pharmacy Services Retail LTC and Corporate As of December 31 2016 the Retail LTC Segment included 9 709 retail locations of which 7 980 were its stores that operated a pharmacy and 1 674 were its pharmacies located within Target stores CVS also has online healthcare presence through its websites CVS com Navarro com and Onofre com br It also provides healthcare services through its more than 1 100 MinuteClinic https en wikipedia org wiki MinuteClinic medical clinics as well as their Diabetes Care Centers Most of these clinics are located within or outside CVS stores Fundamentals CVS has seen both solid revenue and Net Income flows From 2019 to 2020 revenues grew from 257bn to 268bn 4 6 and Net Income from 6 6bn to 7 2bn 8 2 CVS beat every analyst earnings expectations in 2020 Balance sheet wise the company is a strong position with a Debt to Total Equity ratio of 0 93 In short this number represents the amount of debt the company owes vs the equity it holds with a lower number representing a less risky investment the Average ratio for S amp P500 companies is 1 5 CVS has a Price to Earnings ratio the price of the stock vs the Earnings per share currently around 9x the lower the ratio means the cheaper the stock is compared to their total earnings Current S amp P market average is around 25x The company has seen sustained dividend earnings and is forecasted for continued income growth currently at 9 annual Increased growth catalysts There are rumours that CVS will open up some of their pharmacies to administer COVID 19 vaccines across the US There are two things to consider from this Increased revenue streams at scale from the current US administration this could even become recurring revenue with all the talk of yearly booster jabs Increased revenue from the extra footfall going into their stores remember the last time you went into a grocery store to buy toothpaste and came out with 2 full bags The relatively new CEO Karen Lynch is a serial success machine For the past five years 2016 to 2020 she was named to Fortune s list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business Potential Downsides Amazon has announced its intention to enter the pharmacy space which serves to the shake up the industry as a whole over the long term Personally I think the regulatory landscape of the pharmaceutical world means Amazon is still a long way away from making massive strides and this current scenario is actually beneficial to current CVS stock price which is lowered and under valued because of it Analyst Estimates The 25 analysts offering 12 month price targets for CVS Health Corp have a median target of 86 with a high estimate of 102 and a low estimate of 72 Summary The company is displaying very impressive fundamental attributes and is currently trading at a lower price than what it s fully worth That along with its positive future projections and foray into administering COVID vaccines make it a very interesting stock currently It has been dropping in price slightly over the last few weeks and may continue to drop further before a big bounce technical analysis shows a support point at 69 where price may fluctuate and possibly bounce upwards from there At that price I would personally be tempted to buy into the stock amp x200B While I will be posting weekly to Reddit I will post on a more regular

Holders of Retail ETF on Wild Ride 11 00 am ET February 21 2021 Dow Jones Print By Michael Wursthorn GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 mania has spilled over into a popular exchange traded fund as the WallStreetBets craze reaches beyond shares favored on social media The fund State Street s SPDR S amp P Retail ETF was created in 2006 to give investors broad exposure to mall store firms Its shares have surged 23 this year far outstripping a 4 gain in the S amp P 500 despite the uncertain outlook for retail Behind those gains are the traders who congregate on social media platforms such as Reddit s WallStreetBets forum and whose enthusiasm has turned this mundane investment into a roller coaster On Jan 27 GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 soared 135 driven by events such as Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeting Gamestonk The State Street fund jumped 42 the same day The next day GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 shares tumbled 44 and the fund known by its ticker XRT dropped about 9 On Jan 28 the fund suffered its largest single day outflow in more than a decade according to FactSet Three quarters of the money in the fund flowed out amounting to 506 million in redemptions driven in part by what some analysts describe as a frantic rush by traders to liquidate the ETF whose price at times traded at discounts rarely seen in this part of the world to get their hands on underlying GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 shares The whipsaw trading highlights how the mania in WallStreetBets favorites like GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 can drive pricing in other investments in this case one typically preferred by investors seeking portfolio diversification and targeted exposure to industry sectors GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 shares long viewed as an also ran by many investors in a world dominated by Amazon and Costco at one point this year accounted for 20 of the State Street fund The roller coaster ride in the retail ETF isn t something you see really ever said Komson Silapachai a vice president of research at portfolio strategy at Sage Advisory Mr Silapachai said the firm bought shares of the ETF last year as a way to play the growth in e commerce and sold them last month at a profit He said the firm is still seeking to invest in a cyclical economic recovery but won t use this ETF to do so From a markets perspective the link between GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 shares and the State Street ETF is a feature rather than a bug ETFs are baskets of securities like mutual funds tradable intraday on an exchange Their exchange listing creates a link between the price of fund shares and the value of the underlying securities that savvy traders notably so called authorized participants financial firms chosen by the ETF issuer to manage the ETF shares trading can quickly exploit for profit when it gets out of whack That is what happened in late January in the retail ETF Here is how ETFs work Investors can buy and sell shares of an ETF at any time when the market is open ETF issuers such as State Street rely on authorized participants to manage the supply of fund shares and keep prices in line with net asset value or the sum of the weighted value of constituent shares When ETF share prices rise above net asset value authorized participants create more shares by selling a basket of the fund s underlying securities to State Street in exchange for a block of ETF shares typically 10 000 or more which those firms can then sell on an exchange When the shares trade at a discount to the fund s underlying value those firms can buy ETF shares on the stock market and hand a block of them to State Street in exchange for the stocks held by the fund pulling the net asset value back in line with the fund s share price State Street said 43 firms act as authorized participants on its main family of ETFs including XRT They include Citadel Securities LLC Barclays Capital Inc Goldman Sachs amp Co and Citigroup Global Markets Inc the firm said in a filing Generally XRT trades within 0 03 of net asset value according to FactSet But on Jan 28 the ETF traded at a 3 1 discount just after the market opened as shares of GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 were halted on the New York Stock Exchange according to FactSet data XRT traded at discounts to its net asset value most of the session with gaps widening during numerous trading halts on GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 became such a heavyweight in the fund that it created a disconnect between the value of the ETF and the underlying basket said Mohit Bajaj director of ETF trading solutions at WallachBeth Capital Trading volume in XRT shares that day was 10 times the usual level according to FactSet Authorized participants ultimately obtained roughly 370 000 shares of GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 through redemptions of XRT shares said Matt Bartolini head of SPDR Americas research for State Street Global Advisors GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 s outsize influence in the fund in part reflected its giant rally and in part the fund s practice of roughly equal weighting the firms in the index it tracks a break with more widely tracked indexes such as the S amp P 500 whose firm weightings reflect relative market values A buyer of shares in the retail ETF by contrast typically gets about the same amount of Amazon as GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 despite the market value gap between the two Though the GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 frenzy appears to have abated other stocks listed in XRT remain favorites on WallStreetBets Take Magnite Inc an advertising tech company has quadrupled over the last three months and is currently the second biggest holding in XRT after GameStop https research ameritrade com grid wwws research stocks summary c name invest VENDOR amp issue 139905 Some of the denizens of subreddit WallStreetBets have taken a liking to the stock in recent months usually accompanied with the all too common rocket ship emojis implying it is off to the moon It is still not too late to get in In fact you are early This is going to keep running said one user in a post about Magnite in late December ahead of the stock nearly doubling so far this year Write to Michael Wursthorn at Michael

active member on this community of misfits So be encouraging and generous with those Karma shits On this post I will present an analysis of my positive view on the Airline sector as a macro sector play though the same logic can be applied to other related sectors such as Hotels On short I believe that the Airline sector as a whole currently presents an interesting opportunity to benefit from several underlying trends currently in place in the equity market such as the equity rotation to cyclical and small and mid cap stocks as well as from other macro trends such as the expansionary monetary and fiscal policy the acceleration of the vaccination pace the record US personal saving rate and people s desire to travel Within the Airlines sector I believe that the ones that should outperform are those with the following characteristics Revenue Airlines that generate most of their revenue from leisure travel vs business travel Geographic footprint Airlines with greater focus on developed economies domestic markets that is US or EU The US Airlines that combine these two characteristics are SAVE ALGT HA and JBLU To structure this post I will first present a short summary of the analysis for those with little time to read all and below I will present the extended analysis divided in the following sections Macroeconomic and market factors underpinning this view Acceleration of vaccine rollout and distribution Market dynamics Equity rotation towards value and cyclical sectors Equity rotation towards small and mid cap stocks US personal saving rate at record

own analysis to determine whether there is an opportunity to exploit in this sector I believe there is one Summary for lazy ones The vaccination rollout has accelerated after a slow start with 57mn Americans already vaccinated At this pace a conservative view as we can expect the vaccination pace to accelerate going forward half the US population would be vaccinated by July And this is without counting the 33mn people estimated to have antibodies due to virus exposure However vaccination is not uniform across countries developed countries are expected to fully vaccinate their populations before year end whereas other regions will reach that vaccination level in 2022 LatAm and 2023 Africa o Takeaway as the population becomes immune tourism will come back strongly but given the divergence of the vaccination pace among countries tourism will be mainly domestic at first and for some time Outbound trips will be substituted by domestic travel Domestic tourism will return to pre pandemic levels around 1 to 2 years earlier than outbound travel according to a McKinsey study underpinned by fewer restrictions for travel within own country A rotation towards cyclical sectors is currently taking place which should favor the leisure and travel sector as a whole including Airlines Why When people have more money they increase their discretionary spending which includes travelling more So these sectors which are more sensitive to the economic cycle benefit during economic expansions and investor s funds flow to these companies stocks o Takeaway cyclicals stocks such as Airlines are benefitting from investor s flows There s also an ongoing rotation towards small and mid cap stocks The small and mid cap stocks have outperformed the market since September 2020 and this outperformance has increased YTD These benefits many of the Airline stocks form part of these small and mid cap segment o Takeaway small and mid cap stocks which includes most Airlines are benefitting from investor s flows US personal saving rate reached 17 2 in 2020 the highest data point by far in the 21st century the second highest was 8 8 in 2012 This happened because people uncertain about job security during the Covid 19 pandemic prioritized essential spending food housing sanitization over discretionary spending But this pent up demand should benefit economic activity as the economy reopens and people s consumption moves to more discretionary items which includes travelling o Takeaway discretionary spending is coming back strong and travel amp leisure will be one of the sectors to benefit from this trend Finally and most importantly people want to travel again A survey conducted in India indicates that people desire to travel twice as they did before the pandemic whereas a survey conducted in North America indicates that 99 of US and Canadian travelers are eager to travel again with 70 of those stating that they d take a vacation in 2021 The majority said that they would fly to their destinations Partnered with this another survey find that most people are not concerned of catching Covid 19 while travelling o Takeaway if something pandemic exacerbated people s desire to travel and travel will come back faster than it is currently priced in Airlines stocks In my personal opinion the work from home trend which has probably come to stay will allow people to travel more during weekdays making short trips say 4 days something more common while also making leisure travel less stational Acceleration of vaccine rollout amp the end of the pandemic Remember the strong retreat in equities during the final week of January The retreat was due to a deleveraging in the global markets fueled by concerns regarding retail trading yes you degenerate the risk of a market bubble and the slower than expected vaccination pace The administration of vaccines was low at the start yes but it has since accelerated and major banks are forecasting the End of the Pandemic in Q2 2021 However it is worth mentioning that vaccine distribution is not homogeneous worldwide Developed economies are taking a head start and it is expected that populations in these countries will be vaccinated before year end whereas other regions will conclude their vaccination in 2022 e g LatAm and 2023 Africa Why does this matter Because in my view tourism will come back but it will be mainly domestic at first Some key US figures gt 33mn people are estimated to have antibodies due to virus exposure 10 of US population 1 62mn average doses per

1268,lpo017,t2_3m8ukbp9,1614000554,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpo017/airlines_sector_analysis/,1,Airlines Sector Analysis, Hi Guys Well I m writing my first post here so that I can slowly become an active member on this community of misfits So be encouraging and generous with those Karma shits On this post I will present an analysis of my positive view on the Airline sector as a macro sector play though the same logic can be applied to other related sectors such as Hotels On short I believe that the Airline sector as a whole currently presents an interesting opportunity to benefit from several underlying trends currently in place in the equity market such as the equity rotation to cyclical and small and mid cap stocks as well as from other macro trends such as the expansionary monetary and fiscal policy the acceleration of the vaccination pace the record US personal saving rate and people s desire to travel Within the Airlines sector I believe that the ones that should outperform are those with the following characteristics Revenue Airlines that generate most of their revenue from leisure travel vs business travel Geographic footprint Airlines with greater focus on developed economies domestic markets that is US or EU The US Airlines that combine these two characteristics are SAVE ALGT HA and JBLU To structure this post I will first present a short summary of the analysis for those with little time to read all and below I will present the extended analysis divided in the following sections Macroeconomic and market factors underpinning this view Acceleration of vaccine rollout and distribution Market dynamics Equity rotation towards value and cyclical sectors Equity rotation towards small and mid cap stocks US personal saving rate at record

cap is at a record low the Shiller PE Ratio is at a decade high but still lower than the peak of the dotcom bubble but these traditional measures seem to have failed us Analysts use these ratios to assess current valuation against historical periods to determine whether stocks are overvalued and due for a correction However stocks like Tesla now are valued based on future projections Currently valuation multiples are inflated due to historical liquidity conditions Stock market gains are closely correlated to increases in M1 The fed pushing down yields has increased the incentive for investors to enter into other asset classes which caused markets to rise even as the pandemic worsened unemployment number overshot projections and earnings collapsed The Fed acting as a universal buyer of debt allowed firms to issue debt at low rates allowing them to survive the period depressed spending Instead what we require to evaluate to the market as a whole is a relational macroeconomic framework which tells us where investors have an incentive to put their funds based on future economic scenarios because the market is forward looking What this means is looking at bond yields DXY GDP and levels of debt to gage the current state of the economy I m assuming you ve all seen the Burry tweet posted here where he warns people of what he thinks is coming which is inflation followed by a stock market crash The top comment on that thread says the tweet has nothing to do with the stock market but DXY While it s true that inflation has a more direct impact on DXY a collapsing dollar has obvious implications for stocks which I ll talk about next There are many possible scenarios for a market crash at some point in the future what I m going to do here is lay out some of the scenarios what we should be looking at how likely it is and how to time it What does Inflation means for the Economy With the fed continuing with it s QE program rising treasury yields indicates two possible things continuing expectations of economic recovery and inflation Investors buy 10 yr treasury for stable returns when they expect periods of high volatility so will sell the bonds when they expect conditions to normalize Inflation expectations decrease real returns on existing bonds so investors have an incentive to sell bonds and buy equities or newly issued bonds also causing yields to increase Clearly people expect a full economic recovery this has been obvious since the vaccine came out and the stock market reflects that At the same time commodity prices have increased indicating inflation but not at a level that worries the Fed which has maintained that it will continue to maintain a loose monetary policy So clearly the rising yields is caused by a combination of the two None of this necessarily impact stocks negatively What really matters is how severe the inflation is likely to be If inflation slowly creeps up to 2 by the end of the year stocks may not react negatively Even though yields would increase this alone doesn t increase the relative attractiveness of debt to equity because it is only nominal yields that are going up Rather existing debt depreciates in value which only hurts current bond holders However if inflation is worse than expected that is it shoots up to 2 faster than expected the market may end up pricing in a potential rate hike Historically this could mean a major stock market crash Given that Burry is predicting Weimar style hyperinflation it s pretty fucking obvious that he s bearish on stocks in addition to DXY He has literally said the market is dancing on a knifes edge https twitter com michaeljburry status 1363383141168128004 s 20 Why would this cause a stock market crash The US economy is burdened with a huge amount of debt investors are piling into corporate debt margin debt is at a historical high mortgages are booming etc This significantly increase the depth of a potential crash due to forced liquidations The levels of systemic risk in the economy are absolutely huge Of course this is only likely to happen if inflation accelerates faster than the Fed expects Will Inflation Occur This is a harder question to answer We know what to look for when we consider how likely it is that the Fed will be forced to intervene yields commodity prices DXY and the sharpness of the moves in all three There s probably other perspectives to take that I m missing But at this point can we answer whether inflation will overshoot the Fed expectations The Fed has been showing that economic activity remains depressed because thee velocity of money has cratered In one scenario as reopening accelerates people get vaccinated and global travels picks up we will see the velocity of money shoot up Combined with historically unprecedented levels of M1 this could lead to extremely high levels of inflation In another extreme scenario economic growth remains anemic and monetary stimulus fails leading to Japanification which the EU is edging closer and closer to Here equities may continue to trade at current multiples because yields remain low However the recent rally in bond yields suggest that this narrative may not play out in America and we won t have to see things like negative rates Between these two scenarios there are many possibilities America s low inflation in the last 10 years despite loose monetary policy points to secular stagnation that hasn t progressed to the levels we see in Europe and Japan The US economy is still relatively dynamics and we might just simply see a fairly normal economic recovery That said given levels of M1 I would argue that we are currently in uncharted waters and the bearish sentiment is justified This will crash at some point but what really matter is timing Timing Since this is r wallstreetbets what people here really care about is timing especially given the penchant for options I ve read bearish cases that extend this rally all the way out to 2025 before a great reset whereas Burry implies that this will all play out in 2021 As far as timing goes the best we can do is continue to monitor the key indicators that point to a crash and how fast the accelerate because the stock market may react to too much inflation before it actually happens if DXY crashes if yields accelerate upward if consumers start to notice increasing commodity prices In the short run we have impending stimulus hanging over us At this point we re all conditioned not to short when there s stimulus on the horizon and I think that continues to hold As long as the money printer is going your best bet is to stay long What Burry is clearly predicting is a scenario that forces the Fed to turn off the money printer which will mean a paradigm shift for

research on Virgin Galactic Ticker SPCE and thought it could be interesting for some of you It is very light information but it is mainly designed to give you a big picture about the potential future of the business hope it is interesting for some of y all Youtube video for people who can t read at the bottom of the post Industry Analysis Virgin Galactic is in a very new industry Space tourism mainly for the moment Their goal is to make travel in space more accessible to the public the richest people first if we take a look at their ticket price According to Cowen Survey luxurious space tourism has a total addressable market of 2 4 million people with a net worth of more than 5 million globally They also plan to enter in a second industry High speed travelling They estimate that the market is of roughly 1 trillion and could result in more than 200 billion in sales for Virgin Galactic Company background Alright we all know the virgin group and how they have a tendency to launch 57 different companies for every industry Virgin Galactic is their hot baby right now Founded in 2004 by the one and only Richard Branson Their goal is to democratize space like robinhood but for space xd by developing a commercial spacecraft to make space tourism the next big thing For that purpose they have built the world s first commercial spaceport in New Mexico not a lot of customers at the moment but it is set to be a very big platform for the future according to them Financials Lol This section is Waiting to be completed They have not done one single trip yet they don t have any money coming in or almost none and they are developing very expensive shit Loss of 66 million in third quarter of 2020 Up from a 54 million in the previous quarter Still have about 742 million in cash got 440 million from their stock offering in august Project 1 Space Travel The first vehicle they developed is the WhiteKnightTwo it is basically two airplanes glued together why would you do that you may ask Because with that thing they have the power required to carry some heavy shits into space like satellites or spacecraft WhiteKnightTwo Talking about spacecraft comes the SpaceShipTwo their own reusable spacecraft that has the capacity to change its form to improve the stability and for a lot of complicated reasons that you can go check on their website you even have a 3d mockup SpaceShipTwo So this bad boy is in charge of bringing the cash in and we got some information about the cost and the potential revenue It is information old from a couple of months so you need to be careful but this is what we got Cost of one SpaceShipTwo 30 to 35 million Supposed to last at least 10 years and fly more than 50 times a year The total capacity is 8 passengers but it includes two pilots so we have a total of 6 paying seats Each tickets will cost between 200k and 250k so with the best scenario we are looking at around 1 5 million flight Remember the little reusable spacecraft Well It is because they need to change some pieces in the motor Almost all of the motor actually it will cost around 275k each time That brings us to a total of 1 25 million of profit per flight X50 flights per year 62 5 million per spacecraft Of course that is only if we take in account the best possible scenario that we assume that there will always be rich people ready to buy tickets and that virgin galactic decides to not lower the price of the tickets in the next few years Project 2 Supersonic Travelling To be quite honest this section is probably my preferred one even though it is not the main project of Virgin Galactic So they recently signed with Rolls Royce a memorandum of understanding aka a document with no legal weight that is only there to tell the world that both companies are interested in working together For the retards who might not know RR have been a big aeronautical engine producer they were the one in charge of producing the engines of the Concorde The goal of this is to create hypersonic airplanes that could reach at least Mach 3 3 times the speed of sound which would make travel on earth much faster To give you an idea a couple years ago we had the concorde who was beating records by flying from los angeles to london in nine hours and 13 minutes The concorde was only going at Mach 2 not the 3 Virgin Galactic is promising to us Mockup of Virgin Galactic Airplanes It is obviously far from being done with the Concorde we had many problems such as burning huge amounts of fuel only being able to reach its high speed above the ocean because of the noise it was producing and the overall profitability of the project made everyone forget about the idea The interesting point is that Boeing invested 20 million in SPCE stocks which is kinda good news Right And there are also rumors that they are planning to buy another hypersonic company named Boom which could make the development of these hypersonic airplanes faster Boom Company airplanes Conclusion I do believe that Virgin Galactic has a very big potential for growth in the future and I think I am not the only one that has this idea Ark invest with Cathie Wood is massively buying their shares and will soon have the company in their brand new space dlc etf coming out in the next couple of weeks months If we take a look at their vision it is easy to see that their idea is the future and we could have a real airport for spacecraft sooner than we think For now we don t have many places to visit but soon maybe Mars will be added to the list with our God Elon Musk For the one looking for the next gme SPCE is also very shorted as usual not a single website is able to provide us the same ratio but is supposedly above 30 Their vision is really exciting and if you are ready invest in them you got to be ready to have a bumpy ride because it will have a lot of up and downs just look at what the delay of the last test did but if you have diamonds hands or just buy the stock and forget your password you could POTENTIALLY make big gainzzz Not a financial advisor my mom is still in charge of my money so don t sue me if you get fist ted by the edge funds Thanks for coming to my Goon Talk

Update 02 22 , The stock market cools of as technology drops after the treasury yields spike Roku Deere amp Twilio smash earnings expectations while Walmart disappoints Palantir sells off on mixed results so let s talk about this and other stock market news Hello everyone So let s start with the recap of last week as we saw a mixed week for the major indexes with the Dow https imgur com VX5S1v3 gained just 0 11 for the week while the SP500 https imgur com 1uJLQIX lost 0 7 and the Nasdaq Composite https imgur com 5ZVNdNg underperformed losing over 1 5 after the treasury interest rate rose sharply to start the week 7 of the 11 sectors https imgur com xiLEGrH finished the week in the red while Utilities losing over 2 while Energy amp Financials hugely outperformed This stock market movement also pushed the Volatility Index https imgur com uEyhkQu up over 9 in the past week as it rose over 20 yet again Here https imgur com kPFpl23 is the HEAT MAP from last week that shows a pretty divided picture with Technology Communications amp Cyclicals losing ground while the gainers were concentrated in just a couple of sectors We also saw some interest economic data last week with the January core retail sales https imgur com IbeU1ck up almost 6 with the Producer price INDEX https imgur com ZocPeJs also rose by 1 3 its largest spike since it started being recorded So given this numbers and what the FED https imgur com kpGprlk leaders have continued to tell us it s very likely we won t see a sustained inflation rate of at least 2 in the next year or two despite this huge numbers coming in on the economic side It s really hard to see how this numbers can continue to come in at such high levels once we move on to a more normal life even with another round of stimulus checks The other beat on the economic numbers came in from the PMI https imgur com Hrk5SZQ composite which signaled the fastest growth in 6 years while in terms of Jobless claims https imgur com sEbFcJ2 we saw a spike in numbers yet again for the week but the continuing claims manage to drop by more than 50K We also received the investor sentiment survey https imgur com MUk8Vv2 which showed yet again an increase in bullishness which is starting to get very dangerous for the stock market as I said in my previous posts The bullishness is nearing the 50 which we haven t seen since after the November elections so yet again I would pretty much hold my portfolio right now not selling but not buying much right now either as this has worked as a good contrarian indicator in the past This week https imgur com ZPdkzS5 we get some more economic data with the leading economic indicators the consumer confidence index the jobless numbers and consumer spending while on the earnings https imgur com IAIyHIf front we are moving towards the end of the earnings seasons with interesting names like Square Nvidia Moderna Etsy DraftKings amp many others reporting this upcoming week In some other stock market news we saw Ford https imgur com 9X9cqJH continuing their journey on becoming fully electric by 2030 as they will invest 1B in their production facility from Germany This news combined with GM https imgur com SGIF2TL and most other traditional OEM joining more amp more the EV sector will continue to add pressure to the hyped stocks like Tesla Nio Xpeng amp many others I believe there will be a lot of companies that will benefit from this move but not all will succeed so you have to watch out and do your DD on what companies you pick amp chose I think we will see a mixed bag in the future with a couple of hyped stocks like Tesla which just cut the price https imgur com tIxgkLk of the model 3 and Y again amp Nio remaining favorites while I expect OEMs to eat up some of the other new entrants On the earnings side we had Palantir https imgur com EHDqE9f reporting a beat on revenues with the stock selling off pretty steeply after that report despite an in line guidance https imgur com ExRQ4DD for the revenue growth of about 30 for 2021 with a big growth rate in the first quarter of the year It didn t help the stock that the lock up period of 80 of the remaining insider shares also expired but I think this was an interesting buying opportunity for Palantir if you are looking to hold the company for the long term as it already started to recover rising more than 15 on Friday https imgur com TDBDIpw after the ARK https imgur com H8m7HBn Innovation ETF added over 5M shares Twilio https imgur com qhbS8Ln also rose after beating both the top amp bottom line and impressed with a guidance well above the consensus though they followed this with a stock offering https imgur com JALCaI5 of over 1 5B which caused somewhat of a small correction after the big pop One other stock that also rose after the earnings reports was ROKU https imgur com j5gA32i as the company posted a surprise profit while their revenues increased almost 60 over last year They also expect an adjusted EBITDA of around 5 10 for 2021 moving the company into profitability finally But guys the biggest beat on expectations by far in my opinion this week came from the industrial giant Deere https imgur com qoXEacL rising to a new record high for the stock as they beat expectations by 1 70 and increased their revenues by over 20 over last year as they also guided https imgur com OgcZT2b for net income of up to 5B next year compared to 2 75B in FY2020 On the other hand Walmart https imgur com E2a8iOr dropped 6 after reporting a miss on earnings for the 4th quarter while also giving a soft guidance for next year though they did announce a 20B buyback plan and a raise of the dividend yield I think the drop might have also been cause by the news they would increase employee wages with at least 12months of history in the company to 15 hours from the current 11 hour which will affect their earnings in the future So yeah folks let s hope for a better week in the stock markets again Thank you everyone for reading Hope you enjoyed the content Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market Have a great day and see you next time

phone sales continue to cement Apple as a very stable company and situates them very well to continue expanding into other areas hint hint Electric Vehicles Low volatility considering the annual shareholder meeting is tomorrow I am surprised to see that historic volatility is currently only 10 This means options are relatively cheap In my opinion this opens the door for a speculative play here where we can see call options increase in price due to delta AAPL stonk price increasing which has historically performed very strongly as well as IV volatility increase due to speculation Apple

the combination of Apple being quiet on the topic while they work on the details as per their normal playbook as well as a general market sell off in response to recent market volatility i e funds are selling off their AAPL to shift their gains to other areas to fight the market volatility means we have a lower price AAPL stonk than I believe it should be Basically hedge funds are busy fighting in other areas of the market and can t allocate capital to speculate on Apple and are instead busy fighting the day to day fight in other stonks GME The Electric Vehicle EV play there have been reports of Apple looking for an EV partner in 2021 and my opinion is I expect news on Apple s EV play over the next 3 6 months if not during annual shareholder meeting tomorrow Of note Foxconn which is Apples main chip producer is releasing their own EV independent of Apple by EOY In my view point this means a major Apple partner who they have an extensive business relationship with already has the infrastructure and equipment in place to support an Apple EV play Most recently Apple has been in early talks with car producers Kia as well as Hyundai While nothing is official this is evidence that Apple is exploring the EV market But keep in mind Apple is a technology company so they can provide a car manufacturer partner with EV technology using their top computer science talent Using existing skill sets and projects already in development Apple can provide operating systems Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning self driving technology LiDAR sensors etc to the EV space In my opinion this makes Apple a speculative EV play amp x200B Financials Sales grew a whopping 72 111 5B in the previous quarter They spent 5B last quarter on R amp D alone They reported a free cash flow of 73B in 2020

In 2020 the board of directors had a target goal of 265B in net sales and they hit 274B The operating income target was 61B and they hit 66B Clearly this board of directors knows how to get results

speculative upside meaning tickets are cheap for the next rocket to Planet Tendies Tomorrow 23 February 2021 is the annual shareholders meeting This is a good time to take a look at the Apple of my eye AAPL Note this is not an earnings report but a shareholder meeting More on that below Upside iPhone Sales For the first time since 2016 Apple is 1 global smart phone sales That means Apple has retaken their crown as the smartphone king And this is all before 5G really takes over I anticipate Apple iPhone sales to continue to perform well as 5G is rolled out globally Strong smart phone sales continue to cement Apple as a very stable company and situates them very well to continue expanding into other areas hint hint Electric Vehicles Low volatility considering the annual shareholder meeting is tomorrow I am surprised to see that historic volatility is currently only 10 This means options are relatively cheap In my opinion this opens the door for a speculative play here where we can see call options increase in price due to delta AAPL stonk price increasing which has historically performed very strongly as well as IV volatility increase due to speculation Apple thus far has been relatively quiet on their future plans and I believe if they hint at any information tomorrow during their shareholder meeting or in the near term we will be eating tendies https amp ft com

about 20 of the company on an as converted basis We have a great relationship and were flattered that they highlight TerrAscend as a key pillar In terms of whether they want to acquire controlling

mutually beneficial We talk to them regularly They have alot of great insight and are generous with their time and resources For example Their advice has been very helpful as it relates to our

Holding Clearing NSTB is a beautiful picks and shovels play for the financial revolution currently taking place Upside Potential I believe this SPAC has an upside of 90 at its current price of 10 8 and my PT is 20 I will cover topics such as Chamath Retail Trends and Bitchcoin gt Apex benefits from a myriad of trends such as 1 The Rise of Retail Investors and Stock Trading 2 Crypo Currency Bitchcoin Ethereecum 3 FinTech amp x200B gt Background Apex provides fast secure and reliable digital custody clearing real time cripo solutions fractional share trading and other services to online brokerage firms traditional wealth managers wealth tech platforms professional traders and consumer brands Yahoo Processing img xk7fphhks3j61 The most powerful trend is the rise of retail investors The number of retail traders is growing exponentially and Apex is beautifully set up to benefit from this growth Apex generates revenues from fees associated with each trade sign up and other activities Processing img eolsypbns3j61 Chamath and SoFi He endorses a service that relys on Apex s Technologies gt On January 28th 2020 during the GME meltdown Chamath Palihapitiya released a tweet claiming that SoFi was the 1 best app to replace Robinhood This got the attention of various YouTubers such as Deadnsyde and the stock rallied from 18 to 25 an almost 40 increase Chamath s endorsement and connection to SoFi are important because SoFi is a client of Apex Clearing Holdings Processing img g6vrntcds3j61 The Rise of Webull A Favorite alternative to Robinhood gt Webull is almost every YouTuber Tik Toker and Fintwit s broker of choice Influencers are shying away from Robinhood due to its bad reputation and instead heavily promoting Webull Its tremendous success and rapidly growing business is great news for Apex The success of Apex s clients at Robinhoods expense could generate more revenue for Apex Apex the Bitchcoin Play Su woo is a common phrase among the Crips i think gt Apex is a crips play Thanks to Elon Musk Michelle Saylor and others Bitchcoin and altcons are reaching historic milestones In June 27th 2019 Apex announced their Apex Crip Su Woo platform that would allow brokers and financial advisors to offer Crip su woo trading They were one of the first platforms to support crip su woo trading along side stock trading gt gt Quote Apex Clearing Corporation and Apex Crip Su Woo have announced the launch of a first of its kind cripocurrency platform that provides broker dealers and financial advisors with access to a simple fast and effective way to introduce digital currency trading into their clients portfolios gt gt Tech enabled workflows from Apex Clearing and the Apex Crip platform allow investors to transition between trading equities and trading crypoocurrency in just a few clicks opening and funding new accounts in minutes compared to what has historically taken weeks when moving assets from a traditional investment account to a standalone crypocurrency platform gt gt Apex Technologies have a history of innovation in the financial sector They contributed to making crypo currencies more accessible and I believe they will continue to benifit from this trend Processing img z8yaiz8gs3j61 Financials and Momentum gt Quote Transaction values Apex at an enterprise value of 4 7 billion post money and is expected to provide up to 850 million of gross cash proceeds which includes an upsized 450 million fully committed PIPE backed by top tier institutional investors including Fidelity Management amp Research Company LLC Baron Capital Group Coatue and Winslow Capital Management LLC gt gt Industry leading momentum generated unaudited operating revenue of approximately 236 million and unaudited adjusted EBITDA of approximately 86 million in FY2020 with robust sales and adjusted EBITDA growth expected to continue in 2021 Momentum gt I beleive a potential problem for Apex Clearing House is its public perception People may falsely associate Apex to Robinhood even though it isn t true However upon realizing Apex s connection to So Fi and Webull I think they ll quickly change their minds gt gt Palantir PLTR was once deemed too controversial before becoming a successful triple bagger This is because Palantir will benifit from certain trends and that s what investors are trained to follow No matter how you feel money wins gt gt I believe once people grasp Apex s potential and how the trends are in its favor NSTB will have a strong rally gt gt CEO I m also bullish on the CEO William Capuzzi Under his leadership he looks up to Elon Musk and makes innovation his focus He s done a lot for the retail investor by introducing crypo trading and fractional shares Ps He s bald too like Jeff Bezos so that helps too Processing img co6vmbqhs3j61 Apex is an Award Winning Service gt Benzinga Wealth Management Software 2020 gt gt Waters Ranking Winner 2020 Best Clearing House Service Provider 2020 gt gt Benzinga Fintech Award 2018 Conclusion Apex Clearing will benefit from a variety of unstoppable social and financial trends I believe its current stock price presents an attractive entry into an innovative fintech and crypo related business gt Ticker NSTB Northern Star Investment Corp II Ordinary Shares Class A lt gt This is my opinion I m not a financial advisor lt Chamath wholeheartedly

next Luckin Coffee Nikola ALL COMBINED You can listen to me if you want but don t tell me I didn t warn you SOS Limited was previously listed on the NYSE as ticker XRF China Rapid Finance They were a failing company that couldn t turn a profit Their business was focused mostly on rescue loans The price of their stock had fallen to the point to where they were dangerously close to getting delisted https deadsoggyfrog substack com p think about whats happening with utm campaign post amp utm medium web amp utm source email https deadsoggyfrog substack com p think about whats happening with utm campaign post amp utm medium web amp utm source email READ THE ARTICLE FOR BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY A Chinese company known as SOS has recently blown up in the b1tc01n wave as they supposedly acquired thousands of mining rigs in early 2021 Here s the catch it didn t actually happen SOS supposedly received 5000 mining rigs 3 weeks early in the time of a rig shortage and furthermore the company they purchased it from is a shell company created by SOS SOS releases news about buying mining rigs from a company HY International Group New York Inc that doesn t exist the stock gains traction during the coming weeks and shoots up in price They notice this and create a fake website connected to the mining company they mentioned http www hyfth com http www hyfth com The website is cloned directly from the SOS site with the exact same layout even tho its supposed to be US based except some mining rigs at the front page to make it seem legit They even claim to be The world s largest mining machine matchmaker while being created 2 weeks ago I repeat the website was created 2 WEEKS AGO The original adress points to trump tower The phone number and the chineese adress were added today The site has articles that date back to 2020 even tho the website was just created 2 weeks ago Get out before it dumps If you visit the company website you ll quickly see a bunch of red flags if you take the time to read through their news tab and check the annual reports But the most obvious red flag is the company from which they mention buying the mining rigs from you can find the news about at their website https service sosyun com portalenglish page news list 210121 html https service sosyun com portalenglish page news list 210121 html The company name is HY International Group New York Inc mentioned in above link If you do a quick search for this company via google you ll find their website http www hyfth com http www hyfth com The website claims to be The world s largest mining machine matchmaker Thats a bold claim when their website was created literally last week that s right LAST WEEK You can look this up yourself with the following site https websiteage org https websiteage org The mining website was basically created 2 weeks after the announcement from SOS that pretty much says it all What I think happened is that they released the mining purchase news then noticed how their stock was gaining traction To make it all seem legit they create a fake mining website If you compare the SOS site and the mining site they basically have the exact same layout even tho the mining site is supposed to be US based They have literally cloned their website and put some mining rigs on the front page to make it seem legit The contact us tab has a fake name Claire Low they added a fake phone number and a fake chineese adress just today they even have an adress that points to trump tower 40 Wall St FL2808 NewYork NY 10005 great effort Their whole news tab has articles that go back all the way to february 6th 2020 how is this even possible if the website was created last week IF YOU ARE A BULL READ THIS One big argument that bulls present on SOS s legitimacy is that there are big institutional investors that are invested in SOS However this is a misconception as the investors were predate SOS back when it was still the XRF Chinese Loan Company This means that your institutional investors DONT GIVE A SHIT about SOS and likely exited this position a long time ago It just says they have institutional investors because docs transferred over and the public hasn t gotten any new updates with filings So those positions might have been exited already Temporary Hype Warning Every damn Stock Expert on Youtube TikTok Discord and Twitter is claiming SOS as the next Tesla or GME making ridiculous claims for a stock that they hardly looked into themselves Most of these guys just ride whatever is hype and do very little Due Diligence If you own a position in this company be careful because you can get burned really fast when this stock drops The news that SOS is a scam has only surfaced recently and many people who rode SOS to success will likely be hesitant to accept the news However do some research and look into this on your own and don t just listen to what some stock guru tells you RECOMMENDATIONS The bottom line is that this company is a FRAUD You may be able to earn some temporary gains for a few more days but SOS will soon be exposed If you own SOS GET OUT If you don t think this could happen just look at Luckin Coffee
