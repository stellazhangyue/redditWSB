world for greater disclosure of government knowledge into UAP s Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon after the New York Times released it s bombshell coverage of encounters by 3 Navy pilots in 2017 and 2019 each reporting to have seen technology that defies the limits of physics with capabilities that far exceed that of any known assets in US Russian or Chinese arsenals Manoeuvres that have been witnessed include rapid deacceleration high velocity to a sudden stop then hover sharp angle high velocity low angle turns right angles or sharper low altitude trans medium travel submerged craft lifting and flying from water and the reverse high altitude trans medium travel craft dropping from above 80 000 ft then coming to a hover at 30 000 ft and the reverse high velocity travel Mach 10 or near instantaneous non aerodynamic aircraft design cubes pyramids cylinders disks acorns top hats and propulsion systems that do not function off of exothermic thrust based physics no thermal heat trail Pressure has been building on the Pentagon to release what it knows which has since resulted in the declassification of those videos and confirmation by the Pentagon that they are authentic as well as new mandates outlined in the 2021 COVID relief bill mandating full government disclosure by June 2021 The Pentagon has also publicly announced the creation of a new UFO taskforce and has been giving closed door briefings to members of the Senate and Congress including the Senate Intelligence Committee on these incursions into American airspace Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has long fought for funding and disclosure and recently when asked the question so are you saying there s information that the public hasn t seen on the subject he responded what I m telling you is that the public hasn t seen most of the information As recently as two weeks ago new videos and pictures have been leaked of UAP s flying in formation over US battle squadrons which include captured images of acorn and pyramid shaped craft hovering at distance The frequency of these incursions has also been alarming prompting several Atlantic based Airforce bases to issue warnings to their pilots of unknown objects in their airspace ahead of every exercise Radar technicians aboard the aircraft carrier Nimitz describe seeing these objects at such a high frequency and in such high numbers that on some days they were described as falling out of the sky Additional alarm has been raised by other members of the military as the frequency of sightings also seems to correlate with proximity to nuclear facilities including missile silos aircraft carriers and submarines with senior officials in charge of these facilities describing anomalies in launch sequences that appear to be intentional These concerns are what prompted Christopher Lemon former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence along with Luis Elizondo former director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program ATTIP at the Pentagon to leak the videos to the New York Times Speculation of UFO s dates back to World War II where pilots regularly observed bright lights in the sky that would track them into battles At the time these unknown objects were referred to as Foo Fighters but were later termed UFO s Unidentified Flying Objects after the public became enthralled in the crash at Roswell where the government announced it was in possession of an alien aircraft and subsequently retracted the story the following day Public interest was further garnered in the 1980 s when a military contractor Bob Lazar who worked as a physicist on advanced propulsion systems came forward with information that he had worked on 9 crafts in government possession at a military black site called S 4 that matched the descriptions and performance capabilities of the UFO s described by pilots This base was later known as Area 51 and has captured the publics imagination ever since In 2001 a group of concerned senior military leadership and citizens held the first attempt at public disclosure hosting the Citizens Disclosure Project in front of a panel of several sitting US Senators While momentum again began to build that momentum was quickly quashed by the events of September 11 and public interest and only just begun to resurface Article in the New York Times detailing the UAP

investing since its inception date April 10 2019 It has performed remarkably in line with peers when benchmarked against the S amp P 1500 Industrials Index as of May 12 2021 As with many funds of its vintage the crash of March 20 effectively served as a stress test to the financial health of its component companies which it passed with flying colours achieving almost a full retracement the fund only recorded a loss in value of 3 64 from 26 37 to 25 41 which was improved by a further 1 from dividends earned during the period Post 2020 similar space ETFs have launched in 2021 in advance of an anticipated flood of investor funds into this emerging sector as Morgan Stanley estimates the global space industry could generate revenue of more than 1 trillion of more in 2040 up from 350 billion currently With roughly half of that increase expected to come from satellite broadband UFO is well positioned to benefit from this influx of capital with 40 71 of fund allocation comprised of a mix of both orbital and surface communication companies Why UFO What s the play here Former Democratic Majority Leader and Nevada Senator Harry Reid as well as other notable ufologists have long claimed that defence contractor Lockheed Martin may have had fragments of a crashed UFO in its possession Many claim that possession of the UFO material is what not only inspired the shapes of many skunkworks aircraft but led to multiple breakthroughs in materials research and stealth technology Employees at Lockheed have gone so far as to make eyewitness reports of alien sightings and direct interactions More broadly speaking any admission by the government of extra terrestrials will naturally be met with fear and the simple play here is to place a long trade on defense and aerospace of which UFO has a significant composition with an allocation of 27 19 including major Pentagon contractors Raytheon Northrop and Boeing Should the evidence provided be less than conclusive interest in UFO the ETF is expected to increase at the bare minimum both from direct key term searches literally the letters UFO searches by retail investors surrounding related investment opportunities and even more generally through social media sentiment The uptick in interest should naturally lead to an increase in volume traded in popular aerospace and defense stocks most of which are held by the fund Defense stocks are a popular benefactor in times of global uncertainty and the sudden interest back to space is likely to exacerbate existing trends toward the militarization of space and a resurgence of Cold War between leading world powers notably between the US China and Russia see this article in Politico below Increased investment into satellite communications is also an expected knock on effect as countries will be focused on boosting their ears and eyes in the skies see below article from C4ISRNET Article links https www politico com story 2019 06 16 war in space trump china 1365842 https www

to simplify what is going on and catch you up since many are asking Feel free to scroll past if you are a veteran A long long time ago The evil citadel empire and hedge fund cronies led by darth Kenneth Griffin tried to short AMC stock to bankrupt the company and take profits These are the same groups that caused the housing crisis of 2008 that were bailed out with our tax dollars The best explanation of shorting is when someone borrows a 10 video game from a friend stock banana and sells it to a video game store for 10 thinking that in a few weeks the price will likely depreciate to 5 which at that point they will buy back pocket the 5 difference and return the video game to their friend In this case a bunch of apes decided that this AMC video game has nostalgic value and decided to buy all the video games from every store in the world and love it so much they will Hold on for Dear Life HODL unless the person is willing to pay a ridiculous amount for it say 100k or more Obviously that seems crazy so the borrower says no way at first assuming it will eventually go down in price again later At this point the original owner says i want my video game back The borrower of the AMC video game realizes he will never be able to pay 100K or more for the video game or he will lose all his money tendies so he tries several different ways of solving his problem One way is he borrows the video game from another another kid in class who loans it to him for a very low variable 2 7 APR interest rate He gives the borrowed share back to the original friend and everything looks good to the original friend Problem now is he owns the lender the video game which he now doesn t have The lender realizes he likes making money every day and decides to up the interest rate variably all the way up to 247 apr interest In the meantime the borrower tries several ways to make it look like people are selling the video game so that he can trick other apes into selling their copies One big trick is that he makes a bunch of bootleg copies that he sells back and forth between friends at lower and lower prices to make it seem like the value of the game is dropping short ladder attacks But apes are not as stupid as they seem Instead they act even dumber and buy even more copies of the video game because they think its a great value The video games work and play fine but they all have a a unique serial code that is only redeemable to one person the original owner So now a bunch of apes own all the video games 450ish million plus however many bootleg versions are floating around maybe a billion or more The original borrower was hoping surely these apes will eventually sell their games if we keep making it look like there are more and more games being sold off So they keep doubling down on their convictions and we just keep buying more keeping the price of the game relatively low Except now they are paying crazy high interest on several millions of copies How many copies No one knows for sure yet But silverback Adam Aron creator of AMC video game decides things have gotten out of control He cleverly devises a plan to create a video game update so that everyone has to register their copies online also known as the vote update At this point the number of fake video games will be released revealing some naughty people have been bootlegging his game The Feds and SEC don t like it when people make illegal bootlegs So once they are done taking their sweet time building their case and catching them red handed The hedgies faking shares and manipulating the market with bad rumors will inevitably be called by Principal Margin who will take all of their money and start giving it back to the original video game owners as well as the bootlegs The hedgies will be set them to detention for several years where they will have to do be very careful not to drop the soap in front of the class bully Once all the parents catch wind of the scandal at school they all demand their children are compensated for the video game at the price they determined because its not even possible to give them all their original video game Because the teachers Brokers were supposed to monitor the students failed allowing this to happen they will have to help pay for the video games If the teachers don t have enough to pay the principals banks have to help pay because they ensured the students the teachers were doing their jobs If the principals don t have enough to cover the superintendents insurance companies and DTCC have to help pay This goes on all the way up to the federal level until apes get all the Tendies that their video Games are worth which is enough money to send you up to the moon As far as Robinhood they were accused of being complicit in assisting Hedgefunds by selling off copies of the video game that they did not have They have been accused in selling data to Citadel which helps whoever keeps making naked fake shares know how many to make in order to flood the market so that that price of AMC stays low When this was supposed to squeeze in January several people would have been millionaires overnight but Vlad Tenev and his micropenis chose were selling shares of AMC through their app that they did not own He would have had to repurchase the shares at a higher price which would have bankrupted him He chose to save himself and screw over every player in the game including myself that played it fair and square He shut down buying along with other brokers the others aren t mentioned as much because vlad has the smallest micropenis of them all which lowered demand thus killing the price and momentum of the stock This inevitably only delayed the squeeze as we have stayed resilient and continued to BUY and HOLD If they were likely to screw you over once their is nothing from stopping them from doing it again This was the best analogy my smooth brain could come up with If its too complicated simply BUY and HOLD Never bet more then your willing to lose and if price suddenly drops steeply that likely means its about to squeeze so personally i would buy more and double down sit back and enjoy the fireworks This is all my opinion I m not a financial advisor Other apes feel free to add or correct Holy crap that took alot of crayons write up

cap one This will mainly happen due to the revenue generated by Orladeyo and the potential of BCX9930 Basically from now on each ER will be a new catalyst for BCRX Considering how Orladeyo is still in

morning to all of you here on r wallstreetbets I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and is ready for the new trading week ahead Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 17th 2021 Earnings reports and the Fed will test the market rally in the week ahead Source https www cnbc com 2021 05 14 earnings reports the fed will test the market rally in the week ahead html gt Investors will see whether stocks carry their newfound momentum into the week ahead as major retailers including Walmart and Home Depot report earnings and housing data dominates the calendar gt The Federal Reserve may also play a role Minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday and after April s hotter than expected consumer and producer inflation market pros will watch it closely gt Central bank officials are also scheduled to make comments including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks next Monday gt Stocks have been volatile The rally on Thursday and Friday was unable to reverse the week s heavy losses The defensive consumer staples financials and materials were on track for a positive week among major sectors The worst performers were consumer discretionary off about 3 7 for the week and tech which was down 2 2 gt Technology shares were among the best performers in Friday s rally up about 2 1 Energy was the best performer up more than 3 gt Watch it with a certain amount of trepidation said Art Hogan chief market strategist at National Securities It s not like the things that spooked us this week like inflation are going away I think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts gt But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks gt Fundstrat co founder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic like airlines and hotels are ready to rise off the bottom gt He is still concerned about the tech sector which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care gt Fed Ahead gt The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting But that was held before April s Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 4 2 year over year gt That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266 000 payrolls a quarter of what was expected gt I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points They re thinking that one data point is not a trend said Joseph Song senior U S economist at Bank of America gt But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying That would be a precursor to slowly ending the 120 billion a month asset purchase program and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates gt Hogan said when the weak employment report was released the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer gt But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday gt We saw hot CPI hot PPI said Hogan referring to the producer price index That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve gt The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper down nearly 2 for the week gt Retail earnings and housing gt Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday Target TJX and Lowe s release results Wednesday and B J s Wholesale and Kohl s on Thursday gt Another disappointing data point was Friday s April s retail sales which came in flat with March But they are still at a high level Hogan said based on the sales report retailers should have done well gt You re likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming It used to be Walmart Target Home Depot Lowe s said Hogan He said now others have joined the list like TJX and Gap and should do well gt Besides earnings there is housing data The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday and housing starts are published Tuesday Existing home sales will be issued on Friday gt Hogan said depending on the data it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week He noted that D R Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week gt The home building index is off 5 for the week even with it being up 1 Friday This is a red hot sector that has lots of implications he said What s good for home sales is good for auto sales It s good for Home Depot and Lowe s gt Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday gt Scott Redler chief strategist at T3Live com said by the end of the week some of the growth and tech names were trading better like Facebook and Alphabet gt The S amp P 500 held the 50 day moving average which is constructive he said gt The S amp P 500 came within about a dozen points of its 50 day which is the average price of the last 50 closes It is often a level that acts as support but if it is broken it can signal a negative trend gt The S amp P 500 was down about 1 5 for the week at 4 173 85 The Nasdaq ended the week at 13 429 98 down 2 3 on the week gt The tech sector which has been under pressure held its yearly uptrend earlier in the week Today

zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week gt We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical Reposition in May period The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pent up pandemic demand gt Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months November June and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns Though we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000 gt If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the September October lows around 12900 and 12750 which would be an 8 9 pullback from the April 16 14041 91

up to developed international stocks recently for several reasons For one the U S stock market has staged a tremendous rally this week notwithstanding since last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that aren t pricing in so much optimism Valuations though not great timing tools are more attractive in Europe and Japan And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost non US stock returns gt Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks The developed international equity market mainly Europe and Japan is much more value focused than the U S market based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the S amp P 500 Index As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the U S In other words international tends to work when value works gt

international stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials industrials and natural resources coupled with tech sector weakness gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the U S as those economies fully reopen gt We can see how developed international stocks are more value focused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes As shown in the graphic below the U S equity market represented by the S amp P 500 Index has a much higher technology sector allocation making it a more growth oriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities If digital media think Google and Facebook which are categorized as communication services and e commerce think Amazon which is in consumer discretionary are included in this sector comparison the technology gap widens even further In essence for international to outperform U S technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue gt

developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the U S is seeing now those markets may be in an even better position to outperform Until then we maintain our slight preference for U S stocks over developed international gt Bullish Sentiment Down Big gt The past week has been

morning to all of you here on r wallstreetbets I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and is ready for the new trading week ahead Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 17th 2021 Earnings reports and the Fed will test the market rally in the week ahead Source https www cnbc com 2021 05 14 earnings reports the fed will test the market rally in the week ahead html gt Investors will see whether stocks carry their newfound momentum into the week ahead as major retailers including Walmart and Home Depot report earnings and housing data dominates the calendar gt The Federal Reserve may also play a role Minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday and after April s hotter than expected consumer and producer inflation market pros will watch it closely gt Central bank officials are also scheduled to make comments including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks next Monday gt Stocks have been volatile The rally on Thursday and Friday was unable to reverse the week s heavy losses The defensive consumer staples financials and materials were on track for a positive week among major sectors The worst performers were consumer discretionary off about 3 7 for the week and tech which was down 2 2 gt Technology shares were among the best performers in Friday s rally up about 2 1 Energy was the best performer up more than 3 gt Watch it with a certain amount of trepidation said Art Hogan chief market strategist at National Securities It s not like the things that spooked us this week like inflation are going away I think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts gt But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks gt Fundstrat co founder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic like airlines and hotels are ready to rise off the bottom gt He is still concerned about the tech sector which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care gt Fed Ahead gt The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting But that was held before April s Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 4 2 year over year gt That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266 000 payrolls a quarter of what was expected gt I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points They re thinking that one data point is not a trend said Joseph Song senior U S economist at Bank of America gt But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying That would be a precursor to slowly ending the 120 billion a month asset purchase program and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates gt Hogan said when the weak employment report was released the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer gt But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday gt We saw hot CPI hot PPI said Hogan referring to the producer price index That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve gt The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper down nearly 2 for the week gt Retail earnings and housing gt Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday Target TJX and Lowe s release results Wednesday and B J s Wholesale and Kohl s on Thursday gt Another disappointing data point was Friday s April s retail sales which came in flat with March But they are still at a high level Hogan said based on the sales report retailers should have done well gt You re likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming It used to be Walmart Target Home Depot Lowe s said Hogan He said now others have joined the list like TJX and Gap and should do well gt Besides earnings there is housing data The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday and housing starts are published Tuesday Existing home sales will be issued on Friday gt Hogan said depending on the data it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week He noted that D R Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week gt The home building index is off 5 for the week even with it being up 1 Friday This is a red hot sector that has lots of implications he said What s good for home sales is good for auto sales It s good for Home Depot and Lowe s gt Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday gt Scott Redler chief strategist at T3Live com said by the end of the week some of the growth and tech names were trading better like Facebook and Alphabet gt The S amp P 500 held the 50 day moving average which is constructive he said gt The S amp P 500 came within about a dozen points of its 50 day which is the average price of the last 50 closes It is often a level that acts as support but if it is broken it can signal a negative trend gt The S amp P 500 was down about 1 5 for the week at 4 173 85 The Nasdaq ended the week at 13 429 98 down 2 3 on the week gt The tech sector which has been under pressure held its yearly uptrend earlier in the week Today it felt a little better than the rest of the week Redler said Friday It doesn t mean you can go into everything but you can tell traders are picking away at better acting stocks at these prices This

disappointing but it usually takes a long time for jobs to come back after a recession so maybe we shouldn t have been so surprised In fact looking at the 10 previous recessions it took 30 months on average to recover all the jobs that were lost Given we still have 8 million jobs to make up this time we could still be quite a ways away from getting the labor market back to where we were pre COVID 19 gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https i2 wp com lplresearch com wp content uploads 2021 05 May 14 chart 1 png ssl 1 gt The current bull market has tracked the start to the 2009 bull market nearly perfectly Be aware that right about now is when the 2009 bull finally took a break falling more than 16 into the summer explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick We don t expect that type of a pullback this time but after an 89 rally maybe a pullback or consolidation is in the cards gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https i0 wp com lplresearch com wp content uploads 2021 05 May 14 chart 2 png ssl 1 gt Copper is breaking out to new highs after consolidating for 15 years The last time it did that it eventually gained more than 150 Every time is different but with the global

right about now gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https i0 wp com lplresearch com wp content uploads 2021 05 may 14 chart 4 png ssl 1 gt The financial press has discussed the well known sell in May and go away market saying but did you know it actually starts on May 5th As the LPL Chart of the Day shows the middle part of May is historically quite weak for stocks as the broadly weaker period begins The calendar you could say isn t doing anyone any favors even if the economy still is gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https i0 wp com lplresearch com wp content uploads 2021 05 may 14 chart 5 png ssl 1 gt NASDAQ 100 Finds Support gt Our go to leading market index indicator of late the NASDAQ 100 NDX which is tracked by the widely held exchange traded fund ETF Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ may have found some support on Wednesday in the big sell off near 13000 Actually using our wide chisel tip Sharpie we would draw this current near term support between the black line support levels in the 13000 13200 range on the accompanying chart gt While we still do not expect any major decline here we do not foresee any major upside either over the next six months the Worst Six Month of the year May October We zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week gt We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical Reposition in May period The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pent up pandemic demand gt Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months November June and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns Though we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000 gt If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the September October lows around 12900 and 12750 which would be an 8 9 pullback from the April 16 14041 91 closing Doji candle high Below that are the March lows 12200 12420 which would be an 11 13 correction gt In our view all the stimulus pent up demand and Fed money will prevent any major down draft while seasonals valuations technicals internals sector rotation and sentiment will keep a lid on the upside most likely until the fall Please enjoy a more normal summer gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART

up to developed international stocks recently for several reasons For one the U S stock market has staged a tremendous rally this week notwithstanding since last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that aren t pricing in so much optimism Valuations though not great timing tools are more attractive in Europe and Japan And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost non US stock returns gt Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks The developed international equity market mainly Europe and Japan is much more value focused than the U S market based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the S amp P 500 Index As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the U S In other words international tends to work when value works gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https i1 wp com lplresearch com wp content uploads 2021 05 5 13 21 Blog Chart 1 png ssl 1 gt Should strong performance by value stocks continue and we suspect it might international stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials industrials and natural resources coupled with tech sector weakness gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the U S as those economies fully reopen gt We can see how developed international stocks are more value focused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes As shown in the graphic below the U S equity market represented by the S amp P 500 Index has a much higher technology sector allocation making it a more growth oriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities If digital media think Google and Facebook which are categorized as communication services and e commerce think Amazon which is in consumer discretionary are included in this sector comparison the technology gap widens even further In essence for international to outperform U S technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https i0 wp com lplresearch com wp content uploads 2021 05 5 13 21 Blog Chart 2 png ssl 1 gt At this point the primary factor holding us back from upgrading our view of developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the U S is seeing now those markets may be in an even better position to outperform Until then we maintain our slight preference for U S stocks over developed international gt Bullish Sentiment Down Big gt The past week has been one of the worst short term runs for the major indices of the past several months and sentiment this week is reflecting that negative price action Bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII weekly sentiment survey took a spill dropping 7 8 percentage points to 36 5 Whereas just over a month ago bullish sentiment hit a multi year high at 56 9 this week s reading was the lowest since the last week of October gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2021 05 051321 AAII Bull png gt The over 20 percentage point decline in that time was the biggest drop in a span of five weeks since a 22 73 percentage point decline in the five weeks ending February 8th 2018 In the table below we show the past 11 periods in which bullish sentiment fell by at least 20 percentage points in five weeks without another occurrence in at least a year Overall they have consistently preceded solid runs for the S amp P 500 with frequent moves higher that are on average larger than the norm One and three months later have both seen the S amp P 500 trade higher 81 8 of the time and a half year to a full year out has seen the index lower only one time in 2007 Additionally each of the prior instances since 2009 has been marked by the S amp P 500 trading higher across all time frames gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2021 05 051321 AAII Bull Table b png gt With bullish sentiment lower bearish sentiment gained 3 9 percentage points At 27 it is at the highest level since early February though still a few percentage points above the historical average of around 30 gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2021 05 051321 AAII Bear png gt That has resulted in the bull bear spread dropping 11 7 points to 9 5 That is the first single digit reading in the spread since the first week of February but it still indicates that overall sentiment remains biased towards the bulls gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2021 05 051321 AAII BB Spread png gt While bearish sentiment has only risen modestly neutral sentiment is flying After gaining another 4 percentage points this week neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the second week of 2020 Similar to bullish sentiment the move higher in neutral sentiment over the past few weeks has been one of the largest in roughly three years gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2021 05 051321 AAII Neutral png gt Inflation Trends gt You know it s getting bad when inflation starts to trend on Twitter but that s where we find ourselves this morning with the terms GasShortage2021 and inflation both trending on our Twitter feed gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2021 05

com uploads 2021 05 051221 Inflation trends png gt These real time indicators of concerns over inflation also manifested themselves in the official inflation data this morning as y y CPI surged to 4 2 eclipsing the prior post financial crisis highs Not only that but if CPI is unchanged on a m m basis in May highly unlikely the y y reading will climb to 4 3 given the decline last May If we assume that May s m m change is the same as the average so far this year it would imply a 4 8 y y change gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2021 05 051221 CPI SInce 2010 png gt Even assuming that inflation only rises at the average m m rate so far this year may be conservative at this point That s because the rate of increase on a m m basis has now accelerated for six straight months Going all the way back to the 1940s there s never been a streak that long Just for some perspective if CPI increases by the same rate in May as it did in April headline CPI will clock in at 5 1 gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2021 05 051221 InflationStreaks png gt While the current level of CPI looks very high relative to the post financial crisis period from a longer term perspective it still has yet to show signs of breaking out from its thirty year range Based on the pain from prior spikes let s hope it stays that way gt CLICK HERE FOR THE

this morning s release of the NFIB s monthly survey on small business sentiment The survey showed rising prices tight labor market conditions and overall improving demand gt The NFIB also surveys businesses on what they consider to be their single most important issues For the majority of businesses cost or quality of labor and government requirements or taxes are the most prevalent In total 64 of businesses reported one of these as the biggest problem Meanwhile the percentage of businesses reporting weak sales as the most pressing issue continues to fall which is indicative of a further recovery in demand One other interesting decline was in the issue of competition from big business Only 7 of businesses reported this as their biggest problem which is the lowest reading since October

533,nd81g3,t2_6jm9c53p,1621111442,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd81g3/how_cpi_is_transitory/,1,How CPI is transitory , The headline CPI year over year increase at 4 2 was the highest since 2008 Energy prices rose 25 and gas prices 50 Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything Used car and truck prices were up 21 Rents rose 2 1 If you substitute home prices for rents that number more than doubled The Fed calls this transitory citing lower prices in April 2020 due to lockdowns in response to the Covid 19 pandemic The mainstream media were quick to point this out Some news added that the rise in prices is because the economic growth is accelerating The problems with these apologetic excuses for rising prices are many If these increases are solely based on the low numbers in April 2020 then why have they soared from just one month ago If the economy is doing so well why does the Fed continue to print 120bln a month and keep the Fed Funds rates at essentially zero Why is Government falling all over himself to spend money on everything it seems to the tune of trillions in additional fiscal stimulus No the economy is not booming because if all of these stimuli were ended tomorrow everything would collapse It s that simple The truth is that unemployment remains extremely high the labor participation rate low and we re seeing supply shocks develop across the economy This means fewer people producing fewer goods and providing fewer services At the same time dollars printed out of thin air are being pumped into the system left and right How does giving the unemployed a check once a month while providing nothing in return not create higher prices I apologize for the following patronizing example but just to illustrate the point clearly Say you have 10 cartons of milk and 10 circulating in the economy All else aside what is the price of each carton of milk 1 Now say you increase the amount of money circulating in the economy to 20 What is the price now 2 An inflation rate of 100 from 1 to 2 Now let s say that the number of cartons of milk falls from 10 to 5 What is the price of a carton of milk now It s 4 because now you have 20 chasing 5 cartons An inflation rate of 400 from 1 to 4 The point being that if you create more money out of thin air and at the same time reduce the amount of goods and services to purchase prices soar This is the real reason we re seeing prices rise and it s not transitory As I like to say one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year or go to Any shop or the grocery store It s not rocket science This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops small and medium sized businesses return and employment rises significantly Don t hold your breath imho Negating the transitory nonsense the month over month increases were far higher than expected double in the case of the headline PPI These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time i e the CPI is likely going even higher If that were not enough wage inflation is on the rise too as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed Several States have already begun or are considering a return to work bonus in order to get people to go back to work Don t get me started on housing prices The point being Inflation is everywhere So what happened to bond yields when these numbers came out The 10 Year rose from 1 61 to 1 70 The 30 Year rose from 2 33 to 2 42 Now this may not seem like a lot but the market was not buying the Fed s rhetoric ahead of the inflation numbers and much of the impact was already priced in Taking this into account the 10 Year was 1 47 just four days ago and is now at 1 70 That s a huge move for bonds in such a short space of time The 30 Year was 2 16 last Friday the risk to the upside in the 30 Year yield is capped somewhere between 2 75 3 00 imho Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields I am just ape no financial advice Thanks to David Brady for addendum

with companies like US Steel moving from approximately 6 to 25 and I believe there is plenty of room left to run Given that steel prices have been at all time highs the steel producers have relatively low valuations and other macro factors the stock value for companies like US Steel could double or triple this year High Steel Prices One of the reasons steel producers have flown under the radar and maintained low valuations has been analysts expectations that steel prices wouldn t achieve the levels they have and that they wouldn t stay at these high levels See examples https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 01 27 steel price rally seen under threat on global supply revival https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 01 27 steel price rally seen under threat on global supply revival and https www barrons com articles u s steel stock got a rare double upgrade why it will end in pain 51610139992 https www barrons com articles u s steel stock got a rare double upgrade why it will end in pain 51610139992 However prices have risen over the 1 000 ton peak that some analyst called for at the beginning of the year and touched above 1 600 ton his month The price has pulled back a little to closing out at 1 505 on Friday However looking at forward contracts for steel the price is not expected to fall below 1 000 ton until August 2022 To better understand how high the price of steel currently is see the 10 year chart below amp x200B https preview redd it 4ngegkdxucz61 png width 796 amp format png amp auto webp amp s ac2e3239d6127c1b08471ff1946c0f6098a554a7 In 2018 X share price almost reached 50 share Given where steel prices are now I would expect it to touch that again Low P E The rise in steel prices have caused analysis to raise their earnings forecasts for the steel producers but the stock prices do not appear to fully appreciate these earnings projections For example X is expected to earn approximately 7 95 share in 2021 At a current price of 25 5 X could earn 1 3 of its current share price in 1 year China Is Curbing Production The largest steel producing country in the world is China China s steel production growth over the last 15 years has been one of the main reasons for the demise of the US steel production industry This is why I don t compare what X s steel price was in 2008 when steel prices were 1 2 of what they are today Its just not the same company with China being the biggest player However China has started trying to curb its production with its new green initiative https www scmp com economy china economy article 3132666 china targets air pollution steel overcapacity new curbs https www scmp com economy china economy article 3132666 china targets air pollution steel overcapacity new curbs Time will tell whether China keeps to its climate change goals and cuts its steel production but if it does then we can expect steel prices to remain elevated for a longer period of time Spending Seems To Be Under Control One of the disappointments in the steel industry has been poor management People who have been investing in X in the past remember Mario Longhi and the destruction he did to this company Longhi cut spending when he shouldn t have he rejected new technology upgrades to produce steel and he was in charge while the company s intellectual property was stolen by Chinese companies who now produce steel at a much lower cost Overall Mr Longhi s destruction caused the company to lose its top spot as a steel producer X has a new CEO David Burritt Mr Burritt seems to be doing a good job turning around the company Instead of wasting money on money pits within the company Mr Burritt went out and acquired a new technologically advanced steel mill in Big River Steel The timing of the Big River acquisition has played out to be a very well time investment as steel prices were close to their low at the time of acquisition and have tripled since then Overall the Big River acquisition shows that Mr Burritt is willing to move away from outdated blast furnaces and into lower cost methods of making steel which will help US Steel s future earnings Tariffs and Potential Infrastructure Play As a tailwind for the steel industry President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan which includes major spending on roads bridges pipelines etc It is expected that this will bill will pass even it cannot get Republican support The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated In 2018 President Trump placed 25 tariffs on steel imported from China Contrary to what some believe Biden has made it clear that he is not interested in removing the steel tariffs placed on China This should also help keep steel prices higher for longer Conclusion Overall for the reasons stated above I believe X has the potential to climb 2x 3x within this year if not more There are other companies in this space that I will write my opinion on and explain why all are good investments For example Nucor NUE which I also own is best in class when it comes to steel producers I believe NUE represents a great investment but it has already doubled in the past 3 months I think X has the most room to run and is worth your consideration
