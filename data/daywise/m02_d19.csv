hope all of you fellow degenerates are in good health and spirit Today we saw the House Committee on Financial services address the recent situation on GME I don t know about you guys but for the first time in my life I was excited to watch our government attempt to do their job I got on the subreddit and was met with a similar wave of enthusiasm and interest But I also saw something else Cynicism There s a good chunk of us who don t really believe that congress will do their jobs People went out of their way to point out conflicts of interest and even referred back to 08 People are entitled to their own opinion such is the WSB way But I would like to express how much I disagree with the cynics and how hopeful I am with what has transpired in the financial markets and the world these last few months Individual investors from all across the world shared research data their sentiments and theses with the world here on our forum This community found the opportunity of a lifetime and we held on with conviction and solidarity the likes of which I have never in my life seen before We took on the giants of the financial world and made them taste blood We exposed ONCE AGAIN the dangers of unregulated financial markets and the dangerous levels of leverage these sOpHiStIcAtEd iNvEsToRs use and justify We exposed a systemic risk in the system and we caught the attention of media the world over Even still with shills and bots flooding our home we held With fear uncertainty and doubt sweeping across investors all across the world we held We cost the greedy billions and collectively along with our Institutional long allies made billions in the process We shook the finance world to it s core Some truly savant level autists among us predicted the short squeezes the gamma squeezes the imminent collapse of the financial markets A good chunk of these predictions were accurate I ll link the original prediction posts here if I can find them but in the meanwhile take a look at this https www bloomberg com news videos 2021 02 18 peterffy markets came close to breaking amid gamestop turmoil video https www bloomberg com news videos 2021 02 18 peterffy markets came close to breaking amid gamestop turmoil video That s right We nearly collapsed the entire American financial system All because we spotted the opportunity of a lifetime and held At the end of the day you know what happened This isn t a fairytale and we were screwed out of our ticket to the moon Now before I continue with all this sentimental bullshit lets analyze today s hearing The Hearing Today s hearing was definitely interesting We saw some politicians give in and throw softball questions but we also saw others grow a spine and start turning the screws There was a lot of talk about new financial transaction taxes aiming to take down scalpers HFT s We saw our representatives talk about decentralized finance margin requirements settlement times the conflicts of interest certain firms had and the health and regulation of our financial markets Not everything was good though Like stated earlier some politicians folded and some were outright bribed with campaign contributions by Ken Griffin of Citadel and Vlad Tenev of RH We saw a few fucks even talk about eliminating Dodd Frank regulations on margin For those of you younger autists those were the laws enacted directly following the 08 recession and aimed to limit risk in our markets Overall it s what you expect out of any large group of people there were some upstanding individuals who did their duty and stood by their constituents but there were also spineless kleptocrats who used their position and influence for gain I don t get the cynicism though What did you fucks expect Congress to issue a decree forcing these fuckers to buy back all GameStop shares at 1000 per What matters most is that we brought attention to the underlying issues that plague our financial markets and institutions The fight is long from over but we re making strides in the right direction Change doesn t happen in a day not in a week or even a month Hell when it comes to the change we seek a truly free and fair financial market It s likely going to take years possibly decades to see the fruits of our labor Other things to note Vent about BIG FUCKING PROPS to our boy u deepfuckingvalue Keith if you re reading this homie know that you re an inspiration to us all You had a thesis and stuck with it A truly humble and funny guy Loved going back and watching your YouTube videos and watching you testify today was the highlight of my year Best of luck to you bro whatever you end up doing you ll always be 1 here If it was up to me I d petition whatever religion authorities that give out sainthoods and lobby them to make you the Patron Saint of Retail Traders The movement you started finally started shedding light on the shady tactics used to screw the little guy And we re all the little guy Whether you have 8 figures or 8 dollars Wall Street will try to play you for a sucker I ll cya on the moon homie amp x200B For all the annoying fucks who feel the need to antagonize GameStop investors do the community a favor and shut the fuck up It s our money and we can invest gamble make or lose it however we god damn please No one gives a fuck that you think we re bagholders We had the balls to risk our capital for gain and losses are a risk we take What especially pisses me off is the new people making snide remarks If you weren t here pre GME you don t have the right to call us bagholders The OGs of this sub know bagholders because we learned that shit the hard way holding puts while the economy was recovering or buying calls as it was tanking We ve played more earnings calls than you ve even fucking listened to I m glad you fucks found this sub but try not to be insufferable Here at WSB our mouths water at the opportunity of high risk high reward plays This community used to be smart people acting like retards Now its a community of retards who think they re savants because they paperhanded at the right time or got lucky here and there When someone makes it big we say congrats and fuck you When someone loses big we laugh and tell them why they re retarded If you don t add any value to the conversation in terms of data opinion sentiment or otherwise don t have anything clever or funny to say do us a favor and shut the fuck up Bit unrelated to the earlier stuff but stop sucking off Fidelity They re the institutional investors that sold off their stake and tanked the share price Retail stood strong I get they re a good broker dealer and are leagues ahead of their competitors by all means do business with them but stop sucking them off 24 7 it s annoying Positions GME at cost basis of 27 per share Sold on the way up to lock in some gains but still holding shares because I d sooner see it fall back to 3 than to turn my back on my fellow degenerates Long actually FREE Markets and Short ROPE These were forged in hell WSB eats volatility for breakfast and shits it out by noon Gotta do better than that Wall Street

listing of Butterfly Network Ticker BFLY As I plan to make this a somewhat in depth DD I will try my best to give an overview of what I m going to discuss Firstly an intro to BFLY their business and products Then a look into their future and their valuation what revenue they have and might make in the future along with possible new products I will also give info on investors that are backing the company which will hopefully raise confidence Lastly I will address some possible concerns over the company mods pls no remove it s not a SPAC anymore ty lt 3 Intro to BFLY Butterfly Network Inc is an innovative digital health company that is working to enable universal access to superior medical imaging They specifically work with Ultrasound Technology and develop medical imaging devices for hospitals and organizations to scale their ultrasound programs through a new suite of tools that enables ultrasound workflow along with system integrations that are simple and secure Their plan is to continue creating ultrasounds that are affordable have ease of use and have mobility all while meeting the needs of medical professionals and patients The company s device provides diagnostic imaging and measurement of blood vessels and examines the cardiac abdominal urological fetal gynecological and musculoskeletal systems The company offers Butterfly iQ a handheld and single probe whole body

technology Butterfly network helps transform the many complex processes of the Ultrasound process such as management of devices analytics and storage all into one connected POCUS Point of care

workflow of Butterfly enterprise one of their three products along with the image above demonstrates what their AI can do It can be reasonably be assumed that this will bring a lot of potential customers to take interest in their products as this can not only help make clinical decisions but can improve the efficiency of the entire process just how it s meant to be in the Butterfly workflow How do they make money Butterfly Network currently offers 3 products which are the iQ Ultrasound which is their main product Butterfly Enterprise which offers the greatest workflow and includes the iQ and iQ Vet which is of course for animals and used by vets They each have different payment plans with different perks These payment plans also have recurring subscriptions which allows Butterfly Network to have steady revenue BFLY Pricing https www butterflynetwork com pricing you can take a look at their list of products along with their pricing The medical imaging market As most medical imaging takes place in Hospitals or Niche Doctor Offices and of course imaging centers Butterfly Network plans on expanding the settings where medical imaging takes place such as at home long term care centers retirement homes prehospital and urgent care settings This not only helps grow the market of medical imaging but improves the healthcare system as a whole by increasing access to medical imaging Butterfly currently only has its products being sold in North America and Europe for the time being Now although the Butterfly iQ and their other products can gain market share within the western nations its most lucrative market may be emerging markets in developing nations The market for medical imaging is HUGE In fact 2 3 of the world has no access to medical imaging as well 2 3 of diagnostic dilemmas can be solved addressed by simple imaging This may be one of the reasons why Butterfly has attracted investments from the Bill amp Malinda Gates Foundation So not only is Butterfly Network disrupting an 8 billion global ultrasound market it can for sure expand the market as a whole with its products Official Butterfly Investors Presentation https manual butterflynetwork com Butterfly Network JPM pdf Heavily recommend looking at this quick pres Future Financials and Valuation Processing img vhuo3ghd7ci61 Processing img pkh2v58i7ci61 Butterfly Network is constantly upgrading its hardware and software to innovate as rapidly as possible As seen in the image above they are improving their product by increasing its ease of use and duration of use to improve its productivity They are also improving their software to have greater benefits for the medical professionals using it BFLY also plans to expand its amount of products to further increase revenue in the future They plan on creating new probes along with wearables which allows them to tap into more market share along with different types of markets So not only will new products come out but they will continue to further innovate to make their products better as time goes on Financials There has been a total investment of over 400 million since its first product in 2018 and is expected to have a revenue of 44 million and is projected to grow to 138 million in 2022 They also have 589 million in gross proceeds from Longview Acquisition Corp which was the blank check company that took them on

valuation is some sources say there are 41 4 million shares outstanding while others say there are 164 86 million shares outstanding Once this is clarified we will have a better understanding of its market cap Personally I think that there are 164 86 shares outstanding as during the shareholder vote to bring BFLY onto the market shareholders gave them permission to create new shares to raise capital With 164 86 million shares outstanding and a price of 27 that would give it a valuation of 4 45 Billion While the merger is supposed to valued at 1 5 billion this company has great potential and could be worth 10s of billions in the years to come Investors Butterfly Network is backed by the Bill amp Melinda Gates Foundation along with Baillie Gifford Fidelity Management amp Research Company LLC and Cathie Wood from ARK Investment Management LLC just to name a few investors The main two investors to focus on are Cathie Wood and the Bill amp Melinda Gates Foundation as they focus on finding innovative companies with great potential With their investments I see this as a great sign of them succeeding in the future The Team https preview redd it o1funh7e8ci61 jpg width 1146 amp

Concerns Well firstly is the market cap we currently can t confirm 100 what its valuation is Secondly some people have raised concerns over Bill Gates as an investor Sure he is everywhere and is investing in many companies and while he may not think that they will all succeed I m sure he is still looking for innovative companies and products that can better society as a whole Which is ALWAYS a plus There also isn t enough info that I could find at least on the companies revenue and its profit margin If anyone has more concerns I m willing to edit this section to add more to it Thoughts As BFLY came onto the market recently I feel as if the majority of investors both Institutional and Retail have not been very informed of this company With the market craze how it is whether it s GME PLTR NOK AMC etc I think a similar effect could happen to this company depending on how the market reacts Taking a look at QS an EV battery company also another company back by Bill Gates as soon as it came on the market it only took a few days for it to boom from the 20 range to over 100 I m not telling ANYONE to get in because of this this is just a unique factor that has occurred over the past year with IPOs such as Airbnb ABNB coming to the market at over DOUBLE its valuation amp x200B tl dr Butterfly Network BFLY has innovative technology for medical imaging and has a bright future ahead of them Their business model allows them to grow while having a steady income They are also backed by large investors who believe in their success and their future to change the medical imaging market as a whole amp x200B this is to simply bring awareness to the company and this DD leaves out some info and concerns about the company and merger so take this with a grain of salt Positions About 170

everyone Here is a write up I completed a couple of months ago on one of my high conviction investments Feedback welcome Summary Cumulus Media CMLS is a beaten down radio broadcasting company emerging from bankruptcy with overlooked quality assets and a management team that is taking drastic action to increase shareholder value Base case 300 upside from current prices Overview Cumulus media is the third largest radio broadcasting company in the United states The company owns the broadcast rights to a multitude of local and nationally syndicated content such as the NFL NCAA CNN CNBC and more The company also owns Westwood One the largest audio network in America that features some of the most popular podcasts on Itunes and is experiencing explosive growth with a long runway for expansion Cumulus is a small cap company with a current market cap of 167 MM During the March crash Cumulus fell from 19 to 3 an absurd valuation and hasn t fully recovered Even with the recent run up in price the company currently trades at under 3x TTM FCF History In 2018 Cumulus Media emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy after the previous management team ran the company into the ground with value destroying acquisitions and poor capital allocation The restructuring allowed the company to slash debt in half while reducing the interest rate and extending the nearest maturity to 2026 Since emerging from bankruptcy the new management has made it a top priority to deleverage making over 200 MM of voluntary prepayments in 2019 and completing 2 debt refinancings 2020 Has been a transformative year for Cumulus The company has drastically cut down on fixed expenses and are on their way to 85 MM up from 60 MM estimated in Q1 fixed costs savings in 2020 that will stay consistent In addition the company has been divesting their underutilized and underpriced assets which has both provided excess liquidity for the company as well as bring to light the quality of assets owned by Cumulus In Q2 the company closed on the sale of a 75 acre piece of land in Bethesda MD to Toll Brothers for 74 MM Additionally in Q2 The company entered into an agreement to monetize their tower portfolio and additional assets for 213 MM deal closing in Q4 Virtually all of the proceeds from these two sales will be used for debt paydown and liquidity purposes Additionally management is planning on monetizing a large piece of property in Nashville once commercial real estate activity returns to normal levels estimated to be completed in 2021 The digital audio segment of the company is experiencing massive growth with huge potential for expansion over the next decade The company owns a number of top ranking podcasts with strong personalities who s viewership will only grow over time The company s digital network grew 60 in 2019 and 50 YOY during Q3 Even though digital amounts to only 10 of revenues the company has stated they intend to pursue growth opportunities in the digital space to gradually transition to a primarily digital audio platform The company has also jumped on the smart speaker trend by launching Marketplace Minute a short form news briefing that is primarily consumed through smart speakers Despite the challenges of revenue declines Cumulus has kept operating cash flow positive every quarter this year and is FCF positive YTD This absence of cash burn eases any liquidity concerns and along with the 2 asset sales provides ample cash to continue with additional debt paydown Election season was upon us this year which meant millions of dollars being spent on political advertising some making its way to radio broadcasting Cumulus has benefitted from this political spending since Q2 thanks Bloomberg but Q3 was a record setting quarter with 5 8 MM of political revenue As the bulk of political revenues usually come in Q4 of election years we should be getting an additional boost as well as from the senate runoffs in Georgia where Cumulus holds a strong media presence Senate runoff ad spend in Georgia has already exceeded 80 MM and will continue for another 4 weeks https www motherjones com 2020 elections 2020 11 ad spending georgia senate runoffs https www motherjones com 2020 elections 2020 11 ad spending georgia senate runoffs Pandemic Impact I believe the worst is over in terms of impacts of the global pandemic on the business In Q3 spot revenue exc political increased each month trending towards normalized levels Even though the absence of sporting events such as the Olympics and NCAA march madness resulted in revenue declines during the first half of the year for the most part sports are back in America We now have the NFL and college football managing to play games even with Covid cases present In addition the fact that most sporting events will have no limited in person attendance bodes well for other mediums of spectating such as radio Vehicle travel has also recovered nicely and is almost back to pre Covid levels https www bts gov covid 19 daily vehicle travel https www bts gov covid 19 daily vehicle travel Absent any widespread lockdowns I expect these trends to continue Radio is not dead The gap between perception and reality is often where the best investments are found Despite the notion that the radio industry is dying off data shows that AM FM radio is extremely resilient and not going away anytime soon Weekly reach of radio is higher among ages of 25 54 than both social media and television Even among work from home professionals who have had commute times eliminated 40 listen to radio every day and 75 at least once per week Average time spent on radio has only declined slightly YOY only trailing live TV and smartphones https www nielsen com us en insights report 2020 the nielsen total audience report august 2020 https www nielsen com us en insights report 2020 the nielsen total audience report august 2020 In the past 100 years radio has proven its resiliency and endured the inventions of television the internet and smartphones Even though radio use has been slowly declining for decades it has proven to stay consistent as a medium of consumption Management CEO Mary Berner has a 30 year career working in media and has a history of operational success as CEO of multiple companies before Cumulus When Berner became CEO in 2015 she was tasked with turning a company around with suffocating debt multi year declines in revenues and what was described as a toxic work environment In 5 years she led the company through chapter 11 bankruptcy engaged in massive debt paydown turned around operating performance and drastically improved employee morale Insiders own 12 of outstanding shares and have been taking action to create shareholder value by divesting assets to assist with debt paydown Liquidity The two asset sales this year have put Cumulus in a much better financial position and I believe liquidity risk is now off the table During 2020 Cumulus has cut fixed expenses by over 60 million which will stay consistent going forward Cumulus has remained cash flow positive YTD while making substantial progress on debt paydown The company currently has 353 MM of cash on the balance sheet and net debt has been reduced by 330 MM in 2020 As a result of closing transactions management is guiding for net debt to be in the range of 700 MM by the end of 2020 down from 1 2 Billion at year end 2019 The company has favorable debt terms which include no maturities until 2026 This allows for ample time to prioritize debt paydown without harming growth prospects Assuming normal business conditions return in the next 12 24 months Cumulus will be generating ample FCF to continue deleveraging even without divesting additional assets On November 3rd the company retired 47 2 MM of senior secured bonds continuing to pay down debt aggressively while reducing interest expenses Valuation I believe both liquidity risk and execution risk have largely been mitigated and now the prospective returns simply depend on what multiple the market is willing to price the company at Considering that in 2019 the company largely traded at 5x FCF I see no reason why a leaner more efficient Cumulus wouldn t trade at 8 10x FCF Using TTM FCF this implies a 300 400 increase from the current price of 8 46 I believe this valuation will come within the next couple of years as the company continues to deleverage and execute profitably Investors are also receiving the digital audio segment of the business for free at the current valuation which could provide lottery ticket upside should the market decide to value it comparably to competitors If the digital audio segment of Cumulus was valued the same as a similar company like Spotify at 5x sales the digital audio segment alone would be worth 400 MM more than double the entire market cap of Cumulus Risks Liquidity risk even though I believe Cumulus will have no problem handling their obligations the company is still highly levered which will require continued diligence by management to be resolved Additional lockdowns Even though it seems like there will be no new lockdowns even with cases rising in America any extended shutdown would harm Cumulus due to declines in automobile travel along with potential halting of sporting events Decline in radio use accelerates

s going to happen For some reason it didn t click until I watched 3 hours of c span today The best part is you all know this too Today was actually the first day that I knew I was left out of a market that could change not my future but my childrens and my childrens future And that really hit me And that s why i m here The topic of IPO s and having to have a certain wealth amount in order to get into the game regardless of amount really irritated me I guess I guess I never realized I couldn t necessarily have access to an IPO But apparently I don t and that s pretty garbage and I have the perfect example SpaceX SpaceX DD style I guess and i m drinking correct and I will modify 1 Only anything country organization corporation government retard on the planet that not only has reusable rockets but consistently lands them on fucking drone ships in the ocean then uses them 5 times 2 Because of reusable rockets it s around correct me 60 million a flight VS like 90 million for Soyuz

as we speak to go into space Satellites Space Station etc Probably someone looking for Predator or double checking the lack of flatness of the globe 4 Has the only contract as far as i m aware for NASA to use the Falcon Heavy to launch Artemis missions to the moon The first 2 missions in fact and probably a lot more to come Artemis is the space station that NASA and Co are building to act as a hub for any corporation country or retard to use to go back and forth to the Moon So gt Leave Earth gt Dock at Artemis gt Go to Moon gt Pee gt Go to Artemis gt Bring back pee By pee I mean any natural resource humans can devour from the moon And we will 5 Already scheduled for private tourism in space for 55 million a seat 6 Already building the Falcon Heavy to do everything Moon and Mars They are on SN serial number 9 and 10 They crash a lot but it is rocket science after all Hit up youtube for the video s of their flip maneuver it s tricky But that s only a part of it There s the other part Starlink With SpaceX s rockets they are launching Starlink satellites every month at 60 a pop or sometimes 120 a month It s only a matter of time before they reach all their goals for satellite deployment It s only a matter of time before they transition from ground based stations to satellites using laser communication methods as they are already launching satellites with that capability But why is Starlink a big deal Because it s worldwide low latency high speed internet 1 Starlink is 60X closer than a Hughesnet satellite and that has significant advantages latency being one of them In my experience 90ms is max the cut off for sufficient online gaming play VoIP and video conferencing After it suffers Starlink is already at latency under 35ms in beta It s not perfect because they are still building out their infrastructure but their goal is sub 25ms IIRC Which is more than enough for VoIP video gaming etc This needs to be said loudly SpaceX solved latency via satellite for all purposes This is significant 2 Starlink will serve underserved areas areas of governmental suppression areas of conflict areas of disaster and allow communication to flow in the worst of times It s 911 on steroids 3 Starlink is direction competition to the fat cat Charter douchenozzles types in the rural community Maybe they don t care about it and it seems as if they don t but there is a significant market to be had there competition wise SpaceX is probably in its infancy I think a lot of people look at them as super far along and they are to a point but for my children and my children s children they will become a mature powerhouse of an organization that is leading he world in communications and space transit What irritated me today was I realized that I know all of that I know what SpaceX is likely to become because I just constantly pay attention to it But because of certain income net worth thresholds I cannot invest as early as possibly in a company who I feel is by far and away the next Apple Microsoft Google I ll have to let rich people set the price high then i ll buy what minimal shares I can and make nothing in comparison to what I could have made with an equal part in the market from the beginning I don t know what today will mean in the future Maybe nothing But I did realize for myself that I maybe do know what i m doing and maybe just maybe I am getting fucked over by rich people when my children and childrens children could be in any environment they wish that advances their dreams Instead they will probably not get the opportunity to explore that option And they will not get that opportunity to see if I made a smart decision Because when SpaceX comes out i m going to like the stock But it s not going to mean anything because we re not in the club George Carlin

1005,ln6w7p,t2_63khz,1613709590,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ln6w7p/impression_of_the_hearing/,1,Impression of the Hearing,I watched a large chunk of the meeting and had posted this in the main thread but thought it would help as its own post and cleaned it up a bit When reading watching a replay of the hearing pay attention to the political party and pro vs anti establishment status of the congressman asking the questions and it ll often explain the speed length and difficulty of their questions In normal hearings it s more obvious because the person being questioned is from a clear political side so one side will waste five minutes and the other will attack such as in hearings for judicial nominees or cabinet appointees but in this case it may not be as clear as one party vs the other At the end I ll talk about my conclusions D Meeks wasted 5 minutes with long questions that led nowhere This is common with several congressmen R Huizenga probed Citadel and Robinhood s relationship He also asked DFV if he still believes in Gamestop D Velazquez like Meeks asked two long questions and feels bad for Puerto Rico and wants short positions disclosed R Luetkemeyer directed questions towards everybody and particularly asked if short selling a stock 140 is manipulating a stock and should be limited D Scott wasted time jerking Waters off He then talked about how awful it was that social media drove Gamestop up and wants Robinhood to monitor social media to restrict trading He wants retail traders to only be allowed to trade based on fundamentals as if that s how the market ever worked R Stivers pointed out Robinhood s buying restriction yet still allowing selling may have hurt the price He also wanted Robinhood s arbitration policy clarified but Tenev was unable to do so He also challenged Plotkin on how often he shorts and questioned his Tesla short position and feud with Elon Musk At this point Waters pointed out that NOBODY from the SEC is available because of the new president D Green is wearing a mask alone in his office muffling his voice Despite this he s the first Democrat I saw but not the last ask legitimate questions He asked about how market makers benefit from submitting orders before other investors He also pointed out that Citadel has been fined in the past for this and it sounds like the penalties need to be stiffened as at this point it seems Citadel treats the penalties as the cost of doing business R Barr pointed out that payment for order flow is legal but market makers must provide best execution He also questioned if federal regulation is to blame D Cleaver wasted time and thanked Waters again like Scott He then asked how they picked the name for the app He wants to make sure retail investors won t be overleveraged R Hill jerked Tenev off He asked if they have a call center and if a transaction tax would be good for retail investors He then asked Schulp if WSB should be investigated and she says they should but doesn t think it currently meets the level of manipulation deceptive behavior D Perlmutter asked DFV about his belief in GME DFV said he thought the appropriate price range was in the 20s when he first started investing and the high price it achieved was possible but low in terms of probability Perlmutter then made it clear he doesn t understand how Reddit works Plotkin said he began shorting GME when his fund was founded in 2014 and has never naked shorted the system won t allow it R Zeldin monologued about how great our markets are with their liquidity and easy access He referred to DFV as Roaring Kitty and said our markets greatness let DFV make some Deep Something Value He then attacked China and pointed out that Webull gained a lot of users from this drama and wonders if that s a concern D Himes basically went opposite Zeldin and wants market access restricted to protect the retail investor He then treated Robinhood as an investment in itself and wants to compare it to depositing it in treasury bonds or the S amp P 500 Tenev points out that it should be compared to not investing at all My opinion is Tenev is right on this as it s common knowledge that most people won t beat the S amp P 500 by actively investing so this comparison would obviously make Robinhood look bad R Loudermilk expressed his opinion that this hearing is all about making sure the market can be regulated harsher He thinks that if Robinhood acted under regulations then it s the regulations fault and if something is to change then the answer is less regulation not more At this point Waters pointed out that there s many hearings coming and new regulations will be made after that D Foster pointed out that institutional investors are required by law to be provided execution quality data and compare competitors while retail investors are not required by law to receive that data and currently Robinhood only shows how its own execution quality has improved not how it compared to other trading firms Basically he argued that Robinhood is advertising its execution quality has risen from terrible to just bad R Mooney pointed out that Democrats are pushing for a financial transaction tax It will tax the sale of stocks bonds and derivatives at 0 1 percent According to Schulp the tax would not deter fraud nor manipulation it just distorts the market and hurts individual investors and reaching their retirement goals This is most likely the end goal of these hearings D Beatty challenged Robinhood s selling of order flow Back in 2004 Citadel filed to restrict payment for order flow when it came to options trading He clarified that equities and options trading are different R Davidson talked about Project Ion and using b l o c k c h a i n had to type it weird to bypass filter for real time trading He also asked if investors should be able to restrict their shares from being borrowed for shorting and about resolving the issue of infinitely lending the same shares He ended his time by congratulating DFV for his diamond hands D Vargas believed WSB spread anti Semitism this was from before I started watching but apparently Reddit denied this occurred He then talked about the story of Robin Hood and jokes that Robinhood in this case stopped retail investors from saving Gamestop He disagreed with Republicans calling them heartless and that they re helping Robinhood that government regulation made Robinhood restrict trading He asked Griffin if anybody in Citadel told Robinhood to stop trading Gamestop and Griffin says no R Budd asked how Robinhood helps retail investors Tenev then goes off on a list of ways Budd disagreed with Democrats that retail investors are dumb money D Gottheimer wanted to know how Reddit authenticates users and wants to make sure users can tell what posts are legit or not He wants fake users and bots taken care of R Kustoff asked how Robinhood could ve misjudged their capital requirements Tenev said it was an extraordinary event and owns what happened in terms of restricting buying to meet regulations He provided a table in his written testimony to show this D Gonzalez challenged the Robinhood Citadel relationship and Citadel s part in the clearinghouse process He also asks DFV is he s ever faced a trading restriction he hasn t and asks Huffman if WSB acts against Reddit policy Huffman says the mods are doing an excellent job R Hollingsworth asked about how markets work to Griffin Griffin said he wants reduced tick size to encourage trading volume to move to exchanges and lessen dark pools D Lawson said back in his day people spent money on rent they didn t invest He asked Plotkin if there s inequality in the markets He challenged Plotkin on how could tiny retail investors manipulate a market Plotkin said he doesn t think short interest will ever go as high on a company and that they ll monitor social media as the retail investors action with Gamestop has scared institutional investors R Gonzalez challenged Tenev on the specific timing of the liquidity problem and Robinhood s reaction He pointed out that investors can t trust a company that might liquidate their shares when it helps the company but not the investors and that retail investors are blocked out from a lot of investment opportunities He ended with a shoutout to DFV D San Nicolas applauded retail investors for what they did He asked Tenev where the 3B capital infusion came from Tenev claimed it came mostly from previous venture capitalists and has diluted his interest in the company San Nicolas points out that Robinhood benefited from what happened Robinhood restricted buying but not selling to help itself fulfill capital requirements not to protect retail investors I watched further but at this point my internet or Reddit wasn t letting me update my comment Of note was Tlaib yelling for five minutes about why we need a financial transaction tax and AOC wasted a bit of time with her first question but was about to get to the good stuff when technical difficulties led to her time ending Several other Democrats also supported the financial transaction tax and protecting retail investors Conclusions Congressmen varied throughout both parties on how much they wanted to challenge the players involved vs push for other issues It appeared the opinions towards DFV ranged from neutral to supportive Tenev seemed to draw the majority of the questioning He seems to be the sacrificial lamb while Melvin Capital and Citadel skated by with a lot less questions Some Democrats used the hearing to push for the financial transaction tax This tax acts as a percentage commission on all equity purchases and would be set at 01 meaning you instantly make a loss when you buy stock and then could end up selling it for a loss This is very dangerous because taxes always start low and then they ratchet up as Democrats heavily pushed the idea that nobody poor trades so anybody trading could afford it Some Democrats also pushed for regulation restrictions on retail traders to protect them such as increasing income education requirements to trade Some Republicans pushed for deregulation however it wasn t clear if SEC regulations led to Robinhood s situation or just clearinghouse rules

Melvin s SEC Filing Led Me To the Answer Why GME at 40 Matters Tomorrow I ve been racking my brain trying to figure out what s going on with the options and why shorts weren t worried about the share deliveries from contracts expiring tomorrow While trying to work it out I ve been waiting for the quarterly SEC Filing from Melvin and we finally got it on Feb 16 On 2 16 21 Melvin reported a 6 000 000 share Put holding on GME That is how they planned on covering this and how I ve been saying the shorts could have wormed their way out of this calamity every time someone posts they had no way out Yah actually they did sadly Filing https fintel io so us gme melvin capital management lp So I went digging in the time machine to see what contracts were available on the option chain as seen on 12 31 20 And come to find out the strike max on any contracts even all the way out to 2023 was 40 max https i imgur com PAvhWw9 jpg Now here s where I smelled the Fuckery cooking On 1 27 21 CNBC reported that Melvin capital closed out their short position that Tuesday the 26th for a huge loss Tuesday would be the delivery date for the 1 22 21 options after T 2 so it makes sense on the surface Except that the highest strike price option available for purchase on or before 12 31 20 was 40 And 1 22 21 closed at 65 01 There is zero way for any options that Melvin owned in December to have exercised to cover his shares on the 26th If Melvin went to market to buy the shares outright 1 26 21 closed at 147 98 Even if he covered every share at max price 147 98 x 6 000 000 the number they were hedging would only equal 887 880 000 So why the 3bil injection of funds Routers claims that Melvin started January with 12 5bil in capital and that it dropped to 5bil capital during the GME run and ended at 8bil to close the month after the 3bil Citadel P72 bailout https www reuters com article us retail trading melvin idUSKBN2A00KW If they closed out on that Tuesday for 880mil where did they lose the extra 7 5bil at Even if they only hedged half their bet and had 12 000 000 short positions to close it would still only be 1 8bil on that Tuesday Much closer to the 3bil bailout admittedly They would have had to have been short 24 000 000 shares to lose 3bil So why only hedge 6 000 000 of it Here s where it gets extra deep into the Fuckery The option contracts available on 12 31 20 go from 2 12 21 2 19 21 4 16 21 They jump 2 months between contracts and February 19 is the last exercise date available from a 12 31 20 purchase until April https i imgur com Ut6rpea jpg And the highest strike available to buy was you guessed it 40 Tomorrow is the last day until April for those old 40 Put Call options to finish in the money Any firm that tried to hedge their shorts with puts even with max strike contracts loses their Put options if the price finishes over 40 tomorrow GME short of volume was 26 Tuesday 23 yesterday and 21 today One out of every Four shares sold this week has been a short and now we know why If GME finishes over 40 tomorrow any firm that was trying to cover their shorts through 40 Put options from December or before would be stuck buying shares to cover until April Any theta gang Call seller that posted 40 max strikes to collect Premium in December is also on the 40 line this week But they d need to purchase shares or lose them if they were covered and still own them theta gang sold their shares at 400 knowing they could buy them later for less trust me Now I do realize that Melvin held 6 000 000 shares worth of options and that there s less than 20 000 open interest less than 14 000 now that I look Over 4 000 have been taken off the chain in the last 48 hours but this explains the mad dash to 40 The calls don t want to get exercised on and the puts want their shares They want it to 40 so badly they ve shorted an extra 8 000 000 shares this week alone What I don t understand is why those 1 800 000 shares are so important We had 24 000 000 in volume today They could easily snipe 2mil shares in the course of a day or two Unless all of the volume these last few weeks has been entirely the funds trading back and forth and there s a LOT less public float than we thought There was a post earlier of a level 2 order page being constantly hit with 1 share and 0 yes zero share orders I m starting to think that they are trading volume back and forth at the third fourth decimal point with each other Retail brokers can only do shares in two decimal prices ie 420 69 but market makers and the exchanges go to the third and sometimes fourth decimal point The firms could be trading back and forth on the books so it affects volume at a decimal place that retail isn t allowed to access Brokers and market makers have a responsibility to give buyers the best whole cent price but scalping the spread is how the market makers take profit from order flows and how you get zero commission trades It could also be used as a loophole to keep retail from buying the shares that the firms are swapping If the bid is 419 99 and a firm is selling at the price of 420 0005 but it would cost a retail buyer 420 01 since we can only deal in whole cents it would allow another firm to snatch the shares ahead of retail between the spread They would just enter a buy limit down to the 0005 decimal point and take whatever small 420 00 shares are listed on the order book with it It would only cost 500 to add 1 000 000 in volume to the trading day at 0 0005 share plus whatever shares they bought ahead of it I ve been watching the level 2s from three different brokers and there s never more than 20 orders total on the books for GME at any given time and at least two of those are 6969 69 meme asks Retail isn t selling and I ve never seen a 100k sell order on a book from an institutional holder So the volume is coming from somewhere we don t have access to even though it s counted in the daily trading volume I m starting to think they are spoofing volume to make the market think shares are trading when the pool is virtually dry in reality This shit keeps getting weirder To close I actually do think Melvin is out His Put volume that is no longer seen on the option chain and his cash infusion both point to that happening I do think others are fighting to finally dig themselves out of this hole and tomorrow is their last chance and I think they ve been digging themselves deeper to try to make that happen 460 000 shares are up for Call assignment if it stays above 40 tomorrow and 1 370 000 Put shares don t get delivered if it stays above 40 tomorrow That s 72 000 000 in shares that are being fought over just at the 40 mark Another 1 200 000 put shares deliver under 48 and another 1 300 000 deliver under 50 What I don t understand though GME hit 48 during DFVs opening statement and then we got hit with 4 000 000 short sale orders over the course of the rest of the day finra Who shorts 160 000 000 to secure 72 000 000 in options Interest on shorts rose from 1 08 Tuesday to 1 35 today They ve been adding more shorts by the day Why are they shorting it so hard right after a mini squeeze just happened and they know we aren t selling Open interest for 40 Puts on 2 26 21 drops off a cliff to 2 600 open contracts There is something very special about this weeks options but I don t have the entire picture of what or why yet 2 week delays in reporting are garbage for knowing the market today Unless they know the shares aren t really there on the market to buy Oh in other news Jane Street just reported owning 1 500 000 in GME call shares and 1 070 000 in Put shares Https fintel io so us gme jane street group llc Jane Street Capital was the market maker that helped save the bond ETFs last year during the crash When they step in to a large position there s often a reason behind it I don t think this story is done being written yet I m starting to think that those options are the last chance to get shares out of a dry pool Edit for Tl dr I think there s no shares on the market and the funds have been spoofing volume The 2 19 21 options are the last options available to exercise from before the squeeze until April The highest strike available on those contracts at the time was 40 Jane Street has 2 5mil in shares through option contracts somewhere on the chain Jane Street is known for helping market liquidity during Oh Fuck situations This is affecting the market way more than just GME We just haven t seen how or why yet

amp x200B This is total speculation and an optimistically driven theory of PLTRs master plan to strategically assonate the paper hands fake news bears and their stock value in the process This theory has a lot of fucking words so those who are sheep who only read posts with no thought move on now This theory of tactical strategy is related to the recent earnings report shitstorm sell off and eye of the tornado Lock Up Period upon us This concept is not written in an attempt to build group momentum or give advise as to why you should or should not LIKE THE STOCK If you see the logic and like it great if not maybe you laugh at concept if not all good Nothing changes Everyone has come to their own conclusion at this point and this one would be out of an Oceans 11 movie I have watched and participated in PLTR from the point of Pre IPO offering This is a out of the box radical thought based on the historic and current macro and micro factors surrounding the stock SMART people run and work for PLTR These people are true tacticians and strategic assassins Their entire value proposition is based on developing solutions that leverage pattern and randomly occurring situations with the sole mission of increasing the probability of the desired optimal outcome A logical play for a true strategist The algorithm building pattern modeling ninja scientist at PLTR could should be 10 steps ahead of every paper hands bear and market manipulator in the game They could have modeled out a world class strategy which could look like this amp x200B SET THE STAGE Time lock up expiration at the stupidest time possible directly after an end of year earnings report amp x200B POKE THE BEARS A Optically engineer a factual but self deprecating earnings report triggering the fake news and naysayers on the heels of highly concerning and strategically timed lock up period expiration 3 days apart from each other Coincidence Why the hell would they make lockup 3 days later while delivering very conservative guidance which they knew would dent the stock B During earnings Karp basically told short term traders to fuck off amp x200B INITIATE THE TORNADO Poking the bear triggers every fake news outlet push thier masters doom and gloom narritive and send the stock into a parabolic sell off amp x200B SLICE THROATS The nucualar death spiral of the stock flushes all the short term cash mongers and paperhand bitches right down the toilet Those who are not long term believers in the PLTR domination plan do not get a seat on the rocket amp x200B RALLY THE TROOPS The significant sell off we have witnessed over the past few days prompts smart institutional money to step off the sidelines They have vindictively bashed the stock value from day 1 angry about PLTR direct listing that fucked them out of skimming fat during a conventional IPO reluctantly didn t jump on or enough in the 1st few months as it went through roof amp x200B LUCKY TIMING NOT PART OF STRATEGY OR Die Hard Diamond Handed WSB TARDS shift attention from deflated GME and weed stocks with the loose change from the seats of their girlfriends boyfriends sisters car and load up on more fractional lotto tickets to board the rocket ship to Valhalla amp x200B FUEL THE They buy the fuck out of the blood bath sell off happening right now Any significant stock holder at the company is not the same as the pack of bus boys on this sub gambling their stimmi checks and unpaid rent they are trying to screw their landlord out of These people are educated specialists who are paid real money Beyond this 1 They know the stock has runway and have seen it 30 higher two week ago 2 They had the ability to sell off 20 of their holdings for a while and I would bet that many of them 5X d that equity from pre public list and took only a portion of their rip off the table That money is being used to buy stock again during this purge of paper pussy willows amp x200B INITIATE LAUNCH gt total wild speculation with no fact based merit lt This would be the key part of the plan Next week announce rumored Facebook ATT and or other major contracts Perfect timing after the highly anticipated Q4 earnings and concerning lock up period is dust in the wind cheap fuel is reloaded at discount gas station and paperhand punks ran home to mommy amp x200B BLAST TO MARS Ride their tactically created Space X lunar equity rocket ship from 26 to faster than you can fill your put contract sells on RH that expired worthless amp x200B PRINT TENDIES END OF THIS PLAY At Mars they sell nothing or a small portion of their newly unlocked 80 remaining equity in company which hit multiple moons with rapid speed amp x200B SUMMARY I m no PLTR Osama catching strategic data scientist If I can dream this up who knows what they could should may have been cooking up over there Or they don t give fuck about money and just want to code cool software amp x200B HATERS I know all naysayers will argue fundamentals technicals 50X earnings value heavy gov contract reliance blah blah blah I sell over priced expensive shit for a living Value is what someone is willing to buy and sell for Right now we are in eye of storm Even if the Seal Team 6 master strategy plan outlined above has the same probability as GME going back to a price remotley close to getting this sub out of the RED I am a diamond hand PLTR believer until this shit

Answer Why GME at 40 Matters Tomorrow I ve been racking my brain trying to figure out what s going on with the options and why shorts weren t worried about the share deliveries from contracts expiring tomorrow While trying to work it out I ve been waiting for the quarterly SEC Filing from Melvin and we finally got it on Feb 16 On 2 16 21 Melvin reported a 6 000 000 share Put holding on GME That is how they planned on covering this and how I ve been saying the shorts could have wormed their way out of this calamity every time someone posts they had no way out Yah actually they did sadly Filing https fintel io so us gme melvin capital management lp So I went digging in the time machine to see what contracts were available on the option chain as seen on 12 31 20 And come to find out the strike max on any contracts even all the way out to 2023 was 40 max https i imgur com PAvhWw9 jpg Now here s where I smelled the Fuckery cooking On 1 27 21 CNBC reported that Melvin capital closed out their short position that Tuesday the 26th for a huge loss Tuesday would be the delivery date for the 1 22 21 options after T 2 so it makes sense on the surface Except that the highest strike price option available for purchase on or before 12 31 20 was 40 And 1 22 21 closed at 65 01 There is zero way for any options that Melvin owned in December to have exercised to cover his shares on the 26th If Melvin went to market to buy the shares outright 1 26 21 closed at 147 98 Even if he covered every share at max price 147 98 x 6 000 000 the number they were hedging would only equal 887 880 000 So why the 3bil injection of funds Routers claims that Melvin started January with 12 5bil in capital and that it dropped to 5bil capital during the GME run and ended at 8bil to close the month after the 3bil Citadel P72 bailout https www reuters com article us retail trading melvin idUSKBN2A00KW If they closed out on that Tuesday for 880mil where did they lose the extra 7 5bil at Even if they only hedged half their bet and had 12 000 000 short positions to close it would still only be 1 8bil on that Tuesday Much closer to the 3bil bailout admittedly They would have had to have been short 24 000 000 shares to lose 3bil So why only hedge 6 000 000 of it Here s where it gets extra deep into the Fuckery The option contracts available on 12 31 20 go from 2 12 21 2 19 21 4 16 21 They jump 2 months between contracts and February 19 is the last exercise date available from a 12 31 20 purchase until April https i imgur com Ut6rpea jpg And the highest strike available to buy was you guessed it 40 Tomorrow is the last day until April for those old 40 Put Call options to finish in the money Any firm that tried to hedge their shorts with puts even with max strike contracts loses their Put options if the price finishes over 40 tomorrow GME short of volume was 26 Tuesday 23 yesterday and 21 today One out of every Four shares sold this week has been a short and now we know why If GME finishes over 40 tomorrow any firm that was trying to cover their shorts through 40 Put options from December or before would be stuck buying shares to cover until April Any theta gang Call seller that posted 40 max strikes to collect Premium in December is also on the 40 line this week But they d need to purchase shares or lose them if they were covered and still own them theta gang sold their shares at 400 knowing they could buy them later for less trust me Now I do realize that Melvin held 6 000 000 shares worth of options and that there s less than 20 000 open interest less than 14 000 now that I look Over 4 000 have been taken off the chain in the last 48 hours but this explains the mad dash to 40 The calls don t want to get exercised on and the puts want their shares They want it to 40 so badly they ve shorted an extra 8 000 000 shares this week alone What I don t understand is why those 1 800 000 shares are so important We had 24 000 000 in volume today They could easily snipe 2mil shares in the course of a day or two Unless all of the volume these last few weeks has been entirely the funds trading back and forth and there s a LOT less public float than we thought There was a post earlier of a level 2 order page being constantly hit with 1 share and 0 yes zero share orders I m starting to think that they are trading volume back and forth at the third fourth decimal point with each other Retail brokers can only do shares in two decimal prices ie 420 69 but market makers and the exchanges go to the third and sometimes fourth decimal point The firms could be trading back and forth on the books so it affects volume at a decimal place that retail isn t allowed to access Brokers and market makers have a responsibility to give buyers the best whole cent price but scalping the spread is how the market makers take profit from order flows and how you get zero commission trades It could also be used as a loophole to keep retail from buying the shares that the firms are swapping If the bid is 419 99 and a firm is selling at the price of 420 0005 but it would cost a retail buyer 420 01 since we can only deal in whole cents it would allow another firm to snatch the shares ahead of retail between the spread They would just enter a buy limit down to the 0005 decimal point and take whatever small 420 00 shares are listed on the order book with it It would only cost 500 to add 1 000 000 in volume to the trading day at 0 0005 share plus whatever shares they bought ahead of it I ve been watching the level 2s from three different brokers and there s never more than 20 orders total on the books for GME at any given time and at least two of those are 6969 69 meme asks Retail isn t selling and I ve never seen a 100k sell order on a book from an institutional holder So the volume is coming from somewhere we don t have access to even though it s counted in the daily trading volume I m starting to think they are spoofing volume to make the market think shares are trading when the pool is virtually dry in reality This shit keeps getting weirder To close I actually do think Melvin is out His Put volume that is no longer seen on the option chain and his cash infusion both point to that happening I do think others are fighting to finally dig themselves out of this hole and tomorrow is their last chance and I think they ve been digging themselves deeper to try to make that happen 460 000 shares are up for Call assignment if it stays above 40 tomorrow and 1 370 000 Put shares don t get delivered if it stays above 40 tomorrow That s 72 000 000 in shares that are being fought over just at the 40 mark Another 1 200 000 put shares deliver under 48 and another 1 300 000 deliver under 50 What I don t understand though GME hit 48 during DFVs opening statement and then we got hit with 4 000 000 short sale orders over the course of the rest of the day finra Who shorts 160 000 000 to secure 72 000 000 in options Interest on shorts rose from 1 08 Tuesday to 1 35 today They ve been adding more shorts by the day Why are they shorting it so hard right after a mini squeeze just happened and they know we aren t selling Open interest for 40 Puts on 2 26 21 drops off a cliff to 2 600 open contracts There is something very special about this weeks options but I don t have the entire picture of what or why yet 2 week delays in reporting are garbage for knowing the market today Unless they know the shares aren t really there on the market to buy Oh in other news Jane Street just reported owning 1 500 000 in GME call shares and 1 070 000 in Put shares Https fintel io so us gme jane street group llc Jane Street Capital was the market maker that helped save the bond ETFs last year during the crash When they step in to a large position there s often a reason behind it I don t think this story is done being written yet I m starting to think that those options are the last chance to get shares out of a dry pool Edit for Tl dr I think there s no shares on the market and the funds have been spoofing volume The 2 19 21 options are the last options available to exercise from before the squeeze until April The highest strike available on those contracts at the time was 40 Jane Street has 2 5mil in shares through option contracts somewhere on the chain Jane Street is known for helping market liquidity during Oh Fuck situations This is affecting the market way more than just GME We just haven t seen how or why yet

now so no one sees this ,Not that I think he ll do anything but just in case I m posting when no one will see lmao Here s some DD Melvin s SEC Filing Led Me To the Answer Why GME at 40 Matters Tomorrow I ve been racking my brain trying to figure out what s going on with the options and why shorts weren t worried about the share deliveries from contracts expiring tomorrow While trying to work it out I ve been waiting for the quarterly SEC Filing from Melvin and we finally got it on Feb 16 On 2 16 21 Melvin reported a 6 000 000 share Put holding on GME That is how they planned on covering this and how I ve been saying the shorts could have wormed their way out of this calamity every time someone posts they had no way out Yah actually they did sadly Filing https fintel io so us gme melvin capital management lp So I went digging in the time machine to see what contracts were available on the option chain as seen on 12 31 20 And come to find out the strike max on any contracts even all the way out to 2023 was 40 max https i imgur com PAvhWw9 jpg Now here s where I smelled the Fuckery cooking On 1 27 21 CNBC reported that Melvin capital closed out their short position that Tuesday the 26th for a huge loss Tuesday would be the delivery date for the 1 22 21 options after T 2 so it makes sense on the surface Except that the highest strike price option available for purchase on or before 12 31 20 was 40 And 1 22 21 closed at 65 01 There is zero way for any options that Melvin owned in December to have exercised to cover his shares on the 26th If Melvin went to market to buy the shares outright 1 26 21 closed at 147 98 Even if he covered every share at max price 147 98 x 6 000 000 the number they were hedging would only equal 887 880 000 So why the 3bil injection of funds Routers claims that Melvin started January with 12 5bil in capital and that it dropped to 5bil capital during the GME run and ended at 8bil to close the month after the 3bil Citadel P72 bailout https www reuters com article us retail trading melvin idUSKBN2A00KW If they closed out on that Tuesday for 880mil where did they lose the extra 7 5bil at Even if they only hedged half their bet and had 12 000 000 short positions to close it would still only be 1 8bil on that Tuesday Much closer to the 3bil bailout admittedly They would have had to have been short 24 000 000 shares to lose 3bil So why only hedge 6 000 000 of it Here s where it gets extra deep into the Fuckery The option contracts available on 12 31 20 go from 2 12 21 2 19 21 4 16 21 They jump 2 months between contracts and February 19 is the last exercise date available from a 12 31 20 purchase until April https i imgur com Ut6rpea jpg And the highest strike available to buy was you guessed it 40 Tomorrow is the last day until April for those old 40 Put Call options to finish in the money Any firm that tried to hedge their shorts with puts even with max strike contracts loses their Put options if the price finishes over 40 tomorrow GME short of volume was 26 Tuesday 23 yesterday and 21 today One out of every Four shares sold this week has been a short and now we know why If GME finishes over 40 tomorrow any firm that was trying to cover their shorts through 40 Put options from December or before would be stuck buying shares to cover until April Any theta gang Call seller that posted 40 max strikes to collect Premium in December is also on the 40 line this week But they d need to purchase shares or lose them if they were covered and still own them theta gang sold their shares at 400 knowing they could buy them later for less trust me Now I do realize that Melvin held 6 000 000 shares worth of options and that there s less than 20 000 open interest less than 14 000 now that I look Over 4 000 have been taken off the chain in the last 48 hours but this explains the mad dash to 40 The calls don t want to get exercised on and the puts want their shares They want it to 40 so badly they ve shorted an extra 8 000 000 shares this week alone What I don t understand is why those 1 800 000 shares are so important We had 24 000 000 in volume today They could easily snipe 2mil shares in the course of a day or two Unless all of the volume these last few weeks has been entirely the funds trading back and forth and there s a LOT less public float than we thought There was a post earlier of a level 2 order page being constantly hit with 1 share and 0 yes zero share orders I m starting to think that they are trading volume back and forth at the third fourth decimal point with each other Retail brokers can only do shares in two decimal prices ie 420 69 but market makers and the exchanges go to the third and sometimes fourth decimal point The firms could be trading back and forth on the books so it affects volume at a decimal place that retail isn t allowed to access Brokers and market makers have a responsibility to give buyers the best whole cent price but scalping the spread is how the market makers take profit from order flows and how you get zero commission trades It could also be used as a loophole to keep retail from buying the shares that the firms are swapping If the bid is 419 99 and a firm is selling at the price of 420 0005 but it would cost a retail buyer 420 01 since we can only deal in whole cents it would allow another firm to snatch the shares ahead of retail between the spread They would just enter a buy limit down to the 0005 decimal point and take whatever small 420 00 shares are listed on the order book with it It would only cost 500 to add 1 000 000 in volume to the trading day at 0 0005 share plus whatever shares they bought ahead of it I ve been watching the level 2s from three different brokers and there s never more than 20 orders total on the books for GME at any given time and at least two of those are 6969 69 meme asks Retail isn t selling and I ve never seen a 100k sell order on a book from an institutional holder So the volume is coming from somewhere we don t have access to even though it s counted in the daily trading volume I m starting to think they are spoofing volume to make the market think shares are trading when the pool is virtually dry in reality This shit keeps getting weirder To close I actually do think Melvin is out His Put volume that is no longer seen on the option chain and his cash infusion both point to that happening I do think others are fighting to finally dig themselves out of this hole and tomorrow is their last chance and I think they ve been digging themselves deeper to try to make that happen 460 000 shares are up for Call assignment if it stays above 40 tomorrow and 1 370 000 Put shares don t get delivered if it stays above 40 tomorrow That s 72 000 000 in shares that are being fought over just at the 40 mark Another 1 200 000 put shares deliver under 48 and another 1 300 000 deliver under 50 What I don t understand though GME hit 48 during DFVs opening statement and then we got hit with 4 000 000 short sale orders over the course of the rest of the day finra Who shorts 160 000 000 to secure 72 000 000 in options Interest on shorts rose from 1 08 Tuesday to 1 35 today They ve been adding more shorts by the day Why are they shorting it so hard right after a mini squeeze just happened and they know we aren t selling Open interest for 40 Puts on 2 26 21 drops off a cliff to 2 600 open contracts There is something very special about this weeks options but I don t have the entire picture of what or why yet 2 week delays in reporting are garbage for knowing the market today Unless they know the shares aren t really there on the market to buy Oh in other news Jane Street just reported owning 1 500 000 in GME call shares and 1 070 000 in Put shares Https fintel io so us gme jane street group llc Jane Street Capital was the market maker that helped save the bond ETFs last year during the crash When they step in to a large position there s often a reason behind it I don t think this story is done being written yet I m starting to think that those options are the last chance to get shares out of a dry pool Edit for Tl dr I think there s no shares on the market and the funds have been spoofing volume The 2 19 21 options are the last options available to exercise from before the squeeze until April The highest strike available on those contracts at the time was 40 Jane Street has 2 5mil in shares through option contracts somewhere on the chain Jane Street is known for helping market liquidity during Oh Fuck situations This is affecting the market way more than just GME We just haven t seen how or why yet Not my original post

here and am like all us wondering why momentum didn t push after DFV YESTERDAY found it interesting hope you enjoy I ll leave the explanations to the smart apes Melvin s SEC Filing Led Me To the Answer Why GME at 40 Matters Tomorrow I ve been racking my brain trying to figure out what s going on with the options and why shorts weren t worried about the share deliveries from contracts expiring tomorrow While trying to work it out I ve been waiting for the quarterly SEC Filing from Melvin and we finally got it on Feb 16 On 2 16 21 Melvin reported a 6 000 000 share Put holding on GME That is how they planned on covering this and how I ve been saying the shorts could have wormed their way out of this calamity every time someone posts they had no way out Yah actually they did sadly Filing https fintel io so us gme melvin capital management lp So I went digging in the time machine to see what contracts were available on the option chain as seen on 12 31 20 And come to find out the strike max on any contracts even all the way out to 2023 was 40 max https i imgur com PAvhWw9 jpg Now here s where I smelled the ery cooking On 1 27 21 CNBC reported that Melvin capital closed out their short position that Tuesday the 26th for a huge loss Tuesday would be the delivery date for the 1 22 21 options after T 2 so it makes sense on the surface Except that the highest strike price option available for purchase on or before 12 31 20 was 40 And 1 22 21 closed at 65 01 There is zero way for any options that Melvin owned in December to have exercised to cover his shares on the 26th If Melvin went to market to buy the shares outright 1 26 21 closed at 147 98 Even if he covered every share at max price 147 98 x 6 000 000 the number they were hedging would only equal 887 880 000 So why the 3bil injection of funds Routers claims that Melvin started January with 12 5bil in capital and that it dropped to 5bil capital during the GME run and ended at 8bil to close the month after the 3bil Citadel P72 bailout https www reuters com article us retail trading melvin idUSKBN2A00KW If they closed out on that Tuesday for 880mil where did they lose the extra 7 5bil at Even if they only hedged half their bet and had 12 000 000 short positions to close it would still only be 1 8bil on that Tuesday Much closer to the 3bil bailout admittedly They would have had to have been short 24 000 000 shares to lose 3bil So why only hedge 6 000 000 of it Here s where it gets extra deep into the ery The option contracts available on 12 31 20 go from 2 12 212 19 214 16 21They jump 2 months between contracts and February 19 is the last exercise date available from a 12 31 20 purchase until April https i imgur com Ut6rpea jpg And the highest strike available to buy was you guessed it 40 Tomorrow is the last day until April for those old 40 Put Call options to finish in the money Any firm that tried to hedge their shorts with puts even with max strike contracts loses their Put options if the price finishes over 40 tomorrow GME short of volume was 26 Tuesday 23 yesterday and 21 today One out of every Four shares sold this week has been a short and now we know why If GME finishes over 40 tomorrow any firm that was trying to cover their shorts through 40 Put options from December or before would be stuck buying shares to cover until April Any theta gang Call seller that posted 40 max strikes to collect Premium in December is also on the 40 line this week But they d need to purchase shares or lose them if they were covered and still own them theta gang sold their shares at 400 knowing they could buy them later for less trust me Now I do realize that Melvin held 6 000 000 shares worth of options and that there s less than 20 000 open interest less than 14 000 now that I look Over 4 000 have been taken off the chain in the last 48 hours but this explains the mad dash to 40 The calls don t want to get exercised on and the puts want their shares They want it to 40 so badly they ve shorted an extra 8 000 000 shares this week alone What I don t understand is why those 1 800 000 shares are so important We had 24 000 000 in volume today They could easily snipe 2mil shares in the course of a day or two Unless all of the volume these last few weeks has been entirely the funds trading back and forth and there s a LOT less public float than we thought There was a post earlier of a level 2 order page being constantly hit with 1 share and 0 yes zero share orders I m starting to think that they are trading volume back and forth at the third fourth decimal point with each other Retail brokers can only do shares in two decimal prices ie 420 69 but market makers and the exchanges go to the third and sometimes fourth decimal point The firms could be trading back and forth on the books so it affects volume at a decimal place that retail isn t allowed to access

to the people who talk about this without understanding these are the people who AFFECTED the market I m going to go from top to bottom on who had the biggest roles This isn t saying they did this with without purpose but clearly the people who need to be asked questions are not being asked FUCKING SEC the worst thing to do in any scenario ever is nothing As the people who are supposed to protect regulate and carefully analyze flaws in our market so far their communication has been below piss fucking poor in wtf they re actually doing and what they actually could know Their data has been proven flawed countless times and their statements non direct and very conflicting This could very well mean they re corrupt until they do something to actually give individual investors some form of help and to actually enforce their laws on larger institutions RATHER THAN LET THE INSTITUTIONS HANDLE IT LIKE THE FRICKEN DTCC SPEAKING OF The DTCC these guys right here right Yeah remember them when the next Great Depression hits Why Cuz this is a group of banks that practically run the market That whole stunt that happen with GME was an effect of their doing THEY ARE THE ROOT OF THIS PROBLEM NOT ROBINHOOD The DTCC were the ones that made it so brokers were forced to pay the entire stock value upfront normally that is not the case it s usually a smaller percentage however due to the large volatility and large flux in purchased stocks they immediately hit brokers like RH with capital demands and they have legal legislation at anytime to for stocks being bought This number was obviously above what Robinhood could give and their only option out Shut it down But not SHUT IT DOWN allll the way Just buying The reason We don t know but because of their actions all the brokers who couldnt meet this capital or need such had one choice The buy button was removed till further notice Now normally when a stock is doing something questionable or rocking the market boat they stop EVERYTHING NOT JUST BUYING That s to be fair for EVERYONE But because of that all the buying pressure was removed and caused GameStop to fall back closer to it s original TP The worst part of it all The DTCC is primarily made up extremely large banks and work with money IN THE FUCKING TRILLIONS and rather than SEC do SECS job the DTCC did it in its own way If anything we need to ask them questions for atleast the next week as to wtf is going on over there and why and that they either need to keep their hands off or show 100 transparency Melvin Melvin in a sense is the a problem that caused the problem On the scale technically it s their fault we re even here This all must be taken with some salt because their isn t enough transparency as to how much they actually caused and when What we do know is they had large enough positions in shorting all of this to the point were A It was almost if not blantantly illegal shorting And B was down so heavy they not only doubled down and damn near risked a lot of peoples money for their beyond stupid lack of risk management but they had to be BAILED OUT AND INVESTED IN BY A MARKET MAKER If they quit while they were ahead the height of the squeeze would have been 800 tops but instead they DOUBLED DOWN Which is why this whole thing NEARLY QUAKED THE MARKET would have destroyed HFS and even down to the core of some banks and would have cause the largest transfer of wealth known to man Won t be suprised if Melvin gets reemed by the end of the year and disintegrates Also what s anti semitism Is that some sort of market manipulation or some anti HF strat Someone let me know cuz he s accusing people of that and I can t find any answers here on what that is or how it works but lying and making things up isn t cool Citadel this is the market maker that bailed out and invested in Melvin for finding a way to make profit through all of this These guys hold large portions of stocks and have far more info than any individual investor These guys knew something and were clearly doing something to cause all of this to come tumbling down They knew something like the DTCC was coming in and saw a chance to capitalize on Melvin as it feel This guys are the bigger fish to Melvin and are the most visible in the string pulling If anything they re the decoy of the DTCC to be the last shield before the take the bullet They re also not transparent in any of this and are very sus I don t know enough to say exactly what they ve done but will edit when more info is received Robinhood oh Robinhood you poor dumb fuck Robinhood IS NOT THE MAIN ENEMY Robinhood is the enemies slave They don t have a choice and will be KOS if they don t listen somehow Yes RH has grossly large problems yes RH is truthfully anti consumer and it s customers are MMS but they really can t work any other way They will be the first to take the bullet and the only way for them to continue operation was for them to pull the bs and hold for dear life as they take everyone s giant cactus up their rear and hope they make it This is the same story for all the other brokers who pulled the SAME THING Is RH still good No leave now you will not profit Does have any benefits Sure it teaches you a lot about how the market works in a pretty modern way but also not enough for you to take it in the rear too What should you do Leave RH pull everything out and go to either fidelity or someone else RH will never work at this moment for the people it is purely not possible and with how it is now not worth DFV this man isn t necessarily the cause or really any direct form of change in the stocks value Just a man who stuck to his DD and was right in the end He got popular because he was both right in his DD and witty He has not directly persuaded or influenced peoples judgement he just happened to take the spotlight where no else stood and not of his own initiative If he gets charged everyone who s ever used the market ever should too TL DR I just want fairness in the market and for those who need judgement be judged This was suppose to be a free market with fair rules not a barrel of fish If you don t know who s the problem or where it s most likely DTCC or SEC corruption sucks hold brother oh brothers hold thee pos X amount of guhhoodee at some sort of price so yes I am biased And just try to charge me with anything I don t care and I never will words weigh less than action Post edit I m just tired man this isn t fair for anyone how dare they stall our rocket Please fly again some day Oh and if gumhoooo ever reaches above our current worlds clouds from here toward above 530 I ll get the Power to the Player With WSB logo on my person And of course always DONATE TO A CHARITY YOU FULLY SUPPORT I will be supporting animal sanctuaries when the tendieman comes have not decided on who yet

the Daily Discussion for the past few days I ve seen a lot of misery surrounding PLTR because it s dropped freakin 10 a share in the past week or so I m struggling with you but there is literally no downside to the stock The price has gone down because of some negative media attention trying to drive the price down in combination with lockup expiry that happened yesterday TGIF and we re seeing some premarket action in a positive direction today But what does Palantir actually do That s the question everyone wants answered It s tough for people who aren t involved in the type of stuff the company does to understand but there was a decent explanation done on Quora a few years ago that is still VERY relevant to the company even as they branch out into the private sector Yes they are still heavily involved in government contracts for the good ol US of A and her allies but now that it has a solid foothold and has developed its software to be crucial in development of foundational intelligence in a variety of government sectors they are moving into spaces which are going to be more profitable for shareholders So here comes the Quora response It s from 6 years ago and comes from a blog that has since been upgraded to a full up website and this post has gone away from it but it s still very relevant to the here and now even with the fast pace of technology today Seriously if you are in Palantir or are thinking about getting into it read it It s a short read and a good beginning for someone trying to figure out just what the fuck this company does By Kevin Simler I often ask candidates if they re familiar with what we do at Palantir Most people think they are Oh you re that data viz company or worse You guys do data mining right At least they ve heard of us and at least they re on the right track but I cringe anyway We aren t just a data visualization company and we don t do data mining It s almost impossible to convey the scope and complexity of what we do in a few short minutes or to do so without taking the conversation to an eye glazing level of abstraction The following is my attempt at describing what we do at a high level without oversimplifying I hope that after reading this a candidate will get what we re about or at least understand enough not to apply tiny labels to our expansive vision The problem implementing analysis At Palantir we specialize in analysis Yes that s painfully abstract and I ll get to it in a second In real world terms we are building a software platform that enables people to take whatever data is relevant to them and understand it more easily and thoroughly than ever before using concepts that they already understand And we are applying this vision at first to solving problems in the finance sector and the government intelligence community The first important thing to note is that we don t actually do the analysis ourselves We don t devise winning trading strategies and we don t catch terrorists We write software that enables other people to pull off these feats These people experts in their respective fields are called analysts So what exactly do analysts do What is analysis gt Analysis is everything necessary to extract insight from information Let s break that down a bit Information is easy It s data It lives in a relational database or as files indexed on a hard drive and you can easily run queries against it It comes in two forms structured and unstructured And there is a lot of it in the modern world too much actually for current tools to make sense of Insight is trickier Insight is something only a person can generate and understanding this is critical for any organization that wants to do analysis right Thus the challenge of data analysis is how to bring vast amounts of information into productive contact with human intelligence In other words the challenge is how to enable the analyst From the analyst s perspective there are five essential features of an analysis platform 1 First and most important the analyst should be in control In other words the primary way of interacting with an analysis tool should be human driven queries While automated approaches can complement a human driven approach there simply is no substitute for human intelligence Unless you put a person behind the wheel the system can never be flexible or creative enough to uncover truly original insight Artificial Intelligence just isn t there yet 2 Ability to summarize large data sets Some of this is what has traditionally been called data mining the largely automated approach using machine learning or other statistical techniques of processing lots of data at once and extracting nuggets that capture something interesting about the data Unlike Palantir traditional approaches have focused almost exclusively on this aspect of analysis 3 Ability to visualize large data sets Here the analyst wants interesting and informative ways of viewing data graphically to make it easier for him to digest The analyst wants more than just a summary of the data he wants a nuanced view of what s going on inside these data sets What s the overall shape of the distribution What are the outliers What are important structures within the data 4 Ability to iterate rapidly This means enabling the analyst to ask a question get the answer and then quickly ask either a variant on the initial question or a follow up question that depends on the answer to the initial question This rapid iterative process allows the analyst to quickly test out hypotheses and develop theories about what s going on in the data and by extension to discover what s going on in the world 5 Ability to collaborate with other analysts Getting a handle on a terabyte of data especially when it comprises multiple data types is definitely more than a one person job Any organization that s serious about understanding the world needs a team of analysts that can work together as more than the sum of its parts This requires the ability for one analyst to effortlessly share the results of his analysis with his colleagues The Palantir approach That s what analysis looks like to the analyst or rather what it should look like in an ideal world Current tools fall far short of this vision So what do we do at Palantir in order to make analysis this smooth and easy You could say that we help summarize large data sets in the sense that we have to provide the analyst with a rich library of techniques and algorithms You could also say that we do visualization in the sense that we have to provide the analyst with a set of interesting and informative ways of visualizing their data We do both of these things and we have to be creative and solve hard problems in order to add value in these areas But we do a lot more than that Probably the most central hard problem that we address in trying to enable the analyst is data modeling the process of figuring out what data types are relevant to a domain defining what they represent in the world and deciding how to represent them in the system At Palantir we make sure our data model ontology is both flexible and dynamic and that it mirrors the concepts people naturally use when reasoning about the domain This is no small challenge but we re already making it a reality In finance our basic data types include financial instruments dates portfolios indices and strategies the same things that financial researchers think about talk about and reason with In the intelligence product our basic data types include people places and events all with associated properties which is exactly the way we all represent the world in our minds Data modeling data summarization and data visualization are the core disciplines for approaching large data sets Human driven queries rapid iteration and collaboration are multipliers taking the power unlocked by the core disciplines to the next level When these pieces are brought together in a coherent system the result is in an analysis platform both very generic and very powerful This is what we mean when we say that we re changing the way people approach data Welcome to the future of analysis

Why it matters if you got screwed with GME then this paves the way for those cases at least those that filed in CA Robinhood Can t Ditch Online Traders Suit Over Outages By Dorothy Atkins https www law360 com classaction articles 1356526 robinhood can t ditch online traders suit over outages nl pk c8c581de f1c8 47fa a1cb b9ae7e3044da amp utm source newsletter amp utm medium email amp utm campaign classaction Law360 February 18 2021 7 22 PM EST A California federal judge refused Thursday to toss outright a proposed class action alleging that Robinhood s repeated service outages amid volatile market conditions harmed retail stock traders finding that traders sufficiently alleged that they had been harmed by outages Robinhood has admitted are a problem and directing the parties to enter mediation At the end of a hearing held via Zoom U S District Judge James Donato ruled from the bench tossing Robinhood s parent company Robinhood Markets Inc https www law360 com companies robinhood markets inc from the suit with leave to amend but denying Robinhood s motion to dismiss the consolidated litigation for good Judge Donato rejected Robinhood s arguments that the traders lack standing to sue under the high court s Spokeo https www law360 com companies spokeo inc decision He said the traders had sufficiently alleged that they had been harmed by the outages and need not detail their specific unexecuted trades to proceed with their claims He also refused to toss injunctive and declaratory relief claims because he noted that Robinhood s outages are alleged to be ongoing The judge also denied Robinhood s motion to strike class claims He acknowledged that although the proposed nationwide class of Robinhood users seems a little over inclusive the issue is a matter to be decided on a motion for class certification and not a motion to strike After ruling the judge said that he had presided over thousands of cases and that this case is unusual in that the parties are further down the road with key facts He said Robinhood had pretty much said its outages are a problem and had not tried to hide them Judge Donato noted that the complaint lists a number of explanations and apologies Robinhood has given to users and that the company had sent minute by minute notifications on phones that the company were working to fix the outages There was ownership and apology and that s 80 percent of the battle in most cases Judge Donato said Nobody is denying there was a problem This seems the kind of case that could go to a discussion of what the resolution might be Judge Donato suggested the parties try to reach a settlement to save everybody time and money and he told the parties to notify him within two weeks of the private mediator they have chosen If you can settle great If you can t OK but let s at least try he said The ruling keeps alive litigation filed last year https www law360 com articles 1250592 robinhood s system outage spurs class action filed in fla and consolidated in an amended complaint in August https www law360 com articles 1303840 robinhood users blast game like interface in amended suit claiming that the company s platform had gone down dozens of times since March and that while Robinhood was down traders have had no way to access their accounts on the platform or execute trades that would have kept them from suffering major losses In October Robinhood filed a motion to dismiss and motion to strike the class allegations https www law360 com articles 1317333 robinhood rips shoot for the moon strategy in outage suit and on Thursday the judge held a hearing on the motions at the same time a congressional committee was hearing testimony from Robinhood s CEO Vladimir Tenev and hedge fund executives over the volatility of GameStop https www law360 com companies gamestop corp stock which soared nearly 3 000 in January and led Robinhood to stop GameStop buys while allowing traders to continue to sell GameStop shares During the hearing before Judge Donato Robinhood s counsel Maeve L O Connor of Debevoise amp Plimpton LLP https www law360 com firms debevoise plimpton argued that the allegations and proposed class are overly broad and don t specify the individual trades that resulted in losses O Connor said merely alleging an inability to make a trade is not sufficient to allege standing and a concrete particularized injury under Spokeo Not all trades are profitable You can pick winners you can pick losers she said You need more than that to have standing to sue O Connor also argued that the complaint does not specify the put call or strike prices at the time of the attempted trades to support a claim of injury There s a wide range of possibilities of what would happen what traders would have done she said adding that there was no way of knowing in hindsight what traders could have made or lost on an unexecuted trade But Anne Marie Murphy of Cotchett Pitre amp McCarthy LLP argued https www law360 com firms cotchett pitre on behalf of the traders that their complaint specifically alleges losses by 16 lead plaintiffs from across the United States who tried to make trades but could not do so because of the outages She also argued that Robinhood s parent company should be kept in the suit because it is included as a party in the users terms and conditions but she said they can add more allegations regarding its connections to the company s conduct after they take some discovery After hearing arguments Judge Donato sided mostly with the traders and encouraged the parties to enter settlement negotiations O Connor responded to the judge s suggestion by noting that Robinhood has not conceded liability and the parties are still very far apart The nature of this proof is going to be so highly individualized that it s going to be challenging to see that it s a class action O Connor said It may be that a little more litigation is required before having a productive settlement conversation Murphy said the traders were open to entering settlement negotiations but agreed that there was still work to do now that discovery has been greenlighted I agree the damages model is going to be interesting she said We re working hard on that The traders are represented by Anne Marie Murphy of Cotchett Pitre amp McCarthy LLP Robinhood is represented by Maeve L O

Commerce company with a shitty name that s stuck in the 90s while the rest of their business is optimized to print money over the next decade Processing img vxkuuscdegi61 Name aside this company does one thing well it consistently makes MONEY Flowers has beaten estimates on their last eight earnings to the tune of 15 24 This isn t a EV pump and dump that you re going to make 60 in a week But a 20 share price gain can still take you to tendy town with the right call options and a good batch of shares The last week of crabbing share price has dropped the IV since the last earnings price spikes making it a perfect opportunity to pick up some calls pre Q3 fiscal results in April The Bull Case It s no secret that the only reason this stock is trading sub 40 is that their growth hasn t been drop dead sexy It s been consistently seasonal but it hasn t really blown the roof off the fucker until fiscal Q2 Industry analysts always expect Flowers to have a strong Q2 September December is their growth months however they never expected the company to post 1 72 EPS Flowers not only made more money overall but they also managed to lower management costs and improve e commerce growth up 59 7 YOY On some level a portion of this could be due in part to COVID 19 driving consumers online The real question is will the average consumer return to purchasing at their local florist if they re even open anymore or just become a customer Just before the earnings bomb was dropped the share price rose to a 52 week high 37 on hype alone Paper hands lit up and it dumped down to 28 The bull case would see the stock climb back to 40 over the next 2 3 months and perhaps even touching 45 before Fiscal Q3 earnings are due in April 2021 Wall Street expects a net loss of 9c share If Flowers can beat this and go positive it would mark the first time the company made a profit per share in Q3 I would imagine this would signal a shift in the companies growth and lead the stock to some sort of breakout If their newest acquisitions can drive earnings in the off season Q1 Q3 and Q4 then expect a huge upside Flowers has made some power purchases over the last two years to expand their ecommerce reach Their most recent acquisitions include 1 Berries com Shari s Berrys Purchased 08 19 for 20 5 million a This was a steal Shari was about to start selling used panties online after her retail model resulted in multiple store closures Flowers stepped in and scaled the business into a successful e commerce business on berries com Now they re dipping 9 million berries a year at 3 75 berry I would imagine the margins are pretty big on these given how little a strawberry and some dipping chocolate costs 2 PersonalizationMall Purchased 2 20 252 million A big player in the personalized gift space Ranks above Etsy on an organic google search which is nuts and is going to expose Flowers to a new sector for growth What s especially important about this acquisition is that the site drives business year round Flowers has a VERY cyclical earnings cycle subject to huge swings based on seasonal revenue the lion share of the companies earnings comes Thanksgiving through Christmas This site will drive revenue in the dry fiscal quarters for the company Q1 Q3 amp Q4 3 The gay bears are betting against us The stock has historically been shorted As of 1 29 21 data the stock is 20 of float short down significantly since earnings I wouldn t call it squeezable but there are some strong bets against the stock most of which are looking pretty dumb right now It would take 4 days for them to cover based on estimates 4 The financials look good Processing img uvjy8opeegi61 30 asset growth in 2020 that s the exponential growth I m getting on Before that we were seeing sub 10 asset growth If Flowers can keep this type of growth I really like the stock even more https thisinterestsme com rainbow bear emoji The Bear Case https thisinterestsme com rainbow bear emoji Look Flowers is a seasonal business EPS is over a dollar in Fiscal Q2 and is often negative or barely positive in the remaining months The gay bears betting against this stock believe that it s possible Flowers doesn t go net positive for the rest of fiscal 2021 The question on everyone s mind is the stock actually making a positive growth trend Or was this just a fluke based on COVID 19 closures If the gay bear theories prove true the stock could sink Flowers doesn t report positive news very often only on acquisitions and fiscal Q2 earnings The rest of the year is basically hype A few shitty news cycles and this stock could have a VERY negative sentiment If Flowers doesn t blow away Fiscal Q3 I wouldn t expect much movement above 30 35 Still pretty safe to hold shares against gay bears but calls won t print Positions amp x200B Processing img 9cq46h5pegi61 400 shares x 31 03 10x March 19 33c 7x March 19 40c leftover from my earnings play early last month 5x Sept 17 21 37

advice just my opinion about the market I m neither qualified nor inclined to give anyone investment advice Please do your own research and double check anything you read from me or anyone else Sorry for the long rambling format I just wanted to consolidate my investment thesis into one post Demand 50 60 of silver demand comes from industry and that demand is quite inelastic If someone makes smartphones and the average phone uses 0 35 worth of silver you don t stop making phones when the price of silver quadruples Silver is used very broadly since it s found in alloys used in most electronics Of that industrial usage about 2 3 of the silver consumed is never recovered Since it s used broadly and in small quantities If you have a gold watch someday that watch will break and the gold will probably end up in a gold bar someday If you make a cell phone one day it will break and most will end up in a landfill Even some of the silver that goes through a recycling process still ends up being melted into an alloy so it still isn t recovered as silver The needs of industrial demand are often hard to substitute Silver is the most conductive element most reflective element and has natural anti microbial properties I m sure if people could easily use copper instead they probably already would have Silver s industrial demand is highest in fast growing sectors like electric vehicles solar panels and electronics EV s use significantly more silver that gas cars and also use lots in their charging infrastructure The average solar panel uses 0 6 oz of silver and 5G networks are expected to increase silver demand significantly as they roll out Recently the silver market went into a state called backwardation That means that the current price is higher than the prices in the futures markets The natural state is the opposite This state can have many causes but one potential cause is that people think contracts won t be delivered in the future The last 3 times backwardation happened in the silver market preceded large spikes in the price We haven t really experienced much inflation in recent decades and a significant portion of that may be due to deflation in prices of consumer goods because of globalization Basically we keep printing more and more money but China keeps cheaply producing more and more products This has kept inflation contained in localized asset bubbles stocks real estate art and most people haven t seen it effect their lives much That could change The low prices we ve grown accustomed to probably won t keep dropping as we keep printing more money The US and other developed countries are adding staggering amounts of debt and printing money like crazy so inflation expectations are higher than anytime in recent history Inflation and the expectation of future inflation is the classic demand driver for gold and silver Most big pension funds hedge funds and other big money out there have little to no exposure to precious metals least of all silver It s a tiny market that doesn t get much attention but it wouldn t take too much new demand to chase up the price in a market this size In the last few weeks there has been a huge spike in demand for small denominations of bars and coins 100 oz 10 oz 1 oz This has happened before and usually results in the premia going up until mints can catch up melt down 1000 oz bars from the Comex or LBMA and produce more which lowers the premia back to normal This time was more dramatic than I ve seen with premia going up double or triple and countless online shops selling out in a matter of days This is generally positive for silver prices but shortages like this have not been a huge deal in the past Mints making smaller denominations tends to be a one way street When the Royal Canadian Mint makes 1oz silver Maple Leaf coins nobody would ever melt those high value coins into a lower value 1000 oz bar so once those small denominations are made they will end up circulating among investors and outside the Comex LBMA system The amount of physical silver flowing into ETF s lately is also unprecedented PSLV the Sprott physical trust has been around for 10 years and has accumulated about 112M oz About 6 of that came in to the fund in the last 2 days The largest silver ETF SLV has changed the terms in their prospectus effectively warning that they might not be able to find bullion to back the money flowing into the fund This could be a massive signal and the news just came out a few days ago More recently I ve been hearing lots of reports of people having difficulty getting 1000 oz bars from distributors connected to the Comex LBMA system People have been saying that they are getting bullied to settle contracts in cash rather than take delivery Even the local dealer I ve used has told me he can only sell 1000 oz bars at triple the premium he used to sell for and one employee of a reputable dealer in Chicago said industrial customers are being given 2 3 week wait times for bars they used to get immediately I can t say for sure if there s a shortage now or soon but it s starting to look that way If the Comex and LBMA can t deliver 1000 oz bars at spot the price will have to go up and unlike other commodities a higher price of silver may mean more investment demand not less While the shortage of small denominations is something I ve seen before and probably not that big of a deal an actual shortage of 1000 oz bars could be nuclear Supply Around 70 of silver mined is mined as a byproduct of other mines Most mines produce more than one metal and there are relatively few primary silver mines The most common are Gold Silver Lead Zinc Silver and Copper Silver This may seem like a random interesting fact but it actually effects the market a whole lot If we were talking about lithium instead of silver and the lithium price went up 5x every lithium mine in the world will go into overdrive try to expand production as fast as possible build any new mines they could and that will eventually reverse or slow the price increase If you have a mine that produces 90 of their revenue from lead and zinc they aren t likely to do the same expansion if the 10 of production that s silver goes up 5x Gold and silver are mostly valued based on existing stockpiles They have been mined for thousands of years and for most of that time excluding the last 150 or so years almost everything ever mined was still in some sort of usable form This is why these metals can act differently than almost other commodities If the price of corn spiked higher farmers would switch crops to farm more and it would eventually correct the price to the cost of production and a reasonable profit margin Gold or silver could go for a long time being too expensive or too cheap and it wouldn t immediately correct itself since the price is based more on the huge stack already mined rather than just what s going to be mined in the next year The prevalence in the earths crust is about 12 1 silver to gold and historical mine production was about the same Current mine production is about 8 1 The current price ratio is around 65 1 silver to gold I ve heard some people talk about the market size of silver as being 1 5T That s the rough value of all silver ever mined in 5000 years and is pretty irrelevant in this context The amount of silver in investible bar form is under 3B oz which is less than 80B The Comex has about 151M oz in registered inventory and 246M oz in eligible inventory Eligible inventory is owned by someone else It could be sold but it might not be for sale at any given price The LBMA has 1B oz but 85 is already owned by ETF s There is lot of silver in the world but very little for sale in an investment grade at anywhere near current prices For a market apparently worth 1 5T it seems like you could buy every bar in available in the world for about 8B That s obviously not counting the existing demand so it might not take a huge inflow to move this market significantly Over decades industry has chipped away at the worlds inventories of silver to the point where there s around the same amount of trade able gold oz as silver oz in investment grade bar form There s still way more silver in total if you count jewelry coins silverware etc but that can take a long time to show up and change forms In 2011 when silver hit 50 oz the amount of silver recycled went up about 50 but that increase was only a small fraction of the mine supply Some people say that if the price goes up any significant amount a flood of silver will come in from coins silverware jewelry etc and correct the problem In 2011 when silver hit 50 oz the amount of silver recycled went up about 50 but that increase was only a small fraction of the mine supply so the broader supply demand picture didn t really change much There s still a huge amount of silver in coins silverware jewelry etc but if it didn t come back into the market at 50 in 2011 why would it come out of hiding now for less The whole mining industry has been slumping for a decade or more Discoveries of new significant deposits of precious metals are down and now even production has been falling for years world wide I think the market value of Apple is worth something like 3 times the entire worldwide mining industry Historically some of the supply demand imbalance has been made up by governments around the world selling silver bullion into the markets This has probably artificially suppressed the price in the past but most governments have little to no silver bullion left General Market Info JP Morgan was fined around 1B in 2020 for manipulating the silver and gold markets Also ScotiaMocatta paid a big fine and got out of the business in 2020 after being a bullion bank for over 300 years The Hunt brothers were vilified for buying 100M oz of silver in 1980 driving up the prices to 50 oz in 1980 dollars They bought with borrowed money so when the exchange introduced position limits they were only allowed to sell and not buy and they had to sell to repay the margin being called by the Comex Warren Buffet bought 130M oz in the 90 s and nobody said a thing Today there are rumours that JP Morgan has built up a stockpile of over 300M oz Gold hit a new all time high in 2020 Silver was around half it s nominal all time high and a quarter of it s inflation adjusted all time high If you use the 1980 calculation of inflation the 1980 silver price spike hit over 600 and even using todays CPI calculation it s 120 If you look at an inflation adjusted chart of silver prices going back many hundreds of years silver prices were usually many hundreds of dollars From 1720 1900 the silver price never dipped below 100 and was as high as 500 in todays dollars For much of the 5000 years that silver has been considered money 1 10 of an oz was considered a days wage Silver is the most heavily shorted metal by far Some of this is due to hedging by mining companies and some is bullion banks that have bullion they use to offset short contracts Those net out but there is another portion that is naked short non mines holding no metal and only paper contracts The paper to physical ratio on the Comex is as high as 300 to 1 so a small amount of physical metal leaving the market could leave a lot of short contracts scrambling to find metal that someone wants delivered Palladium once had the largest short position relative to its size while demand rose and created a shortage For years it took 2 5 oz of palladium to buy an oz of platinum then over a decade the tables turned and now 1 oz of palladium can buy 2 oz of platinum I think a shortage is inevitable and scarcity is an incredible driver of behaviour There are a lot of companies who really rely on silver and who currently use just in time inventory so they can t keep their operations going for long without new inventory If I recall the toilet paper aisle in March 2020 I think that when people start to sense a shortage they tend to stock up Unlike toilet paper this won t just be driven by fear and need This would be driven by fear need want and greed Imagine if toilet paper were a target of huge speculators that could easily and cheaply house many years of global production and suppliers couldn t easily ramp up production to respond to the shortage It probably would have left a whole lot more desperate people willing to pay a whole lot more Summary This is a small market with growing and inelastic demand and an existing supply demand imbalance that has been eroding available inventories for years It s currently in short supply in an investable deliverable form and that shortage is getting worse by the day The silver market is historically prone to wild spikes and this time a large spike up in price would actually be reverting to a more normal historical price over the very long term in terms of the ratio with gold and in absolute inflation adjusted price Proven price manipulators are exiting the market and some may have switched from net short to net long The physical price diverging from the paper price may force the Comex and LBMA to make more deliveries than they are basically built for dry up any available inventory and may cause a large number of paper contracts to owe physical metal they have no way of obtaining at anywhere near current prices Industrial users are the sleeping dragon in this situation needing hundreds of millions of oz per year to operate their businesses and historically relying on just in time inventory Now they are being forced to wait to get inventory and may start to see a shortage ahead Some may decide that the risk of not getting product or having to pay much higher prices is too great so they need to take some of the dwindling inventory for themselves The more scarce it becomes the more industry will want to stock up Speculators will get wind of this and further compete for the last scraps of bullion This situation looks to me like a big bonfire soaking in the gasoline of paper leverage that may ignite anytime I ll be sitting by with my marshmallows waiting to sell into a market that might look much different than when I bought but who knows Time will tell

of this information is correct I would appreciate your input or maybe get this DD trending so that the community here can collectively provide input and then each of you decide for yourselves what you want to do with the information Okay So we get a lot of tickers thrown around here on Reddit StockTwits Discord Twitch YouTube TikTok Twitter you get the point Everyone who has at least one thumb and a bank account wants to share what they claim to be the best stock ever that hasn t been found yet and really it s just the same tickers that we ve seen since March 2020 and the person has been holding a bag for months on end That being said I am very skeptical of what I hear basically believing none of it But if the person can provide some solid information that will get my attention I will listen and then dive down the DD rabbit hole fucking Alice in r wallstreetbets style So let us begin The ticker is TRCH and I m sure some of you have seen it already I m betting some of you have a few hundred or thousand shares Good Now if you re unsure of why you bought it or if you have never heard of this ticker before let me break it down for you TRCH recently did an offering which scares a lot of traders but shouldn t depending on the circumstances TRCH did an offering because they had to in order to get to the level of cash they needed Thats because they have HUGE plans and it starts with them merging with Meta Meta is also YUGEEEE Some of Meta s customers and partners include Sony Airbus Panasonic Boeing Mazda ThermoFisher Scientific but most importantly for TRCH Samsung Why do we care about Samsung And why do we care about TRCH when they re just an energy resource company that is apparently selling off all of their assets Just shut up and listen Metamaterial OTC MMATF announced the signing of a definite agreement for a business combination with Torchlight Energy TRCH back in December Okay so if Meta is an OTC how are they so huge Well because to understand a companies value and potential value we have to look at not only their financials but also the leadership and direction they are taking their company There are a lot of successful and cash heavy companies that aren t publicly traded And stocks rise in value based on forward looking speculation I mean look at TSLA Meta is the real deal and are in a bunch of different markets They have billion dollar potential because they re in all of the RIGHT markets We re talking markets like EV LED Solar GlucoWise Holography Lithography MRI and others They have 89 filed patents 54 granted across 28 patent families 21 granted 5 registered trademarks and proprietary custom manufacturing processes and trade secrets developed over 10 years with multi million dollar investments Just check out the new investor presentation In the presentation there is mention of a biosensor This smartphone attached biosensor under development uses nonmaterial for molecular fingerprint detection in a range of applications such as COVID 19 and others and Daily use biosensor with sensitivity and performance enhanced using nano material to meet rising demand for point of care testing and then quotes a market potential of 10 B That B is for Billion Global Biosensors Market is expected to reach USD 41 29 billion by 2027 They want a huge piece of the pie and this is just one emerging sector they are in If they are projecting 10 billion market potential and TRCH market cap isn t even 500 million BOOM IMO the offering on TRCH was the chance to buy but if you didn t get in then today would be the time to get in because they are trading much lower the past two days following a couple hit pieces by SeekingAlpha By the way the people who wrote the hit pieces on TRCH they are shorting it More on them in a moment SeekingAlpha is garbage TRCH They regularly have a huge short percentage was 32 short interest on February 10 and today the short volume ratio was 26 which means that a WHOLE LOT OF SHORTS ARE GONNA LEARN Shorts have had fun and they ve been getting cocky the past couple days That s about to change come Monday February 22nd Lets examine the shorts shall we White Diamond Research yup they re the guys who wrote the SeekingAlpha hit pieces This group is the biggest bear group I know and the sad part they re absolutely terrible at it They claim a 90 success rate and 3rd party verification but how they came to making that statement I have no idea Just look at what they have shorted RIOT they went bearish and took a short position at 2 41 and RIOT is trading today at 77 80 call an ambulance but not for me They took a short position on GP in December when it was trading at 18 33 and it was trading today at over 30 oof They took a short position on CLSK in October when it was trading at 10 75 and just like all the other short positions they take they wrote hit pieces on CLSK and gave it a 3 price target which would have been a 77 decrease in value from the level they took their position What is CLSK trading at now They are at 34 at this moment and were over 42 earlier this week They also shorted MVIS when it was trading at 2 02 in August 2020 Considering MVIS is trading at 20 13 at this very moment and peaked at 24 18 this week I d say it is safe to say that White Diamond Research Group should consider changing their name to We Don t Research Group I know that was a terrible attempt at making a joke I m not that funny But i know how to do DD Lets keep going What we can derive from their actual track record when shorting literally any stock is that White Diamond Research sucks so good at what they do that if you invest in anything they short you re almost guaranteed to double triple maybe even 35x your money The merger is nearly 1 month away March 12 and yet 48 have already voted in favor of it CEO tweeted this and said he was looking forward to March 12th But does what the insiders tweet really matter It is if they put their money where their mouth is So lets take a look at insider ownership and if there has been an increase or decrease Well first up is Greg McCabe Director at TRCH He recently bought 1 630 434 shares of his own company At the time it was worth 749 999 64 and since then the offering has closed and evidently he is still holding every single last one of his shares Diamond Hands Greg is going to give White Diamond Paper Hands a run for their money TRCH also will be giving a special dividend which will also attract bigger fish Why else do current investors have a reason to hold Because when the merger goes through on March 12 Torchlight is expected to sell off its oil and gas assets by June 30 2021 What is that worth 33 463 330 and this would become a one time payment to shareholders Meta also recently acquired Interglass a Swiss Lens Manufacturer We can understand the reason why and the potential when we read from one of their recent filings META will invest and expand its capabilities in design development and manufacturing of metaFUSION TradeMarked products for smart eyewear This highly integrated solution combines embedded metamaterial and functional film elements with precision cast corrective lenses which are required by over 50 of potential users in the market So basically META is in every emerging market but they re still OTC which means merging with TRCH is basically the missing piece Then after the merger I am sure many of META s wonderful partners will have great PR lined up Considering the amount of shorts and Paper Hands White Diamond Research Group betting against TRCH I m betting there will be a massive squeeze I see TRCH running up all the way to merger starting next week after the market has found its correction which I believe was finally today As of today TRCH is undervalued has a catalyst merger is cash heavy debt free and the merger is with META which puts them in emerging markets My analysis is that this merger will drive the price up beginning next week all the way through and after the merger is complete shorts will all get squeezed and based on being cash heavy in emerging markets and forward speculation this stock will be a 20 stock in a few months I think it s possible we see 8 10 by March 12th and depending on how epic the short squeeze is and how many people find this company it could go parabolic to 30 before settling around 22 I took a long position as of this morning I have been skeptical until I did weeks of research and watched the stock run up and then come back down after it got a small pump from Atlas This stock also has the behavior of a parabolic runner and I m thinking it will perform more like RIOT over the course of the next year It will run up to 20 within a couple months and as their emerging market technology is PR d it will continue to run up every few weeks making higher highs and higher lows each time

had no idea where to get started with trading so I thought I would make another boring educational post for the millions of new traders who recently joined our community This will show you the best tutorials and tools you need to get started trading stocks and options Even though I am a decent full time trader I am not a grammar expert so if you have any questions please comment them below and I will try and get back to them Before we start please understand you should treat trading as a job because if you do it right it will be your only source of income in a year or two if you put in the effort and master your emotions List of apps videos and tools worth using 1 Mobile Traders Brokers Feel free to offer your thoughts on these in the comments 1 Webull 2 Tastyworks 3 ThinkorSwin 4 E Trade 5 Tradestation 6 Schwab 2 Option Flow Data See what options hedge funds are buying 1 https titanflow io https titanflow io Best For Mobile Traders 2 https flowalgo com https flowalgo com Best For Experienced Traders With Over 20k 3 YouTube Videos To Watch In Order I can only provide video names because the links got my last post removed 1 The Ultimate Stock Trading Course for Beginners 2 Technical Analysis Secrets What Most Trading Gurus Will Never Tell You 3 Options Trading for Beginners The ULTIMATE In Depth Guide 4 Stock Market Order Types Market Order Limit Order Stop Loss Stop Limit 5 3 Common Psychological TRADING Mistakes 6 How to Build a Profitable Trading Plan I assume most of you already have a broker you prefer but in case you do not I have listed a few good ones above What I like to tell new traders is to drop a small amount of money into your account Something like 20 50 that you are willing to lose Play around on the app and buy a few stocks NO OPTIONS and get a feel for your app or platform After you have some fun making your first few trades head over to YouTube and watch the videos I listed above Treat these videos as a class and bring a notebook to write down any notes you think are important or any questions you may have After each video go over your notes and ask questions in one of the many trading communities here on Reddit Then go back to your app or platform and test out what you have learned while again taking notes of things you notice After you do this proceed to the next video After you have watched the Technical Analysis video practice using your own technical analysis by visiting the trading view website If you have think or swim by TD Ameritrade E Trade or another broker who has a platform for desktops you can do it straight from there which can be a huge bonus After you have watched the first two videos then you can bring your total account up to 100 You will continue to practice trading using the skills you have learned so far You may make some profit or you may end up losing a few bucks It s important to understand how your emotions are guiding your trading decisions Every time before you hit the buy button you should ask yourself Should I really buy this If you can t answer that question then under no circumstances should you be making that trade If you want to get started in options you can watch the third video but understand that while options can have amazing returns they also come with great risk The video is 3 hours long so grab a snack and find a quiet spot where you can t be bothered That option video blew my mind and is one of the main reasons I am able to trade full time That video covers everything so I do not need to go more in depth here on options trading Now we come to something that is SO important but usually takes traders far too long to understand The order type video will save you so much money because it will help you understand why market orders are usually not the right way to go especially when you are trading large amounts of capital During this whole time you should have been practicing how to trade and you might have wondered what the order types meant when you went to buy a few shares of stock Again take notes and practice implementing what you have learned into your evolving trading style The next two videos are a great pair because the first one educates you on the emotional side of trading while the second video helps you learn to trade with a plan If you do not have your emotions under control I can tell you know that you will abandon that plan as soon as you see your account start to lose money You have to get rid of that sinking stomach feeling when the stocks not moving in the direction you want This definitely takes time but if you can mitigate these types of feelings you should have a solid understanding of how to start trading If you have time which most of you won t I recommend watching all of the tutorials again because you will take different things away from them compared to when you were just starting out Doing all of this may take a couple of weeks or a few months if you have a busy work and family life but I encourage to make the effort so you can live the good life Always remember why you started trading in the first place If you are just looking for fun or a quick buck you will probably end up losing way more than you ever imagined Hope you enjoyed this post everyone

idea where to get started with trading so I thought I would make another educational post for the millions of new traders who recently joined our community This will show you the best tutorials and tools you need to get started trading stocks and options Even though I am a decent full time trader I am not a grammar expert so if you have any questions please comment them below and I will try and get back to them List of apps videos and tools worth using 1 Mobile Traders Brokers Feel free to offer your thoughts on these in the comments 1 Webull 2 Tastyworks 3 ThinkorSwin 4 E Trade 5 Tradestation 6 Schwab 2 Option Flow Data See what options hedge funds are buying 1 https titanflow io Best For Mobile Traders 2 https flowalgo com Best For Experienced Traders With Over 20k 3 YouTube Videos To Watch In Order I can only provide video names because the links got my last post removed 1 The Ultimate Stock Trading Course for Beginners 2 Technical Analysis Secrets What Most Trading Gurus Will Never Tell You 3 Options Trading for Beginners The ULTIMATE In Depth Guide 4 Stock Market Order Types Market Order Limit Order Stop Loss Stop Limit 5 3 Common Psychological TRADING Mistakes 6 How to Build a Profitable Trading Plan I assume most of you already have a broker you prefer but in case you do not I have listed a few good ones above What I like to tell new traders is to drop a small amount of money into your account Something like 20 50 that you are willing to lose Play around on the app and buy a few stocks NO OPTIONS and get a feel for your app or platform After you have some fun making your first few trades head over to YouTube and watch the videos I listed above Treat these videos as a class and bring a notebook to write down any notes you think are important or any questions you may have After each video go over your notes and ask questions in one of the many trading communities here on Reddit Then go back to your app or platform and test out what you have learned while again taking notes of things you notice After you do this proceed to the next video After you have watched the Technical Analysis video practice using your own technical analysis by visiting the trading view website If you have think or swim by TD Ameritrade E Trade or another broker who has a platform for desktops you can do it straight from there which can be a huge bonus After you have watched the first two videos then you can bring your total account up to 100 You will continue to practice trading using the skills you have learned so far You may make some profit or you may end up losing a few bucks It s important to understand how your emotions are guiding your trading decisions Every time before you hit the buy button you should ask yourself Should I really buy this If you can t answer that question then under no circumstances should you be making that trade If you want to get started in options you can watch the third video but understand that while options can have amazing returns they also come with great risk The video is 3 hours long so grab a snack and find a quiet spot where you can t be bothered That option video blew my mind and is one of the main reasons I am able to trade full time That video covers everything so I do not need to go more in depth here on options trading Now we come to something that is SO important but usually takes traders far too long to understand The order type video will save you so much money because it will help you understand why market orders are usually not the right way to go especially when you are trading large amounts of capital During this whole time you should have been practicing how to trade and you might have wondered what the order types meant when you went to buy a few shares of stock Again take notes and practice implementing what you have learned into your evolving trading style The next two videos are a great pair because the first one educates you on the emotional side of trading while the second video helps you learn to trade with a plan If you do not have your emotions under control I can tell you know that you will abandon that plan as soon as you see your account start to lose money You have to get rid of that sinking stomach feeling when the stocks not moving in the direction you want This definitely takes time but if you can mitigate these types of feelings you should have a solid understanding of how to start trading If you have time which most of you won t I recommend watching all of the tutorials again because you will take different things away from them compared to when you were just starting out Doing all of this may take a couple of weeks or a few months if you have a busy work and family life but I encourage to make the effort so you can live the good life Always remember why you started trading in the first place If you are just looking for fun or a quick buck you will probably end up losing way more than you ever imagined Hope you enjoyed

dish for fun and profit NCLH CCL RCL ,Happy Friday all NrdRage here You might remember me from such hits as knowing exactly where each GME weekly was going to end up getting people out of SNDL before it collapsed and starting a RIOT before it was cool amongst others Today I want to have a more gentle conversation with you Let s talk about cruise stonks amp x200B Wayne s World Flashback Humming Picture it It s 2020 The air is crisp with winter in the air you re blowing your student loans on the latest iPhone and your parents have decided to spend some of your inheritance on a 10 day Caribbean cruise because they re tired of shoveling snow and you ended up being their greatest disappointment anyways so why should they leave you some money So you could go blow it all on some SPY FD puts Screw that Carnival CCL was sitting at about 42 a share NCLH was at 52 RCL at 115 Everything in the world was in its place amp x200B Then mom and dad called you frantically to let you know that there was a bioattack upon the ship originating somewhere around the shuffleboard area Everybody was dying and the army wasn t letting them off the ship They wanted to let you know that they loved you but that they too had been buying SPY FD puts and had lost the rest of your inheritance and were waiting for the right time to tell you Things were looking really grim amp x200B As we all know predictably when the world shut down the cruise stonks got positively crushed Turns out having 0 in revenue is bad for stonk price Who knew But should they stay there Is there no longer a business model for beyond middle aged white people that want to spend a couple of weeks pretending they re alive as they partake in an entirely on the rails kiddie bumper adventure amp x200B Back to the present Advance bookings say otherwise as Boomers make a recreational bet on return to normal Take Norwegian for example They re advance bookings for 2021 is actually ahead of where they were in 2019 in spite of extending their global sailing boycott all the way to next May Royal Caribbean and Carnival both state that their 2021 bookings are back to exactly on par where they were before all this madness about spicy flu happened And these are just the people who are willing to fork over money right now that AREN T afraid of the scamdem oops I mean well you know Just wait until everybody gets emboldened by their plot armo I mean vaccinations More tellingly the vast majority of people who were booked on canceled cruises when given the choice between refunds or rollovers chose rollovers Dumb move since money now is better than money later but just another sign that we re all in a virtual simulation of Idiocracy Run with it Now add in the fact that as we open up people will be positively DESPERATE to go do something ANYTHING that s not in their house that they will positively crush any and all entertainment options especially travel So in a way this DD could actually apply to stonks like Cedar amp Six Flags or Disney or whoever sells fun depending on what your definition of that is Thanks to the K shaped recovery most people in this country are sitting on a pile of extra cash they re just waiting to blow on an enhanced vacation package of some sort amp x200B But let s look under the hood for a moment shall we The reason these 3 lines were able to stave off bankruptcy is threefold 1 they all raised debt to create liquidity That s generally bad but since the Fed has been a free money printing machine for a while they got some fantastic interest rates for that debt Matter of fact 2 of the 3 of them used that new debt to pay off older higher interest debt then took out new new debt to make up the difference 2 they all issued shares and created a small amount of dilution though in the case of Carnival they were in the middle of a stock buyback when this all happened so they basically ended up re issuing the shares they had bought Bad for short term balance sheets but long term lesser impact and 3 they ve been locked out of COVID related relief packages till now which means their turn in the queue is widely viewed as coming up for their shot at free money roulette At present it s looking like about a quarter billion dollars to them to bail them out They ve already been able to shift their portage losses directly to the ports in question so they saved some cash there as well amp x200B So using some napkin math and Yamazaki logic the only thing preventing these cruise lines from going right back to where they were before all this happened is if they find themselves in a credit crunch as the data shows that they will return to normal capacity operations in time So let s take a look at cash amp x200B amp x200B Cash on hand for the stonks https preview redd it lzteng2yohi61 png width 526 amp format png amp auto webp amp s cac095ff6d0525d4ee3df08350376aa02cf4fb21 amp x200B In the chart above I took the liberty of adding CUK which is Carnival s other stonk Really understanding this group I guess I should have listed that one as the primary so you feel more comfortable about it as you listen to your wife get railed by her boyfriend But I digress amp x200B OK so how much are they burning amp x200B amp x200B Moneys https preview redd it czyu0552qhi61 png width 532 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 824805099e9a3317413e0df26e49505dba8049c2 amp x200B Yeah all you know exactly what this looks like nobody knows better than WSB how to look at loss porn and these cruise lines have a lot of it The gist here is that Carnival and Norwegian are probably fine financially for at least another year with no new income and they have debt they haven t accessed yet at their disposal Royal Caribbean is in a little bit of a tighter spot as they re going to have to go to the banks for money in the next 6 months barring a government bailout Norwegian is in a particularly envious position because their debt levels are already lower than everybody else s and some of their smaller subsidiaries are going to be setting sail on those river cruises earlier which will staunch their bleeding as Europe re opens amp x200B Now because I know all you retards love talking about shorts and what not let s take a look at what Wall Street thinks of these stonks If they re going bankrupt they re going to lean their chipstack in on them right amp x200B Short interest https preview redd it w0lvq2wvrhi61 png width 519 amp format png amp auto webp amp s cb2eab882c75806f676e64ca6edd4e1bf4dea7f7 amp x200B Let s take a

smart money started piling in just before Christmas That s about when I got in on 2 of these as well But I felt it was an aggressive move at the time Especially since we were missing a lot of vaccination data as well as any forward guidance from these companies They ve since clarified their stance and the vaccination data shows that we were already going to be rolling out a million doses a day in spite of what one side of the aisle was claiming the mango was going to deliver on Volume tapered off to normal levels since then but has since started picking up on the upbeat news that should have effect on this particular industry amp x200B Outlook I m incredibly bullish on NCLH I m highly bullish on CCL RCL is a little more problematic to me looking at the total picture and I m pretty neutral on them overall bordering on skeptical I had more I wanted to talk about but I m tired of typing amp x200B So To summarize amp x200B Your Boomer parents are going to start getting on these boats again as soon as they start floating Unlike last time and thanks to the K shaped recovery they ll very likely splurge on the shore activity packages rather than cheap out and sit by the pool at every port this time since they have extra money to burn None of these companies are facing imminent financial threat and have not only secured solid credit lines and nice reserves to weather this storm without sinking get it Hah but actually showed their financial houses were pretty tight They ve always been reliable earners and will continue to be as they ramp back up This is a rare opportunity to get what is usually a slow moving Boomer stonk at a steep discount In the future they ll actually be able to make MORE money because they had COVID as an excuse to suspend dividends and don t think for a second they re going to be in a rush to bring those back even after shit returns to normal Your grandparents still don t love you either Buy a cruise ticket and you ll be sad but you ll have enough money to where you ll be able to find some 45 year old who s a bit on the brown side of ripe who nonetheless will be impressed by your stack of tendies and will probably still give you blowies as you try to reach down to get to the base of her sagging tiddies Also invest in some pharma plays for the inevitable increase in senior citizen STD s that s going to occur when they can leave th e nursing homes again Price targets NCLH Probably 46 by 2022 60 by 2023 CCL and CUK 35 by 2022 47 by 2023 For CUK subtract 5 bucks RCL 90 by 2022 96 by 2023 amp x200B How do you play it Well retard one thing you definitely don t do is play short term FD s on this Sorry I know how much you love them but have you considered shorting RIOT if you hate money You ll get the same effect but you can at least say you lost money on digital fake money which will make you rare The answer here is OTM leaps Position disclaimers amp x200B CCL 700 1 22 25c s I ll likely expand this position to 1000 options NCLH 2000 1 22 42 5c s I ll very likely add another 3000 2023 calls if there s some terrible news that causes a precipitous drop amp x200B All my love amp x200B Chad Dickens

questions to ask during future hearings I watched most of the hearing yesterday and quite frankly I was disgusted I was looking forward to the House Financial Services Committee really ask some serious hardball questions but I felt like we were let down Granted Representatives Anthony Gonzalez Michael San Nicholas Andy Barr AOC and especially Brad Sherman did ask some decent questions Unfortunately the majority of the representatives seemed to have no financial background whatsoever or they just hadn t done any real preparation for this hearing and had left it to their staffers instead Or they were using the opportunity to ask some serious questions to instead campaign for this financial transaction tax to fix all of our world s problems Unfortunately this financial transaction tax will just get passed on to retail investors through larger spreads and worse execution I won t comment about Rep Maxine Waters other than to say that I think she should have given a little extra time when representatives were about to get an answer to a really good question and that she probably could have used a bit more tech help You are doing a great job of wasting my time if you re going to filibuster you should run for the Senate was probably one of the best lines to come out of that hearing thank you Rep Brad Sherman for that My goal here is to simply discuss some of the tough questions that should have been asked or could potentially be asked at future hearings If anyone has some great questions to add feel free to post below For the record I don t have any position in GameStop or any of the highly shorted stocks discussed on this board but I have really enjoyed reading about the whole situation until the buy side of trading got frozen which I found to be an unparalleled market manipulation which resulted in the transfer of billions of dollars of wealth I am rooting for the WSB crowd from the sidelines and I hope everyone gets their tendies I do have my MBA and my investments specialize in rapidly growing tech stocks and biotechs In the five years that I have been investing I am currently up 4 654 as of writing this primarily with long positions on little to no margin with a few options I truly don t know the best way to get some of these questions into the hands of representatives other than just emailing the one that represents your district amp x200B Questions for Robinhood On January 28th Robinhood and several other brokers prevented their customers from purchasing shares of GameStop and multiple other stocks allegedly due to exponentially increased DTCC collateral requirements Customers were only allowed to sell their shares and new shares could not be purchased even with cash in non margin accounts In the days that followed customers were eventually able to buy extremely limited numbers of shares 1 to 5 shares if they didn t have any in their portfolio already What do you think happens when the vast majority of the buy side for a stock cannot buy and people can only sell The price plummets because there is no equilibrium no buying support Why wasn t the exchange NYSE contacted to freeze the stock Especially with options contracts being exercised the very next day coincidentally the rapid price reduction resulted in the transfer of billions of dollars of wealth away from retail investors Without the buy side being frozen out the stock price easily would have entered the thousands as the significant number of ITM calls started to get exercised at the expense of the hedge funds that had shorted GameStop into the dirt Do you have any concerns that your customers aren t truly getting best execution and best price with the payment for order flow model Is it possible or even probable that market makers either sell that order information or profit off of it by executing trades just prior to the order For instance a large Robinhood after hours order comes in to buy 1 000 shares of GameStop stock On Robinhood after hours and pre market orders are traditionally executed as limit orders due to the high volatility This also means that a firm or algorithm can see the exact price limit though What is to stop the market marker s investment branch or a firm that pays for that information from buying 1 000 shares and then selling them to the Robinhood customer at very close to their limit price resulting in potentially a 10 profit in a couple seconds Everyone can see limit prices if they have Level 2 stock quotes in real time But if you can see every single Robinhood order what is stopping viewers of that data from abusing it There is obviously a reason why Citadel pays Robinhood for the right to execute the bulk of their trades and it is a highly profitable business for them How much additional capital would you have to raise through equity or other options if GME s stock price hit 1 000 2 000 or even reached the moon during average trading volumes seen on Jan 27th and the days prior amp x200B Questions for DTCC What circumstances dictate how collateral requirements are set is there a specific formula or is it more subjective and at the discretion of management Why would collateral requirements increase exponentially overnight rather than progressively increasing over time There seems to be a significant amount of discretion with regard to setting these collateral requirements as they were able to be reduced twice during conversations with Robinhood Who owns DTCC hint it s the banks and brokers that own its common shares do they have any say in management decisions and who specifically made the decision to increase collateral requirements to 100 of the stock price Note that the House does have subpoena powers and could request copies of all communication between DTCC and the market makers and brokers involved in this issue amp x200B Questions for Melvin Capital You had informed CNBC that you closed out your short position on GME Every single article in the news referenced to this one comment by CNBC saying this all back to one point Can you confirm that you closed your entire short position that you are not currently short on GME and that you didn t just double down on your short positions Your statement would be technically accurate if you closed your original shorts and just started established new short positions immediately after but it is also extremely misleading if this was the case There are some concerns by many in the community that you are using the mainstream media particularly CNBC as a mouthpiece to spread false FUD to manipulate the stock price to your advantage At any time did you communicate with Robinhood or any of the other brokers which restricted the buy side of trading for several securities or did you communicate any of your concerns with Citadel the market maker which executes their trades We would also ask for copies of any conversations or communication that took place between your organization and these other entities amp x200B For a NYSE rep How did we ever get to a situation where over 140 of the float of an individual stock was short The vast majority of shares aren t allowed to be borrowed by short sellers unless the share owner consents or has automatically consented in a margin account agreement My understanding is this when a share is borrowed to short it also creates an imaginary long position that has voting rights when someone buys it whereas the person that lent the share temporarily loses their voting rights Additionally that person s imaginary share can be loaned out again for someone else to short If 100 of the longs allow their shares to be shorted you have a logarithmic curve where the long to short ratio approaches but never equals 1 2 longs to 1 short 3 longs to 2 shorts 4 longs to 3 shorts etc Can explain more about this if needed Would it be a good idea to only allow each share to only be shorted once meaning that a max of 100 of the float would be shorted It would make these short squeezes significantly less catastrophic where there physically aren t even enough shares to cover for weeks sometimes What can be somewhat crazy is that many people who have margin accounts don t even realize that their shares are being lent out to short sellers because of a document that they signed when opening the account which consents to it Why was trading not frozen with most retail investors being able to only sell and not buy even with cash not margin Notably this occurred the day before options contracts would be exercised In today s modern age why do we not have real time updates on short interest why doesn t everyone have equal access to level 2 stock quotes etc you can sometimes get it through the exchange itself Real time trade settlement would probably alleviate collateral requirements at the expense of causing significantly more electronic activity when settling each individual trade instead of giant batches of them T 1 or even same day settlement by market close might work best but it isn t my area of expertise Are there any other concerns with real time settlement Time to fix errors mistakes money laundering concerns anything else There has been some concern expressed over manipulation behind the scenes when people could only sell GME and not purchase any new shares or call options Some have looked at the bundles of 100 to 110 shares being repeatedly sold over and over lowering the price ten cents or so at a time cutting the stock price in half Are you able to look at the investors and or organizations that were buying and selling these shares during that time to confirm that it wasn t the same people selling the shares back and forth to tank the price in a so called short ladder attack Could ask the SEC this question as well amp x200B For the SEC While I have a great deal of respect for your organization particularly after reading some of the updates on your website with investigations that have concluded many people are concerned about the lack of severity for fines and penalties In an unprecedented action when investors couldn t buy a stock but could only sell it GME and several other stocks had their prices plummet This resulted in the theft of billions of dollars of wealth by this manipulation What are you doing to ensure that this never happens again If organizations are found to have been negligent and or engaged in foul play will the penalties be commensurate with the damage and be in the billions of dollars Or just a slap in the wrist with a few million dollar fine which is arguably why the brokers decided to take the action that they did it was better than losing hundreds of millions when they would have to pay the cost of shorts that could not afford to cover Some parties involved have argued that if GME s stock price had continued to rise at the rate it was before intervening the stock market could have been devastated or even collapsed in the ensuing tide of Failures to Deliver plus a chain reaction of inability to pay for covering short positions How could this occur under your watch Are the rules and regulations in place inadequate to prevent this from happening or were they simply not being enforced Naked short selling is illegal can you confirm whether or not 140 of the float being short did not involve any naked short selling Or was it simply short sold shares sold to longs that were being lent out to get sold short again in a cascade amp x200B TLDR There were a few decent questions yesterday a lot of the representatives were clueless Post your suggestions below

amp Management Team https www highwirenetworks com about https www highwirenetworks com about Conclusion Spectrum Global Solutions is an excellent company with a great subsidiaries portfolio Merging with High Wire Networks is a massive bonus for the company and will increase its value 10 fold Spectrum Global Solutions has a global presence that allows and will continue to allow them to reach global markets and clients Their potential for growth is limitless Their stock for investors at the moment is very attractive with the low outstanding shares and float With volume this stock will increase dramatically in my opinion Although their revenue is something that needs improvement as I mentioned with the global presence this is something that can be achieved This merger will bring a new board of management that can steer this company in the right direction to achieve those revenue targets High Wire Networks is a fantastic company that is well established and is producing revenue of 18 million dollars annually and has just been awarded a 2 8 million dollars contract to add to its current revenue The board of management will take over the management of Spectrum Global Solutions and rebrand the company As High Wire Networks is in the Cyber Security business cybersecurity has a 66 billion dollar market size thus giving the company a lot of room to grow https www globenewswire

strong these companies look and with the merger this will definitely push them a long way in the right direction to achieving this goal with ease Therefore I believe this ticker is a strong buy at 0 35 and I believe my PT s low 3 Medium 4 50 High 6 are justified from all of the above mentioned
