financial expert Though I wouldn t mind the input of better minded apes Please Read The Entire Post Before Telling Me To Fuck Off I am pointing at you SNDL algo bots Financial Disclosure At End That Includes One Day Gains STAR iStar Inc is a real estate investment trust REIT with a market cap of 1 28 billion dollars their primary focus is on ground leasing There are examples below where STAR gets their revenue under these circumstances of ground leasing 1 A factory in need of cash The factory will sell the land under their factory to STAR and then STAR will lease it back to the factory 49 of revenue 2 STAR purchases raw land develops the land and leases or sells the land to a new business 33 of revenue amp x200B STAR also provides other financing services to clients 12 of revenue amp x200B Before the pandemic STAR was an exceptional company that flourished with high earnings and I admit they have seen better days However I firmly believe the bad days are behind them now and I am placing a target price of 22 75 without any WSB fuckery They also recently increased their quarterly dividend to 0 125 to common stock holders That is 50 cents a year just sitting on the stock That is why it s marketed to mutual funds and ETFs as a relatively safe security Below is a one week chart of STAR After market today is currently sitting at 17 95 This can also be seen in my financial

attracted me to STAR was its short interest I know I know Oh god another short squeeze bullshit pitch Tough shit I think everyone and their Pewdiepie watching 9 year old child is looking for the next meme stock Now is there a potential squeeze situation here The fuck if I know But I will get into some key factors and you can make up your own bloody ape minds STAR has a total 70 24M shares in float

inflow into their funds Let us exclude these 22 04 million shares from float for the sake of the argument The real floated shares can be estimated to be 48 2 million shares and the short interest just above 30 The daily average volume traded is about 950k shares Most of the buying is conducted by ETFs and mutual funds Now let us say there was an increase in share price to 20 The shorts may start to cover their position But they won t be able to do it fast enough with the trading volume available to them They would need to recover 14 6 million shares when the daily average volume is 950k that is dominated by purchases by ETFs and Mutual Funds That would take them weeks of purchasing to cover during a normal trading environment All while the share price continue to climb due to increased

4357 Intro Grab a glass of your favorite vino maybe a nice cheese tray to accompany it in case you get hungry this is kinda long settle down somewhere comfortable and put your thinking cap on because this is the pibbliest first DD I present to you VWE a stock sure to tug at the heartstrings of wine lovers and alcoholics everywhere Vintage Wine Estates is a family of wineries and wines whose singular focus is producing the finest quality wines and incredible customer experiences Their words not mine but honestly how can you not have an incredible experience if you re half a bottle down VWE owns wineries throughout Napa Sonoma California s Central Coast Oregon and Washington State VWE s portfolio of wines and spirits includes GIRARD WINERY CLOS PEGASE SWANSON VINEYARDS B R COHN VIANSA SONOMA CAMERON HUGHES WINDSOR VINEYARDS LAETITIA LAYER CAKE BAR DOG FIRESTEED CELLARS CHERRY PIE GAZE GOUGUENHEIM MIDDLE SISTER WINES PURPLE COWBOY DELECTUS WINERY COSENTINO WINERY TAMARACK

VINEYARD References Before I begin most of the information I reference is pulled from the Management Information Circular dated April 9 2021 of Bespoke Capital Acquisition Corp yes it s a recently completed SPAC but don t give up on me keep reading A sentence followed by xx indicates the page number from which the information can be found I ve also copy pasted from the Vintage Wine Estates website www vintagewineestates com If the information comes from somewhere else I ll be sure to cite How They Make Revenue is generated from wholesale product sold to distributors wine and other merchandise sold direct to consumers through wine club memberships winery tasting rooms and via the internets The business to business segment sells private label wines and custom winemaking services and also offers storage services VWE also sells grapes and does off premise tastings for third party customers D 4 to D 5 Market Info Over 427m cases of wine are consumed annually in the U S with an estimated market of 47b There are over 10 000 wineries in the U S with about 50 indicating a willingness to sell in the next two years 1 more on why this is good news for VWE in just a moment Strengths VWE owns 9 winery estates and leases 3 and owns or controls over 900 acres of vineyards The company has likely completed more brand mergers and acquisitions in the last 10 years in the US than any other company in the industry As such VWE is experienced in integrating acquisitions into its production and distribution networks quickly increasing the sales and margins of the acquired business D 3 VWE has historical revenue growth of about 21 EBITDA growth 24 over the past ten years 1 Pro forma of the newly SPAC d company is valued at a 2022 estimated EV EBITDA of less than 13 and a price to earnings multiple of about 21 1 VWE stomps in the 10 and up premium and fine wines segment which has grown about 6 annually and the segment is expected to continue to grow at 6 per annum 1 The wine industry is recession resistant D 11 Good times people wanna party drink up bad times people wanna drink their sorrows away pour me another Weaknesses As an agriculturally dependent operation there is seasonality associated with revenue and net income think growing cycles processing transportation etc Expect to see lower sales and income January March and higher October through December D 10 Threats Interest rate risk VWE has a 350m credit facility available for use assuming maximum borrowing from the facility a 1 increase in the 30 day LIBOR rate would result in an interest expense of about 2m annually D 10 Raw materials price risk Wine depends on grapes so the price quality and availability of grapes is subject to any factors that affect supply and demand ex fires burning through Napa Valley bugs shitty weather drought etc VWE doesn t deal in futes so this leaves them exposed to price fluctuations D 10 NAPA aka Duckhorn portfolio A WVE competitor that makes some amazing wines Merlot is their premium varietal and they are also known for their Cabernet Sauvignon bottlings Duckhorn Vineyards has been named one of the Top 100 Wineries in the world seven times by Wine amp Spirits and the 2014 Duckhorn Vineyards Napa Valley Merlot Three Palms Vineyard was named the 2017 Wine of the Year by Wine Spectator Check out www duckhornportfolio com for more info Opportunities VWE expects to grow its business through more acquisitions Acquisition targets undergo a rigorous data driven due diligence and underwriting process to assure a meaningful upside in each transaction D 3 Going back to the market info section there are a lot of potential acquisition targets ripe for the picking Remember how the newly SPAC d company is valued at a 2022 estimated EV EBITDA of less than 13 and a price to earnings multiple of about 21 the most comparable company Duckhorn Vineyards NAPA which went public earlier this year currently trades about 21 5 times 2022 EV EBITDA and estimated PE of 45 I know you probably suck at numbers like I do but VWE 13 compared to NAPA 21 5 EV EBITDA and PE s for VWE 21 compared to NAPA 45 as of April mind you Wtf does that mean you say It means this thing has legs to run wine reference for all you snobs out there 1 NAPA is at 22 05 as of and VWE is 12 36 as of 6 8 21 so these numbers are slightly dated but you get the point TLDR Drink wine and go long VWE Positions 500 shares and 20 VWE 7 16 15c

d3123c8105bc22f485fadd3962e37fe5e9980dc2 BULL ARGUMENT Clean Energy is focused on developing owning and operating dairy and other livestock waste RNG projects and supplying RNG procured from their own projects or from third parties to their customers in the heavy and medium duty commercial transportation sector Clean Energy has participated in the alternative vehicle fuels industry for over 20 years and will argue they are the largest U S provider of RNG for commercial transportation Clean Energy is in a unique position because valuable Environmental Credits are generated by the party that dispenses RNG into vehicle fuel tanks and they have access to more dispensers than any other market participant As a comprehensive clean energy solutions provider Clean Energy designs and builds as well as operates and maintains public and private vehicle fleet customer stations in the United States and Canada sells and services compressors and other equipment used in RNG production and at fueling stations transports and sells their fuels via virtual natural gas pipelines and interconnects sells U S federal state and local government credits which they collectively refer to as

Energy to provide cleaner more carbon negative RNG BEAR ARGUMENT Clean Energy began to see the negative effects of COVID 19 on volumes delivered in mid March 2020 and continued to see declines in volumes delivered through December 31 2020 as compared to 2019 Their volumes bottomed in the second quarter of 2020 and improved through year end albeit at a slower pace than expected with volumes delivered for the fourth quarter of 2020 increasing 7 over the second quarter of 2020 While volumes delivered in December 2020 were 2 lower compared to December 2019 this decline was lower than the decline of 4 when comparing September 2020 to September 2019 The most significant negative effects of COVID 19 in relation to Clean Energy volumes were experienced in the airports fleet services and public transit customer markets which were down by between 15 and 31 during 2020 compared to 2019 due to federal state and local government mandates to restrict normal daily activities as well as travel bans quarantines and shelter in place orders Other risk factors Clean Energy may face include The willingness of fleets and other consumers to adopt Clean Energy vehicle fuels which may be influenced by certain of the factors many of which are beyond their control Competition in the market for vehicle fuels generally and the nature and effect of competitive developments in the market Suppliers ability to successfully develop and operate projects and produce expected volumes of RNG particularly in light of a long and variable development cycle that requires significant resource commitments The potential commercial viability of livestock waste and dairy farm projects to produce RNG The development and production of vehicles and engines in key customer and geographic markets by vehicle and engine manufacturers over which Clean Energy has no control CONCLUSION I am bullish on Clean Energy and I agree they are currently undervalued https simplywall st stocks us energy

conventional natural gas in the form of compressed natural gas and liquefied natural gas for the United States and Canadian transportation markets Renewable natural gas which is delivered as either

amp s 030161b4d0242ce4fd02ff4c7cf999d8a478279d BULL ARGUMENT Clean Energy is focused on developing owning and operating dairy and other livestock waste projects and supplying renewable natural gas procured from their own projects or from third parties to their customers in the heavy and medium duty commercial transportation sector Clean Energy has participated in the alternative vehicle fuels industry for over 20 years and will argue they are the largest U S provider of renewable natural gas for commercial transportation Clean Energy is in a unique position because valuable Environmental Credits are generated by the party that dispenses renewable natural gas into vehicle fuel tanks and they have access to more dispensers than any other market participant As a comprehensive clean energy solutions provider Clean Energy designs and builds as well as operates and maintains public and private vehicle fleet customer stations in the United States and Canada sells and services compressors and other equipment used in renewable natural gas production and at fueling stations transports and sells their fuels via virtual natural gas pipelines and interconnects sells U S federal state and local government credits which they collectively refer to as Environmental Credits they generate by selling renewable natural gas as a vehicle fuel obtains federal state and local tax

chevron clean energy fuels extend adopt a port initiative to reduce emissions 01620727503 tesla y with Clean Energy to provide cleaner more carbon negative renewable natural gas BEAR ARGUMENT Clean Energy began to see the negative effects of COVID 19 on volumes delivered in mid March 2020 and continued to see declines in volumes delivered through December 31 2020 as compared to 2019 Their volumes bottomed in the second quarter of 2020 and improved through year end albeit at a slower pace than expected with volumes delivered for the fourth quarter of 2020 increasing 7 over the second quarter of 2020 While volumes delivered in December 2020 were 2 lower compared to December 2019 this decline was lower than the decline of 4 when comparing September 2020 to September 2019 The most significant negative effects of COVID 19 in relation to Clean Energy volumes were experienced in the airports fleet services and public transit customer markets which were down by between 15 and 31 during 2020 compared to 2019 due to federal state and local government mandates to restrict normal daily activities as well as travel bans quarantines and shelter in place orders Other risk factors Clean Energy may face include The willingness of fleets and other consumers to adopt Clean Energy vehicle fuels which may be influenced by certain of the factors many of which are beyond their control Competition in the market for vehicle fuels generally and the nature and effect of competitive developments in the market Suppliers ability to successfully develop and operate projects and produce expected volumes of renewable natural gas particularly in light of a long and variable development cycle that requires significant resource commitments The potential commercial viability of livestock waste and dairy farm projects to produce renewable natural gas The development and production of vehicles and engines in key customer and geographic markets by vehicle and engine manufacturers over which Clean Energy has no control CONCLUSION According to Simplywall st https preview redd it bwl9boec16471 png width 854 amp format png amp auto webp amp s ad876df7da5412f5496a49e1d2e8bea321680254 I

51604070672 Super Bowl ad https youtu be 1AgNKbHQQxc with Will Ferrel Now for my opinion All this news IS NOT priced in and GM should trade at 20x PE 100 share price vs 54 today in the next 3 24 months Why 1 Income generated per vehicle could grow dramatically in the future as you can squeeze residual revenue streams from each car you sell As Tesla has started to prove people will pay for autonomy over the air performance upgrades media internet connections insurance offerings 2 Autonomy and battery tech is becoming a moat in the auto industry Brands like Jeep and Ford may not go away but the few companies who have battery and autonomy advantage will become the manufacturer and operating system for all brands I believe GM is one of the companies that will emerge as a leader 3 Just as analysts failed to find the right PT for Tesla and doubted its survival back in 2019 GM hasn t changed the narrative yet I could be wrong but even at close to all time highs I think this stock has A LOT of room to run If Tesla traded at 25x sales let s say GM should be 1 2x vs 5 today due to potential margin expansion 4 I like Tesla but look around Everyone drives a different style car and not everyone is going to want a CyberTruck GM doesn t need to be a Tesla killer just competitive enough to retain share of truck and fleet sales I m long GM This isn t financial advice I just like the stock so do your own research Edit To the question of whether the news is priced in I think the negative comments on this post suggest GM s future in EVs battery tech and autonomy is NOT priced in if the forward PE ratio relative to 2021 EPS wasn t already enough evidence The question in my mind is whether GM Cruise will be able to execute but the fact they already have driverless taxis in SF and top selling EV in China seems to me like they re headed in the right direction Source https www reddit com r StockMarket comments lek3jh general motors i like the stock https www reddit com r

DD,This post largely targets the troll s claims and the biggest fud when it comes to CLOV If you are a close minded ape apes trashing other apes stock are not true apes who thinks no stock can squeeze besides theirs I suggest you stop reading now Reposting my post that got 360 upvotes in 30 mins but then suddenly got removed for no apparent reason I guess the mods don t like our CLOVER Let s fucking fly this week Little add on from my last post A lot of trolls want to talk about Citadel owning shares of CLOV but don t want to mention the fact that Citadel also has 1 8 percent ownership in AMC This information comes straight from fintel Security AMC AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc Institution Citadel Advisors Llc Manager Ken Griffin Ownership 1 80 Citadel Advisors Llc ownership in AMC AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc Citadel Advisors Llc has a history of taking positions in derivatives of the underlying security AMC in the form of stock options The firm currently holds 4 110 000 call options valued at 41 963 000 USD So by your own logic trolls AMC is a pump and dump distraction from GME which went up only to get people away from GME Oh wait but then you find out CITADEL owns 20 thousand shares of GME as well IS EVERYTHING A PUMP AND DUMP MADE BY CITADEL Well no they own thousands of shares in thousands of stock because they are market makers Any troll still mentioning Citadel s ownership in CLOV just wants to create fud so less people move from their stock to other stocks The truth is there is no reason we all can t move up together we are all in the meme stock gang where we are all fighting shorts and hedge funds Why not be a team If we destroy them in every stock they manipulate that will give us a better chance of getting them margin called When we just squeeze one stock they can just liquidate the other stocks they manipulate Don t listen to apes trying to trash other s stocks CLOV short squeeze is happening whether you like it or not I do not yet own a position in CLOV but I plan to do so tomorrow after seeing price movement data today it is literally just a AMC situation which I was also in and made a 3x return on all over again This looks like the first day of crazy volatility and i expect this to continue until after the last day when the stock price jumps the most when retail investors cover now let s get into the data to show why this is actually a even better setup then AMC for a retail short squeeze Disclaimer no where in this post am I saying hedge funds have covered in AMC yet so you die hard apes don t need to spam me with hate comments Now let s get into it If you go over to fintel you will see volume today was 700 MILLION Yes you heard that correctly CLOV which has a 112 million share float had on average every share traded 7 TIMES IN ONE F CKING DAY For reference AMC in it s glory days had like 800 million in volume with a 500 million float Now there are multiple explanations to why there was so much volume 1 Is a bunch of day traders and machines came in to make a quick profit on top of all the apes scooping their shares right up to own the float Or 2 Hedge funds with synthetic shares which is most likely Today alone there was 200 million shares sold short while fintel was showing 0 shares available all day How the hell is 200 million shares shorted possible with 0 shares available Now keep in mind that most of these synthetics would have been bought right back by a machine after no less then a second to make a 1 percent return on them because if they just sold 200 million shares at a time to the open market the price would be at 2 dollars right now but it still shows the manipulation and the desperation from them to keep the stock price suppressed Either way all the volume on top of the synthetics show how much new apes are coming in and buying up the float there has been 0 or close to 0 shares available to borrow for a day or two now meaning retail can t actually double down on their short positions or open new ones which also means with continued losses they will be forced to cover since they can t average up Now If we go over to ortex or ortex s twitter we can see that CLOV currently has 51 million shares that are borrowed and waiting to be returned That is 45 percent of the float A 45 percent short interest compared to AMC before retail covered was around 30 percent With just a 4th of the buying power compared to AMC our short squeeze can take us to 100 easily our float is a 4th of AMC s If we can achieve the same kind of cult following that AMC got we are looking at a GME TYPE OF RUN And for the love of all that is holy guys please wait to buy until 8 30 AM eastern so I can pick up shares before it goes to 50 appreciate it And for you apes that only buy when you see rocket porn here ya go By the way I say retail can t short the stock when there is zero shares available because hedge funds can do whatever the fuck they want with synthetic

POPEYES The best frickin chicken sandwich on the face of the earth and frankly much better chicken than Wendy s sorry but it s true They also have fabulous rice and tendies Not to mention their french fries fry the competition Point is it s freaking delicious Remember when people killed each other over the chicken sandwiches Yeah Supply and demand bitches Here s the skivvy Popeye s was bought by Restaurant Brands International QSR in 2017 a Canadian corporation that also owns Burger King and Tim Horton s We have QSR to thank for the chicken sandwiches so they aren t totally incompetent Popeyes is an objectively better restaurant than Tim Horton s and Burger King Not that Burger King and Horton s are bad but Popeye s bears far greater growth prospects All Burger King and Horton s locations really should become joint Popeyes locations i e selling Popeye s kush in addition to whatever was going on there s strong synergy between donuts and Chicken Oooo that sounds freaking good a donut chicken breakfast sandwhich Anyway this doesn t need to happen for QSR to go to the moon but it really should happen to boost the BK and Horton laggards Here s what makes QSR attractive Popeye s if you haven t already guessed Popeye s major growth is in overseas expansion Popeye s currently has 3 400 stores worldwide People everywhere want to open Popeyes franchises QSR needs to get the logistics capacity and reach to let them do so in all parts of the world and they are steadily entering new countries each year They need to turbocharge this and issuing more shares at a higher stock price will help them do so ASIA KFC has become a cultural staple in China which has over 7 000 stores But as we all know Popeye s has objectively better chicken than KFC THE KERNEL IS NO MATCH FOR THE FREAKING POPE There s tremendous growth opportunity there to become the dominant chicken chain QSR has the meek goal of getting 1 500 stores in China in the next decade which alone is a 50 increase in the number of total stores 1 Our goal make every KFC in China into a Popeyes Or just have a Popeye s for every KFC in China Either way chicken domination Popeye s Shanghai opening saw a huge crowd of like 2 000 people who waited hours in line 1 There s already a following Who missed the infamous chicken sandwich wars on Twitter There s also plans to open a few hundred stores in India Nepal and Bangladesh 2 UK amp EUROPE Popeyes is entering UK in 2021 aiming for 350 stores in the next decade which builds on successful entry into Spain amp Switzerland in last two years 3 OTHER ATTRACTIVE QUALITIES The Popeye s twitter account is bomb Chicken Sandwich Wars Popeye s was Anthony Bourdain s RIP favorite chain restaurant Chicken is a much better meat for the environment than cow and pig meat requiring 1 8th and 1 4th respectively the energy to produce per gram 5 Also less space required less religious dietary restrictions on chicken Lab grown chicken meat may more readily resemble chicken chicken texture i e it s probably going to be harder to get cow and pig cells to differentiate into the various relative compositions and arrangements of the preferred meat while chicken breast is mostly one cell type I am speculating on this last sentence Shrimp also bear some ecological promise OTHERWISE QSR has propagated rumors in the recent past 2019 to buy a FOURTH restaurant chain 4 see source If the stock price rises enough they could issue more shares to acquire the capital to do so THE GAMEPLAN buy QSR shares Get price high enough 100ish to have them issue more shares to buy a FOURTH restaurant chain Advocate most locations of Tim Horton s and Burger King be made joint Popeye s locations and advocate a freaking chicken donut sandwich New Internet Sensation Breakfast menu with monte cristo like thing would also be bomb Perhaps a burger with chicken for buns would be good too Hm After successfully buying a fourth restaurant chain and the other above proposals QSR should change its listing to POPE because Popeyes is the POPE of chicken SO Are you in or are you chicken Disclosures I bought 100 in QSR around 65 Might buy a lot more soon There s not much here for a short squeeze I just freaking love Popeye s idk about Horton s and Burger King I just see them as potential Popeye s locations again not closing them just selling Popeyes stuff there

to a good broker Introduction Lots of companies have been hurt terribly by covid 19 and one that was already performing poorly before the pandemic was Europcar As the name says Europcar Mobility Group S A is Europe s biggest rental car company Partially focused on tourists Europcar saw its demand collapse during 2020 and its stock hasn t done anything remotely different Although the stock price was slowly falling since 2017 when it shortly hit 13 2020 was the final straw with a low of 0 25 Since then our precious European motherfucker has gone back to 0 40 but IMO there s no reason it shouldn t go above 1 before the end of the summer and perhaps 1 5 before the end of the year Financials When looking at the financial situation of Europcar please don t think their 3B in debt is bad It s actually really good I m going to compare Europcar to Avis a company that is already 3x higher than PRE PANDEMIC PRICES amp x200B Europcar https preview redd it mjnpyxvfl7471 png width 871 amp format

dfafe13339024e1f70bfcf20a2ee2189e1226fd2 You might think How did Europcar got so much money last year Well they did a debt restructuring that royally FUCKED shareholders back then But now they have a fuck ton of money in the bank to invest once the pandemic is fully over Also look at that juicy 1 5B of equity while Europcar has a market cap of 1 8B Post pandemic outlook Like any company that relies on tourism Europcar has had a rough year but the pandemic is almost over and now is the time to look at the future Slowly countries are opening up and there is no doubt about the fact that tourists will be welcome across Europe this summer although Europcar operates outside Europe this is by far their biggest market Europcar themselves expect to be operating normally at 2019 levels by 2023 1 But there s something they didn t account for in those expectations The car shortage a blessing in disguise At first you d think that a shortage in new cars is bad for rental car companies since it s their most important supply but you d be mistaken Because of the pandemic all rental car companies quickly reduced their fleet But now they can t buy any This is leading to a rental car shortage which means SUPER FUCKING HIGH OPERATING MARGINS In some places rental cars are going for FOUR TIMES the price compared to PRE PANDEMIC prices I ll repeat that 4 FUCKING TIMES Those cars will make over 75 profit With Europe slowly opening up for tourists this might go even further Peak season is almost starting And lets not forget Europcar still owns a fuck ton of relatively new cars The value of those cars will depreciate a lot slower than normal making them EVEN MORE profitable coming years The chip shortage is not ending quickly since car manufacturers are still last in line for the production of their chips Long run bull case The long run case is rather simple The rental car market is going to grow 2 In the coming years a worldwide growth of 15 is expected and Europcar has the ability to profit a lot off this growth Before the pandemic hit Europcar was actually growing in 2020 as well while in the years prior to the pandemic Europcar saw a year on year revenue growth of 7 8 In the future Europcar is also aiming to aim more at b2b operations as well making them less dependent on tourism although tourism is also expected to grow in the coming years Usually this would attract new competitors but this is a market that requires a lot of capital in order to enter It does not seem likely that many new competitors will pop up and steal a big part of their market share There are not too many competitors in the rental car market and there s also not a big risk of any new players joining too Starting a rental car company is VERY capital intensive Tl dr and PT This European Motherfucker will it s way to over 1 by the end of the summer and 1 5 by the end of the year as this summer will be their MOST PROFITABLE EVER They also have more money on the bank compared to last 5 years This stock has not boomed yet but it s undervalued AS FUCK d Solid investment for this summer My holdings Currently own 2200 0 3854 since I m a poor eurocuck student but I ve been

sorry for you fucking idiots who haven t switched from RH yet because this gem is not available on there Fuck you by the way get the fuck out of that hellhole and switch to a good broker Introduction Lots of companies have been hurt terribly by covid 19 and one that was already performing poorly before the pandemic was Europcar As the name says Europcar Mobility Group S A is Europe s biggest rental car company Partially focused on tourists Europcar saw its demand collapse during 2020 and its stock hasn t done anything remotely different Although the stock price was slowly falling since 2017 when it shortly hit 13 2020 was the final straw with a low of 0 25 Since then our precious European motherfucker has gone back to 0 40 but IMO there s no reason it shouldn t go above 1 before the end of the summer and perhaps 1 5 before the end of the year Financials When looking at the financial situation of Europcar please don t think their 3B in debt is bad It s actually really good I m going to compare Europcar to Avis a company that is already 3x higher than PRE PANDEMIC PRICES Europcar https preview redd it hk77kzutt7471 png width 605 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5a2869fc4d740d970cb569b8a53f4cc87ff533e2 Avis budget group CAR https preview redd it vt3i1c1vt7471 png width 605 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 97936ec26b8355d32f47349e66e56e79e5b5130e You might think How did Europcar got so much money last year Well they did a debt restructuring that royally FUCKED shareholders back then But now they have a fuck ton of money in the bank to invest once the pandemic is fully over Also look at that juicy 1 5B of equity while Europcar has a market cap of 1 8B Post pandemic outlook Like any company that relies on tourism Europcar has had a rough year but the pandemic is almost over and now is the time to look at the future Slowly countries are opening up and there is no doubt about the fact that tourists will be welcome across Europe this summer although Europcar operates outside Europe this is by far their biggest market Europcar themselves expect to be operating normally at 2019 levels by 2023 1 But there s something they didn t account for in those expectations The car shortage a blessing in disguise At first you d think that a shortage in new cars is bad for rental car companies since it s their most important supply but you d be mistaken Because of the pandemic all rental car companies quickly reduced their fleet But now they can t buy any This is leading to a rental car shortage which means SUPER FUCKING HIGH OPERATING MARGINS In some places rental cars are going for FOUR TIMES the price compared to PRE PANDEMIC prices I ll repeat that 4 FUCKING TIMES Those cars will make over 75 profit With Europe slowly opening up for tourists this might go even further Peak season is almost starting And lets not forget Europcar still owns a fuck ton of relatively new cars The value of those cars will depreciate a lot slower than normal making them EVEN MORE profitable coming years The chip shortage is not ending quickly since car manufacturers are still last in line for the production of their chips Long run bull case The long run case is rather simple The rental car market is going to grow 2 In the coming years a worldwide growth of 15 is expected and Europcar has the ability to profit a lot off this growth Before the pandemic hit Europcar was actually growing in 2020 as well while in the years prior to the pandemic Europcar saw a year on year revenue growth of 7 8 In the future Europcar is also aiming to aim more at b2b operations as well making them less dependent on tourism although tourism is also expected to grow in the coming years Usually this would attract new competitors but this is a market that requires a lot of capital in order to enter It does not seem likely that many new competitors will pop up and steal a big part of their market share There are not too many competitors in the rental car market and there s also not a big risk of any new players joining too Starting a rental car company is VERY capital intensive Tl dr and PT This European Motherfucker will it s way to over 1 by the end of the summer and 1 5 by the end of the year as this summer will be their MOST PROFITABLE EVER They also have more money on the bank compared to last 5 years This stock has not boomed yet but it s undervalued AS FUCK d Solid investment for this summer My holdings Currently own 2200 0 3854 since I m a poor eurocuck student but I ve been slowly adding more to the bunch 1 https www fleeteurope com

Disclosure At End That Includes One Day Gains Processing img fth4z466y7471 STAR iStar Inc is a real estate investment trust REIT with a market cap of 1 28 billion dollars their primary focus is on ground leasing There are examples below where STAR gets their revenue under these circumstances of ground leasing 1 A factory in need of cash The factory will sell the land under their factory to STAR and then STAR will lease it back to the factory 49 of revenue 2 STAR purchases raw land develops the land and leases or sells the land to a new business 33 of revenue amp x200B STAR also provides other financing services to clients 12 of revenue amp x200B Before the pandemic STAR was an exceptional company that flourished with high earnings and I admit they have seen better days However I firmly believe the bad days are behind them now and I am placing a target price of 22 75 without any WSB fuckery They also recently increased their quarterly dividend to 0 125 to common stock holders That is 50 cents a year just sitting on the stock That is why it s marketed to mutual funds and ETFs as a relatively safe security Below is a one week chart of STAR Premarket today is currently sitting at 17 95 up 6 5 in one day This can also be seen in my financial disclosure at the bottom amp x200B amp x200B Source Ortex com https preview redd it rewwuy9hx7471 png width 805 amp format png

think everyone and their Pewdiepie watching 9 year old child is looking for the next meme stock Now is there a potential squeeze situation here The fuck if I know But I will get into some key factors and you can make up your own bloody ape minds STAR has a total 70 24M shares in float or the number of shares that are currently available to the market Of those shares 20 79 or 14 6 million are shorted These are the exchange reported numbers provided by Ortex However Ortex estimates the true number of shares shorted is 15 79 million Source Ortex and Images Provided Below amp x200B amp x200B

shares in float 31 39 are held by ETFs and mutual funds Source https www etfchannel com etfs symbol star https www etfchannel com etfs symbol star Image provided below amp x200B These 22 04 million shares are essentially locked away from the shorts There is only 1 way for the shorts to gain access to these shares and that is to buy up all outstanding shares in each mutual fund ETF and force redemption That is unlikely For example IJR is the largest holder of STAR among the ETFs and it s worth over 72 billion dollars Source https www etfchannel com symbol ijr https www etfchannel com symbol ijr amp x200B Processing img b52ayqjoz7471 With 22 04 million shares and ever increasing with cash inflows into mutual funds and ETFs Yes these funds are purchasing a steady supply each day due to cash inflow into their funds Let us exclude these 22 04 million shares from float for the sake of the argument The real floated shares can be estimated to be 48 2 million shares and the short interest just above 30 The daily average volume traded is about 950k shares Most of the buying is conducted by ETFs and mutual funds Now let us say there was an increase in share price to 20 The shorts may start to cover their position But they won t be able to do it fast enough with the trading volume available to them They would need to recover 14 6 million shares when the daily average volume is 950k that is dominated by purchases by ETFs and Mutual Funds That would take them weeks of purchasing to cover during a normal trading environment All while the share price continue to climb due to increased buying pressure Melt up Below is an image of how long it took the shorts to build up their short interest Hedgies would have to fight each other for the shares Someone go make some memes of Hedgies fighting each other Think of it as a 3 way tug of war between Hedge Funds Mutual Funds and Apes Where mutual funds need to purchase due to cash inflows shorts need to cover and apes

you have all seen the post pandemic housing boom and the effects it has had on lumber prices going through the roof Many of these houses are being built in suburban areas where backyard pools are very popular Having a pool is not just a one time expense like building a house would be Pools require constant maintenance and expensive servicing and chemicals almost like owning a pet you re always buying something else for it There are 5 2 million residential inground pools in the U S and 255 000 commercial pools It is estimated that 60 70 of these pools use chlorine tablets There are an estimated 200 000 new swimming pool purchases in 2020 2021 a dramatic increase Adding pool permits has seen 32 year on year growth The rapidly rising number of new pool owners combined with a major chemical plant fire in Lousiana has caused an upcoming massive chlorine shortage Chlorine prices in some areas have already doubled Chlorine prices are expected to spike up to 70 this summer There is one company that is uniquely poised to benefit the most from these circumstances that company is Leslie s Swimming Pool Supplies Ticker LESL amp x200B https preview redd it yzmj30eip8471 jpg width 150

chlorine tablets just pass on the added costs to Leslie s Well aren t we in luck turns out Leslie manufacturers their own chlorine tablets This puts them in a great position as one of their competitors literally burned down 45 of Leslie s sales come from chemicals They make and sell the chlorine tablets with almost half of their business coming from chemical sales the majority of that being chlorine amp x200B https preview redd it sqvnmgfnp8471 jpg width 300 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 941ccf0eedaa2e1ca060286cbf61ab5de79eb586 Financials Leslie s just became publicly traded last fall They have had 57 consecutive years of sales growth with a 7 1 sales CAGR since 2001 They recently recorded record 2021 Q2 earnings They had sales of 192 4 million an increase of 52 3 from the prior year quarter They had a net loss of 6 5 million compared to 29 8 million in the prior year quarter They adjusted EBITDA of 9 5 million compared to 8 1 million in the prior year quarter an improvement of 17 6 million They also raised their fiscal 2021 sales outlook by 75 million Adjusted EBITDA by 25 million and Adjusted net income per share by 0 10 Gross profit increased 79 6 to 71 7 million from 39 9 million in the second quarter of 2020 and gross margin was 37 2 compared to 31 6 in the second quarter of 2020 an increase of 567 basis points amp x200B https preview redd it

and the other is not a favorable investment in my opinion Another bear idea would be to just invest in one of their competitions like POOL who would seem undervalued compared to LESL at a short glance POOL primarily deals in the selling of construction equipment for the building of the pools and is not as favorably positioned as LESL on the chemical and pool upkeep side Obviously I did not spend a lot of time on this section because I m not an idiot who believes the collapse of the global financial sector is imminent amp x200B https preview redd it 9l2wuqhqp8471 jpg width 300 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 9640702b9cc4c682321e6d24c61c45b739c059a8 Wrapping it up I think LESL is a very favorable play for the upcoming summer I think with the mass vaccinations people will want to hang out with friends by the pool more than ever and the upcoming shortage and amount of pools built is already proof of that Another thing to keep in mind is the summer Olympics this summer could make people want to swim Positions 6 8 21 30 strike calls This is not financial advice spend your money however you want

stocks Well DKNG is the US market leader in online betting in the US DraftKings is expecting 1 1B in revenue this year but the company will post a heavy net loss due to its high cash burn rate DraftKings is losing money every year as it tries to aggressively scale its growth PENN another US favorite has several billion in lease obligations due to its physical casinos SuperGroup is fully online and already profitable No Capex costs are a major plus Here s the formula for SuperGroup s success Spin is a profitable online casino Betway is unprofitable but growing quickly Free Cash Flow from Spin fuels growth for Betway which then expands SuperGroup s brand and brings more customers to both business branches Spin is the cash cow that fuels the overall machine and Betway is the source of future revenue growth Unlike DraftKings SuperGroup won t have to issue new equity to have the cash needed for its growth Okay so what Another betting play Well let s look at the valuations https

will stack on top of the projections listed above SG is trading at 2 9x sales if it never places one bet in the US The company doesn t need to win the US market it just needs to take a small piece of

AND ripe for short squeeze amp x200B amp x200B The Punchline CoreCivic CXW is a former REIT that owned and operated private prisons The progressives hate private prisons and have driven this stock down almost 80 since 2015 after threatening to end Federal contracts with the company and pressuring banks to stop lending them money At the current price of 9 30 the stock now trades at multiples that question it as a going concern 3 6x CY21E P FFO vs 13 14x historically I believe we have just witnessed 3 major catalysts over the past few months that should permanently dispel the current prevailing bias and that the company should start making its way towards my estimated fair value of 20 115 upside The stock looks to be breaking out By the way the company has the full backing of Michael Burry Big Short guy who has more than 10 of his portfolio in the stock If you re worried about inflation and or social unrest post COVID buy prisons Net net the company should not be valued as if it were going bankrupt Once the company meets its leverage targets by mid 2023 they will commence buybacks at a 28 30 FFO yield which will unlock the value in shares even if other investors don t want to Get in now before it s too late amp x200B https preview redd it wyrxjje5u8471 png width 933 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f70a53086cea6be8d5436d076f22c8394ee6c8c6 The Numbers 3 6x CY21E P

needs it given positive cash flow generation Capital allocation priorities pay down debt then return cash to shareholders Model Assumptions 7 5 WACC 1 long term growth 100 of existing BOP revenues disappear after 3 years 25 of existing USMS revenues disappear after 3 years 2 of existing ICE revenues disappear after 3 years occupancy rates normalize to 79 by 2023 from 74 today unit revs grow 3 trend like capacity declines 2 per year trend like EBIT margins stable at 11 3 5 reinvestment rate all incremental cash flow is used to pay down debt until 2023 Company Background CoreCivic has 3 main business segments Safety Community and Properties Safety is a nice word for prisons and makes up 90 of 2020 revenues So this is the most important segment we need to worry about Around 85 of revenues come from the US State and Federal governments Within Federal 52 of revs ICE immigration is 28 USMS US Marshals Service is 21 and BOP Bureau of Prisons is 3 These breakdowns are important because we need to assess the degree to which Biden has the power and means to cancel contracts with CXW ICE 28 falls under Department of Homeland Security DHS does not have its own detention facilities VERY difficult to cancel private contracts without other options HIGH demand given border crisis USMS 21 falls under DHS does not have its own detention facilities VERY difficult to cancel private contracts without other options BOP 3 falls under the Department of Justice DOJ DOJ was the target of Biden s latest EO to cancel private prison contracts does own and operate its own detention facilities easier to cancel private contracts US State Prisons 32 fall under jurisdiction of states meaning Biden can t touch In a realistic base case scenario it s likely you would only see BOP contracts terminated with maybe some USMS contracts in jeopardy And Biden may have already turned his attention to other priorities on his agenda after issuing his EO and declaring victory on private prisons earlier this year The prison government relationship is SYMBIOTIC much like that of US China trade It s impossible to totally get rid of it So the most important questions How quickly can the company deleverage and re prioritize shareholder returns I expect the company to meet leverage targets by 2023 meaning guidance on shareholder buybacks may come as early as mid 2022 Do political headwinds pose a risk to cash flow and its ability to execute on capital allocation priorities No BOP only makes up 3 of revenues and I don t expect a material reduction in contracts from ICE and USMS But even in a conservative scenario where 25 of existing USMS contracts and 2 of ICE contracts are terminated I still get my price target of 20 In a bear case where all BOP USMS ICE revenues disappear

Shedding REIT Status for C Corp Status Effective Jan 1 2021 As a REIT the company was forced to return 90 of its cash flows back to investors But given the unique situation the company has been in i e concerns around industry longevity inability to access debt at attractive rates due to pressure on financial institutions the company decided in 4Q20 to convert from REIT status to C Corp status It can now use its cash flow any way that it wants and it s prioritizing paying down debt so it doesn t have to rely on the ridiculous cost of debt it s being penalized with Obviously the stock collapsed since anyone who owned this thing for dividends no longer wanted it But now that s out of the way and the company is making progress on deleveraging amp x200B https preview redd it dvn3h4vcu8471 png

sales of 100mm and refinanced some debt to push out maturities beyond 2023 This development speaks to the company s ability and determination to pursue deleveraging goals and boosts credibility https

This is major and what s driving the recent breakout In April the USMS decided not to renew their existing contract with CoreCivic at the Northeast Ohio correctional facility The news that the company was able to fill that capacity with a new contracts speaks to outside demand for their facilities In other words even if some contracts from the Federal government are terminated the company can likely find demand from other clients to replace them i e local state governments etc Impressive Upcoming Catalysts Earnings Early August The company has been adversely impacted by COVID occupancy rates collapsed as social distancing measures and early releases have reduced the inmate population I would expect that with vaccines widely distributed and a return to normalcy that we should continue to see operations recover during upcoming earning releases Additional progress on deleveraging would be viewed favorably REDDIT SHORT SQUEEZE OF THE PRIVATE PRISON STOCKS Reference https

meme stocks In fact meme stocks may be immune to this gayness because they have nothing to do with market fundamentals or real economic data which is what I think is going to drive a selloff When Starting tomorrow and lasting as short as 2 weeks or as long as a few months with a hot CPI number as the catalyst For those of you who don t know and are literally trading stocks without paying attention to anything going on in the economy the CPI Consumer Price Index number is the main gauge of inflation How big 10 or more depending on the magnitude of the CPI beat Why A feedback loop driven by algorithms that trade based on bond market data Why should I give a shit about the bond market I don t trade bonds and think bonds are for fucking nerds and boomers but if you ve been in the market since the beginning of the year you know that the bonds specifically 10 year treasuries are arguably the most important market drivers in the world The bond market is about twice as big as the stock market and the price action of bonds dictates the movement of the stock market to a large degree A big swing in the bond market has the potential to completely fuck the dynamics of the stock market and the CPI When bonds get bought the 10 year yield goes down and when they get sold the yield goes up The 10 year yield also goes up in response to inflation and dictates the mortgage rate one can get at a given time the interest rate at which businesses can borrow money etc It is therefore a very important indicator for earnings predictions and general economics Algorithms which account for about 80 of stock market volume either directly look at the 10 year yield to make trades or derive earnings estimates and other money flow from the 10 year yield What have 10 year treasuries been doing lately At the beginning of the year there was a correction based on a rising 10 year yield that was particularly bad for growth and tech stocks that do well in a low interest rate environment The 10 year yield has been very low over the past year because when the market crashed the fed enacted historically dovish monetary policy to bolster stocks and the overall economy One of the policies the fed enacted was purchasing of bonds by the US treasury in order to keep the 10 year yield stable In recent months there has been talk of a taper tantrum wherein the fed begins to phase out those stabilizing purchases as the economy recovers Powell has been adamant that he will keep treasury purchase in place for the time being and that he will give us plenty of warning before he begins to taper bond purchases Last week the fed announced that it was going to stop buying corporate bonds and ETFs which was another dovish policy similar to treasury purchases that they were doing in the corporate bond market The fed wasn t doing a huge amount of corporate bond buying so that wasn t a huge deal for the economy or market but caused some to get nervous that the fed may be getting ready to ease 10 year note purchases in the months ahead However this fear was short lived because last week employment data came in that showed lower than expected job growth Generally job growth is a very important inflation indicator So important that until a few months ago when the fed changed its mandate it was the main factor determining whether the fed would raise or lower interest rates A cool employment number caused the bond market also largely algorithm driven to buy a lot of 10 year bonds because weaker job growth is supposed to mean weaker than expected inflation Therefore over the past week the 10 year yield has made a big move about 8 down and caused the broader indexes to rally The S amp P Dow Jones Russell 2000 and Nasdaq are all at or near record highs based largely on the fact that bond yields have been going down and algorithms have been triggered to buy Right now the 10 year is hovering around 1 5 which is the lowest rate it has been since March Since the initial rise at the beginning of the year the 10 year has typically bounced off of the 1 5 level and has gotten as high as 1 77 Despite the rise of the 10 year it is still well below its pre crash levels of 2

10 year yield going forward and how is that going to trigger an algorithm fueled gay bear feedback loop Above I talked about how the 10 year yield fell on the cool jobs number The glitch in the market matrix started last week when the ADP private payroll number came out The report said 978 000 new jobs were created in May a high number that was relatively in line with most estimates However the ADP report has for some reason not been accurate over the past year or so When the real employment number published by the government came out the following day showing a mere 559 000 jobs being created a corrective rally in 10 year treasury notes started and has persisted into today driving the 10 year yield to multi month lows To summarize what has happened so far ADP gave an employment number that diverged from the government employment number the government employment number missed estimates bond traders and algorithms derived a low inflation number from those low employment numbers and overcompensated bond purchases bond yield went down stonks went up This overcompensation could affect the bond and stock market tomorrow and in the weeks ahead There are a few potential catalysts that could drive a big move in the 10 year and the downstream stock market over the next week The first one is a 10 year note auction today at 1 pm While I don t expect the auction to cause a major change in treasuries there is a possibility that some selling could occur this afternoon to cause fluctuation in the 10 year since the price is at a multi month high Tomorrow and next week are huge catalysts though because the CPI number is being released While bond traders and algorithms attempt to derive a rough inflation number from employment data the CPI number is the real number that indicates the level of inflation the economy is experiencing and what price people are paying in the typical transaction On Wednesday next week the Fed meeting and Powell s subsequent comments will dictate how the Fed will respond to the inflation number and whether it will raise interest rates it won t or begin tapering bond purchases it might The bear thesis is contingent on tomorrow s CPI number being a huge beat That was the case last month and a big reason for the May selloff While the expected number was 0 4 MoM the actual number was double that 0 9 Given that 10 year bonds are very overbought with an 8 rally this week a hot CPI number like the one we saw in May could raise the 10 year yield as much as 10 basis points If it goes up 5 or more basis points a correction is highly likely and will have a magnitude proportional to the strength of the 10 year yield move This is not guaranteed This month s CPI number is projected to be 0 3 but based on various factors like continued housing market strength increased oil prices especially over the past month and with a big miss on crude inventories data this morning and general price increases see Chipotle news I tend to think 0 3 is a very low estimate Moreover employment data may have been a red herring for bond traders and algos because of the continued unemployment assistance being given by the government While a weak jobs number would normally produce a similarly weak CPI number unemployment assistance has the ability to elevate prices without job growth That is the main issue with the data being used by algos right now While the bond market won t necessarily react violently to a hot CPI number the recent rally has it primed for a selloff and resultant spike in yields Other Red Flags A few other things happening in the global economy and in volatility are making me nervous A big one is China Yesterday China released its own CPI along with its PPI producer price index or cost to manufacture goods The Chinese economy showed a divergence between CPI and PPI which is irregular While Chinese producers showed the biggest overhead cost increase in decades they seem to have decided to eat the cost and elected not to pass the price increase on to consumers This makes sense if you agree with Powell s standpoint on inflation being transitory temporary Eating production cost increases isn t a big deal if it s only for a few months and while it might cause company profits to dip it won t have a far reaching economic impact unless it is sustained and producers are forced to pass the price increase to consumers While I agree that huge inflation reads like I expect tomorrow are transitory I still think overall inflation has picked up in a relatively permanent way The current labor shortage along with job creation via stimulus and potential infrastructure spending will force companies to offer new employees higher salaries and increase salaries permanently across the board Also something tells me US companies are less likely to eat increased production costs than Chinese companies which rely on low costs to gain an advantage over foreign rivals There is also the possibility of the government instructing its companies to hold off on price increases while the recovery is taking place Also volatility is at an inflection point I follow volatility pretty closely understand it and have written about it https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lmt5s0 fyi for people new to the vix and vix etfs before in the past if you want to understand it better Currently the VIX which measures options premiums of S amp P 500 stocks is near post crash lows It got as low as 16 57 yesterday which is about 7 off the low not a lot for the VIX and has generally bounced off of that range during swings over the past year Today it s up to 17 21 For comparison it got up to near 22 00 during the May correction and was in the high 30s during January when meme s almost destroyed the stock market While a VIX rally doesn t necessarily mean there will be a correction high option premiums imply that institutions are hedging big swings VVIX the derivative of the VIX which measures the rate at which options premiums are changing and generally goes up prior to big moves is way up today 9 VXN the new volatility measurement of the Nasdaq is also near post crash lows While volatility is still elevated compared to 2019 the next couple of weeks will determine whether volatility decreases to pre crash levels 10 00 20 00 or continues to stay in the range it has been in 20 00 to 40 00 Continued volatility decrease

Powell If there is a correction the length of time it will last is based largely on the Powell testimony A hot CPI number might cause bond markets to freak out but the fed s stance will largely dictate whether a spike in the 10 year is confirmed and continues into the 2 range or if it stays steady The CPI number will play a little bit into the speed at which the fed tapers asset purchases but they already know what they re going to say next week for the most part Another part of my bearishness has to do with my opinion that Powell will announce tapering between now and the end of the year next week which could cause a correction regardless of tomorrow s inflation data How to play Don t buy VXX UVXY or any other leveraged index fund or volatility tracker Those suck have low upside and don t necessarily go up and down the market see link above for explanation of VIX futures funds Just play puts in the indexes or calls if you disagree with me I tend to think that monthly QQQ and IWM options are good targets because they have more beta than SPY But the Nasdaq has already had a big correction while SPY has been largely unaffected and is closer to may close today at record highs amp x200B amp x200B TLDR Bond market could shit its pants and cause a correction if the market underestimated the inflation data coming out tomorrow Happy Pride Month

https www forbes com sites bradtempleton 2020 10 28 new tesla autopilot statistics show its almost as safe driving with it as without sh 5b11f0ea1794 paints a picture that is more 50 50 So what is the truth It is hard to tell I have done plenty of KPI Reporting for board members of my company I can tell you how KPIs like these typically are reported Firstly Think about this Where will the autopilot be activated mostly Freeways Highways but not in cities difficult traffic situations etc right Where do most accidents happen Right So Tesla s cars are accumulating miles and miles without accidents driving in a straight line on a highway something that btw almost ANY car from ANY brand can do even 5 10 years ago If you just report those numbers of course you will get to a statistic like the one Elon posted If you compare freeway numbers with freeway numbers it is a wash as it seems the forbes article has tried to do Secondly In the foot note of the tesla report they state that they count all accidents where the autopilot was active 5 seconds before the accident Why 5 seconds though Why not 10 why not 30 What would YOU do if you were the one who has to create this report Exactly Thirdly Is of accidents even the best thing to measure Having less accidents obviously is important for the ADOPTION of FSD cars but is it a good measure of how CLOSE we are to actually achieving FSD cars Think about this Most accidents happen especially on freeways when people are speeding using their mobile phone or breaking the law in some other way Of course the car never does this So shouldn t we compare the Tesla numbers to just the accidents where noone was speeding etc Couldn t we achieve less of accidents also by restricting cars with technology e g mobiles are always deactivated near the driver seat speeding is technically restricted Of course we could but who wants that Summary Measuring security of FSD Cars of accidents per mile is a bullshit KPI to start with It can help with adoption but the reporting of it is very likely skewed or plain out wrong I am not saying it is done in a fraudulent way but I think it is not a fair comparison as it is done today And any report can be tweaked a bit to look better just a tiny bit here and there And this is done ALL THE TIME by all the big companies and players because their bonuses and salaries depend on it 3 The data treasure of Tesla So after some more high level and less technical arguments lets dig into the matter itself If you don t know much about how ML works I would invite you to watch a movie that everyone can enjoy and understand It is about AlphaGo the engine that beat the game of GO It is a great movie in itself and it gives you quite some insight that you can leverage to understand this DD thread AlphaGo Movie on Youtube https www youtube com watch v WXuK6gekU1Y You might like it a bit more if you either played Starcraft in your life or you are a nerd like me One reason why many investors give Tesla an edge over their competitors is the fact that Tesla has the most miles driven with full sensor cars and they supposedly have that data available to build their ML models on The whole thesis is based on the fact that Tesla can achieve FSD within 2 3 years because all the other competitors are catching up here and fast The problem is what do you actually do with this data What data can Tesla realistically save Do they save ALL the data from all sensors including driver input video radar ultra sound I have done a project once where we saved just very basic sensor data of trucks from a customer This thing produced 2 Gigabytes of data per hour driven with sensors picking up one data point every second There was no video or anything in there just GPS data velocity stuff like that So a Tesla would probably need much much more right It also cant be satisfied with a data point per second it would need a proper data stream video of at least 10 fps same for radar and have a multitude of sensors according to google something like 10 cameras 12 ultrasound and one radar I don t even want to start guesstimating how much raw data a Tesla car produces but I have seen numbers thrown around from 100 GB per hour to 3 TB per hour which seems realistic given my own experience in the super simple use case I mentioned and the number of sensors in a Tesla car So what can Tesla do with this data You certainly can not store all of the data from all the cars for longer periods of time Anything above a few Terabytes gt 100 will be very cumbersome to use will take ages to compute anything on and will cost a shit ton of money to keep and maintain If you take just the 500 000 Tesla cars sold in 2020 and assume they only drive 1 hour per day on average and in that hour they only produce 10 GB 10 of estimated low this would already be around 1 Exabyte of data per year 1700 Terabyte Training any layer of a model e g the layer that can find road markings on such a data set is an insanely difficult and expensive task already Nevermind the fact you probably need tens of thousands of them What I am saying is this Even with their own data centers and some great processing powers it is impossible for Tesla to actually store and use all the data that they could collect Today s storage and computing standards simply aren t big enough yet I have some good insight into AWS and Azure and a few of the bigger university computing initiatives Maybe Tesla has something that NONE of those have in their data centers But I doubt it It is general consensus that AWS is by far the best here in terms of cost efficiency per computing power or storage size since they basically practiced it for 10 years now AT SCALE They can collect a lot of data But they can not keep it and it is not the big competitive edge that some think it may be And we haven t even started on data that is flawed rain versus sunny weather skewed left driving countries versus right side driving countries or simply bad quality dirt on the camera Anyone who has done ML projects knows that this is one of the biggest issues I have done projects where we used satellite images on certain locations 15 GB per picture of a 10x10 mile square location Half of them had clouds and you could not see shit thankfully modern services let you filter for pictures without clouds or only partly clouded Then try to compute your 15 GB picture even on modern infrastructure without taking ages and THEN find out that the resolution is still way too fucking low for what you wanted to do SIZE IS A PROBLEM 4 Complexity of Machine Learning amp x200B Anyone who has done any ML in their life knows how difficult ML is when it comes to real problems Maybe you have now watched the AlphaGo Video You might have noticed that the example there is a very simple game with 361 squares each of which can only be empty black or white This means the input data structure is extremely simple There are no flaws in the data no artifacts and it was still a huge fucking deal when they won You might have noticed that the number of possible moves that the engine can do are even more simple than the board as some fields will already be occupied You might have noticed that there were still 50 people working on building that engine and it took them months years How many of Tesla s employees are working on this FSD which is orders or magnitudes more complex You might have noticed that even with all the simplicity the engine still flunked at least once amp x200B Now think of driving a car like a game with a multitude of players non binary options instead of steer left steer right it is more like a 120 degree field of steering from which you select exactly one per milli second Data is skewed flawed or in bad quality Decisions can not be computed for minutes even AlphaGo takes this long they have to be made instantaneously And they can t miss It has to be 100 correct People who have done ML in the real world will know that even relatively simple problems require quite complex models These take hours to train and inference times are not always optimal even on expensive state of the art infrastructure Another much more simple example for this is Google Translate The smartest people with almost infinite money took one of the biggest if not THE biggest data set in the world all written text ever produced and tried to build a translation engine Heck this thing is great But does it work perfectly Of course not Would you trust it with your life Someone smart once said Machine Learning is good for problems where you need to be 51 right like the stock market e g A 1 edge is all you need Driving a car you can not afford to be wrong 49 of the time and ML is bad in those 99 99 problems amp x200B Conclusions The hype around Machine Learning is huge And progress has been made But the problems that autonomous driving needs to tackle are insanely complex The technology is not there yet and it is not going to be there in the foreseeable future The human brain is still far smarter than any data center in existence Probably even ML as it exists today needs a complete revolution in order to be able to solve some of the things that our brain can do and driving cars seems to be one of those problems that needs to wait for that amp x200B How to use this for investing I don t go short or buy puts anymore after SPY 180P 4 16 last year But I think there is a big opportunity for other automakers My favorite currently is VW and people have been catching up to it They will be building the most EV cars very soon and they can put in As usual here none of this is investment advice TL DR Tesla wont get autonomous driving L4 within the next years Positions 100 commons for VW cost basis around 25k Small position in NIO F ord Sorry no options for this one I am not crazy enough to short TSLA and the timing of this can take for however long people still believe in the FSD story

Producers, Summary Synthetic Biology is a field in science focused on reprogramming micro organisms yeast to produce things like CBG or vanillin rather than making alcohol Its simple feed cells sugar and they make whatever you want because their DNA is rewritten This field has been around for a while but has had recent breakthroughs that make it poised to become the next big thing In this example I will use cannabinoid fermentation as a base on how to evaluate these companies I will be using Amyris in examples because they are one of the few companies that releases their stats amp x200B The Goal Try to create a strain of yeast that makes a lot of product CBG as efficiently as possible amp x200B Old Method At its core synthetic biology is reprogramming the DNA of yeast You make some edits to DNA and you select the best performing strain rinse and repeat and pray you get the best performing strain before you run out of money That s the core of it editing and screening selecting strains amp x200B New Method Its still the same reprogramming the difference now is that the editing is quicker thanks to CRISPR and genetic programming The screening selection is now boosted by machine learning Machine learning uses a vast database to pick the promising strain candidates early on this is one of the most important pieces To give you a sense of how much quicker the process is Amyris is doing 1500 DNA designs edits every cycle two weeks and their computers are selecting lt 0 1 of 7 2 Million candidates screened per year amp x200B Critical Components to Understand Scaling Yield how much CBG the microbes can produce Scale process of editing and selecting strains to have high yield in bigger fermentation tanks 100L 10 000L 200 000L Bigger tanks higher efficiency Companies will get a High Yield strain and then try to Scale that strain That s right its not as simple as just putting the little bastards in a bigger tank you have to also fight evolutionary pressure Making yeast produce CBG is sort of like if you engineered chickens to shit out pineapples Think of how much work and energy it would take that chicken to make a single pineapple it would be slow and clunky this is the problem high yield yeast face in the tank As yeast multiply there can evolve unproductive strains that expend less energy and can grow at a faster rate than the high yield yeast unproductive yeast can take all the resources and ruin your batch Evolutionary pressure is one of the biggest challenges to scaling and is more problematic the bigger scale you go amp x200B Critical Components to Evaluating a Synbio Company 1 Current Scale what size tanks are they currently producing at 2 Time to Scale how long have they been working on scaling how fast do they get to bigger tanks If its slow they will be burning cash 3 Costs of Product How good is their yield per Liter OR Cost of product per unit how much they will charge for a kilogram of CBG Companies do not like sharing this info if they do they are probably bragging Synbio companies are capable of creating virtually any molecule through this scaling process It sounds like some kind of science fiction thing but it is here now and very real Now that you know more of this field here are some of the top players and their CBG stats Current Scale L Time to Current Scale Costs of Product Amyris 220 000 1 year 500 kg Ginkgo 50 000 2 7 years Won t say Demetrix 15 000 1 5 years Won t say Creo CBG A 12 500 5 years Won t say Willow 10 000 1 year Won t say amp x200B Its not about who is first it is about who is fastest to scale amp x200B Common Misunderstandings Commercial scale It s a big milestone but FAR from the finish line Commercial scale means that the product CBG can cover the costs of the supply sugar Much more scaling has to be done in order to improve margins and have a true product that can make money Scaling does not end once it is in a biggest tank either it keeps going in cycles Amyris launches a campaign every 3 4 months each campaign resulting in 50 COGS reduction approaching the cost of sugar THAT is the type of sexy number you are looking for Purity yeast already produce things like insulin and other medical ingredients purification isn t a big deal these days If your scaling process is true you should already be having excellent purity by fighting off evolutionary pressure END The science behind ALL of these companies is amazing and I wish the best for all of them They all have made major achievements to get this far The Synbio World has room for many players If you have any competing stats and want it known comment below and include citation I am happy to include it if it is relevant amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B More on Amyris for those obsessed like me Some of you may be wondering why Amyris is so far ahead It is simple Amyris has been doing this since 2003 They practically invented the scale up process around 2011 and got it to a reliable state in 2016 That is why Amyris is years ahead of all of its competition it literally had a head start It will take years for any other company to gather the required data for their selection process to be equivalent to Amy s amp x200B On Management Management did whatever they could to keep the lights on Anyone burned by that deserved it because we all should have done better DD the financials were disgusting The Amyris that rose from those ashes is a whole new beast though I think these next ERs will prove that amp x200B On Lavvan Lawsuit I am not a lawyer but I am not concerned with this lawsuit I believe it to be frivolous We see Amyris going ahead with CBG so their lawyers must believe they have a strong case RCL Agreement https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1365916 000136591620000179 a8kexhibit9902 htm https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1365916 000136591620000179 a8kexhibit9902 htm When we went through the RCL agreement we noticed something interesting The ONLY time CBG was mentioned in the agreement is where it is excluded from additional cannabinoids So if it doesn t belong under Commercial Cannabinoids or Additional Cannabinoids it is not included in the agreement its in a grey area and Amyris can do whatever it wants That is my interpretation amp x200B https preview redd it 2o56td4rna471 jpg width 1900 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 0c7223fbb0cd7246472507ce1598e5a4b8b14ac2

I wanted to bring you one of my old show horses NIO As well as let you know that this auto maker is primed for a decent run in the mid to long term I ve been playing them since their IPO I hope these links are acceptable and can remove as needed On quick note I like to repeat to others is NIO has first place wins in the EV F 1 racing scene having the fastest times in the opening seasons This means to me 1 They know how to build and manage power supplies 2 They know how to build high performance EV drive trains 3 They know how to build high performance EV engines Now on to the discussion Back in Feb 2020 NIO had reached a government backed deal to provide them with 2 5 billions in savings to manufacture at a factory in their Heife region This factory hadn t been slated for a particular vehicle Hello fellow apes I wanted to bring show you one of my old harlots NIO As well as let you know that this auto maker is primed for a decent run in the mid to long term On quick note I like to repeat to others is NIO has first place wins in the EV F 1 racing scene having the fastest times in the opening seasons This means to me 1 They know how to build and manage power supplies 2 They know how to build high performance EV drive trains 3 They know how to build high performance EV engines Now on to the discussion Back in November 2019 NIO had reached a government backed deal to provide them with 2 5 billions in savings to manufacture at a factory in their Heife region While NIO was managing the build of a new factory equipment they were able to ramp up production of their current model vehicle the EC6 Continuously hitting their production guidance released in their earnings calls NIO then announced in January 2021 that they wanted to produce a more affordable sedan to compete with Tesla In comes the ET7 this vehicle is slated to be produced at their new factory To date I haven t seen any news that indicates they ve hit a snag 5 day halt did occur in building out the production capacity at the new facility They released deal in May 2021 to produce 240 000 per year https finance yahoo com news nio extends joint manufacturing agreement 090009258 html This model vehicle will be their mainstream vehicle and it s planned to hit the road in the coming year They ve already expanded into the hottest market in EU for EVs Norway https www cnbc com 2021 05 06 nio plans to start delivering cars to norway in september html https www nio com news nio announces norway strategy Now that s all production and management of their vehicles But what about the interior and software Well they ve done something a little out there but apparently the consumers are enjoying it they integrated an automotive assistant which is AI driven This might be something that changes the relationship with owners and the vehicle causing them to hold the vehicle longer instead of reselling on secondary markets Which drives the demand for new vehicles that they produce https twitter com NIOGlobal status 1394334686025961477 s 19 They also have NIO Navigate on Pilot 1 0 this is the same as Tesla Autopilot with the same suite of features There s plenty of videos showing that this AI driven software is functioning as designed This also indicates they aren t behind Tesla but right in step with them https youtu be 1UaGjztOi94 ONE NOTE about NIO Navigate on Pilot They said they d be working on an update but it has not hit the road So this indicates to me that they re struggling with something to make it to the next phase Once they release an update they ll be a leader in self driving vehicles in the largest EV market Now just wait THERE S MOAR Geez I m running out of breath They have a battery swap service that solves one issue that other EVs have Super long lines and long charge times They can swap your battery in their vehicle in 3minutes 3min and you re back in the road that s as good as gas station times They also released news on a solid state battery which has it s own combustion suppression properties that existing battery technologies suffer from Google battery fires for four hours on Tesla Some fundamentals They ve reduced operating costs significantly last quarter They ve increased margin on their existing vehicle https ir nio com news events news releases news release details nio inc reports unaudited third quarter 2020 They ve increased sales month to month and year over year They ve increased their revenue So what say you is this a dieing company NO Is this company primed for success yes Will they keep up with the major autonomous vehicle players absolutely Two Last points 1 They are listed on the Chinese companies in Congress for delisting THEY absolutely plan to stay in compliance to stay on the US exchange 2 they are very active with news and guidance so it s easy to stay up to date and allow you to reanalyze frequently what s good for your play

opportunity albeit not your typical short squeeze gamma squeeze or any other squeeze of the sort It is actually a pretty straightforward bet Allow me to Introduce Uranium Ah sure you guys can probably dismiss it but here me out There are 3 big ETFs in the sector URA HURA and URNM URNM has been outperforming its rival by adding smaller and more speculative names On stocks that get added to the index we usually talk about small float and market caps that are sub 100m when added There is an indiscriminate buy of the underlying equity for the next 3 weeks after the index rebalancing In March I had done that research and got lucky on a couple of names added to the index I circled in Red the period at which the index bough and you can see the surge in volume The great thing is that this ETF keeps growing in size because of the renewed interest in Uranium That means that they need to keep buying shares at whatever price the asking price is every month to keep the relative position in in the ETF The below stock is Western Uranium and Vanadium They also have strong fundamentals and are a perfect M amp A target for their next door neighbor Energy Fuels The current Ceo of Western owns 15 of the shares and the share structure is super tight They are currently only in the URNM ETF and I think they have a good chance at getting into URA the biggest ETF in the uranium sector I obviously own a

are owned by their rival URNM and HURA There is only a handful of names that are not in the URA ETF These names are Laramide resources Azzarga Uranium Mega Uranium Vimy resources Toro Energy Forsys metals If you are willing to wait a bit more the URNM rebalancing happens in September Currently the best 2 performing stocks in Uranium this year are Alligator Energy and Elevate Uranium They will most probably get included in the ETF as well They could also make it in the URA rebalancing in July but I see this as less likely Another name that is on the cusp and could well make it into the ETF is Anfield Energy Another short term catalyst is the transaction of Sprott acquiring the Uranium participation corp For those of you who have been sleeping under a rock Sprott has been able to grow its Gold and Silver ETF assets under management significantly They intend to do the same with the Uranium participation corp which buys and holds physical uranium It used to be that when the fund s net asset value was 20 they would issue more shares and buy more uranium Sprott however will have an NYSE listing instead of a Canadian listing and will be an active buyer every month on the Spot market The current spot for Uranium is at 32 and we will need to seed 40 to 45 to see the party begin Many in the space believe this will happen due to this move from Sprott on top of the foreseen shortage from all the supply destruction since Fukushima At this point you should already have understood that you can front run institution and that this in itself is a great arbitrage like situation

total Uranium was 150 billion meaning an easy 5x from here in total The granddaddy of performance was Paladin back then which started as a junior and became a big producer The stock went from 0 03 to 9 53 in 4 years Paladin is still a solid pick as they will be one of the first producers Still if you are looking at a story like Paladin today I think a couple of names have the management and

making it susceptible to massive moves every time there is a buyer in the market with decent volume Azzaraga has a great deposit can start production fast and needs low CAPEX to get there They have a good management team Either Encore Energy or Ur Energy can easily buy them Laramide resource Management is top notch Great diversified assets They can come into production or be sold The CEO has been with the company forever and holds 10 of the shares If you need more resources to double down on I suggest John Quakes on Twitter Uranium insider is also another great name to follow I also suggest

before I get started I am a scientist doing biological research but I don t work in immunology or infectious diseases so I am by no means an expert I have interacted with the founder of Inovio Dr David Weiner briefly on a couple of occasions but I have no knowledge that isn t publicly available and I am not affiliated with the company in any way Finally I am very bad at investing so please do not take this as advice I m only making this because I think their tech is really cool and underappreciated and I think you ll find it cool too Also if I happen to be right we could make some money So what does Inovio do Inovio works on making DNA based treatments for a broad range of diseases To boil it down to basics when something bad is in your body whether that s a bacteria virus or even a tumor your immune cells recognize that bad thing by specific substances that the bad thing produces We call those substances antigens You might recognize this terminology and process from the recent COVID vaccines and mutations The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are both based on a COVID antigen known as the spike protein Both of those vaccines use RNA to give your cells instructions https www cdc gov coronavirus 2019 ncov vaccines different vaccines mRNA html to make the protein and recognize it when you become infected Inovio develops DNA injections to get to the same result Inovio has been working on this since long before COVID was on our mind and they currently have clinical trials https www inovio com for patients clinical trials ongoing to treat HPV HIV Hepatitis C metastatic prostate cancer and of course COVID 19 So why is Inovio not just 3rd place finisher behind Pfizer Moderna As I mentioned before Inovio s platform https www inovio com dna medicines technology is based on DNA You might remember from biology class that DNA has two strands whereas RNA has one strand One big advantage of storing instructions in DNA over RNA is that DNA is far more stable If you know a biologist ask them if they d rather work with DNA or RNA 99 are going to choose DNA because RNA is incredibly unstable and has to be kept very cold or it will spontaneously degrade You might have a faint recollection of problems storing and transporting the Pfizer Moderna vaccines because they must be stored at 80 and once thawed must be used in a short window of time DNA on the other hand can be dried and stored at room temperature https ir inovio com news releases news releases details 2020 INOVIO Announces Positive Interim Phase 1 Data For INO 4800 Vaccine for COVID 19 default aspx for extended periods of time 1 year without compromising its structure So not only is Inovio ahead of the pack on development of non COVID uses of this type of treatment but their treatment is far easier to produce store and transport So what s to prevent copycats One of the disadvantages of using DNA to deliver instructions to your cells is that it is harder to actually get DNA into cells The way the COVID vaccines were injected would not be very effective using DNA However Inovio has developed a proprietary handheld device https ir inovio com news releases news releases details 2020 INOVIO Receives 71 Million Contract From US Department of Defense To Scale Up Manufacture of CELLECTRA 3PSP Smart Device and Procurement of CELLECTRA 2000 for COVID 19 DNA Vaccine default aspx that uses an electrical pulse to help the DNA get into your cells They have fairly broad in my opinion patents covering both this device and their DNA technology in the U S https patents google com patent US8927508B2 en and Europe https patents google com patent EP2409727A1 en that don t expire until 2029 and 2027 respectively So how do I make sweet sweet MONEY Inovio is well set up to capitalize on these emerging technologies beyond just COVID 19 I see two potential routes for big ROI As previously mentioned they have ongoing trials for multiple diseases that have previously been incurable or very difficult to treat Based on the efficacy of the COVID vaccines and published data https www thelancet com journals lancet article PIIS0140 6736 15 00239 1 fulltext by Inovio on their DNA technology I believe these trials will be successful and open the door for this tech to be used against wide variety of conditions from COVID to cancer With their IP and head start they should capitalize on this opportunity well Of course success of clinical trials is never a guarantee but you have to risk money to make money and Inovio seems to be on the right track for success The second potential for huge growth of Inovio is another pandemic It d be nice not to have to hope for that but data does suggest that we ll see them more frequently I see this as a growth stock with the potential for a large acquisition pending the success of their trials The best value to me seems like shares and LEAPs as catalysts for biotech companies often come quite suddenly I occasionally buy 1 DTE options because I am a fool who no longer wishes to work TL DR Inovio INO has a way to potentially treat incurable diseases that is similar to the highly effective COVID 19 vaccines produced by Pfizer Moderna Inovio s treatments are stable at room temperature for a year and they have patents protecting their tech in the U S and Europe Clinical trials look promising and upon success the company is poised for massive growth acquisition

the history of MP Materials Mountain Pass you need to study its past history Most casual observers never quite made the correlation but if you live in Southern California and have driven to Las Vegas you ve driven over Mountain Pass It s the last mountain range in the Mojave Desert that you drive over on highway 15 just before you reach the state line of Nevada Mountain Pass is the current only rare earth mining and processing site in the western hemisphere About rare earth metals What are rare earth metals They are a group of 17 elements lanthanum cerium praseodymium neodymium promethium samarium europium gadolinium terbium dysprosium holmium erbium thulium ytterbium lutetium scandium yttrium all found in rare deposits The thing about these rare metals is that they are actually quite common in the earth s crust However the difficulties in the extraction process of these metals is what gives them their name These metals are used in just about anything electronic rechargeable batteries magnets computers lasers fiber optics superconductors and vehicles Not only are they used in electric vehicles in batteries and motors but they are also used in catalytic converters Over the last 5 6 years prices of rare earth metals have risen because they are rare but they are also very costly to refine in environmentally friendly ways This has also spurred the growth of catalytic converter theft which has become a growing nuisance Recyclers have been paying up to 250 per unit to almost anyone that s willing to supply them Nearly 60 of rare earths metals that were imported in 2018 were used for catalytic converters The majority of the global rare metal supply is owned by China thus they control most of the supply chain Due to China s dominance in this sector the United States along with the rest of the world is very susceptible to China s pricing or supply disruption tariffs export ban pricing pressure According to this Reuters article The United States imported 160 million of rare earth compounds and metals in 2018 up nearly 17 from 2017 Around 60 of it was used in catalysts for oil refining and in vehicle engines The SPAC merger On November 17 of 2020 Fortress Value Acquisition Corp FVAC closed a SPAC merger deal with 345 Million in cash in trust and a 200 Million PIPE led by the SPAC King himself Chamath Palihapitiya The combined company was set at a valuation of 1 5 Billion with over 500 million in cash to fund the growth strategy and was labeled MP Materials https preview redd it cqnsvik0mb471 png width 1170 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

acceptance of clean energy and strengthening supply chains Over the term of the Trump presidency the trade war with China had intensified leaving companies with tariffs and questionable supply chains This economic race had set the stage for MP Materials With tariffs on imports and unfavorable pricing from China on rare earth materials it leaves a very volatile question mark for US manufacturers and other related companies Flash forward to 2021 with the Biden administration not only is the government trying to turn the table on strengthening its own supply chains it s also trying to eliminate its vulnerabilities The pandemic has shown us the necessities of medicine essential goods and things like semiconductors should be made in the United States and this was reinforced by the executive order signed by President Biden in February On the list of critical goods to be evaluated within the first 100 days was specifically rare earth metals This clearly demonstrates how MP Materials being the only miner and refiner of these materials in the United States could profit The other larger mention on the executive order was large capacity batteries such as those used in electric cars I would highly recommend reviewing the order as there are so many industries that were mentioned that all use rare earth metals related to MP Materials A long term investor may see the importance of rare earth metals in terms of being a critical factor to the US economy After the 100 day review is completed somewhere around the beginning of June there is no doubt MP Materials will be listed as a critical company and will have an overwhelming support of the US Government Not only will this secure MP Materials as a local monopoly but it will solidify local business supply chains for years to come Also with a critical infrastructure bill in the works the company could be on the list to receive subsidies to level the playing field with China MP Materials rare earth concentrate product represents 15 of the world s supply Expected increase in demand of rare metals With the rise of electric vehicles starting to enter the manufacturing plants of US automakers the demand of rare earth metals will be growing exponentially If you take a moment to look at the slide deck of the investor presentation from MP Materials the business is currently in early days of stage 2 https preview redd

power the strongest types of rare earth magnets These magnets are used to power EVs electric vehicles and many industrial processes This is why the mining of these rare earth metals play a vital role in the EV market After mining these materials MP Materials then ships them to China they rely on plants in China to actually process the mined materials while incurring a VAT tax and tariffs to be refined and is still turning a profit MP Materials is set to open the largest NdPr separation facility in the world in 2022 and are putting stage II into motion NdPr is an essential piece used in magnets especially in EV motors Stage III shows they are looking to actually produce NdPr magnets onsite sometime past 2025 which would make them even more vertically integrated Demand from electric vehicles wind turbines and other technologies is hitting an inflection point The shift in clean energy and electrification of transport globally will be an important theme over the next decade The demand for rare earths will rapidly outpace the current levels of production and supply Take a look at the forecasted price of NdPr over the next several years https preview redd it dut1u16ylb471 png

is not just a rare earth metal play but they will be particularly focused on NdPr which will be driven by clean energy industries and more specifically electric vehicles Potential Risks A company that entails rare earth mining such as MP Materials will be subject to typical risks that surround commodities Right now we are in a super cycle but how long will that last Since China also supplies up to 80 of the world s rare earth materials there is also the potential of risks associated with the pricing pressure Lastly there are some advancements in synthetically creating materials that replace these rare metals but not enough conclusions have been drawn in the validity of this topic Valuation Now like any SPAC it s hard to give accurate projections more than 3 years out but the rare earth metal market has had prices nearly double this year which has led to a pretty sharp increase in the stock price already Not to mention unlike some SPACs this is a company that is already generating products and profits The most recent analyst coverage has near term price targets between 37 and 57 In the last 3 weeks there has been a rise in the 10 Year yield and that has made the technology sector and SPACs become unfavorable Like several other stocks it appears MP Materials is the baby being thrown out with the bathwater the stock has retraced from its 51 77 52 week high significantly Now the company did report an excellent 4th quarter surpassing expectations on March 18th More recently the company announced it wanted to raise 600 million in a senior debt offering that would not come due until 2026 There was some concern that this could dilute the stock when it comes due but this is over 5 years from now This free cash will allow MP Materials to speed up its timeline and reduce costs by operating its own NdPr separation facility With the speculation of a commodity super cycle and rising inflation coming the price of rare earth metals will continue to strengthen This appears to be a potentially great value investment and the upcoming 100 day review in June from the Biden administration will only further strengthen the importance of MP Materials in the US Economy Having said that the company s original valuation in the merger was set to 1 billion dollars 1 5 billion minus 500 million to fund expansions At the moment of writing the company s market cap is sitting at roughly 6 billion We want to determine if the current valuation is pricing the company at fair value given the potential the company has This is not an easy task given the complexities of the rare earth metal industry and also the lack of competitors This is not a growth stock nor is it strictly a commodity play In my opinion we can look at it as a play on Neodymium and Praseodymium NdPr which is where the pricing outlook and largest growth expected over the next 10 years is very strong It is my opinion that MP Material s growth will be somewhat reflected by the demand of the EV market as well as the progression of other clean energy industries where the use of these metals is critical If the EV market were to increase tenfold I think MP Materials would also benefit greatly by proxy TLDR 1 China currently has somewhat of a monopoly on rare earth materials currently providing about 80 of the world s supply This allows them the capability to create pricing pressure which they have done in the past and control the supply to hurt their competitors 2 At this moment in time MP Materials is currently mining the materials then sending them off to China for processing all while still maintaining a profit MP Materials will eventually be processing these rare earth materials in their own processing plants The company is working on vertical integration for the entire process from start to finish 3 The most significant of these metals is NdPr which power some of the strongest magnets used specifically in the electric vehicles and wind turbines clean energy 4 MP Materials stock price is already trading at a hefty valuation relative to what the stock price was post merger However this company s revenues will also be reflected by the strong demand and trend driven by the increase in EV sales 5 Considering these metals will play a vital role in many tech industries moving forward they may receive substantial support from the government The Biden administration has already put in motion a plan to strengthen it s own supply chains to remove vulnerabilities Rare earth metals are specifically on this list Positions Long MP in common stock
