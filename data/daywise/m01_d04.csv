D471c7X finish up over 0 60 and finishing at record highs while the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite https ibb co vzGgSBb finished barely up for the day gaining 14 We also saw the VIX https ibb co 2YrvMpT finishing just down for the day but it s still up from a week https ibb co LxdGJ8c ago as the volatility still remains way above the levels https ibb co XbWkzW4 before March when it rose to over 80 We just about saw a positive ratio of companies advancing https ibb co 5TwrM2m to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs as we saw 10 of the 11 sectors https ibb co yyrTGGP finishing in the green with Utilities Financials Real Estate amp Health Care gaining more than 1 while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss We also saw most factor groups finishing https ibb co dmvNJgL the day in the red with only Large Cap Value companies posting a gain of 3 as you can see in Thursday s HEAT MAP https ibb co wBGr7cR with gains all around the board while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil amp Gas industry Here is the weekly HEAT MAP https ibb co zQWD12B with names like Alibaba Shopify Palantir Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of December https ibb co ZX09X8Z with a gain of more than 20 as you can see here while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news We also finished https ibb co r5JRk5b the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here led by Technology Consumer Cyclicals and Communications But gains were had in most other sectors as well except the Financial Travel and Energy sectors which finished the year down The biggest losers https ibb co nDgRs1S in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16 were by far stocks like Carnival OXY Norwegian Cruise Line United Airlines and many more others The Nasdaq 100 wasn t safe either despite jumping almost 50 in 2020 having the best gains in 11years with companies like Walgreens Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17 while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7 up for the year as Boeing Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower We also saw huge winners https ibb co n7yP7cM in 2020 as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple Nvidia PayPal Amazon and many others that posted huge gains While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna Peloton amp Zoom also rising by more than 300 The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple amp Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike Disney amp Salesforce We also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau s gaming revenue https ibb co NWBrC3s continued the slow recovery but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20 higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business Meanwhile we also received the latest jobless numbers https ibb co Km8px8X which dipped below 800K again 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5 2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous report https ibb co gJLQYPB While this week https ibb co mDnXFZY we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains or if the results and data don t show up as investors amp analysts expected it we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again We also really don t get any significant earnings https ibb co 60QM77h releases this week with most of the interesting ones like Micron Walgreens amp Bed Bath amp Beyond coming on Thursday So in some other stock market news Tesla topped expectations https ibb co g9048Ry of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter as we saw Tesla https ibb co th7Hhnc pricing the model Y at just over 50 000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world s biggest car market as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US Tesla closed over 700 for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock check out my prediction on Tesla HERE https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kci2lk my tesla stock price predictions buy or sell Some other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with Li Auto https ibb co LYCSs1N increasing deliveries five fold year year with a 32 increase month month in December while XPENG https ibb co Zc7FSQC also announced record delivery numbers up 35 month month and more than 300 year year for December We also saw NIO https ibb co 4VWGX78 posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K up over 120 year year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries which were also up over 110 year year as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self driving and other technologies next week Meanwhile we saw Lemonade https ibb co dKh6kx0 take a ride after another short seller released a statement pointing out to the final lock up period after the IPO as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock despite the company https ibb co YWksq6g needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm Geico and Allstate to reach their first million I personally am an investor in this company and I really like what they are doing so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon Guys personally I can t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for Apple https ibb co cx07jJs as the top of the line products keep having great demand but we do have to see what happens in the US China relations as this could impact the Apple revenue stream this after the New York Stock Exchange has started https ibb co 599nrxc the process of delisting telecom giants from China You can check out my prediction on Apple HERE https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kmzvqv apple stock price predictions buy or sell aapl We also saw a memo https ibb co qyBfzrq from DELTA s CEO as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020 Meanwhile FuboTV https ibb co Dg5jZ6x continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook Fubo plunged again almost 16 Thursday and is down almost 50 in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired more than tripling the shares float And on last piece of news that just came out is that Roku https ibb co gM8Z4Bv is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi this would give a boost to Roku s exclusive programming as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3 5 in pre market trading Let s hope for a good day in the market as US FUTURES https ibb co zf9tMYZ seem to be pointing at a good open with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic data https ibb co f24tRCS this year in the early morning while the global stock markets https ibb co sjvZMrx started on a positive note except Japan Thank you

tomorrow random autist amp x200B Norway Yes we love this country has been a loyal and faithful ally to the United States for years Norway joined the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development OECD and was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO in 1949 You see Norway is our OG friend amp x200B But autist why are you talking about history and not stonks amp x200B Patience fellow retard Rockets don t lift off without a little commentary followed by a countdown 3 2 1 amp x200B So you see our loyal friend Norway created a National Fund called Statens pensjonsfond Utland SPU in 1990 which has since grown to become the world s largest sovereign fund valued at over 1 trillion 10 trillion Krone For context Melvin Capital only has 20b 2 of Norway s strength amp x200B Screenshot of GME s Top Holders Norway owns 1 8 million shares of GME https preview redd it gqrrm1c0ic961 png width 439 amp format png amp auto webp amp s bd767f9ed61c1afe1ec9312dee41568b6c5fa34f amp x200B That means Norway is by far the largest and strongest retard in the room and he has yet to wake up amp x200B But this is where things get interesting amp x200B You see Norway s National Fund SPU s goal is to invest with an extremely long term perspective enabling it to cope with big swings in value in the short term The goal of the fund on behalf of the Norwegian people is to generate the highest possible return with only moderate risk so that the fund grows and endures amp x200B The fund only invests in companies with an extremely long term perspective and yet GameStop is one of them You see Norway s National Fund currently owns 1 8 million shares which represents 2 5 of voting rights On top of that the fund is an active participant in shareholder and proxy votes They frequently have a regular dialogue with these nearly 1 000 companies regarding shareholder decisions They take the effort to be involved in their investments and will be active voting participants amp x200B Where was Norway When the Buy Wall Fell amp x200B Ryan Cohen can call upon the alliances of old our loyal ally Norway With the partnership of the century the fund could increase their investment by a small 100m which would be enough to purchase another 5 million shares at a very conservative price of 25 share This would be enough shares to bring Norway s National Fund to a 10 owner 1 8m shares previous 5 million new shares 6 8 million shares out of 68 million outstanding Norway could then partner with Ryan Cohen to pull off the ultimate power play of our life time This purchase would represent less than 0 01 of the fund s over 1 trillion in assets and would be hardly a drop in the bucket but the move would give the fund a large upside exposure to the booming Gaming Industry As part of the partnership with Ryan Cohen Norway could even become the center of gaming for all of Europe with Norway hosting e gaming tournaments conferences and events GameStop could even partner with Norwegian gaming companies for partnerships during their e commerce pivot Imagine an annual gaming conference held in Norway on behalf of GameStop showcasing the latest in the gaming industry coupled with an e gaming tournament for the coveted GameStop Championship Ryan Cohen could hand out awards and accolades during the annual event further boosting the GameStop brand name You could even have the King of Norway yes they have a king still crown the champions for further publicity and even more PR stunts GameStop is the brand name and recognition that everyone needs in order to launch themselves into the future of the gaming industry amp x200B You see Gamers around the world have yet to be united under a single gaming hub one brand name to encompass everything gaming to include buying games consoles hardware swag but also a brand for hosting organizing and sponsoring e gaming events while also partnering with game developers to forge the future of gaming GameStop could truly be the stop for all our gaming needs amp x200B With Ryan Cohen and Norway combined owning nearly 25 of GameStop and Ryan CEO with the blessing of Norway shorts would completely back down decisively outgunned by the 1 trillion mega whale that is Norway This move alone would instantly trigger the short squeeze but there s still more to come which would leave the short squeeze as an after thought the opening flame to the beginning of something new and awe inspiring amp x200B GameStop absent the bears and shorts dragging it down would see a total transformation from brick and mortar store into the digital gaming world entering the future as the face and central hub of the gaming world as GameStop was always destined to be amp x200B With this move GameStop would instantly squeeze and flush out all of the short sellers and bears Melvin and the army of shorts would be defeated and bankrupted Once the dust settles post squeeze GameStop would easily settle in around at 50 60 share price due to the market pricing in the new and unlimited upside potential After RC takes the helm as the captain of the rocket ship GME will continue to grow as it transforms and executes its vision eventually surpassing 100 per share and onwards to 250 per share and beyond in the future years GameStop would conquer the gaming world amp x200B Norway could easily see their 100m investment return 2x 5x netting them a healthy 200m 500m profit perhaps upwards of 1 25 billion in the next few years while also bringing additional money and business opportunities to Norwegian companies making the move way too good of an opportunity to pass up A small 0 01 investment would net Norway easily a 200 to 1000 return ROI while also boosting the Norwegian economy helping Norwegian gaming companies tech companies and tourism industries amp x200B We humble degenerates would simply be along for the ride of a lifetime amp x200B TLDR Ryan Cohen partners with Norway to spends 0 01 of their portfolio and buy more GME shares Ryan Cohen takes over GameStop and our ally Norway becomes the home to all things Gaming in Europe boosting their economy GameStop moons and we all experience the biggest gains of a lifetime amp x200B Positions GME 300 shares 32 x 20c 25c 30c Apr 30 x 15c 20c Jan rip my 20c Dec 31 calls amp x200B amp x200B Note I m an

online digital experience Many processes inside of these companies are done manually with paper and can take weeks to process and receive approval Financial institutions are one of the most risk averse sets of customers Banks and other financial institutions will always be around Although these companies may look different from today this industry will always be around That s why Buffett invests in banks As cloud software and the regulatory burden becomes more expensive and time consuming financial institutions are looking to improve their processes to be more efficient and please customers Simple processes can drag on for weeks in financial institutions Cloud software nCino and nCino s competitors are helping solve this problem nCino aims to change these manual processes and make financial institutions more nimble while still being compliant with all regulations According to Gartner banking had the highest global enterprise IT spending of all industries with approximately 376 billion spent in 2018 Although nCino only defines its serviceable addressable market at 10bn the broader IT industry gives nCino a long runway of future potential growth nCino has a number of competitors My initial research shows that nCino competes with Fiserv Oracle and other small companies In order to invest in nCino a deeper look into the competitive environment will need to be completed Business Overview nCino was founded in 2012 by a team of bankers These founders built a software company solving problems for banks The founders knew the struggles that often occur inside banks and used their knowledge to solve these problems nCino is a bank operating system platform It helps provide banks onboard originate loans open accounts and many other processes The CEO stated in

regional community banks credit unions and challenger banks as customers nCino sells its software on a per seat basis This gives it room to continue to expand within its existing customer base nCino also stands to benefit from capturing more financial institutional clients and expanding their average contract value Here is a list of nCino s offerings loan origination portfolio analytics compliance and risk management digital customer engagement customer relationship management CRM client onboarding deposit account opening business process automation and enterprise content management Total Addressable Market nCino s S 1 touts that there are more than 28 000 financial institutions worldwide Gartner also lists banking as the industry with the highest global enterprise IT spending with approximately 376 billion spent in 2018 The financial industry is one of the largest industries and if nCino can help power even a sliver of this industry it will be a good future for this company Of course I have to caveat this by saying that starting a t shirt business and capturing 1 of the apparel industry may seem plausible but it is impossible I make this statement because nCino already has a strong base of customers and has done the work to capture this pie This gives it the possibility to capture more market share not all of it but more The bull thesis for nCino is to be the main software operating system for banks As banks become more reliant on technology nCino will prove to be a critical piece of infrastructure nCino will also develop more product offerings that help their customers This enhances the stickiness of nCino and leads to upsell opportunities nCino s management team lists the total serviceable market for nCino s bank operating system at more than 10bn I believe this is within reason and management is likely underestimating on purpose or not the addressable market they believe they can capture Competitive Advantages Although I like to be optimistic about companies when researching them I do think nCino is quite an attractive company based on my research on the qualitative aspects of the business Mission critical product with high switching costs The solutions that nCino provides are for mission critical processes that banks want to be done right Financial institutions would rather have a manual time consuming process than an automatic process that goes wrong Switching costs come into play once customers are comfortable with nCino s product As customers rely more and more on nCino these customers are unlikely to switch Switching from nCino or any company to a competitor may lead to outages issues and lots of problems that financial institutions will not risk having to deal with Even if financial institutions attempt to build out their own bank operating system it will be costly prone to error and not worth it That s like trying to build out Stripe if you re an e commerce company Shopify Allocating capital to build out this function will make zero sense for financial institutions It s better to stick to what you know and what you re good at That s why nCino will have high switching costs Economies of scale The cost of building out a suite of software products and deploying it to a large customer base is much cheaper for a large company than a small company Just like no startup would try and compete directly with Amazon Shopify Salesforce Stripe etc as nCino grows no company will come close to competing in the same fashion due to their scale benefits As nCino looks to expand its product offering the attractiveness of nCino s products to financial institutions will only grow Financial institutions a very risk averse set of customers want products that have been vetted by other financial institutions and have offerings that solve critical problems Financials Like many SaaS companies nCino has two primary revenue lines The first is recurring revenue similar to most SaaS companies The second revenue source is professional services revenue Subscription revenue accounts for the majority of revenue and gross profit January 2020 Total revenue 138mn GAAP Gross profit 74mn Subscription revenue 103mn Subscription revenue growth 60 Subscription gross profit margin 70 GAAP EBIT margin 20 January 2019 Total revenue 92mn GAAP Gross profit 45mn Subscription revenue 64mn Subscription revenue growth 69 Subscription gross profit margin 69 GAAP EBIT margin 25 January 2018 Total revenue 58mn GAAP Gross profit 28mn Subscription revenue 38mn Subscription revenue growth N A Subscription gross profit margin 67 GAAP EBIT margin 32 Although nCino is not profitable on a GAAP basis like many of its software peers the attractiveness of the growth story is compelling More research into unit economics may provide an even more compelling story What s Interesting The financial industry is a risk averse industry and usually one of the last industries to adapt to change This is changing with the increasing adoption of technology and software The innovation occurring in FinTech and in financial institutions is growing If nCino can be one of the main companies to be the operating system for banks just like Microsoft Salesforce is to most companies then nCino may be an attractive investment opportunity Salesforce also owns a large portion of nCino nCino relies on the Salesforce Platform Also this may initially seem like a concern Salesforce also owns 11 6 of nCino It wouldn t make much sense for Salesforce to stop nCino from using the Salesforce Platform if they own such a material stake in the company Some of the hedge funds that I follow Link https twitter com StratusYoung status 1327453755583893505 have positions in nCino which is what initially attracted me to this business Hedge funds like Dragoneer Tiger Global and Durable Capital have a position in nCino Sure these positions may just be small positions to take advantage of the tech IPO pop but future quarters will show if this is a long term position for these funds Future Questions Competition In order to be more confident in nCino I d have to know more about the banking industry and the various competitors and similar nCino product offerings Through my research I found some competitors but little to no information on these companies because they are private or are just not in the typical VC crowd I also am not sure how hard it would be for Salesforce Microsoft or another well funded company to try and launch similar product offerings to nCino It seems from first glance that nCino has a strong suite of products but not sure if this is something they ve built over time or is from the founders background in banking I doubt Salesforce would try and compete directly with nCino but may form some type of ongoing partnership Ownership I like to see management teams with large ownership stakes in the businesses they run With nCino I don t see a large ownership stake Although there were a number of founders and thus each founder has a small stake in nCino the largest positions by far are owned by Insight Partners Salesforce and Wellington I will need to do more research on digging into the ownership structure and see whether or not management is being incentivized alongside public investors Conclusion I think nCino is a strong company and in my opinion it s one of the more attractive investment opportunities from the companies I ve outlined in the past The financial industry is huge and if nCino can continue to innovate build products upsell existing customers and sign contracts with new customers I think nCino may be a stock that people will be talking about in 3 5 years It s had very strong growth thus far and likely will continue Of course the valuation is a key point with some concerns over the high multiple but relative to similar high growth high margin comparable companies nCino fits into this bucket

close , 2021 starts off with a bang as VIX shoots up an ungodly 30 during intraday peak During intraday low the Dow was down as much as 700 pts 2 3 Nasdaq 345 pts 2 6 and S amp P 94 2 5 WSB reeled in horror as stonk somehow doesn t always go up The market sell off accelerated in the morning after 10 AM as the market continues to keep an eye on the GA run off election with polls increasingly being more favorable for the DNC candidates No doubt an extra wrench was thrown to the GA GOP Senate campaigns as POTUS continues to pressure GA officials on figuring out votes cuz that s totes normal thing for a sitting President to do For those WSBer who failed basic HS civics class just one GOP win in the two senate seats run off will keep Biden s more progressive agenda at bay and likely the recent tax cut in tact as the GOP and McTurtle retain control of the Senate while a DNC win will secure both legislative branch for Dems as VP Harris be the tie breaking vote in the Senate Will this mean a bigger stimulus package A renew market sell off Should ANTM UNH and others quiver in fear Find out later this week as results will unlikely be clear even after polls are close on Tues night Jack Ma Alibaba s very public CEO has reportedly been missing in action in the past few months as speculation starts floating about his disappearance due to the CCP While memes float about of Ma being tucked away in a Chinese state prison with Randy Marsh due to pissing off Pooh Bear shares of BABA continues to be pressured despite a rebound last week as CCP s antitrust probe on both Alibaba and its subsidiary Ant Group chugs on BABA closed the day 2 10 at 227 85 while competitors PDD closed 6 13 to 166 78 and JD closed the day 1 79 at 86 33 QS the SPAC turned meme EV stock took a nice more than 40 dive today as shares sold off on well who the fuck knows why it sold off The EV battery maker took on a NKLA like trajectory and rallied as much as 120 before steadily trimming its gains in the past week For those who are adventurous OTM Jan 15 puts such as 35p are going for 1 55 while 40p are going for 3 3 But honestly do you really want to baghold QS at those pricing if assigned Shares closed the day down more than 34 40 84 to 49 96 If you sold puts you dun goofed Haven the AMZN BRK JPM venture in disrupting health care has disbanded after the 3 year attempt Turns out having sensible health care in America is hard as fuck Shares of healthcare companies UNH HUM et al were up during pre market and morning hours but faded through the day as overall macro pushed the sector down In more wait is this really America news more than 200 GOOGL employees and contractors in both the US and Canada have decided to unionized to promote a less shitty workplace and ethical business practices once a upon a time Google s motto was Do No Evil Collectively known as the Alphabet Workers Union the group s aim is to start small and eventually amass enough membership to actually address some of the more lofty goals namely pay and working conditions GOOGL closed the day down 1 51 though more likely inline due to overall macro than this thus far non material news Elon chan and his meme stock continues to kill whatever remaining short sellers are left as TSLA reaches new ATH after Q4 delivery report Despite the FY number being missed by 450 vehicles the quarterly delivery of 180 570 vehicles handily beat Wall Street s estimate of about 174k vehicles and shares are up bigly to close up 3 42 at 729 77 How did we ever doubt those WSB degens who loaded up 3 500 strike calls pre split which are now ITM Truly they were ahead of the times in knowing that TSLA will shoot up an additional 76 in the next 3 months On Chinese EV side of things NIO delivered 7k vehicles in Dec 2020 while XPEV delivered 5 700 vehicles both numbers are record growth for the two company which shows a YoY growth of 121 for NIO and 326 for XPEV WSB with OTM FDs know these growth well as their FDs goes from 100 in value but still down all time of 85 NIO closed the day up 9 75 to 53 49 and XPEV trimmed their intraday high of 10 to close up 2 97 at 44 10 In WSB meme stock land things are a fairly mixed bag as GME continues to fade after reaching a recent 52 week of 22 35 The definitely not going bankrupt video game retailer closed the day down 8 44 to 17 25 PLTR despite being up more than 2 in pre market closed the day relatively flat at 0 76 to 23 37 Finally steel gang got a respite today as MT closed the day up 4 59 though intraday high was up as much as 8 Looking for cheap and relatively responsible WSB meme stock play You can do GME covered call and sell April 35c for about 1 6 though I d recommend selling on a green day for 2 This will net you 100 shares of GME for less than 15 70 per share and cap your imaginary gains at 35 if the squeeze does happen Conversely you can go with GME April 20c 35c debit call spread for a low price of 2 4 per spread or for those who prefer to sell FDs to fellow WSBer poor man s covered call of Jan 2022 25c and selling weeklies and or April 35c will suffice At the end of the day the fact that April 35c has so much value still to it should be taken advantage if GME has a green day For MT June debit call spread is probably the way to go with 25c 35c a possible spread These are not financial advise and if you listen to a stranger online and lose your pants on the play then that s too bad DJI closed down 382 pts 1 25 IXIC closed down 189 pts 1 47 SPX 55 pts 1 48 and RUT is down 28 pts 1 47 Notable numbers and ERs this week ISM manufacturing index tomorrow at 10 AM ET BBBY reports on Thursday before market opens while MU reports after market close Load up on those MU 90c for 7 20 this time it ll definitely hit Last week s recap none cuz I was enjoying the covid yacht party

listen up ladies and gentlecucks I have some fresh off the griddle DD for you Let s talk about QRTEA aka Qurate Retail Group aka QVC aka QxH I ve noticed nobody on here is really talking about this company but it s in a very interesting position and is way undervalued Let s get this out of the way You mean the fucking company that sells shit to my boomer parents on TV Yeah that fucking company Processing img am4fnjwftd961 Real quick let s first take a look at WTF I m talking about You see that sad sad 5 year chart above Great 1 QVC that boomer fuck of a company And WTF is a Qurate Okay so I can t answer that second question Is it supposed to be a play on curate I don t know it s fucking awful but irrelevant Moving on Over the past 5 years QVC has gone down the shitter Which well duh who the fuck besides your granny is buying stuff from a TV channel The price bottomed out around 3 earlier this year Oof But through a series of buyouts mergers and restructures between 2018 and today they ve strategically and frankly very quietly put themselves in a great position to make a significant turnaround I m not the only one who thinks so you ll see why below First and foremost here s the deal their market cap is currently only 4 9B which makes no sense against their revenues which were roughly 13 5B in 2019 That s a P S ratio of only 0 35 aka THEIR MARKET CAP IS ONLY A THIRD OF THEIR REVENUES The fuck amp x200B Processing img 558sb3iktd961 In 2018 they increased their revenues dramatically YoY But you re probably thinking so fucking what I have eyes and can see in 2019 they had a shit year and did the opposite of grow Well 2 OMNICHANNEL No but actually ecommerce So first and foremost In 2018 ecommerce revenue became 58 of their annual revenues 1 So they re no longer just that tv channel your senile grandma buys from They re a through and through ecomm company now To go further they actually own several ecommerce brands including Zulily Y all ve likely seen ads for Zulily but I m sure most of you have no idea what they sell That s because the target demo isn t you it s mothers with young children aka woman between the ages of 20 and 40 My guess is that that represents a few of you but the vast majority of you are basement dwelling manchildren that would never use Zulily I certainly don t But it doesn t really matter what they sell My point is that in 2018 they grew their customer base by 24 2 and in 2019 they released a stat noting that they have 91 customer return rate 3 which is insanely high with that growth Their customers are dedicated af and their customer base is growing rapidly What sort of P S ratios do ecomm companies have in 2020 Well let s look at the conservative case Overstock Processing img bp5y21dntd961 Over 2x higher than Qurate But that s just one company What about others Processing img ty6cj9potd961 Convinced yet No Fucking fine let s keep going 3 Ferrari No Ferraro And maybe a Ferrari Their shitty 2019 revenues were likely due to a massive restructuring where they finally merged HSN and QVC at the end of 2018 4 No surprise there restructuring two behemoth old fucks is a big job Money was invested Revenues slid But then at the end of 2019 they hired Leslie Ferraro 5 Who the fuck is Ferraro Oh only the previous president of Disney s Consumer Products division during one of their highest growth periods 6 and someone who was at the company for 17 years before leaving in 2016 This is a woman who has options she s not going to join a sinking ship after taking 3 years to make a decision about what company to join So she joined in September 2019 just before we kicked off our current pandemic as president of newly combined QxH which is the combination of QVC and HSN oh look they have no real competitors in this space now With her experience in marketing licensing and interactive media she ll likely be able to grow the digital and ecomm side of this business beyond its life as fading boomer TV telesales networks Even so their revenues were still surprisingly significant which brings me to 2020 4 COVID 19 When COVID 19 happened and we all got trapped inside and forgot what it was like to interact with other humans like when you used to leave your basement to say hi to your wife and her boyfriend upstairs This means your boomer parents and granny have been doing nothing but watching fucking TV and browsing the internet at 300 zoom I don t think I need to tell you why that s good for QRTEA but just in case you re too smooth brained to understand it means they ve done incredibly well this year compared to 2019 and will likely outdo their 2018 revenues Just take a look at their last 10 Q filing https ir qurateretail com node 32576 html BalanceSheets 260982 https ir qurateretail com node 32576 html BalanceSheets 260982 big numbers many words TL DR numbers go from negative in 2019 to positive in 2020 5 Michael fucking Burry In addition to all of this there s my favorite kicker sometime between June and September Michael Always A Bit Too Early But Not Wrong Burry bought 1 1 million shares of QRTEA 7 Since then the price has just bounced around a bunch and is still flat but that doesn t mean squat This is a man with a plan and a fuckton of shares 6 The Dividends On November 20th Qurate released an announcement that they ll be doing a 1 50 per share special dividend and a share buyback 8 Presumably this means they ve been having a spectacular Q4 on top of a great three quarters leading up to that and they have the cash to not only give a dividend but buy back shares Processing img cx44i50utd961 The day they made that announcement the price jumped from 8 83 to 11 59 by the 25th It settled in the 10 range after that 7 Lastly Melvin Capital those dumb fucks and the battle of shorts I swear it s like they exclusively just inverse Burry s positions Or Burry inverses their positions IDGAF The point is Melvin Capital is holding 31M of puts 9 on QRTEA They created this position in Q2 of this year 10 when the stock was between 5 7 so I assume they expected Qurate to go bankrupt lol and have put themselves in a really shitty position They actually unraveled about 11M worth of puts in Q3 so that 31M position is down from 42M I guess realizing they were immediately underwater and perhaps becoming aware of Burry s investment As we all know these folks will do anything to keep the price down They re already underwater and I ve noticed the past couple weeks there has been a whale putting up a huge sell wall to keep the price below 11 30 Keep playing those games friends How s it working out for you on GME 8 Conclusion So where does this leave us We have a company that has a wildly undervalued market cap compared to revenues has restructured itself into a real ecomm company has brought on an expert at growth in the interactive and licensing space has growing revenue during a pandemic and was perfectly positioned to take advantage of it and feed growth and is doing so well it issued a special dividend and set up a buyback program Michal MF Burry has bought in and Melvin Capital is shorting it which if GME is anything to go by is a good sign TL DR QRTEA is no longer a boomer company and the market hasn t realized it yet so it s still undervalued Q4 holiday earnings are in February Position 2300 shares 500 18 5c 4 16 References for you

late Democrats have taken the lead in the Georgia Senate run offs which could spell big trouble for tech companies sporting lofty valuations especially non profitable ones See below amp x200B Processing img v8qnudiice961 amp x200B Processing img 374t218jce961 So why exactly does a Blue Wave spell trouble for tech companies A couple reasons more fiscal spending higher inflation expectations higher interest rates less valuable long term cashflows tech trade crowding and hedge fund leverage Let me explain amp x200B Fiscal Spending Inflation and Interest Rates Generally speaking Democratic policy favors a large government budget and with hopes to spend over 5T on clean energy infrastructure education and healthcare Biden s team isn t breaking from the mold A blue wave would make it much easier for the Biden administration to enact these policies While Biden is planning on increasing taxes by 3 4T to offset his spending the government still needs to create money to finance these projects which leads to inflation Moreover the Fed has taken a newly lax stance on its price stability mandate and is welcoming inflation of more than 2 so it won t hesitate to let prices run hot to achieve its inflation target As shown in the graph below 10 yr bond yields and fed funds rate tend to be highly correlated to measures of inflation as its a natural way to dampen the acceleration of rising prices amp x200B Processing img g1uje1ymce961 Summary dem sweep higher fiscal spending higher inflation higher interest rates How This Affects Tech Stock Valuation For all the retards who have never taken a finance course or don t understand basic valuation techniques the essence of stock valuation is projecting future free cash flows and discounting them back at a risk adjusted rate b c 1 is worth more today than 1 five yrs from now and there s not 100 certainty in the CFs the company might produce in the future Thus the main determinant of a company s value is its profitability the rate at which you discount the company s cash flows and the time horizon you analyze it at which can be related to the discount rate For those actually interested google discounted cash flow analysis With the current fed funds rate pinned between 0 and 25 and the 10yr yield less than 1 you can practically look out at a time horizon of 10 20 years before discounting back cash flows Though still a stretch interest rates at this level might be able to justify some of the 30 50x price sales multiples we see in certain growthy tech names at the moment amp x200B Processing img 5635a9ypce961 That said if interest rates do begin to rise as a result of a blue sweep and analysts are forced to incorporate risk free rates of 2 3 into their discount rates at time horizons where these companies generate little profit tech companies could see their valuation multiples deteriorate by 50 Even just pre Covid valuation multiples for the above growthy names would absolutely crush their stock price I understand Covid brought forward significant demand for tech companies and in many ways permanently altered consumer behavior but this chart shows pure multiple expansion on the basis of forward revenues not even earnings assuming low discount rates and near infinite time horizons Crowded Long Tech Trade It s no real surprise but according to a recent BofA survey the long technology strategy is the most popular crowded among fund managers Also a year end Morgan Stanley report indicated that hedge fund gross and net exposure was near all time highs at 100 and 96 ile respectively amp x200B Processing img eu7eyrurce961 A Quick Note on Leverage Hedge funds use leverage to amplify returns and when leverage is cheap see above they are more keen to do so If a hedge fund is levered at 2x it has 100 of capital to support 200 of positions A 10 drawdown would leave the fund with 80 of capital to support 180 of positions with a new leverage multiple of 2 25x If this were to happen the fund would have to sell roughly 20 of its book to maintain its leverage ratio In such a crowded trade selling like this would cause another fund to liquidate a portion of its holdings to not become over levered and this self sustaining cycle of selling persists An example of this price action and positive feedback loop is the Quant Quake of 2007 though its trade was less crowded and firms were probably more highly levered Conclusion TLDR A blue wave and higher interest rates or even the fear expectation thereof could quickly unravel the long technology trade due to its crowding leverage and a newfound preference for shorter duration cash flows crushing the stock prices of non profitable tech companies amp x200B Positions QQQ 300p 1 29 CRWD 200p 1 29 amp x200B amp x200B Note This is not
