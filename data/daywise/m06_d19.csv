accurately represent what it should be and does not present the proper legal disclaimers As a semi professional DD Writer myself I believe that it is my duty to try and at least somewhat help you dumbass apes Over the course of this post I hope to create a picture of what DD is supposed to look like as well as how to avoid responsibility when your shitty stock tanks 90 after you wrote 30 dogshit DDs per day on why it would go up 400 tomorrow Title When writing titles for Due Diligence posts it is important to note that you must accurately encompass your entire work in a single phrase This might sound hard considering you re all illiterate but it s easy Let s start with the basics Titles can vary based on the type of due diligence you are writing but generally if you re writing analysis fundamental or technical you will be using the same type of title The first word must indicate whether your analysis is 100 thorough and complete 1 or rather if there are kinks that need to be worked out within it 2 upcoming data etc You all will most certainly be using 2 In the case of 2 you must start the title of your DD with the phrase Preliminary analysis Preliminary describes whether it is in progress or not in this case it is and analysis is analysis After you have written this you must then follow it up by saying on company name business structure abbreviation INDEX TICKER We write it like this to specify the company whose business we will be analyzing as well as their home index and stock ticker After this we write who the DD is for In the case of company analysis for that specific company an investment bank will put the company they are analyzing in that region Here s an example Preliminary Analysis on ContextLogin Inc NASDAQ WISH for The Special Committee of the Constituents at WallStreetBets Legal disclaimers When writing papers on stocks it is important to note that any and all assumptions you make can be seen as a form of guaranteeing movement of a stock For example if I were to say BlackBerry is looking like it s gonna jump 30 All in the law would consider me to be giving financial advice It is always important to preface a piece of DD with the proper legal disclaimers so as to prevent you from being prosecuted by illiterate apes when they lose money Before you begin the body of your DD you must give two important disclaimers 1 I am not a financial accounting tax or legal advisor we ll elaborate on that one in a moment 2 This Due Diligence is made solely for fun private usage and should be considered as such This DD is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should not be treated as definitive proof of any future events past results are no guarantee of future performance we ll elaborate on this one after the first mention I have been seeing people use the term I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice The worst part about this is the fact that it is usually added at the end of their DD Here are a few guidelines 1 Add your disclaimers at the beginning of your DD 2 The first mentioned disclaimer should include information as to what qualifications you do NOT have Most individuals just say either I am not a financial advisor and leave it at that while others go a step further with I am not a financial or tax advisor The truth is that you need more than that You must include a statement that says that you will not interfere with government authority and tax law as well as disclosing what qualifications you do not have And example of a proper 1 disclaimer would be u Some other guy 1 does not provide accounting tax or legal advice Notwithstanding anything in this document to the contrary and except as required to enable compliance with applicable securities law you and each of your fellow WallStreetBetters apes moderators and other users may disclose to any and all persons in the US federal income and state tax treatment and tax structure of the transaction and all materials of any kind including tax opinions and other tax analyses that are provided to you relating to such tax treatment and tax structure without u Some other guy 1 imposing any limitation of any kind 3 The second mentioned disclaimer should include information that states that the DD you have written is preliminary and the stock you are doing DD on is subject to change For example The information in this presentation is based upon any information supplied to me and reflects prevailing conditions and my views as of this date of which are suspect to Change My estimates should be regarded as indicative preliminary and for illustrative purposes only Body Writing proper DD comes with a set of requirements on coverage of certain topics Topics you cover in your DD should include 1 Market perception 2 How does X stock compare to other members of its sector 3 What are some of the potential market alternatives to X stock and how might they affect the value of X stock 4 What alternatives may be able to overtake X stock and how might we evaluate them After you initiate these topics you proceed to covering them in as much depth as possible finding as many possible answers to them as possible Add a bull AND bear case If you can t find any negatives for your penny stock you re delusional Conclusion In conclusion I hope that this bit of guidance helps increase the quality of DD on this subreddit Thanks for sticking around if you did and have a nice day

position in NVIDIA but nonetheless the reason for this DD is strictly information not persuasive I truly believe NVIDIA is undervalued currently I believe NVDIA will reach 800 pre split 200 post 4 1 split with the current momentum going for the stock along with a shift to tech soon If you didn t know already NVIDIA designs graphics processing units for the gaming and professional markets as well as system on a chip units for the mobile computing and automotive market EARNINGS NVIDIA recently had its earnings report in which they reported 3 66 earnings per share for the quarter beating the consensus estimate of 3 28 by 0 38 They recorded revenue of 5 66 billion up 84 percent from a year earlier and up 13 percent from the previous quarter with record revenue from the company s Gaming Data Center and Professional Visualization platforms Gaming revenue of 2 76 billion up 106 percent from a year earlier Record Data Center revenue of 2 05 billion up 79 percent from a year earlier Quarterly Earnings Surprise Amount Fiscal Quarter End Date Reported Earnings Per Share Consensus EPS Forecast Surprise Apr 2021 05 26 2021 3 13 2 62 19 47 Jan 2021 02 24 2021 2 58 2 2 17 27 Oct 2020 11 18 2020 2 41 1 92 25 52 Jul 2020 08 19 2020 1 67 1 63 2 45 As you can see over the past four quarterly earnings NVDIA has beaten each of the projected forecasts easily for the most part With a gross margin of 64 11 for this quarter and an average quarterly gross margin of 60 96 over the past 5 years NVDIA is primed to continue its dominance for the future Also it is important to note that NVDIA beats out its main competitors Intel and AMD in gross margins on average over the past 5 years and over the last quarter NVDIA Gross Profit Margin Quarterly Range Past 5 Years Minimum 54 74 Jan 2019 Maximum 65 06 Apr 2020 Average 60 96 AMD Gross Profit Margin Quarterly Range Past 5 Years Minimum 4 51 Sep 2016 Maximum 46 07 Mar 2021 Average 37 34 Intel Gross Profit Margin Quarterly Range Past 5 Years Minimum 53 13 Sep 2020 Maximum 64 50 Sep 2018 Average 59 65 Now onto reasons why I think NVIDIA is a strong buy 1 Price targets NVDIA is still undervalued with multiple price targets very much higher than the current price of what NVDIA is trading at currently along with multiple buy ratings One example in specific Bank of America recently upgraded NVDIA price target to 900 from 800 and reiterated its Buy rating The bank said its takeaway is that rising AI adoption expanding use cases across cloud enterprise edge telco can help NVDA double its content and triple its data center sales over the next few years Bank of America said it expects NVIDIA s data center business to grow at a 35 compounded rate to become its largest segment by year end 2025 Other notable price targets include 854 Jefferies 800 Robert W Baird 800 Rosenblatt Securities 1 Acquisition of ARM ARM can t stay independent for long even the CEO thinks so Arm CEO Simon Segars made the case that if it stays independent Arm wouldn t be able to keep up with the increasing demands of its customers for more complex chips that can perform a wider variety of functions The simple solution Getting acquired by another company NVIDIA seems to be in the lead to acquire ARM and other rivals are terrified They have a good reason to be as NVDIA already a strong leader wants to spend 40 billion to acquire U K chip technology provider Arm Holdings This acquisition will reshape the industry entirely NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said the acquisition of ARM is an opportunity to create a company that can generate even more new ideas and bring more innovation to its customers in the form of intellectual property A quote in specific The benefit to the market and to the Arm customers will be more IP better IP more accelerated road maps and hopefully taking Arm to the far reaches of what is becoming the diversity of computing that is literally going in every single direction Huang said You re covering everything from cloud to edge to internet of things to high performance computing to microprocessors to accelerated computing everything 2 Internet currency Not allowed to say actual word so replaced it with internet GPU s can be used for internet currency and its mining purposes It s possible to blame the graphic card shortage on these miners but nonetheless the usage of them is highly prevalent today NVIDIA s releases of processors specifically used for mining poses a huge boost to its revenue and to the internet currency world NVIDIA booked 155 million in revenue from CMP cards in its fiscal first quarter While internet money is gaining traction around the world we can expect NVIDIA to continue its dominance and reliability in mining purposes 3 Stock split On May 21st NVIDIA announced a 4 1 stock split which would take place on July 19th So for every one share you own you will own four instead as the stock splits its price valuation by four On the day of the news NVIDIA s stock price closed at 599 67 Since then the price of NVIDIA s stock has gone up around 24 to 743 75 Not even one month has passed and the stock is up 24 With one full month until the split I predict NVDIA to hit 800 or and above by the time of the official split Call options and shares in my opinion are the way to go for the next month as this could be a great opportunity to invest in a fast growth company 4 Growth NVIDIA has been a great growth tech stock to own recently with the numbers backing this statement up NVIDIA RETURNS YTD 223 35 42 77 1 Year 376 83 102 20 6 Months 214 67 40 44 1 Month 184 92 32 98 Now for the returns on NVIDIA compared to AMD and INTEL NVIDIA RETURNS YTD 223 35 42 77 1 Year 376 83 102 20 6 Months 214 67 40 44 1 Month 184 92 32 98 AMD RETURNS YTD 7 06 7 70 1

wise showing complete dominance with its stock price Concluding I believe NVIDIA is a must buy presplit and the risk is minimum The stock shows solid uptrend with extreme growth to come NVIDIA is a strong buy in my personal opinion and an amazing company to be invested in
