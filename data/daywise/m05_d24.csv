moon, Bona Fide Market Makers are Granted Exceptions to the Locate Provision The SEC has consistently stated that it believes that both legitimate shorting and naked shorting are important to maintain market liquidity The agency s actions seem to consistently place more importance on liquidity than preventing illegal naked shorting Very importantly Reg SHO exempts bona fide market makers from locate requirements that apply to ordinary investors because it believes this is necessary to facilitate customer orders and maintain liquidity in fast moving markets Hence market makers are not required to adhere to the locate rule They can naked short stock without a locate Close out Requirement Rule 204 of Reg SHO covers the situation in which the short seller Fails to Deliver FTD the stock at the determined settlement time If this occurs Rule 204 requires action on the part of the brokers and dealers from whom the stock was borrowed to close out the trade by demanding that the short seller buy the stock in the open market Settlements are made two days after a stock trade and this rule requires that the short seller must close out a FTD no later than the beginning of regular trading on the first day after the settlement date This is three days after the trade and is referred to as T 2 There are exemptions of course to this rule If a broker dealer has a FTD but can demonstrate that that this resulted from bona fide market making activities the close out of the FTD can be extended to the third day after the scheduled settlement day T 5 If the position is not closed out a participant in the short sell can not undertake more short sells unless it has entered into a pre borrowing agreement as ordinary investors are required to do This restriction stays in place until the FTD is closed out Shortly I will describe how this rule is easily avoided amp x200B Threshold Securities Rule 203 B is a component of Reg SHO which mandates the creation and operation of threshold securities lists These are securities that have large and persistent Fail to Delivers that are a hallmark of illegal naked shorting The SEC defines these as equity securities that have an aggregate Fail to Deliver position totaling 10 000 shares or more for five consecutive settlement days and is equal to at least 0 5 of the issuer s total shares outstanding The various major exchanges create and publish these lists on a daily basis Designation of a stock as a threshold security triggers provisions of Reg SHO that are intended to eliminate the FTDs If the security remains on the threshold list for thirteen days T 13 whoever was responsible for delivering shares thirteen days earlier likely a broker dealer or market maker must close out the failed position by purchasing equivalent shares in the open market Until the time that the market participant responsible for the FTDs closes out the position they cannot enter into new short sales of the threshold security without having first borrowed or entered into a bona fide agreement to borrow the shares Unlike the locate requirements of Rule 203 A market makers are not exempt from these close out requirements In practice this has not worked out so well Many companies remain on the threshold list for months at a time This can be explained by a practice in which the FTDs are rolled over from one brokerage house to another After thirteen days a market maker that naked shorted the shares is required by Reg SHO to buy shares in the open market and deliver them However before the close out requirements are triggered on day thirteen the market maker can transfer the position to another willing market maker or broker and the thirteen day countdown to a mandatory buy in starts all over This frequently used Wall Street trading technique allows FTDs to remain for months or years Techniques Used to Circumvent Reg SHO The SEC has limited enforcement ability and seems to be content to allow Wall Street and the DTCC to police themselves This was made evident in one lawsuit that I read in which a household name Prime Broker was alleged to have committed numerous illegal actions These are representative of techniques that are used routinely across Wall Street by almost all prime brokers Examples are permitting important hedge fund clients to bypass the locate requirement when entering short sales creating and distributing easy to borrow lists that improperly included threshold and hard to borrow securities to the firm s proprietary traders and clients concealing FTDs through washed and matched trades i e rolling over an FTD to another broker dealer transacting illegal stock sales in dark pools off the primary markets to avoid NYSE oversight and to maintain anonymity failing to reasonably supervise that locates were obtained and or documented for short sales falsely marking short sales as long on order tickets to conceal naked short positions falsely representing that they either possessed the borrowed securities or had located them for borrowing and delivery failing to make legitimate or reasonable efforts to locate shares prior to short selling entering into fictitious option contract to conceal naked short sales using the DTCC stock borrowing program as a means to conceal naked short sales submitting fake short interest and other reports to regulators concealing their activity through falsely reporting shares created through illegal naked shorting as shares in brokerage statements of investors as if these assets were representative of real shares concealing their activity by issuing voting material to shareholders with nonexistent assets who have no corporate rights including the right to vote shares failing to comply with responsibilities and duties to investigate and report suspicious transactions to regulatory authorities

122,njq4z0,t2_cvt03ae,1621832827,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njq4z0/airline_sector_dd/,1,Airline sector DD,Are airlines undervalued My analysis Hello folks I ve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general I am an advisor analyst for Brighton Jones a team of money managers advisors analysts and accounts and have beaten the market 6 8 of the past years with an average yearly return of 22 I don t say this to brag or to seem self important I just want to make it clear that I m not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it and now thinks they re the next Warren Buffet The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19 As a value investor what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors I m aware Airlines are a sub category of the transportation sector and aren t technically their own sector but you get the point many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre covid price With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world airlines should soon in most estimations by mid 2022 2023 be back to pre covid levels I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30 60 we ll get to those in a bit in the near future but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks AAL I think this stock is reasonably priced right now If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117 the second largest only behind UAL AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average compared to other airlines and market cap at 1 95 Billion but has a high average revenue the highest of the major stocks at 43 Billion If you re a net profit guy gal you should stay away from this one If Revenue is more important to you you could justify a buy right now because AAL s market cap is the lowest of the major airlines Delta Southwest and United but the company at least before covid generated more revenue than all of them I just don t see enough profit here to justify a buy but I don t think it s necessarily a sell either Sorry for a non concrete opinion on this one It s the only stock here I don t think is either completely overvalued or undervalued Delta Delta is a buy in my opinion Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for Delta s 30 Billion in market cap is higher than every airline s besides Southwest but Delta s yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up s also Southwest and has the second highest average revenue about 100 million not even half a percent less than AAL s Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis but still matters somewhat and has an average leadership staff Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market and should be trading around 40 45 Billion market cap roughly 10 times average profit less than 1 2 times revenue Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector that isn t an unfair price Southwest Sell sell sell Southwest is an awesome company Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline and they are by far the most respected airline out there With that being said there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion 7 Billion higher than Delta a company that is much more profitable Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid yea you read that right and there is no justification for it United This is a higher risk higher reward Delta UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60 lower than LUV by about 100 and only about 15 higher than AAL But United is second in average yearly profit and is barely behind the two neck and neck revenue leaders by a small amount 43 vs 40 Billion Unlike Delta there are a few things that worry me about this company First and foremost public opinion again I think this is overvalued a bit but is still important United is the most hated airline in America and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago Seriously these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins Compared to other airlines UAL s has been abysmal Under new leadership that I really like I think that will change While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth Thanks for taking the time to read this and I d love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have As a disclosure this isn t legally necessary I just include it in good faith I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares and I have clients who own United shares I do not own any other airlines and my clients at least from me do not either I really enjoyed doing this and would love to do it again on any stock security you guys would like it on

questionable https www usinflationcalculator com inflation current inflation rates to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long term effects To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices first we have to understand the basics of inflation What is inflation To put it simply inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency As prices of products inflate each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value Zimbabwe https en wikipedia org wiki Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe is an extreme example they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy The raw material prices increase consumers can purchase fewer goods and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached Is it a serious concern among investors https preview redd it izi11ho4k2171

to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S amp P500 As expected mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days How does inflation affect stock price The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies In the long run shares can act as a hedge against inflation i e the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers But let s be real here None of us are interested in the long term behavior and want to know the short term impacts on stock prices In general stock prices have an inverse correlation as can be observed from the chart above i e as inflation rises stock prices fall This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short term revenue and profits general economic slowdown and a prospect of lowered real returns But the single most important factor to consider for short term stock price swings is interest rates Interest Rates https preview redd it r3x8iy46k2171 png width 594

actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat While the Fed still hasn t announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated What does it mean for my portfolio Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods growth stocks drop in price This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company thereby adversely impacting the share price Processing img 3vg0lqm9k2171 Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is we have multiple options If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks Commodities and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes Conclusion The short term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed s explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year Whatever the case may be we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor

DKS TD BMO and More, Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation Week 6 NVDA SNOW CRM COST BBY ZS DKS TD BMO and More amp nbsp What s poppin bull gang Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week cause it s time to do it all again Earnings season is just about over so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around Thank you all for joining me for the ride amp nbsp All that being said I fucking love earnings season It s an absolute battleground out there Insane volatility breaking announcements and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time What s not to love Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers roll the dice and amass a small fortune That being said the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders many find that they re one bad trade away from a complete blowout so you always need to think about each trade critically No shame in sitting it out altogether amp nbsp The Spreadsheet To aid us in planning our trades this week I ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week https docs google com spreadsheets d 1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft ZMAM315Xtw edit usp sharing Using this spreadsheet we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker Obviously past performance isn t indicative of future success but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information If you re struggling to find a given stock click on the ticker symbol on the index page it should hyperlink you straight to the table If the above link isn t working for you refer to the link below amp nbsp Spreadsheet HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft ZMAM315Xtw edit usp sharing amp nbsp Please note that scraping and compiling this data took hours If the sheet has helped you out in any way please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials It would mean alot to me Most websites also require you to pay for this data which I think is a load of shit amp nbsp Interesting Observations and Sample Plays Below I ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance If I missed anything feel free to bring it to my attention amp nbsp All major Canadian Banks report this week Some names in the lineup include BMO RY TD and CM BMO reports first out of the four so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks Similar to the American banks in Week 1 I m expecting huge beats across the board alongside some comfortable upwards movement amp nbsp Those with OTC TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks Again similar to Week 1 you could ve played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag Those looking to run that play back should look into ZEB The IV is low as hell and it only holds Canadian banks Options on it are dirt cheap with an option less than 1 OTM going for a grand total of 0 10 Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3 bagger Unfortunately the ticker isn t liquid whatsoever and the bid ask spread isn t too appealing You re gonna be buying at the ask and selling at the bid so even if we get a nice move we re still gonna get trashed by slippage ITM options may be the way to play this one I couldn t find a better ETF alternative so this one is the best we got This play is definitely one of the riskier ones amp nbsp Piggybacking off the last point liquidity is suspect this week Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains If you think you see an awesome play make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it You ll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain so there s gonna be a fucking crater in the bid ask spread You re guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners amp nbsp ZScaler options are inefficiently priced Historically ZScaler moves roughly 15 post earnings but the options chain is only pricing in a 5 move this time round This gives us gambler a huge edge since we won t get IV crushed as hard and we can buy our options for cheap There are lots of strategies you can run this week but I m personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills amp nbsp Obviously since I gave data on over 40 companies there s plenty that I ve missed Dive in have a look around and have some fun with it Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes and get the best risk reward possible Feel free to share your findings too I d love to see what you guys come up with amp nbsp Conclusion We ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week meaning there s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles Use the spreadsheet https docs google com spreadsheets d 1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft ZMAM315Xtw edit usp sharing to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio and play accordingly If enough people found these useful I ll continue making them throughout the earnings season If the sheet has helped you out in any way please consider dropping an upvote or a comment and checking out my socials it would mean a lot to me Happy Trading Everybody

depth of approximately 6 500 metres in water depth of approximately 370m and is slated to be drilled soon spudding in Q3 of 2021 The primary target is a Santonian age stratigraphic trap interpreted to

the past few years and Guyana has been losing billions of dollars as it lacked the necessary infrastructure More than 75 of the port business servicing offshore oil and gas operations in Guyana and Suriname are provided by Trinidadian ports The head of Suriname s national oil company Staatsolie confirmed the need for a deepwater port facility to service activities in both countries Today there

countries and ninth overall https www drillingcontractor org exploration boom in guyana suriname high dollar high stakes 60031 There are cost fuel and carbon footprint concerns for companies operating in Guyana and Suriname as the sailing time to Trinidad ports to the fields offshore Guyana and Suriname require approximately 48 hours of sailing one way as opposed to between 12 and 14 hours from the Berbice river CGX Energy port location This means that significantly more fuel is consumed for services from Trinidad based ports leading to increased carbon emissions and escalation of costs related to fuel consumption equipment rental wear and tear and complicated logistics This is a profound opportunity not only for CGX Energy but also for Guyanese people seeking to capitalize on the emerging jobs in the oil and gas industry The Berbice Deepwater Port is expected to create some 1 000 direct jobs during the construction phase with 300 persons employed when the Port is fully operational A

present as such access to capital and risk of dilution are significant risk factors As with any exploratory player CGX Energy has significant geologic risk with respect to its offshore blocks In

better ETF alternative so this one is the best we got This play is definitely one of the riskier ones amp nbsp Piggybacking off the last point liquidity is suspect this week Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains If you think you see an awesome play make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it You ll find that lots of the
