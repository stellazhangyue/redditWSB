stories like this amp x200B gt Before 1776 you didn t need to know math and shit to understand economics Because back then if a country was 1 3 of the world s population like India in year 1 AD it was 1 3 of the global economy And if a country had 1 4 of the world s population like China at the time it was 1 4 of the global economy Because before tractors and electricity and shit were invented during the industrial revolution which was in full swing by 1776 a motherfucker could only hunt or gather or grow so much shit on any given plot of land If a country ran out of land it ran out of food and its people starved which kept both population and economic growth in check And that explains all that old world raping and pillaging and conquering of land because up to that point economic growth meant one thing more land gt gt But after the industrial revolution a motherfucker could grow or produce a shit ton more on any given plot of land which meant if you could out think and out machine the other guy you could make legit fuck you cash money without a crown or an army which was some new shit at the time And to explain all this in 1776 Adam Smith wrote a book called An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations and invented economics And thank god for that because for roughly 300 000 years before Smiths book people believed that successful crops and hunts and shit was the work of the gods What Smith taught us is that economic production in the post industrial era is not the work of god but instead the the work of invisible hands And this changed everything gt gt It just so happened that the same year Smith invented economics the United States of America was invented a frontier refuge for wild eyed fortune seekers and reject religious mystics and in America all that new money magic found one fuck of a home And for the next hundred years or so Americans went ape shit building their country while experimenting with all this new money magic hustling and slaughtering their way across the Wild West to the Pacific Ocean leaving a trail of over 1000 banks and more than 8000 different paper currencies gt gt But by 1849 with no more land to settle everyone realized that the US paper money situation was out of control and what the world really needed was some kinda universal non bullshit currency everyone could agree on And fuck it just so happened gold was discovered in California that year and thats some shiny ass universal cash money bling everyone could agree on gt gt So for the next hundred years as the rest of the old world warred themselves broke killing each other over land all old school like America built new and improved machines and hoarded gold until finally by the end of WWII America totally owned that shit and became the pimp daddy boss man of global money I mean America had most of the worlds gold which meant America had all the money in the world So to seal the deal in 1944 the US invited all those broke ass bitch money countries to a hotel in Bretton Woods New Hampshire and explained how global money shit was gonna work moving forward the US would own and manage the worlds gold supply and set the price of gold and peg the US dollar to gold which they alone would exclusively control Meanwhile everyone else would peg their bitch ass money to the dollar Or they were commies in which case they still had to peg their money to dollars if they wanted to buy the shit they needed from the west but only after converting it at shitty exchange rates on the black market And the rest of the world seeing how their paper shit compared to all that US gold they were like cool gt gt With all the worlds money newly interconnected and global shit got really fucking complicated Thankfully to explain it all in 1934 a dude named John Maynard Keynes wrote the The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money and invented macro economics which compared to Adam Smith was like the New Testament of money same God different rules gt gt Or maybe exactly like that I mean what does it say on the US dollar It says in God we trust Fuck the US constitution doesn t even say that This was some holy fucking shit they were dealing with and they knew it So taking a page from Ancient Rome in 1913 the US Congress built 13 stone columned temples across the land to house a select group of non elected financial holy men to guide the magic hands This was called The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States of America and to this day that s where we go to pray when money shit gets really fucked up in the world gt gt In the decades that followed WWII shit was pretty good in the USA and Americans spent like fat ass type 2 diabetic SSRI happy sun burnt Florida Lottery winners Which was fucking great for a while but by the early 1970 s the debt started to pile up And well everyone knows the 70 s was a total shit decade in American history In fact by the early 70 s the country was a fucking mess unemployment was 6 1 and inflation some old school economic shit you can Google was 6 2 Which would suck for any US President to deal with especially in an election year Because dealing with a troubled economy requires leadership and sacrifice which is a hard sell to American voters in the best of times and imfuckingpossible for a dude like Richard Milhous Nixon So after months of praying to the Fed for a re election miracle Nixon had an idea Well it wasn t really his idea it was something his 42 year old Undersecretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs a guy by the name of Paul Volcker had been pitching for a while Basically Volcker realized that the US was the pimp daddy of all the worlds money which meant US money was the only game in town which meant the US treasury could wipe their ass with newly printed dollars and the world would still pimp their sisters to get their dirty little war torn broke ass fingers on the shit So fuck why back the money with gold That shit was just a whole lotta extra work what with all that settling of account balances and interest rates and shit Fuck that gt gt You get the point and so did Nixon He was a fucking hustler at heart plus he was the fucking President of the United States and if Volcker was right de pegging the dollar to gold would mean he could manipulate the fuck out of the invisible hands Like printing billions or paper dollars to distribute to smart money Wall Street campaign donors to invest in stocks and jack up asset prices putting a few imaginary paper dollars in the pockets of struggling main Street dumb money investor voters or debase the value of US money just enough to drive down prices of shit rate US exports to win back market share from Germany and Japan gt gt But just one problem Fed Chair Arthur Burns who was like wait what gt gt Ok so here s the thing Nixon was a fucking sleazeball who would give zero fucks to just bulldozing those sanctimonious unelected Fed motherfuckers But 1973 was an election year and he needed a story to trash a century old global economic order I mean what he really needed was an enemy some fucking non English speaking Illuminati motherfucker lurking in the shadows and threatening American jobs because Americans eat that shit up So in August 1971 Nixon took to prime time television and announced to an Aaron Spelling loving TV dinner eating Vietnam weary America that International money speculators were destroying the value of he dollar and costing American jobs Which may seem like some obvious fucking ludicrous mode political bullshit but in the early 70s shit was legit hard economically for a lot of Americans And politicians understand that shit because at that level when you get to be president rule number one is that when shit is both mysterious and fucked up never try and explain it leave that shit to the losing party instead find a villain and tell your people how you re gonna fuck that motherfucker up That pretty much always works Because the universe is as much a fucking mystery today as it has been for over 300 000 years a complex system that our pleasure seeking story telling monkey brains are not wired to understand Unemployment Inflation Fuck we still can t explain that shit We are wired to survive in the wilderness and we know a threat when we see it which is some primal brain hard coded survival shit like a rustle in the bush beyond the light of the campfire it gets our hearts beating and bonds us as a tribe behind the dude with the biggest club Until he gets eaten by fucking bears But whatever in the moment we ll believe whatever he fuck he says And what Nixon said was that we can t trust money to both gold and god We had to chose So he de coupled the dollar from gold and henceforth and to this day money became faith gt gt The day after the Nixon announcement the Dow rose 33 points its biggest daily gain ever at that point A New York Times editorial read We unhesitatingly applaud the boldness with which the President has moved Which may have been bold and all but it was also a fucking disaster In the two years that followed gold rose nearly 300 from 43 to over 120 and the US suffered three quarters of negative GDP growth while unemployment exceeded 9 and inflation nearly doubled hovering in the range of 10 12 prompting global currencies to go all ape shit searching for some semblance of fair market value in the hunger games free for all that was the post gold global economy gt gt But fuck that was one fuck of a good time to be trading currencies Which brings us fuck finally to the trade gt gt A few years later Andy Krieger was a graduate student in South Asian philosophy and a competitive athlete at Penn committed to making the world a better place Aw But one morning after a long night translating some obscure Sanskrit text he got to thinking academia is a fucking slog the kind of job where you had to wait for some old bearded wizard to die to get ahead So the next day he met with his dissertation advisor and announced that he was gonna drop out of the graduate program and enroll at Wharton to translate the ancient mysteries of money And with the world just starting to make sense of all the newly floated currencies and all kinds of crazy new financial instruments like options Krieger was instantly hooked gt gt This was 1984 and few traders know what a currency option was let alone how to price one Black Sholes was a new new thing and computers were non existent But Krieger saw the potential of all this shit and knew he could use these instruments in a very powerful way so while still a student he joined a Chicago options trading firm and learned the ropes and after returning to Wharton he wrote a computer program to price options that relied on assumptions no one else was thinking about at the time This got him noticed by Solomon Brothers and then Bankers Trust And there after a run of hugely profitable trades no one really understood in 1987 the CEO of Bankers Trust gave him 700m to trade And fuck me with option leverage this meant next level shit tons of billions gt gt On October 19th 1987 on what became known as Black Monday the DJIA fell 22 6 the largest single day percentage drop in history But Krieger was cool He watched the world dump dollars and flood into alternative currencies many of which were small and tied to struggling economies But Krieger knew this was a panic flight to anywhere but the Wall Street carnage He also knew that as soon as the markets settled the fast money would head right back to the safety of the dollar and their currencies would revert So with 700m and 400 1 leverage Krieger placed his bets the largest of which was a short against the New Zealand dollar the Kiwi eventually taking a position greater than the entire New Zealand monetary supply And fuck at the same time Krieger had complex positions in the British Pound and the German Mark and even another short in the USD At any given time Krieger had over 40B in trades in float fluctuating over 20m in value at any given time gt gt And then with markets swinging wildly as the Kiwi drops just 5 against the dollar Krieger exits everything for a profit of 300m Fuck gt gt After exiting the trade with Wall Street a walking dead financial dystopia Krieger quit the game completely and retired to some island in the Caribbean In the aftermath regulators started to poke around at the one bank who booked a profit based entirely on Krieger s trading while Wall Street melted and an accounting scandal ensued involving Arthur Anderson the auditor of Bankers Trust which you could literally cut and past into the post Enron economy of 2001 Meanwhile the New Zealand government was crying foul publicly while privately counting their Kiwi blessings that Krieger had successfully tanked their money making NZ exports competitive on the global market At the time it was a total money shit show as quaint as that may seem today gt gt In the years that followed Soros did the same kind of shit and made 1B breaking the Bank of England and then a shit ton more shorting the Thai Baht And there were other cool ass macro money mega trades but by the late 90s all that shit came to an end as the central banks came to realize what the politicians had long known when some threat creeps in from the economic wilderness and shit gets crazy and mysterious our monkey brains turn to the dudes with the biggest club And central banks have the big clubs Until they get eaten by bears But so far that hasn t happened u cantedlight come back and bless us with more history lessons that an autist can actually understand

the impact of the Georgia Election on the Stock market Is Alibaba going to recover or is it going down GM outperforms in 2020 let s talk about this and other stock market news Hello everyone and Good Morning So let s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021 as the Nasdaq Composite https ibb co P4FW6dK gained almost 1 the broad stock market SP500 https ibb co Jd46zGb rose by 71 and the Dow Jones https ibb co Cs47MP1 finished 167 points higher We also saw the VIX https ibb co kH2gz8v dropping by more than 6 after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70 of the companies were advancing yesterday https ibb co 59qrWLY on average volume with 109 new highs We saw 8 of the 11 SECTORS https ibb co hFqx3Gg finish the day in the green lead by Energy up over 4 and Materials up over 2 while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities amp Real Estate just finished in the red Most small amp mid cap value amp core companies were outperforming yesterday https ibb co dWszjdG as large caps did finish mostly flat Here is the HEAT MAP https ibb co gDLn3Bc from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market with Big Tech companies advancing moderately while most of the Oil amp Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China The economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006 continuing the trend of this year as this number is the lowest https ibb co 26hzbrN we have seen since 1986 as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record breaking capital injections We also saw the December ISM Manufacturing INDEX https ibb co q73Fj2m coming at 60 6 higher than the 56 6 expected and the 57 5 in the previous month This was led by a growth in new orders productions prices index amp supplier deliveries while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month standing at 51 5 This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020 with December being the 7th straight month of expansion https ibb co 12gpyy2 and the biggest one of this year with this PMI corresponding to a 5 2 increase in GDP on an annualized basis as we also saw a 5 5 increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store SALES https ibb co qWjH5dJ TODAY https ibb co 2n4jcFm we continue to get auto sales numbers MBA mortgage applications ADP jobs numbers factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite as we also await the Georgia Runoff ELECTION https ibb co zXyZWmR final results as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call If the Dems to sweep this could cause an increased volatility in the markets especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion as I believe it s very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes which is very unlikely on big amp important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects they wouldn t do that when things are still very bad in the economy and the future still looks uncertain Things should get better before any big tax changes or any other big regulation changes So if the Dems win the other seat expect volatility that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers So I just wouldn t bet against the bull market that we are in right now In some other stock market news we saw a report that Alibaba is planning https ibb co s2vb2L8 to raise 5B through bonds again following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell rating https ibb co QbJwG53 while also cutting their PT from 280 to 210 I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction but after all of this will pass Alibaba is still a great company even without https ibb co m4x7CCs Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese APPS https ibb co X8xr9Cs with the latest big ones being Alipay amp WeChat Pay In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long term investing goes Yeah maybe in the short term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get but I really don t think Alibaba will go bust in the long run Yesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers with GM https ibb co 6HhqwZr stealing the show with Q4 sales up almost 5 year year as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020 while NISSAN s sales https ibb co gFhYd60 continued to drop as they sold 19 less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33 as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments Meanwhile VW https ibb co st5S7fh did slightly worse overall in 2020 but saw a 11 increase in sales in Q4 as this was led by a 22 increase in the total SUVs sold The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more amp more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive If you do want to invest in this industry I suggest you take a look at the product development amp future outlook for the company before I think both GM amp Ford are going in the right direction but you should do your own research So let s hope for a good day in the market as the world https ibb co 55PMcBq stock markets and the US FUTURES https ibb co bN3RK87 seem to be pointing to a mixed open with the Dow leading the way while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1 3 on panic selling amp portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia Thank you everyone for reading Hope you enjoyed the content Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market Have a great day and see
