sometimes substantially different from that of other hominoids due in part to the development of technology and a wide range of habitation Humans are by far the most numerous of the hominoid species in fact outnumbering all other primates by a factor of several thousand to one Most non human hominoids are rare or endangered https en wikipedia org wiki Endangered species The chief threat to most

Old English apa is a word of uncertain origin b https en wikipedia org wiki Ape cite note 6 The term has a history of rather imprecise usage and of comedic or punning usage in the vernacular Its earliest meaning was generally of any non human anthropoid primate c https en wikipedia org wiki Ape cite note 7 as is still the case for its cognates in other Germanic languages 5 https en wikipedia org wiki Ape cite note 8 Later after the term monkey https en wikipedia org wiki Monkey had been introduced into English ape was specialized to refer to a tailless therefore exceptionally human like primate 6 https en wikipedia org wiki Ape cite note 9 Thus the term ape obtained two different meanings as shown in the 1911 Encyclop dia Britannica https en wikipedia org wiki Encyclop C3 A6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition entry it could be used as a synonym for monkey and it could denote the tailless humanlike primate in particular 7 https en wikipedia org wiki Ape cite note EB1911 10 Some or recently all hominoids are also called apes but the term is used broadly and has several different senses within both popular and scientific settings Ape has been used as a synonym for monkey or for naming any primate with a human like appearance particularly those without a tail 7 https en wikipedia org wiki Ape cite note EB1911 10 Biologists have traditionally used the term ape to mean a member of the superfamily Hominoidea other than humans 1 https en wikipedia org wiki Ape cite note Dixson1981p13 1 but more recently to mean all members of Hominoidea So ape not to be confused with great ape now becomes another word for hominoid including humans 3 https en wikipedia org wiki Ape cite note Benton2005p371 4 d https en wikipedia org wiki Ape cite note DawkinsUse2 11 The taxonomic term hominoid is derived from and intended as encompassing the hominids https en wikipedia org wiki Hominid the family of great apes https en wikipedia org wiki Great ape Both terms were introduced by

Terminology Human taxonomy https en wikipedia org wiki Human taxonomy The distinction between apes and monkeys is complicated by the traditional paraphyly https en wikipedia org wiki Paraphyly of monkeys Apes emerged as a sister group of Old World Monkeys in the catarhines https en wikipedia org wiki Catarrhini which are a sister group of New World Monkeys Therefore cladistically https en wikipedia org wiki Cladistics apes catarrhines and related contemporary extinct groups such as Parapithecidaea https en wikipedia org wiki Parapithecidae are monkeys as well for any consistent

note 1 15 citation needed https en wikipedia org wiki Wikipedia Citation needed in which case the apes Cercopithecoidea and Aegyptopithecus emerged within the Old World Monkeys The primates called apes today became known to Europeans after the 18th century As zoological knowledge developed it became clear that taillessness occurred in a number of different and otherwise distantly related species https en wikipedia org wiki Species Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark https en wikipedia org wiki Wilfrid Le Gros Clark was one of those primatologists who developed the idea that there were trends in primate evolution and that the extant members of the order could be arranged in an ascending series leading from monkeys to apes to humans Within this tradition ape came to refer to all members of the superfamily Hominoidea except humans 1 https en wikipedia org wiki Ape cite note Dixson1981p13 1 As such this use of apes represented a paraphyletic https en wikipedia org wiki Paraphyly grouping meaning that even though all species of apes were descended from a common ancestor this grouping did not include all the descendant species because humans were excluded from being among the apes e https en wikipedia org wiki Ape cite note 16 Traditionally the English language vernacular name https en wikipedia org wiki Common name apes does not include humans but phylogenetically humans Homo https en wikipedia org wiki Homo form part of the family Hominidae within Hominoidaea Thus there are at least three common or traditional uses of the term ape non specialists may not distinguish between monkeys and apes that is they may use the two terms interchangeably or they may use ape for any tailless monkey or non human hominoid or they may use the term ape to just mean the non human hominoids Modern taxonomy aims for the use of monophyletic https en wikipedia org wiki Monophyly groups for taxonomic classification 12 https en wikipedia org wiki Ape cite note SpringerHolley2011 17 f https en wikipedia org wiki Ape cite note 18 Some literature may now use the common name ape to mean all members of the superfamily Hominoidea including humans For example in his 2005 book Benton wrote The apes Hominoidea today include the gibbons and orang utan the gorilla and chimpanzee and humans 3 https en wikipedia org wiki Ape cite note Benton2005p371 4 Modern biologists and primatologists refer to apes that are not human as non human apes Scientists broadly other than paleoanthropologists may use the term hominin https en wikipedia org wiki Hominin to identify the human

Tesla was trading in cents Oftentimes as investors we all have what if scenarios and regrets about not capitalizing on an opportunity at its infancy As it goes when a new industry is about to break out there will always be two sides those who believe and those who doubt History either remembers you as a winner or a loser What if I told you the energy industry is about to make history now That s right reminiscing of the early days of e commerce and EVs today LNG is what these industries were at their childhood stages So what s the deal with natural gas LNG According to forecasts the current demand for LNG in 2021 is around 300mpta and is looking to more than double to 700mpta by 2040 This is evident considering our world is in the process of a transition from coal and high emission energy production LNG demand keeps increasing every year establishing itself the ultimate cost efficient solution for a transition to cleaner energy gt And while in an ideal way we d prefer to skip LNG and go directly into clean renewables reality doesn t paint the same picture Simply put there isn t enough supply for the huge demand we require Not only that but for a lot of developing countries the question isn t even how do we clean our emissions It s for all intents and purposes how do we even produce enough energy This is where Tellurian Inc NASDAQ TELL plays its cards Founded in 2016 by the godfather of LNG Charif Souki and his longtime associate Martin Houston Tellurian aims to build a natural gas business of approximately 27 6mpta year through their Louisiana Driftwood LNG terminal gt This ambitious project would put it as the biggest LNG terminal of North America thus far Let s look at the company Leadership wise the company is led by the best men in the industry The veteran board of directors not only is accredited to have delivered 18 of LNG today but have a clear vision for a booming gas industry With their integrated business model and favorable gas prices According to JKM TTF and Henry Hubs spot prices the company has successfully signed two 3mtpa long terms deals with two global players Gunvor and Vitol in the last two weeks with no signs of stopping eithers on the road to complete the 11mtpa year requirement to complete Phase 1 one of the project gt The company boasts a strong balance sheet with no debt and has successfully secured all the necessary building permits By no means an easy thing with clean energy lobbies Therefore and as predicted the next step is starting construction at some point during this summer In the upcoming weeks we should see even more action as the company is looking to close even more perhaps bigger deals especially with Korea whom they ve been strengthening their relationship with for the past months gt But despite it and like any stock certain risk management has to be assessed For instance one of the earliest equity partners Total S A has shed more than 23 million shares over the past months The exact reason for this is unknown but most analysts are wary It s also noteworthy that according to an agreement by the two parties Total would have to buy 20 million shares at 12 if Tellurian secures FID Final Investment Decision by June a task they failed so far Coincidentally should Tellurian not reach FID by the required date Total is free to completely walk out of the arrangement without repercussions Should this be a big concern We know that the management has anticipated and as expected flexed the plan so that dependency on Total is no longer required at all in the long run It s also just as important to bring up the fact Total is going through a complete rebranding after their two failed LNG startups in Mozambique and Myanmar both halted due to armed conflicts in the area and estimated to cost them billions of damage So maybe this divorce won t be so bad after all You may also find the use of an ATM At The Market Offering over the course of the year an important variable to reflect on before investing According to the 2020 Q4 report and 2021 Q1 report the company has utilized ATM three times over the course of the year to raise upwards of 200mil And while you usually hate to see the shares diluted you have to respect the end goal behind it as the company looked to raise enough money to clear the balance sheet and stay debt free as well as resuming drilling and acquiring more upstream reserves According to Souki himself it was stated ATM would only be used if absolutely necessary and if it benefits the company as a whole The manner and timing in which it was executed was very calculated as well and minimized any potential side effects we could ve had from this dilution In the future the company has maintained its strong position of not needing any more ATMs to raise cash Stock price action So what s the stock price like Have I missed the hype Well let s just say there are three trains The short term train left exactly two weeks ago the mid term is waiting for passengers and the long term one hasn t arrived yet At the time of this article the stock is trading at around 5 consistently breaking peak after peak for the year after having traded as low as 1 7 a few months ago and having traded on average around 2 3 for most of the year Unless something supernatural happens we will not see below 4 anymore For an optimal mid term entry point anything below lt 4 is considered a steal with loading up at 5 or higher no slouch either We predict that in the short term stock will rise at the very least above 6 5 with a potential to break 10 once Phase 1 is fully concluded and construction is at full swing This writer s opinion Speaking long term we are looking at a ten bagger here if you were to buy now and everything goes according to plan With conserative estimates ranging at around 40 that is if we use the company s own predicted 7 FCF at full operations to estimate a realistic share price Any share picked up at lt 10 will be a steal when operations are in full swings and deliveries are being made So here s the big question do you believe in the leadership s ability to succeed Because if you do this is your chance to end up at the right side of history when the remark Man I should ve bought TELL when it was 5 pops up

connects them all ,This is more of a how I feel post more than the numbers conjectures and just the makeup of traditional DD we read I ve been keeping tabs on the Mr Burry inflation conversation and how Reddit apes are responding to it While his tsla puts and some scrutiny overshadow his motives behind his bond positions I think the inflation argument is quite evenly divided even outside of Reddit The whole inflation argument is appealing to me because it shows future inflation is not wholeheartedly priced in and that an area of potential profit exists from it What I want to dissuss in the post are some of my thoughts about the current economy market and how we all percive the information being presented to us Also thanks to kenny none of this would have been possible without you amp x200B If you understand how inflation works without a doubt in your mind skip this part and go to the squeeze section If you need some wrinkles be my guest to read it all amp x200B Inflation Where the wealth distributed amongst a population can lose purchasing power due to an increasing supply of base value holders If some of the population apes were to gain massive amounts of cash through squeezes then they will be able to purchase more assets bananas Very simple logic The way that hedgies banks tutees all keep power is through the constant consolidation of wealth and the power of equity While we all believe in equality for all we do not believe in equity for all by any means The definition of equity is the quality of being fair and impartial in which property rights AND cold hard cash is From scarcity finite be it artificial or not equity and other assets can be monetized convert ed into or express ed in the form of currency Again simple logic we can say one banana is worth 1 since 1 1 for anyone with a dollar Again simple logic So If the consolidation of wealth starts being more and more accessible to apes stonks go up then the AVERAGE cash holdings amongst all apes will also increase since dollars are being distributed Elasticity of demand is a measure of how sensitive a change in quantity demanded is to its price If I have diabetes and insulin goes up 100 does change that my demand for insulin No and that means insulin is demand inelastic price changes do not impact demand Elasticity doesn t just rely on prices and demand but also average income Let s say a single banana that s amongst a finite amount of bananas is worth 1 on the open market and everyone has 5 everyone can afford 5 bananas Now ape corona happens and the ape government gives out stimulus to all apes an extra 2 How many bananas can everyone afford if eberyone has 7 Five Why would the seller of bannanas think that bananas should be worth more then 1 Because he has a finite number of bannanas being priced against a infinite ammount of valueholders If they sold banananas at 1 per and then went and bought plums they d realize that they get less plum for same ammount of bananas Why because the plum salesman cant buy tvs at the same price and the tv guy cant buy tools at the same price and the tool guy cant buy cars at the same price and the car guy i think you get the point Everything is priced against dollars and therefor against eachother If the value of things did not change relative to the value of everything else then it wouldnt be impratial and then nothing would have equity Think about trading a banana for a plum leaving the money outside of this example Imagine its a good year for growing plums and it has tons of supply while bananas had a bad year and has little supply Now think about the ratio of bananas plums and how the exchange rate between them would be changed by the coming of good and bad seasons The change in supply does not impact the value value VALUE VALUE not price im talking pure value as much as the demand elasticity does If a banana is 1 and then 2 the next day why would i still buy it if i had the same ammount of dollars Because I still VALUE IT MORE then 2 Untill I value that banana less the what the seller want for it you know im gona buy it Value is not the same as price Example I say something has good value that which has a high quality quantity you get more for your buck or WORTH but is offered at a low or reasonable price Because something has worth X to people holding dollars it can be priced at Y Both the seller and buyer are satisfied Why Because the seller and buyer did not agree on its value Both parties got a deal that they thought was benneficial to them though in reality one of them lost equity from the transaction If both partys didnt think that it was a good deal the transaction would never occur EACH PARTY AGREED TO A TRANSACTION AT THE SAME PRICE YET THE NET VALUE CHANGE FOR EACH ONE DIFFERED amp x200B Squeeze So apes have been getting rich this is not news What IS news is all this inflation talk supply chain shortages cyber attacks and the reverse repo markets climb to 500k On reddit a good ammount of burry enthusiast have been analyzing his positions and how they relate to GME MOASS While I do think all hedgies are fukd and apes will hodl all of us into valahala I cannot use the assets I have to back a asset that big money considers overvalued It isnt overvalued and we are going to the moon ok What im more intrested in relating to Burry is his predicition for the bond market and how that ties into MOASS The general concesus is that Burry liqidatated GME before MOASS to avoid investigation by officals If he can figure out 2007 2008 then clearly the man can figure out a shourt squeeze but I digress Based on the direction velocity of of the RRP the stock market as a whole and recent developments with short squeezes reddit users discussing how it can possibly play out this always end back at this square Not choosing ANY sides for the sake of discussion I will state here however that im holding tlt puts They always state that the fed has two options when in reality its 3 A Raise rates to curb current inflation B Raise the Cap on the 80revese repo limits and C do nothing amp x200B a better way to sum this up is as Schiff says When it comes to inflation the Fed basically has two options It can admit it s a problem and take steps to address it or it can pretend there isn t a problem so it doesn t have to do anything about it While I primarily think that for inflation to be problem it depends almost entirely on if its transitory or not I do think that based on the CPI and also the price of gas food cars lumber homes silver electricity netflix and all consumer goods Ect that we are within inflationary forces Key points ive noticed Around 90 95 of proponents are acknowledging that inflation exsists The timing of when any inflation bets be it TLT or SPY are all speculative at best Most proponents on both sides tend to agree rates cannot go lower since real rates are negative but some users do think real rates will drift more and more into negative territory Many users are also noting that negative rates could make future rates even higher long run Most on both sides tend to agree that a raise in rates would cause a large sell off in the markets although not all see this sell off as a problem However some on both sides question if a market crash at this time would wreck greater havoc then later Monotizing debt appears to be the replacement to C that some users think will occur however this would increase the money supply even more A large group within this think that the fed cannot choose either option A or B due to either both options failing or exacerbating the issue at hand Most if not all agree that the fed needs a scapegoat to point at Most proponents are raising eyebrows at the steady rise of RRPs Most think future hyperinflation is a unrealistic fate for the world reserve currency https trends google com trends explore date today 205 y amp geo US amp q stagflation https trends google com trends explore

and a battle with Wall Street that they cannot win according to the founder of one of the largest trading firms in the world Zero commission trading helps to build an illusion that amateur investors have never had it better Alex Gerko co chief executive of London based XTX Markets told the Financial Times in an interview But the way retail brokerages sell on their customers orders and a very poor benchmark mean that the smallest investors together shell out billions of dollars in hidden costs every year when buying or selling US equities he explained The GameStop episode made it obvious that the retail part of the market is particularly broken Gerko said referring to the huge spike in the console store chain s shares in January The incentives are there to create a lot of churn in very illiquid stocks which is exactly what we are seeing this year On the face of it the GameStop frenzy was an unprecedented victory of young amateur traders over Wall Street professionals including some hedge funds that had been betting against the company But Gerko thinks the reality is the opposite If you think of zero commissions on paper it sounds great trading was expensive and now it s free That s obviously complete nonsense he said Part of the allure of retail platforms such as Robinhood is that they provide zero commission trading But Gerko said charges are hidden in the difference between the buy and sell price the so called spread meaning brokers and market makers want clients to trade shares where this gap is widest such as in illiquid stocks that are generally thinly traded If a market maker earns a certain spread from retail flow and then pays some percentage of that spread to the retail broker you end up with a perverse incentive to ensure that the end clients trade stocks with very wide spreads he said The 41 year old mathematician s criticism comes as shares in cinema chain AMC Entertainment and other meme stocks popular with retail investors in online forums such as Reddit are soaring once again AMC shares have jumped by more than 500 per cent in the past month to last week s highs before moderating gaining a further boost after the company promised retail investors additional perks including free popcorn Gerko said brokerages and other intermediaries are among the beneficiaries of these share price pops particularly as retail brokers often sell their clients trades in bulk on to market makers which then aim to secure favourable prices for clients This practice known as payment for order flow PFOF earned US brokers 2 9bn in 2020 without charging amateur investors commission up front and has attracted attention from regulators In the current ecosystem there is somehow enough to leave market makers with billions of dollars of revenue he said So where does this money come from The retail investors When people are claiming that they provided X billion dollars of price improvement last year the question is whether any of that price improvement is real And whether it s something they should be proud of The Russian born UK citizen started his career as a currencies trader at Deutsche Bank In 2015 he set up XTX Markets and built one of the largest computer driven trading firms in the world He has kept a low profile while amassing more wealth than some household names Last year he contributed more to the UK s tax coffers than the Duke of Westminster according to the Sunday Times making him the 13th largest individual taxpayer in the country His firm does not employ human traders but relies purely on computer models to buy and sell assets in a bid to generate profits It does not engage in payment for order flow The firm is the third largest dealer in global currency markets and handles 13 per cent of European equities traded on exchanges Since 2019 the company has also been in US stock markets A recent paper from consultancy BestX Research said price improvement on retail market orders averages about 25 per cent compared with the standard benchmark But the paper added that this in reality was akin to getting a 30 per cent discount on an item after the shopkeeper raises the price by 40 per cent because the benchmark covers only a small slice of the market Broker Robinhood and the two of the largest US market makers Citadel and Virtu have defended the PFOF model arguing there is no evidence that payment for order flow harms investors But newly sworn in chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission Gary Gensler has said he would make the PFOF model a focus of future work Gerko said one solution could be to strip PFOF out of the process and instead to feed retail traders orders on to exchanges where they would match off against each other or market makers would compete to execute the deals He also bats away criticism that his proposals are self serving noting that XTX advocates for market structure changes in all markets even where they play a dominant role already such as currency markets Even with those kinds of changes however he doubts that retail investors can emerge victorious from another round of battle with sophisticated trading firms Retail investors have managed to cause some pain to one hedge fund I can assure you in the long run it won t be retail participants winning this game that s just impossible Source Retail frenzy reflects broken US equity markets says XTX s Gerko

during the trading rotation inflation scare ABNB starts selling off with very little volume hence the volume gap 2 weeks before the lock up period expires liquidity tsunami at the bottom and increased selling from insiders post IPO liquidity is bought and price goes up then consolidates Conclusion there was very little interest in buying from 180 to 130 just before lock up period expired So it just took a few smart traders to dump positions 2 weeks before to make a killing But there is significant buying interest now as the past days clearly show and there won t be volume resistance going up

and the explosion in price movement volume and sentiment around everyone s favorite meme stocks lately I thought I d do a simple really really simple comparative analysis based on 6 month charts of some of go to tickers My purpose in doing so To see if we can establish a trend and differentiate these stocks in any meaningful way Why do I think this is important The squeeze narrative has been used a lot since Jan following the parabolic movements of several stocks Since then I feel that all squeeze and meme stocks have been psychologically grouped as the same but their trends show they are not The simple hypothesis We should be able to easily differentiate the Jan stocks as compared to any of the others that gained attention post January There was a defined and unique occurrence that took place back in Jan surrounding GME AMC BB KOSS NOK BBBY and Express Since then we have seen a wave of short squeeze narratives for other tickers but the difference around the January stocks was how they appeared to all move in tandem and have a relatively strong correlation setting them apart and potential pointing to some broader scheme involved utilizing naked shorting and resulting in massive FTDs It goes to say this is an anomaly and I believe these stocks should be looked at differently when compared with other squeeze and meme stocks being pushed Side Note For these charts all tickers will be set to full screen scaling on Trading View in order to see how closely their trends in price action move together so it s not comparative of current price per share but of their general movements when those movements took place and individual gains Some of the squeeze stocks that followed January s events CLOV RKT and MVIS compared with GME over a 6 month basis GME because it was the most notable Jan stock historically until recently amp x200B It may not be as apparent from this first picture but there is divergence in these stocks trends I would argue the second half of the chart appears more correlated because everything became sentimentally grouped together as meme stocks after the MSM started pumping WSB narratives for everything https preview redd it

trends I would argue the second half of the chart appears more correlated because everything became sentimentally grouped together as meme stocks after the MSM started pumping WSB narratives for everything What can I infer from this just from looking at it CLOV has done its own thing until closer to late March when it first started getting attention again after the massive influx of WSB participants post Jan Even so if you look close enough it has peaks and valleys that move against the trend of GME MVIS also definitely follows its own tune RKT is actually the one of these 3 that looks like it could follow GME but it didn t squeeze in Jan with the others It had a massive run up in the beginning of March that sticks out against the others It appears to me that it was really around March that this psychological collective was starting to be established as we see a little less divergence in trends though they are still identifiable as different Now compare GME and AMC Although AMC didn t run up in March if you study these lines you can see there consistent moves up and down at the same time as GME until recently May amp x200B AMC bucked the trend the past few weeks

trying to highlight but I think if anyone were to take the time to play around with some charts and overlay the tickers you can see just from basic visual analysis that there is extreme similarity in all of the Jan stocks over 6 months suggesting they are in their own bucket entirely independent of other meme stocks If we take the time to compare Jan stocks 1 on 1 with others it highlights this difference I ll use Express here because no one talks about it but it has Jan stock correlation This tells me that it isn t sentiment driven and is seemingly moving with other Jan stocks for another reason that isn t retail pumping it amp x200B Express and CLOV https preview redd it ns66q7mzl1471 png width 3337 amp format png amp auto webp amp s a43dc1801e4f19503b88e13e7850d6cf09a01eea Express

5b5f08737f56ea50e6ae132e8ea8e11b9e73b8ae Why did I bother to go through all of this I think it s important to provide some distinction between the events of Jan and those respective stocks as compared to the more recent favorites I m not saying what will or will not squeeze but I do think it s important to separate the narratives around meme stocks when evaluating risk and trying to understand what influences a particular stock If this wasn t so long already and if I had the character limit I d give my interpretation of the time line when and why certain narratives formed and how it s important but I think the charts says enough

I will provide you the reader with all the information you need to know about the upcoming merger as well as Lucid s plans to be a top EV competitor in the future If you would like to keep updated on some more hype stocks in a report style similar to this one follow my account here https utradea com member portfolio WallStreetWhale Company Overview Churchill Capital IV Churchill Capital IV CCIV is a blank check company that was formed for the purpose of completing a merger or other business combination with Lucid Motors Ticker LCID post merger Churchill Capital was founded by Michael Klein who is expected to stay a part of the company Lucid Motors post merger to create long term value for the business CCIV completed their blank check IPO on August 3rd 2020 in which they sold 207M shares at 10 share generating proceed of 2 07B which will be used later to fund the merger Furthermore Churchill Capital raised another 42 85M by selling 42 85M warrants for 1 warrant this money will also be used to fund the merger The acquisition is said to have a pro forma acquisition value of 11 75B and is said to be completed in their investor presentation by early Q3 2021 On February 22nd 2021 Churchill Capital entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger https sec report Document 0001104659 21 026358 with Lucid Motors This business combination will be consummated after a vote for the approval of the shareholders Lucid Motors Lucid Motors was founded in 2007 in Newark California at this time their company was named Ateiva rather than Lucid Motors Ateiva was originally a company that developed and sold their electric batteries and powertrains to other electric vehicle manufacturers By 2013 Ateiva was a recognized and respected producer of battery packs and electric powertrains and started to entertain the idea of developing their own electric vehicle s It was at this time that the now CEO CTO Peter Rawlinson joined the company In 2014 Lucid secured their first round of funding to develop their own vehicle At this point Lucid was not putting too much thought into the design but managed to make their own 900 Horsepower HP vehicle that went 0 60 MPH in 3 seconds and with good range In October of 2016 Ateiva officially decided to rebrand and change their name to Lucid Motors and started to take their vision of becoming an all electric luxury vehicle maker very seriously They started out of the gate very quickly as they announced their plans to break ground in Casa Grande Arizona and started to construct their 700M 590 acre factory AMP 1 in November 2016 just one month later Fast forward 4 years to November 2020 and we see Phase 1 of this factory being completed https www prnewswire com ae news releases lucid motors completes construction on first greenfield electric vehicle factory in north america commissioning process underway for spring 2021 production start of lucid air 301182337 html which is enabling them to produce 34 000 of their Lucid Air vehicles 1st production vehicle annually Furthermore Lucid is preparing to start the 2nd phase of their factory build which will allow them to manufacture their upcoming Gravity SUV and increase production from 34 000 vehicles per year to 90 000 vehicles per year This phase is expected to start as soon as late 2021 and be completed by the summer of 2023 Investment Information Termination information This merger deal can be terminated under any of the following conditions 1 There is a mutual agreement between Churchill Capital IV and Lucid Motors that they want to both terminate the deal 2 The merger is not consummated by October 22nd 2021 3 Any government entity ordering taking action to prohibit the merger 4 If there is a breach of contract by either of the companies Churchill and Lucid then the other company can choose to terminate the deal 5 If Churchill s shareholders vote against the consummation of the merger If the acquisition falls through for any of the conditions as listed above then Churchill Capital will gather all of their capital into a trust account and redistribute it to their existing shareholders if this were to happen shareholders will likely receive 10 share owned However if Churchill gets sued and the lawsuit is successful then Churchill Capital is required to pay out these claims before their shareholders which will result in a shareholder payout of less than 10 per existing share PIPE Private Investment into Public Equity Information Churchill Capital agreed to sell 2 5B worth of Class A common stocks to their PIPE investors These shares were sold to the PIPE investors at a price of 15 share which means that PIPE investors bought 166 667M shares This is important because the 15 level that PIPE investor bought in at can be seen as a potential bottom for the stock implying a downside pre merger of 41 18 Under Churchill s subscription agreement https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1811210 000110465921026358 tm217491d2 8k htm outlining the terms for the PIPE investors it notes that the PIPE investors are not allowed to liquidate their shares until 90 after the completion of the merger if the SEC decided to not review the registration statement or 150 days if the SEC reviews the registration statement This is very important because the PIPE investors will sell at least some of their shares the second they are legally able to because they need to reduce their risk and diversify into other investments Knowing this we can expect Lucid s share price to fall on this date due to large amounts of selling Experienced Management Team 12 of Lucid s 20 management team member have worked at a variety of car companies both electric and non electric including Tesla Rivian Ford General Motors Hyundai Audi Volkswagen Mazda Jaguar Land Rover Lotus and Ferrari Peter Rawlinson the CEO and CTO previously worked as the Chief Vehicle Engineer of the Tesla Model S which helps to speak on his knowledge and experience primarily in the electric vehicle space Furthermore the non vehicle centered management members have worked on the management teams of Apple Siemens Intel PayPal Magna eBay Cisco and Pillsbury previously to working at Lucid Lucid s Battery Technology As we know Lucid formerly Ateiva used to solely manufacture battery packs and electric powertrains for electric car manufacturers Furthermore Ateriva which is now Lucid s technology wing has been producing battery packs for Formula E racing cars for 6 seasons which displays the history and high level of performance that Lucid s batteries can achieve Additionally Lucid s battery has been ranked as the most efficient battery in terms of miles kWh ranking at 4 5 miles kWh compared to Tesla s Model S which ranked 2nd with 4 0 miles kWh This higher efficiency enables Lucid s customers to enjoy longer range faster charging times and lower cost battery packs The Lucid Air Grand Touring model has a 500 mile range a top speed of 168 mph and a 0 60 speed of 3 0 seconds making it very competitive with Tesla s Model S long range edition Lucid s Air Grand Touring has a price tag of 139 000 compared to Tesla s Model S Long Range Edition s price of 73 000 This is because Tesla has been able to achieve economies of scale to reduce their manufacturing price whereas Lucid has just started to manufacture their vehicles However in 2020 Lucid plans to release their Air Pure model at a competitive price of 77 400 which will be more comparable to the prices offered by Tesla Lucid s Charging Infrastructure Electrify America Lucid has announced their partnership with Electrify America which is the second mover in the charging space behind Tesla Electrify America also allows 900Vcharging which is optimal for Lucid vehicles as it allows them to charge at their fastest speeds Electrify America currently has 600 charging stations with over 2 600 individual chargers across America Electrify America is also growing very quickly and a map of their reach can be found here https insideevs com news 504444 electrify america opens 600th charging station Other Partnerships Lucid has also stated that their cars will be able to receive charging from other aggregators and station owners such as ChargePoint and EVgo Forward Technology Lucid ID Profiles Facial Recognition automatically recognizes driver profiles and adjusts to their preferences Predictive Analytics Improves the car driver relationship by using AI to learn driver behaviours and automatically adjusts to fit these behaviours Sensor Suite Lucid has integrated 32 onboard sensors which is the most among production vehicles Autonomous Driving Lucid is planned to launch their Level 2 Autonomous Driving functionality and is able to undergo software updates through the cloud This is not yet close to Tesla s autopilot however it is only the start of Lucid Autonomy and is already better than many of their other competitors Mass Production ready Although Lucid has not yet started to mass produce their cars they have designed their cars to be readily available for mass production when the time comes in order to have a smooth transition and leverage their economies of scale An example of this is their brick injection mould which is designed to be manufactured in the millions and be integrated into any of their cars in a single operation Proprietary Technology Wunderbox Boost Charge Technology Wunderbox is the first bi directional system on the market that is capable of withstanding 900V which enables their 300kW fast charging Their charging speed is approximately 6 67 minutes 100 miles of charge compared to Tesla s speed of 7 5 minutes 100 miles Lucid has applied or been issued 407 patents Approximately 338 of these patents have been issued to Lucid and the other 69 are still in the application process This is good news for Lucid as they grant Lucid with a competitive edge depending on the nature of their patents Micro Lens Array MLA Lighting Lucid s MLA lighting allows their headlights to adapt to driving and weather situations to provide optimal visibility to ensure driver safety An example would be if it were foggy the car would gradually adapt to the level of fogginess to ensure the best visibility at any given time Market Outlook Luxury Vehicle Market The global luxury car market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5 over the next 5 years growing into a 733 2B industry by 2026 This presents an opportunity for Lucid to potentially capitalize on especially with increased government mandates and incentives and the consumers increased demand for EV s Total Addressable Market Currently Lucid expects to capitalize on 2 of their TAM through their Lucid Air Sales in 2021 2022 This is a very reasonable estimate and would represent 34 000 vehicles sold In 2023 Lucid is looking to capitalize on 2 3 of their TAM which would be 80 90k vehicles sold Lastly in 2030 Lucid is expecting to capitalize on 4 of their TAM which would translate into 600 000 vehicles sold in 2030 Total Annual Deliveries Lucid is forecasting a total vehicle delivered CAGR of 88 22 between 2022 2026 which will result in 251 000 cars delivered by 2026 Total Revenue Lucid id forecasting a revenue CAGR of 78 95 between 2022 2026 which would translate into 22 76B in revenue for the year of 2026 Market Strategy Pre Orders Lucid opened their Air models to pre orders where customers can reserve the car for a fee of 300 1000 Lucid opened this up in Q1 of 2021 and judging by the existing reservations Lucid is expecting 800M in anticipated sales However these reservations can be cancelled so it would be illogical to assume all of these pre orders will translate into sales Showrooms Lucid has a direct sales strategy so that their customers can experience the car before making their decision to ensure interactions are on brand and pressure free Lucid currently has 6 showrooms in large cities across North America that are open for the public and Lucid is planning to expand these showrooms into Europe in late 2021 Lucid Digital Journey Customers can engage with Lucid via their app website configurator and much more There has not been a lot of information released about this yet but this is what they have released Future Application Possibilities Passenger Vehicles Busses Helicopters and other Aircrafts Heavy Equipment and Agricultural Equipment Energy Storage Systems Investment Valuation Valuation Since CCIV is just a shell company and Lucid the company becoming public has not had to make their financial reports available to the public it is very hard to determine any sort of price estimate or use any valuation techniques that I have learned Also since they are pre revenue it is even harder to estimate the fair value off this stock Th only way in which I can make any sort of valuation is to use the free cash flow forecast information that they provided in their investor presentation In this DCF model I arrived at a fair value per share of 29 86 which implies a share price increase of 17 02 However this DCF model is likely not all that accurate due to the lack of available information about Lucid s financial position Catalysts Merger Date Announcement Churchill Capital investors have been anxiously waiting on the news of the merger date to be dropped Once this happens it could serve as a catalyst for the stock heading up to their merger date Autonomous Driving If Lucid announces that their level 3 or level 4 autonomous driving has more autonomous features and mimics that of Tesla s autopilot there will be excitement amongst investors and people might buy more shares This is especially true if you look at the EV space as a technology race like many others do Future Improvements to their Battery Technology Lucid has already highlighted that their battery is the most efficient and compact however if they continue to improve upon their battery technology then more people might find their cars useful and be willing to purchase them If this happens their revenues might outperform and their stock price may jump Partnerships As we know Lucid has already partnered with many companies like Electrify America EVgo ChargePoint LG etc If the news breaks that Lucid is partnering with more companies that can help them increase their product and reach then their stock price is likely to be affected Updates on Factory Production If Lucid is able to finish the construction of their Phases on time or even sooner than anticipated they will be able to produce more vehicles quicker than before thought This should signal to investors that they are ahead of schedule and that earnings are likely to be good causing investors to buy in Risks No Operating History and Revenues The lack of public information on Lucid as a company may scare off some potential investors Additionally Lucid is a pre revenue company which bears a lot of uncertainty for the future Furthermore if future financial information comes out and it is not near where Lucid projected it to be then some investors will sell due to their valuations being off Merger is Never Consummated If the merger is terminated or if they merger does not happen by October 22nd 2021 then the potential losses will be at least 60 82 based on the current price of 25 52 and losses might even be more than that The exercising of Warrants As previously mentioned there are 42 85M warrants these warrants can be converted into common stock upon expiry which has the potential to dilute existing shares by up to 20 This is not favourable for current shareholders PIPE Investor Liquidation Once the PIPE investors are able to liquidate their shares Lucid s stock is likely to have a massive sell off which will hurt the share price in the short term However if you are bullish on this stock this may be less of a risk and more of a buying opportunity Chip Shortage The ongoing chip shortage is likely to have adverse impacts on the Lucid s production estimates and if Lucid is not able to meet their targets investors may worry and potentially panic sell Also this will affect the DCF model that I built out and Lucid may not be undervalued due to their heightened estimates

Tide has just recently started trading on the NASDAQ today and I want to share my DD Quick Summary Biggest MJ e commerce expanding rapidly US expansion low valuation About the company High Tide is a Cannabis Retailer in the Canadian MJ space They have the 1 and 2 MJ accessory e commerce sites https grasscity com https grasscity com and https www smokecartel com https www smokecartel com In addition to these industry leading MJ accessory e commerce sites they also own industry leading e commerce sites for CBD as well including US based https cbdcity com https cbdcity com and https fabcbd com https fabcbd com In Canada currently they have 87 retail locations in Canada that sell MJ and MJ accessories and plan to have 115 by the end of the year Their retail store brands include Canna Cabana Meta NewLeaf and KushBar Wholesaling Yes High Tide also wholesales their advanced MJ accessories to US locations as well These brands include Valiant Distributions https www valiantdist com https www valiantdist com and Famous Brandz https famousbrandz com https famousbrandz com which has partnerships with Snoop Dogg Trailer Park Boys and many other celebrities Now that you know a little about the company let s get into some numbers Revenue growth profitability and valuation With 38 32M in revenue last quarter High Tide grew 179 in revenue YoY and 42 82 QoQ They have been boasting consistent high growth for the past two years and imo will be a big winner in the MJ space They currently trade at a 2 5 forward P S 200M estimated revenue for 2021 which is extremely low for a company that is growing so quickly Now you might think that while in this growth phase they would not be profitable not true The company has been EBITDA and cash flow positive for the past 4 quarters and trades at a price ebitda ratio of 38 9 which again is extremely low for a company growing so quickly and in the MJ space Why is the valuation so low you might ask Shorts Shorts High Tide is massively shorted High Tide short interest is 50 given the day I personally cannot wait for the High Tide short squeeze Who is our valiant and great leader Management team Raj Grover is our CEO and leader and the man is an absolute beast Raj currently owns 20 of High Tide shares and has never sold a single share Raj started High Tide in 2009 with 40k and has since then grown it into a profitable company with hundreds of millions in revenue Industry comparisons Sundial Valuation Comparison Let s compare this with some other Canadian MJ companies that are also on the NASDAQ Sundial currently has a market cap of 1 97B about 5x the market cap of High Tide You would think they have better growth more revenue higher profitability right Incorrect the company only has 51 47M in revenue over the last 4 quarters and 72 41M in EBITDA Yes you read that correctly negative 72 41 million in EBITDA Now lets check High Tides number over the last 4 quarters They achieved 107 92M in revenue over the last 4 quarters with a positive EBITDA of 12 86M More than double the revenue of Sundial and infinitely higher than their EBITDA Now let s look at the growth of these two companies High Tide over the last 4 quarters grew QoQ 43 29 18 56 15 63 and 42 82 with 19 57M 23 2M 26 83M 38 32M in revenues perspectively Sundial grew revenues 14 90 33 76 10 11 26 52 with 17 59M 11 64M 12 82M and 9 42M in revenues perspectively Can you see the difference High Tide has consistent massive growth QoQ while Sundial has only grown revenues 1 out of the past 4 quarters Conclusion High Tide is a clear winner in the MJ space with their e commerce selling worldwide to US Canada and Europe We are literally the Amazon of the MJ space Our amazing leader Raj who has built this profitable high growth empire Also we are extremely undervalued by traditional methods or by industry comparisons All I have to say is The Tide is High PS All numbers are in Canadian Dollars as Sundial and High Tide are both Canadian companies References High Tide Investor Presentation https hightideinc com wp content uploads 2021 06 High Tide Investor Presentation June 1 2021 pdf https hightideinc com wp content uploads 2021 06

s me the UWMC guy here I m still very very invested in UIWMC I still think it has great potential and I don t expect it to stay sub 10 for much longer But a man can get annoyed when he see s so many opportunities in stocks and so I ve diversified using future earnings and deleveraged my margin on UWMC to leverage elsewhere meaning I still have over 50K on UWMC I was initially writing a PDF sector report for you guys on gaming peripherals and hardware and I m still doing that Hint Turtle Beach was a great great investment but there are other awesome ones though I ve been a bit busy so it s taking me longer than I wanted With that said I viewed this absolute stunner of a layup and so I ll just drop this golden goose for you First let s start with what the company itself is Cannae Holdings is engaged in actively managing and operating a group of companies and investments as well as making additional majority and minority equity portfolio investments in businesses in order to achieve superior financial performance and maximize the value of these assets Then let me go ahead and tell you who is Cannae s CEO Bill Foley To get an idea of this guy read this to get an idea of his investment style Bill Foley A Vineyard Bargain Hunter Builds an Empire On Wine by Lettie Teague WSJ https www wsj com articles SB10000872396390443635404578038884022420900 And this to get a sense of what types of companies he despacs Billionaire Bill Foley Is SPAC Market s Overlooked Star WSJ https www wsj com articles billionaire bill foley is spac markets overlooked star 11617537600 In short what this man does is DE SPAC companies that are either EBITDA positive and on track to be NI positive this year or next year or companies that are already profitable Because CANNAE has founder shares and PIPE shares they receive better prices so even the DESPAC itself is very profitable Here is a list of companies that the company has invested in for their IPO or SPAC Please note some of these companies are still in the de spaccing phase like Alight and the sum of their parts calculation as of May 2021 is this Sum of the Parts cannaeholdings com https investor cannaeholdings com static files 0a6d9ff9 63fc 46d1 a810 c2c7ac880fd9 That represents a more than roughly 34 upside The SP is lower than on May 10 but that s offset by the fact that some of these investments like Paysafe went down roughly the same amount But still the market cap for this company is roughly 5 5B on its external investments alone as well as its cash on hand This doesn t take into consideration that on the day of earnings they announced that they would be despaccing Wynn gambling which is why Bill Foley coudn t attend and the CEO handled it Wynn to take online gambling arm public with help of a SPAC msn com https www msn com en us money companies wynn to take online gambling arm public with help of a spac ar BB1gAeX5 The De SPAC is going to be a little different this time however Straight from the CEO s mouth at the earnings call So that forward purchase agreement will not be effectuated And the only involvement that Cannae has is it has agreed to backstop the full 690 million against redemptions And we actually hope there are redemptions because we d love to buy this at whatever 10 a share So that s our role That s Cannae s role So we re getting our 50 basis point fee for the standby plus the opportunity to buy some shares Their also in talks or hinted at it for another acquisition as noted in the corporate Ian Zaffino Got you And then on the other Trebia side and this will be my next question before I let someone else jump on On the Trebia side I guess from the wording of your letter you re kind of playing things a little bit close to the vest But should we assume that the deal that was targeted something did it worked out and now you re on the prowl for something new or is it the existing target is still kind of in play Richard N Massey I don t know if it s appropriate for me to comment on it except to say we re not looking for something new right now How about that for a skating around on the answer Remember these DE SPACS are profitable straight from the get go as they have founder pipe shares they get at roughly 8 5 a pop as opposed to the sticker 10 Regardless all these companies are companies that will boom as price discovery happens and i see a TON of upside on them To get a better idea of what this company is invested and what they do and how Bill Foley is making money read this which is the shareholder letter which was written in the most recent quarter 6f8e2bd1 d497 4512 b6f5 cb7d532d70f5 cannaeholdings com https investor cannaeholdings com static files 6f8e2bd1 d497 4512 b6f5 cb7d532d70f5 However I m going to move on to the businesses that CANNAE owns fully which are two restaurant chains in fact O Charley s and 99 Restaurants Obviously the pandemic hurt them but they were EBITDA positive as of the quarter ended March with 7 6M in profit before EBITDA Their set to become NI profitable as soon as this upcoming quarter and then shop these two franchises around probably I don t count the other operating expenses line because that doesn t have anything to do with their restaurant chain operations and has to do with their operations of their investment firm portion side All in all tallying everything their operating expenses were 36M On the balance sheet they have a total Equity Assets Liabilities of 3 55B which represents an upside of 3B The price to book value of this company is 9 you can find this here Cannae Holdings Price to Book Value CNNE ycharts com https ycharts com companies CNNE price to book value text Price 20to 20book 20value 20is 20a 20valuation 20ratio market 20value 20that 20is 20shown 20Read 20full 20definition Finally the management team seemed VERY frustrated about the SP In March they announced a buyback over 3 years of 10 of the float but if this continues i expect a much more aggressive buyback But they seemed to be currently more focused on investing the cash and producing superior returns for shareholders which i commend With that said eventually they ll snap and make a larger buyback if things don t change Again it s trading under book It s a no brainer

summarize 1 W rkh rse develops electric trucks and delivery drones 2 We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles EV The people want it the government wants it and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen 3 The government wants zero emissions W rkh rse trucks are already zero emission Gas and diesel powered trucks are not These petroleum based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up 4 They have a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies 5 They have developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks see pictures The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there s no going back Zero emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and they are set up to do this Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure Think about it Walmart Fed Ex Amazon UPS Postal Services Supermarkets for food delivery etc 6 350 000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times This number is projected to increase 7 Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management who has been very popular lately google her had purchased a few million shares for her fund She has since sold This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted more on that below Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52 week highs a few weeks ago Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting It s a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them I m not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn t find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless 8 In April they more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks That s 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars That s an enormous number of trucks and that s only from one wholesaler 9 Their main problems are with manufacturing and delivery The reasons why 1 They re limited in part due to supply chain constraints There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components This has impacted the entire industry including Ford and GM This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales In addition they now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions Inc to supply their batteries This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world 1 Electric trucks are a relatively new industry Demand has skyrocketed so their capacity to meet this demand has been limited Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve they teamed up with someone who can They re now partnered with J B Poindexter amp Co a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering construction and assembly 10 There are several EV players Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail W rkh rse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles 11 Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately 521 000 compared to approximately 84 000 in the first quarter of 2020 That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly 12 Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE which they were invested in 13 The Company had approximately 205 1 million in cash in March 2021 This helps limit the need to acquire debt 14 The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a 6 billion contract with the USPS last February It s now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company This one time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean they will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies Furthermore they may still win this 6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front In addition the USPS Postmaster Louis DeJoy who influences the direction of the contract is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it s assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr DeJoy s decision of granting it to their competitor If this contract once again becomes up for grabs there s a good chance they will win it If that happens watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock Forget the moon I m talking about GN z11 the furthest galaxy from us 15 Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you re seeing This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in 16 There are 8 analysts who have recently ranked them Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy NONE recommend a sell It s unanimous NONE recommend selling Some of the analysts recommend price targets are even 24 20 20 and 17 Cowen amp Co Colliers Securities Oppenheimer Roth Capital R F Lafferty BTIG B Riley Financial and Wolfe Research 17 You re helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future 18 The stock price was about 30 of its 52 week high when this was first written Mods preventing this post so it s higher now 19 This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL It s shorted about 40 of its float It is one of the most if not THE MOST shorted stock out there It s very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can t expect it to happen overnight It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you especially now The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens They re accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day They ve learned to process this emotion and not act upon it However they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear They re counting on you selling out of fear the bottom and buying out of greed the top If you wait them out they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares Also the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises amp x200B So how to deal with fear 1 Accept and expect fear to happen because it will Anticipate it and do not act upon it 2 Do not invest money that you can t afford to lose This way you can let it ride 3 Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC AMC was shorted about 20 on its float it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did W rkh rse is shorted about double the amount of AMC Also understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are They don t make their money from making good stock picks They make their money from taking a cut of the money they re investing for other people They make up fancy words algorithms and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can t even beat the Dow Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things Look it up if you don t believe it TLDR 1 W rkh rse is prime for a short squeeze It is one of the most if not the most shorted stock out there 2 Their fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced Out of 8 research analysts who follow it all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell Price targets for several were at or above 20 3 Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed 4 Demand for their products has skyrocketed 5 Don t be lazy don t TLDR this one ready the whole thing I am not a financial analyst I am a physician with a love of finance I do not give financial advice This is for educational purposes only and I may very well be completely wrong You can lose all of your money on this stock or any stock for that matter You must do your own homework and research before buying any stock I personally love this stock and I own

But what comes after a short squeeze It could be huge value creation for CLOV Disclaimer This is not investment advice I work in the Medicare industry and thought I would share some ideas I have no affiliation with any company mentioned in this post 3 minute read amp x200B On January 16th 2009 Obama was getting prepared to be sworn in His first order of business was to stabilize the American economy that the finance industry almost destroyed People all over the world had lost much of their life savings because of Wall Street s greed After stimulus passed the administration started to work on their first major legislative policy It was healthcare amp x200B On that same day in 2009 UnitedHealth UNH was trading at 25 50 with a market cap of 23B amp x200B https preview redd it zkh5gwhks3471 png width 1342 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 2aa3a04e6955c634e17b8743935e14faa9ff7ce2 The Obama administration ended up passing the Affordable Care Act ACA on March 23rd 2010 The ACA has dramatically changed the US healthcare system Now that it s survived both Democratic and Republican administrations it will continue to spark more change long term The ACA gives Medicare the power to change payment models in a way that moves the entire industry away from fee for service FFS to value based care It does this by giving the private sector huge financial incentives to improve outcomes Since the ACA passed UnitedHealth UNH has grown over 16x to a market cap of over 380B The Medicare market is what has primarily driven UNH s growth They are the largest Medicare Advantage MA insurer in the US with 26 market share Much of that growth has been through the acquisition of MA plans in local markets all over the country CLOV ISN T JUST A SHORT TERM PLAY 16x growth is the opportunity Clover Health CLOV has AFTER a short squeeze It s one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market With the support of retail investors they can use their elevated stock price as an asset to go on a series of acquisitions that create real business value This growth will support an even higher stock price It s a virtuous cycle Whenever shorts come in it will just lead to another step change in stock price and even faster expansion for CLOV Healthcare providers and insurers have stable revenue streams making it straightforward to finance their acquisition https www investopedia com terms a acquisition financing UNH has already proven this playbook https www dukece com optumcare biggest health care system never heard over the past 10 years It s right in front of us We can replicate it and with a strong retail backing CLOV can execute this same playbook in an even shorter time period The retail revolution has arrived at the exact same time that there is massive disruption i e opportunity in the healthcare industry amp x200B RETAIL INVESTORS NOW HAVE THE POWER TO CREATE LONG TERM WINNERS NOT JUST BEAT SHORT SELLERS CLOV is perfectly positioned to replicate the UNH playbook and beat them at their own game CLOV has run Medicare Advantage MA plans for over seven years They ve been able to take more and more market share away from UNH and other large competitors each year That s made them one of the fastest growing https www cloverhealth com en about us press clover health triples geographic footprint MA plans The most amazing part is that it s been entirely organic growth amp x200B With more retail investors they can rapidly launch and or acquire new MA plans in geographies that they re not currently in They also have the Clover Assistant a software platform that providers use to improve health outcomes With their Direct Contracting Entity DCE https www managedhealthcareexecutive com view cms direct contracting model is it still one of the value based models built on fee for service chasis CLOV can acquire provider organizations around the country and take on full risk with them They could rapidly become one of the largest payvidors in the US The future of US healthcare will be dominated by payvidors It s a combination of a payor i e insurance company and provider i e doctor It s powerful https www dukece com optumcare biggest health care system never heard because you can take on and manage risk as a payor and directly control cost and quality on the provider side Kaiser Permanente has proven out this model in the US for decades now UNH has become the ultimate example of a payvidor growing from an insurer 10 years ago to the largest employer of physicians https www medicaleconomics com view now what imminent dangers and emerging opportunities physicians in the US amp x200B THIS IS THE NEXT STAGE OF EVOLUTION IN THE RETAIL REVOLUTION GME and AMC have been amazing trips so far On days that they squeeze they really are like trips to the moon The problem with these companies though is that they eventually come back to Earth I can t see a future where more people going to be buying and selling video games at stores or going to movie theaters CLOV is like going to the moon short squeeze building a permanent base with a launch site business growth and then going to Mars business growth future squeezes I will continue to support i e hodl GME and AMC because of what they have meant to us They ve given us a voice that Wall Street can t ignore Nothing changed after 2009 Now we re making them change As the retail investor movement grows I hope we can also support companies that are positioned for future growth If we could do that we might just take control of this entire game amp x200B Note This thesis isn t specific to CLOV or healthcare I truly believe retail investors can create massive value for all companies and industries positioned for growth I just know healthcare and see a proven model https www dukece com optumcare biggest health care system never heard that can be replicated by a great company that also happens to be highly shorted Copied from r CLOV

out u biutifo The Massive Implications of the Covi Stix approval in Mexico 1 Mexico has the 6th most active cases worldwide Currently there are more cases in Mexico than in UK Germany and Turkey combined 2 Mexico is the 10th most populated country in the world 3 There are more than 37 million Mexicans born or ancestry in the US I belive at least part of that population will seek and have access to Covi Stix 4 The price spike that will happen when the EUA is approved will start at a higher price point as a result of this news 5 The current agreements between Mexico and multiple Central American countries pretty much automatically turn them into a covi stix market 6 Sorrento has received a huge push of validity in the Latin American market 7 Sorrento has just potentially doubled its revenue on this news alone 8 The updated commercial agreement with the USA and Canada T MEC since June 2020 specifically talks about approval procedures for medicine and medical instruments etc so that products approved in Mexico follow procedures accepted by USA standards Therefore it strongly reinforces the chances for approval of the EUA Ranking Shorted Tickers According to Natural Squeeze Potential I wanted to figure out which among the most shorted stocks have the highest potential to create a spontaneous squeeze In other words a squeeze that will occur as a result of the stock price going up quite simply as a result of the performance of the company So to clarify the better the point total of the company the larger is its potential to see a spike in stock price based on performance alone to the point that the price surge will create a squeeze To create the list I went with the most shorted stocks with a market cap above 2 bil I didn t want to include smaller companies because then volatility and manipulation become hard to calculate Then I used several different parameters to include in the point total including short percentage revenue earnings target price float insider and institutional ownership groundbreaking news generation current ytd 52 high and low prices etc I then proceeded to give each parameter value One was total value meaning how relevant is that parameter to the issue at hand potential stock rise The other was relative value meaning how much better is one company doing in comparison to all the others in the list That is how values were awarded to reach a total that I named NSQP natural squeeze potential Generally speaking I liked the results meaning I think the list makes sense although I haven t gone through it one by one to evaluate how accurate it seems to be But I think it does shed light on what companies are least likely to create their own squeeze and which companies have strong squeeze potential In fact I think anyone shorting the top five in this list is de facto insane Comments questions and bashing are welcome I have a position in Sorrento that came in first and that position was what got me thinking about creating the list to begin with I was curious to know how SRNE would fare compared to other shorted companies I absolutely do not think I manipulated the list because when I was doing it I had no way of knowing what the final result would be Too many numbers Here s the list and scores Ticker NSQP SRNE 26 709 FLGT 21 743 SKLZ 21 677 BYND 21 642 FSR 21 490 ROOT 20 903 WOOF 20 803 QS

after the SQueeze gt ANSWER Huge Value Creation for CLOV, Disclaimer This is not investment advice I work in the Medicare industry and thought I would share some ideas I have no affiliation with any company mentioned in this post 3 minute read On January 16th 2009 Obama was getting prepared to be sworn in His first order of business was to stabilize the American economy that the finance industry almost destroyed People all over the world had lost much of their life savings because of Wall Street s greed After stimulus passed the administration started to work on their first major legislative policy It was healthcare On that same day in 2009 UnitedHealth UNH was trading at 25 50 with a market cap of 23B It s right in front of us https preview redd it v56sm4f1w3471 png width 1342 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 94e2320a90a813edc48db0b95a0e6c66d3adf8b7 amp x200B The Obama administration ended up passing the Affordable Care Act ACA on March 23rd 2010 The ACA has dramatically changed the US healthcare system Now that it s survived both Democratic and Republican administrations it will continue to spark more change long term The ACA gives Medicare the power to change payment models in a way that moves the entire industry away from fee for service FFS to value based care It does this by giving the private sector huge financial incentives to improve outcomes Since the ACA passed UnitedHealth UNH has grown over 16x to a market cap of over 380B The Medicare market is what has primarily driven UNH s growth They are the largest Medicare Advantage MA insurer in the US with 26 market share Much of that growth has been through the acquisition of MA plans in local markets all over the country CLOV ISN T JUST A SHORT TERM PLAY 16x growth is the opportunity Clover Health CLOV has AFTER a short squeeze It s one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market With the support of retail investors they can use their elevated stock price as an asset to go on a series of acquisitions that create real business value This growth will support an even higher stock price It s a virtuous cycle Whenever shorts come in it will just lead to another step change in stock price and even faster expansion for CLOV Healthcare providers and insurers have stable revenue streams making it straightforward to finance their acquisition https www investopedia com terms a acquisition financing UNH has already proven this playbook https www dukece com optumcare biggest health care system never heard over the past 10 years It s right in front of us We can replicate it and with a strong retail backing CLOV can execute this same playbook in an even shorter time period The retail revolution has arrived at the exact same time that there is massive disruption i e opportunity in the healthcare industry RETAIL INVESTORS NOW HAVE THE POWER TO CREATE LONG TERM WINNERS NOT JUST BEAT SHORT SELLERS CLOV is perfectly positioned to replicate the UNH playbook and beat them at their own game CLOV has run Medicare Advantage MA plans for over seven years They ve been able to take more and more market share away from UNH and other large competitors each year That s made them one of the fastest growing https www cloverhealth com en about us press clover health triples geographic footprint MA plans The most amazing part is that it s been entirely organic growth With more retail investors they can rapidly launch and or acquire new MA plans in geographies that they re not currently in They also have the Clover Assistant a software platform that providers use to improve health outcomes With their Direct Contracting Entity DCE https www managedhealthcareexecutive com view cms direct contracting model is it still one of the value based models built on fee for service chasis CLOV can acquire provider organizations around the country and take on full risk with them They could rapidly become one of the largest payvidors in the US The future of US healthcare will be dominated by payvidors It s a combination of a payor i e insurance company and provider i e doctor It s powerful https www dukece com optumcare biggest health care system never heard because you can take on and manage risk as a payor and directly control cost and quality on the provider side Kaiser Permanente has proven out this model in the US for decades now UNH has become the ultimate example of a payvidor growing from an insurer 10 years ago to the largest employer of physicians https www medicaleconomics com view now what imminent dangers and emerging opportunities physicians in the US THIS IS THE NEXT STAGE OF EVOLUTION IN THE RETAIL REVOLUTION GME and AMC have been amazing trips so far On days that they squeeze they really are like trips to the moon The problem with these companies though is that they eventually come back to Earth I can t see a future where more people going to be buying and selling video games at stores or going to movie theaters CLOV is like going to the moon short squeeze building a permanent base with a launch site business growth and then going to Mars business growth future squeezes I will continue to support i e hodl GME and AMC because of what they have meant to us They ve given us a voice that Wall Street can t ignore Nothing changed after 2009 Now we re making them change As the retail investor movement grows I hope we can also support companies that are positioned for future growth If we could do that we might just take control of this entire game Note This thesis isn t specific to CLOV or healthcare I truly believe retail investors can create massive value for all companies and industries positioned for growth I just know healthcare and see a proven model https www dukece com optumcare biggest health care system never heard that can be replicated by a great company that also happens to be highly shorted

after the SQueeze gt ANSWER Huge Value Creation for CLOV, Disclaimer This is not investment advice I work in the Healthcare industry and thought I would share some ideas I have no affiliation with any company mentioned in this post 3 minute read On January 16th 2009 Obama was getting prepared to be sworn in His first order of business was to stabilize the American economy that the finance industry almost destroyed People all over the world had lost much of their life savings because of Wall Street s greed After stimulus passed the administration started to work on their first major legislative policy It was healthcare On that same day in 2009 UnitedHealth UNH was trading at 25 50 with a market cap of 23B amp x200B https preview redd it 4fwq1wjf34471 png width 1342 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0594d073464cefa8c1790d1cd96f690afe16e3c0 It s right in front of us The Obama administration ended up passing the Affordable Care Act ACA on March 23rd 2010 The ACA has dramatically changed the US healthcare system Now that it s survived both Democratic and Republican administrations it will continue to spark more change long term The ACA gives Medicare the power to change payment models in a way that moves the entire industry away from fee for service FFS to value based care It does this by giving the private sector huge financial incentives to improve outcomes Since the ACA passed UnitedHealth UNH has grown over 16x to a market cap of over 380B The Medicare market is what has primarily driven UNH s growth They are the largest Medicare Advantage MA insurer in the US with 26 market share Much of that growth has been through the acquisition of MA plans in local markets all over the country CLOV ISN T JUST A SHORT TERM PLAY 16x growth is the opportunity Clover Health CLOV has AFTER a short squeeze It s one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market With the support of retail investors they can use their elevated stock price as an asset to go on a series of acquisitions that create real business value This growth will support an even higher stock price It s a virtuous cycle Whenever shorts come in it will just lead to another step change in stock price and even faster expansion for CLOV Healthcare providers and insurers have stable revenue streams making it straightforward to finance their acquisition https www investopedia com terms a acquisition financing UNH has already proven this playbook https www dukece com optumcare biggest health care system never heard over the past 10 years It s right in front of us We can replicate it and with a strong retail backing CLOV can execute this same playbook in an even shorter time period The retail revolution has arrived at the exact same time that there is massive disruption i e opportunity in the healthcare industry RETAIL INVESTORS NOW HAVE THE POWER TO CREATE LONG TERM WINNERS NOT JUST BEAT SHORT SELLERS CLOV is perfectly positioned to replicate the UNH playbook and beat them at their own game CLOV has run Medicare Advantage MA plans for over seven years They ve been able to take more and more market share away from UNH and other large competitors each year That s made them one of the fastest growing https www cloverhealth com en about us press clover health triples geographic footprint MA plans The most amazing part is that it s been entirely organic growth With more retail investors they can rapidly launch and or acquire new MA plans in geographies that they re not currently in They also have the Clover Assistant a software platform that providers use to improve health outcomes With their Direct Contracting Entity DCE https www managedhealthcareexecutive com view cms direct contracting model is it still one of the value based models built on fee for service chasis CLOV can acquire provider organizations around the country and take on full risk with them They could rapidly become one of the largest payvidors in the US The future of US healthcare will be dominated by payvidors It s a combination of a payor i e insurance company and provider i e doctor It s powerful https www dukece com optumcare biggest health care system never heard because you can take on and manage risk as a payor and directly control cost and quality on the provider side Kaiser Permanente has proven out this model in the US for decades now UNH has become the ultimate example of a payvidor growing from an insurer 10 years ago to the largest employer of physicians https www medicaleconomics com view now what imminent dangers and emerging opportunities physicians in the US THIS IS THE NEXT STAGE OF EVOLUTION IN THE RETAIL REVOLUTION GME and AMC have been amazing trips so far On days that they squeeze they really are like trips to the moon The problem with these companies though is that they eventually come back to Earth I can t see a future where more people going to be buying and selling video games at stores or going to movie theaters CLOV is like going to the moon short squeeze building a permanent base with a launch site business growth and then going to Mars business growth future squeezes I will continue to support i e hodl GME and AMC because of what they have meant to us They ve given us a voice that Wall Street can t ignore Nothing changed after 2009 Now we re making them change As the retail investor movement grows I hope we can also support companies that are positioned for future growth If we could do that we might just take control of this entire game Note This thesis isn t specific to CLOV or healthcare I truly believe retail investors can create massive value for all companies and industries positioned for growth I just know healthcare and see a proven model https www dukece com optumcare biggest health care system never heard that can be replicated by a great company that also happens to be highly shorted

delivery drones 2 We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles EV The people want it the government wants it and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen 3 The government wants zero emissions Workhorse trucks are already zero emission Gas and diesel powered trucks are not These petroleum based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up 4 Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies 5 Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks see pictures The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there s no going back Zero emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure Think about it Walmart Fed Ex Amazon UPS Postal Services Supermarkets for food delivery etc 6 350 000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times This number is projected to increase 7 Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management who has been very popular lately google her had purchased a few million shares for her fund She has since sold This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted more on that below Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52 week highs a few weeks ago Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting It s a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them I m not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn t find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless 8 In April Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks That s 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars That s an enormous number of trucks and that s only from one wholesaler 9 Workhorse s main problems are with manufacturing and delivery The reasons why 10 They re limited in part due to supply chain constraints There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components This has impacted the entire industry including Ford and GM This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales In addition Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions Inc to supply their batteries This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world 11 Electric trucks are a relatively new industry Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse s capacity to meet this demand has been limited Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve they teamed up with someone who can They re now partnered with J B Poindexter amp Co a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering construction and assembly 12 There are several EV players Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles 13 Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately 521 000 compared to approximately 84 000 in the first quarter of 2020 That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly 14 Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE which Workhorse was invested in 15 The Company had approximately 205 1 million in cash in March 2021 This helps limit the need to acquire debt 16 The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a 6 billion contract with the USPS last February It s now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company This one time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies Furthermore Workhorse may still win this 6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front In addition the USPS Postmaster Louis DeJoy who influences the direction of the contract is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it s assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr DeJoy s decision of granting it to Workhorse s competitor If this contract once again becomes up for grabs there s a good chance Workhorse will win it If that happens watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock Forget the moon I m talking about GN z11 the furthest galaxy from us 17 Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you re seeing This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in 18 There are 8 analysts who have recently ranked WKHS Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy NONE recommend a sell It s unanimous NONE recommend selling Some of the analysts recommend price targets are even 24 20 20 and 17 Cowen amp Co Colliers Securities Oppenheimer Roth Capital R F Lafferty BTIG B Riley Financial and Wolfe Research 19 You re helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future 20 The stock price is about 30 of its 52 week high 21 This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL It s shorted about 40 of its float It is one of the most if not THE MOST shorted stock out there It s very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can t expect it to happen overnight It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you especially now The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens They re accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day They ve learned to process this emotion and not act upon it However they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear They re counting on you selling out of fear the bottom and buying out of greed the top If you wait them out they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares Also the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises So how to deal with fear 1 Accept and expect fear to happen because it will Anticipate it and do not act upon it 2 Do not invest money that you can t afford to lose This way you can let it ride 3 Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC AMC was shorted about 20 on its float it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC Also understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are They don t make their money from making good stock picks They make their money from taking a cut of the money they re investing for other people They make up fancy words algorithms and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can t even beat the Dow Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things Look it up if you don t believe it TLDR 1 WKHS is prime for a short squeeze It is one of the most if not the most shorted stock out there 2 WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced Out of 8 research analysts who follow it all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell Price targets for several were at or above 20 3 Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed 4 Demand for their products has skyrocketed 5 Don t be lazy don t TLDR this one ready the whole thing P S not financial advice nor my DD

thought it would be nice to share my research now that people are starting to take note This is essentially a summary of 1 2 3 and 4 amp x200B Thesis I think WISH is in a weird position that makes it both a value and growth investment opportunity It s dirt cheap compared to it s competition and poised for growth owing to natural transition to e commerce and wish s focus on leveraging ML AI to to get people to buy more and save more amp x200B Introduction WISH is a global e commerce mobile first company that is designed for the value conscious online shopper If you re bike helmet costs 70 on Amazon or ebay look at Wish com https Wish com and it ll probably be 15 They also leverage data science and ML to gamify the shopping experience They have daily draws or lotteries that give people in app credit It s difficult to gamify the buying experience for amazon or eBay because the items just cost too much in other words consumers think less before purchasing an item for 5 compared with an item for 500 amp x200B https preview redd it hnl86nlif4471 png width 1822 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0497fe33960dc9515b9cd526a00232ec9e42d31f Another super important thing about wish is their Wish Local venture which eliminates last mile delivery costs and saves both seller and buyer a lot of money There are more things wish does that empower both the seller and buyer which i will get to later amp x200B If you are a value conscious consumer you don t have many options And guess what lt 1 billion people on this planet make under 75K Wish specifically targets those shoppers with incomes under 75K The average wish shopper has a 55K income This slide from 3 shows wish s global footprint amp x200B https preview redd it upmlnqd564471 png width 2184 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f82a280543601e025c5ddda156b6869ba347ee58 Now where does wish fit into the e commerce space They are essentially trying to be the online dollar store but except using ML AI the app will adapt to your preferences Essentially think about walking into a dollar store and seeing everything you want in the first aisle If you shop for things under 5 you ll see those things If you like finer things you ll see those things You can guarantee that whatever you buy from wish will probably be way below what you d pay for the same item at other retailers This image from 1 shows you exactly where wish is in

with value It s like if TikTok s algorithm was used to sell you stuff amp x200B Competition In their 10 K 2 wish states that any e commerce market place that sells items online or brick n mortar are competitors While this is theoretically true it mischaracterizes consumers shopping habits I don t shop on Amazon for used games i have facebook marketplace or offerup for that When i want to sell something esoteric i wont find buyers locally so i gotta use ebay When i get my year end bonus and feel like splurging on a handmade cup i don t go to amazon i have etsy for that Just like this wish

taking note Amazon when they were expanding had to build out massive fulfillment centers to cut down on their delivery time Wish is doing something different Wish Local Instead of building a brand new building wish partners with local stores to have them become the fulfillment centers Currently they have about 50K local stores that offer the option to pick up your order in store This saves the buyer money and gives the partnering store foot traffic It s a win win It s also a massive win for the seller The most expensive process of shipping is last mile delivery in other words it probably

a5a47f262250d4531edf1c1bc3dbda8d8276c1dd Lastly wish offers more benefits to its sellers than most marketplaces sans amazon because it s massive Every seller can use productboost which analyzes the product being sold and markets it to the correct buyers The feature even offers buyers discounts if the buyer is hesitating Wish also has the option to automate the product graphics creation very useful for larger sellers And lastly wish offers an immense logistics suite gt 60 of their buyers are foreign so logistics can become difficult when selling on other marketplaces like Ebay and Etsy Wish has options to handle the entire logistics for your store so you can sit back in Europe watching somebody in America buy your outdoor canopy amp x200B Innovation Now all this expansion requires analyzing a whole lot of data Wish is perfectly equipped to handle just that Amazon has a whole lot of ML AI scientists but probably all of them work on AWS and not on the store Etsy probably has some too But wish is more of a data company first and then an e commerce company And this is reflected in the discovery aspect of wish Amazon has very little discovery if you buy something amazon will suggest the option to buy it again Etsy has even less And ebay has even less than that Wish is gamifying the shopping experience by suggesting a whole bunch of other stuff you might be interested in

wayfair CFO Joe Lonsdale is a PLTR co founder and Jacqueline Reses was CEO at SQ This is a team that blends data science and e commerce amp x200B A main reason people don t shop on WISH is because the marketplace is filled with low quality goods While this is true it insults wish s amazing data analysis Wish CAN be filled with low quality cheap stuff if that is your shopping preference their software will tune the feed to match your shopping habits Wish is also introducing more and more branded products to cater to some of the wealthier consumers amp x200B Other investors So who is in wish with you Wish currently has 96 15 institutional ownership according to yahoo finance https finance yahoo com quote WISH key statistics p WISH https finance yahoo com quote WISH key statistics p WISH I don t really know how they are defining institutional ownership because other websites show something closer to 65 Peter Thiel s founders fund which invested in SpaceX Stripe PLTR Facebook etc is also an early investor in wish https foundersfund com portfolio https foundersfund com portfolio Daniel Loeb of Third Point Partners is also an early investor in wish Formation8 the extremely successful venture capital firm is also in Wish https en wikipedia org wiki Formation 8 https en wikipedia org wiki Formation 8 For a list of other hedge funds go here https whalewisdom com stock wish https whalewisdom com stock wish amp x200B Valuation It s tough to value a company at this stage But some things are clear Private investors looked at the company and values it at 20 The average analyst value on wish is 22 If we do some simple calculations showing the numbers in the table and value wish on the low end with eBay s P B and the high end with ETSY s P B we get 25 and 60 respectively But these valuations make a lot of assumptions Wish is a data science and logistics company as well as an e commerce company valuing something at this stage is immensely difficult But one thing is certain the stock is cheap at the time of writing amp x200B Bear thesis 1 Untested business model The main bear thesis against wish is that they are operating with an untested business model The argument goes something like It is not clear whether people making gt 75K will shop online Rebuttal I see this bought up alot but this is the exact market wish is attempting to capture With e commerce growing at gt 30 and virtually everyone in america and europe having a smartphone this co hort of people making lt 75K is increasingly bought into the fold If wish were operating with a time tested business model it would have competition from amazon and flipkart and alibaba spells doom amp x200B 2 Another important bear point is wish s reliance on Chinese sellers The argument goes wish is historically populated by drop shipper type merchants in china because they are the only ones who can make products that can compete on price Rebuttal While this is currently true wish is seeing a rapid influx of sellers in the USA Their 10 K shows an increase of gt 200 for sellers residing in america In 2 3 years the monopoly china merchants have on wish might dissapear amp x200B 3 the shipping times right now can range anywhere from 10 20 days Rebuttal This point is because of 2 More merchants in china means longer shipping times As said before the tide is turning and this was also echoed in the 5 13 ER that saw record low times amp x200B 4 the company is not profitable Rebuttal The stock was hit hard the last ER almost falling 25 because it missed EPS estimates Wish beat on revenue estimates but failed to prove profitability This is again because wish is attempting a newer business model and is still in growing phase The company currently spends almost all of it s revenue on marketing and sales Look at a lakers jersey next time you watch NBA Kinda like how amazon stressed building a brand and revenue before becoming profitable wish is doing the same amp x200B
