imgur com rWUea2Z jpg Last week s 1x to multi baggers SPOT SNAP BA Last week s losers BIDU XPEV On a milk carton but our family still has hope JD I use Barchart and TOS for general flow but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I m playing UPDATE DOCU CEO speaking at Morgan Stanly TMT conference Monday AM This 300c 3 5 came through last week https i imgur com dD2cqVp jpg Suicidal strike but I like the sentiment When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling I m in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough Why Because the moment I buy a put we are going to new all time highs I just know it So I ve had to work a little harder to pull out the calls and I m happy for those of you that got the SPOT SNAP and BA tendies from last week s DD XPEV was kind of weird too I guess I need to take buy American Honestly I ll take 3 5 5 for picks on a bloody week any day though Please remember When things are this volatile choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day minimum unless we re playing a specific event The difference between a failing play and a 30 intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open or buying two hours later And don t get greedy this is guerilla warfare right now Take your pop profits unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike and much longer than the whale If you can t afford it don t play it There are opportunities every day Anyway I want to go in a little different direction this week as something interesting stood out to me Ready Let s roll 1 The SPOT Whale Anatomy of a carcass On Monday as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written some further research revealed that at 8 AM on Monday 2 22 SPOT was hosting an investor day Investor day was indeed the whale s bet and boy did it pay off with that 8 intraday pop I hadn t heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit so my spidey sense was tingling Then the next interesting hits came Last week s Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting On Tuesday and Wednesday amidst the storm SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops TWTR which I d made a note of the week prior had the same activity What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together Investor analyst days It was time to get to work 2 The investigation I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven t paid much attention to The results were interesting in two ways 1 SNAP https investor snap com overview default aspx SPOT https investors spotify com home default aspx and TWTR https investor twitterinc com events and presentations default aspx investor relations pages show these events in 2021 but not in 2020 or 2019 Earnings Sure Annual meetings Indubitably Conferences Yes Investor analyst days Nay Small sample size obviously but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years I d call it significant 2 SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports this is important later SNAP ER was 2 4 Investor Day was 2 23 SPOT ER was 2 5 Investor Day was 2 22 TWTR ER 2 9 Analyst Day was 2 25 All three of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor analyst events All three of these came within a month of their ER All three of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that pump NOTE I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech and PYPL employed the same strategy No investor day in 2020 yet after their ER on 2 3 21 they hosted an investor day on 2 11 These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT 3 Defining RAMBO As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations conferences and meetings on their corporate sites gives valuable input for what may be brewing I also saw that Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology Media and Telecom conference https esn net morgan stanley technology media and telecom conference march 1 2021 Among others our favorite FSLY is set to present Given that these plays coincide with investor relations meetings conferences and are blatant pumps I ll refer to it as RAMBO Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities 4 Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports SPOT if you re going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever why not announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore The same can be asked of others like PYPL SNAP TWTR etc My theory is that the current ER environment where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10 000 estimate beat means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards In a way they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time After seeing the success of this manuever this past week I wouldn t be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day analyst day or key meeting conference 5 So what am I saying I m saying that given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO separate from earnings reports One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of Hunting for RAMBO Picks I ll test this on in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend wait on price action to settle for Tech calls EPD https i imgur com U18rGpb jpg Dipping a toe in with this nice boring boomer midstream oil giant They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8 3 but let s be real I couldn t care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory not my retirement income The real opportunity is in the fact that on Friday two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future including a 23c for 3 26 They coincided with upcoming RAMBO as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd https www enterpriseproducts com investors presentations They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day SPOT did last week I see this as a confidence move and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould potentially be newsworthy I ll roll the dice here but keep it safe and drop if the news is a dud As a side note though oil is just a good long term play for 2021 My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh rinting As always pick a good entry point BIDU https i imgur com G5XaBOD jpg EDIT the BIDU stock split isn t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre HK listing split with a neutral effect affect Whatever on NASDAQ share prices Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright Yeah yeah I know I will be shilling BIDU to the grave But I saw some more interesting call activity on them it never stops and a nice little 420 3 26c that piqued my interest I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this gt BEIJING Jan 22 2021 PRNewswire Baidu Inc Nasdaq BIDU Baidu or the Company a leading Internet platform and AI company today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders the EGM at 11 00 a m on March 1 2021 Beijing time at the address of No 10 Shangdi 10th Street Haidian District Beijing the People s Republic of China A proposal of changing the Company s authorized share capital by one to eighty subdivision of shares Share Subdivision will be submitted to Baidu s shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM Yes that s right BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company s split date Remember TSLA Remember AAPL Well this ain t ether of those lol but I like the news and dammit I like the stock Can I tell you exactly what they do NO Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in ALOT CRM https i imgur com 25AMtPg jpg CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently and you know I love a good falling knife Outside of that nearing bottom though they ve got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4 9 275c They re trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week alone https investor salesforce com events and presentations default aspx I ll play it a little safer a little longer but I m in for fishing the bottom here ZNGA https i imgur com cTLGZLk jpg Whale came through with a conservative bet but I ll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol not really but yeah kinda They re speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th 8 25 AM PST https investor zynga com news releases news release details zynga present morgan stanley technology media telecom conference NVDA https i imgur com TFrRmTn jpg I m as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4 12 and calls are starting to trickle in Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker I don t care how rich you are Ticker I just like this week JNJ because I m a bandwagon hopper and PDD ER lotto gamble TLDR Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be

getting ready to leap This is my first DD post so I would appreciate any feedback and criticism of assumptions I am making here But I thing that JFrog is setup for a good run in the next few months and here is why What do they do Their main product is JFrog Artifactory which is a universal repository for software binaries runnable code and it also serves as a mirror repository local copies of Open Source Software They also offer JFrog X Ray that scans those Open Source libraries for malware vulnerabilities This is one of the most critical cogs in the software sausage factory Artifactory is comparable to a walk in refrigerator with the mirror repo it adds the loading dock with X Ray it also helps to ensure food safety You may have heard of the Solarwinds attack and if you have been following it heard that it is described as a supply chain vulnerability attack In my professional opinion the toolset JFrog offers is the best available to combat this kind of threat and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security That is why I am very much a Bullfrog If there is interest I will do a deeper dive into this aspect at another time but for this initial one this is the huge surge in demand for their capabilities and the need for going beyond the basics is my thesis why this company is positioned to do very very well going forward Company background They were founded in 2008 and there main product has been Artifactory ever since It has only 1 direct competitor with similar scope Sonatype Nexus but Artifactory is better and cheaper Sonatype started as a plugin for Artifactory that does something similar to X Ray before X Ray existed then they copycatted the Universal Repo so JFrog hit back with X Ray I have used both of these products over the years since 2013 and I have worked in environments without Artifactory improves developer productivity a lot and it secures company Intellectual Property Their product is used by most of the Fortune 500 companies This includes Google AWS Microsoft IBM and Facebook These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels the software that runs their entire companies safe That should tell you something about how good it is They have over 90 renewal rate of their customers They acquired Shippable in 2019 which basically lets them offer the whole sausage factory Though the area where this competes is very competitive with some very good products that are Open Source Their focus lately has been on offering a SaaS model to complement their on prem offering and make adoption easier This should also grow their revenue a lot because it will make it easier to buy the total package instead of just the most basic They went public in late 2020 but it was very low key since they came out the same day as Snowflake Financials I am including a couple of Comps here based on the segment they operate in Atlassian TEAM makes Jira Confluence and Trello which are used by most software teams for managing requirements and agile software Team collaboration I picked them as a comp because I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory Crowdstrike CRWD is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running As a high growth software company unsurprisingly their GAAP earnings are negative Surprisingly to me though they are very minor and they have even had 1 quarter of profitability FROG 0 1861 CRWD 0 4763 TEAM 4 9355 Their market cap FROG 4 9 B CRWD 47 8 B TEAM 59 4 B Their forward P E Ratio FROG 615 CRWD 771 TEAM 173 They don t have any long term debt Their current ratio short term assets short term debt is 5 3 Their margin is over 80 Revenue is growing 44 YOY Ownership 65 owned by insiders and institutions Most of that ownership is insiders because there are only 5 ETFs including an ARK Index Fund that own it Their final lockup was just released on 2 16 after their earnings and insiders have through 3 13 to sell before they go back into lockup This is similar to what happened with Palantir recently but it seems like most of them have sold what they are going to sell TL DR They have a great product and have cornered a growing market they invented which has high barriers to entry They are well managed and have good financials as well Positions 420 shares and 61 options I am planning to get 8 more options on Monday If you haven t guessed yet I like the stock You can check my post history to see some YOLO posts from earlier this week I will post another update when I am fully loaded with 420 69 to ride this My EOY price target is at least 100 share from the current price which is at 53 49

That s about to change drastically This morning Berkshire Hathaway beat Q4 EPS consensus by 42 3 said they repurchased 24 7 billion in shares in 2020 and planned to continue the record pace of repurchases this year 2 https www berkshirehathaway com 2020ar linksannual20 html In addition Buffett laid out his bullish case for BRK as usual in his annual letter However more important than any of these things as significant as they are is what was missing from the letter this year As many of you rightfully complain Buffett has failed to find elephant deals for many years He s complained himself about this every year and warned every year that BRK will lag SPY in the short term In the meantime he s fiddled with new ways to put the cash to use with sector bets on airlines banks japanese conglomerates etc With this backdrop remember that Buffett is not a boomer he s from the Silent Generation So what he didn t say in the report is really important So what the fuck didn t he say He didn t complain at all about not knowing what to do with cash and didn t warn that BRK might lag SPY You re not grasping the significance yet Let me explain The reason he s been fiddling with sector bets is because these are his replacement for the elephants In fact he explains in his letter linked above that they re even better He no longer needs to pay a control premium to own them Plus he can buy into better businesses that are too valued by their shareholders to be sold entirely to any one owner Over the next year the market will transition from an easy money market to one where economic principles and free cash flows matter There s no one more adept at navigating such markets than Warren and his colossal BRK cash machine Also here s some simple math for you SP500 P E ratio 38 8 BRK P E ratio 13 5 Yes I included unrealized capital gains in calculating BRK s P E That s because BRK s portfolio is actively managed and it is part of their business model and reported net income This means BRK s underperformace relative to SPY lately was due to earnings multiple contraction in BRK while SPY experienced multiple expansion This is why Buffett didn t warn that BRK might underperform He s back in his mojo and about to whoop SPY s ass again Boomers will wake up to this next week and push up BRK s multiple again Calls were cheap on Friday so I bought 170 BRK B 242 50C 3
