to 9 months ,Greetings apes Today I humbly offer my opinions and they are opinions not financial advice on four predominantly UK based stocks I firmly believe will make fat bank by the end of the year or earlier I ll break down each stock individually and my reasoning as well as a potential risks section at the end The stonks pt 1 Mitchells and Butlers Mitchells and Butlers is one of the largest pub chains in the UK Chances are if it s not a wetherspoons or an independent it s a M amp B joint in one way or another With a wide variety of brands under its name M amp B enjoys a massive market share of UK booze outlets Last year saw pubs get utterly decimated and accordingly M amp B s stock price crashed hard but with reopening dates now announced by the government sentiment towards the pub industry will likely rise as will M amp B profits as thirsty patrons flock back to their favourite watering holes The trend will likely only continue to rise as restrictions are lifted and more people rush to enjoy cheap steaks and watered down pepsi in summer In the short term the value of the stock may go down but I expect that by the end of May firm profits will start flowing in and the stock price will only go up until it reaches a plateau in about September October as the novelty begins to wear off The stonks pt 2 Restaurant group Like Mitchells and Butlers Restaurant Group owns a significant portion of the mid to high class restaurants across the UK with numerous brands under its umbrella While Restaurant Group has enjoyed a better recovery over the worst of the pandemic owing to delivery services Restaurant Group stock price is still well below its all time high and the consistent price for the last few non fucked years Assuming a rapid increase in stock price upon reopening in late May to July Restaurant Group could see anywhere from a 120 to 300 increase in value Theoretically Restaurant Group has the same plateau but I anticipate that the stock price will level off at a higher value after the spike than M amp B The stonks pt 3 AMD At approximately 85 a share right now AMD is around the highest it s been for years The last few days have seen a contraction in price but AMD is all but guaranteed to bounce back in November December time With the release of the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series consoles AMD silicon is in more homes than ever before and orders from Sony and Microsoft are only going to keep coming in However 2021 also sees the pending release of Ryzen 6xxx processors as well as a brand new socket platform DDR5 RAM and the potential release of RDNA 3 based graphics processors Given previous company performance the new Ryzen processors are likely to offer a reasonable increase in performance as well as a host of new features inherent to a new platform This will make the systems attractive to both home enthusiasts and laptop desktop manufacturers looking to put fresh new chips in their computers Assuming RDNA 3 releases this year gains could also be boosted by what is likely to be a series of graphics cards that can soundly outperform Nvidia s current offerings in traditional rendering and has the potential to be the top dog until Nvidia releases 4xxx series Even assuming a worst case scenario where their new processors and GPUs are beaten this year improvements in market share and product performance over last gen will likely still bring about an increase in value or at least break even But that s small fry Because all the above is just a squirt of precum compared to the hot thick recoil inducing money shot that is stonk number 4 The stonks pt 4 Rolls Motherfucking Royce I know what you re thinking Don t they make fancy cars Who s buying those Nobody my dear ape but you know what else they make Jet engines Rolls Royce has approximately 36 000 engines in service with airlines around the world and guess where those engines are right now In hangars missing their scheduled maintenance With air travel being pretty much dead right now a huge amount of aircraft are now squirreled away awaiting reactivation While it s true that a lot of airlines went bust over the crisis the planes and engines will be kept around and should eventually be brought back into service while the airlines that survived will have to un mothball their fleets EN MASSE With a year of sitting around the spike in repairs and maintenance to Rolls Royce will be huge and after that a steady rise in air travel in the central and western Europe region will soon get the stock price right where it was before the pandemic Travel between the USA and Europe and places like Japan and Australia who have handled the pandemic relatively well will also help to get air travel back up Not only that but Rolls Royce carries the patented literally can t go tits up guarantee courtesy of Boris Johnson who gets an erection just thinking about starting a colony and who will absolutely bail out Rolls Royce in the event they go tits up Moreover with a programme for Small Modular Reactors Rolls Royce are in a prime position to enter the Nuclear power industry adding further value to their long term profits That s all well and good but then what about other areas in aviation I hear you say you surprisingly handsome monkey Well Airbus and Boeing are both recovering from their slumps but with recent news Boeing stock is likely to go into freefall for a while and Airbus stock is on its way back up to normal Rolls Royce s biggest competitor GE has their stock chart look like a fucking line But not Rolls Royce Rolls Royce s stock price right now is only just beginning to recover Rolls Royce stock prices looked like the trajectory of a Javelin missile in the pandemic and have only today risen above 100 a share In comparison their normal stock price rides around 700 to a peak just shy of 1100 That s up to an 11 times return on investment folks Risks the less publicised of the aircraft failures yesterday could have been a Rolls Royce engine though the lack of a stock price fall today suggests otherwise Nonetheless it is possible that a catastrophic accident could happen wiping out Rolls Royce stock price overnight and severely delaying a recovery Restaurant Group and M amp B both rely on the public running out in droves to enjoy food and drink While I believe this is all but certain it is possible that a given percentage of UK patrons no longer wish to go out and have become so accustomed to having their food delivered that they are unlikely to visit these establishments in future Finally while I believe AMD s future is bright the current shortage of manufacturing is likely to hurt their stock price and may dampen future product releases if it continues into the end of the year and next year Nonetheless I believe AMD is going from strength to strength and will only gain value in the long run Or until they make another bulldozer In conclusion While I m not an expert and this isn t financial advice I have firm belief in the value of these stocks While I don t have the capital to go ham on these I will be purchasing a Rolls Royce share as soon as I can and will be following its progress with great interest The other stocks also represent a firm investment albeit ones with less potential to go to orbit Options on any of these would likely also bring profit to potential buyers if you can t buy a share yourself or wish to use calls and puts to potentially make even more money That s all apes Remember to wash those diamond hands and also buy a GME if you can

miss out,Hello fellow autists I know there are PLTR DD posts all the time but many miss out on important details that must be addressed and many of you retards don t know what the company does even though you put your life savings on the stock Palantir is a growth stock that is going to overtake the market harder then when your wife s boyfriend comes over and takes your spot on the bed for the night Everything shows this is a quality company with strong growth potential in the enterprise market big service provider to the government and is a great artificial intelligence with a growing market as a leading provider There are many doubters of PLTR which can only be attributed to the fact they hate money Did I mention tons of intuitional investors such as Cathie Wood entered a large position in PLTR and everything she touches turns into tendies Hop on the fucking train amp x200B https preview redd it mo6imrozl4j61 png width 1400 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 70416eca0b19050cfa2ca5a362a0fac70ce36c3f What the fuck exactly is PLTR I am glad you asked Palantir Technologies is a software company that specializes in big data analytics The company is known for three projects in particular Palantir Gotham Palantir Metropolis and Palantir Foundry Palantir Gotham is used by counter terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community USIC and United States Department of Defense In the past Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015 Gotham was also used by cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor a Canadian public private venture which operated from 2003 to 2012 Palantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds banks and financial services firms Palantir Foundry is used by corporate clients such as Morgan Stanley Merck KGaA Airbus and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV See how diverse the company is in multiple industries Plus the Navy uses Palantir for their nuclear submarines now which tells you how quality the product is and the government is loyal to their suppliers And will pay big money which makes call holders and share holders fucking wealthy rich while gay bears get fucked harder then someone who thought spy 200 puts were a good idea amp x200B Why Palatir There s a fuck ton of software companies for me to yolo First let me start off I am not a software engineer or hardcore computer guy but I have read many accounts by people who know more then me in this sector that this company is legit Strong Government Contracts Palantir claims it will become the default operating system for data across the U S government Its Gotham platform which mainly serves government clients already helps the U S military FBI CIA and other government agencies make data driven decisions Palantir s revenue from government customers rose 73 year over year to 420 3 million or 55 of its top line in the first nine months of 2020 During the third quarter it secured a new AI contract with the U S Army Last December the U S Army renewed the second year of a four year analytics partnership which provided for one base year and three optional years with Palantir That same month the Food and Drug Administration FDA which already uses some of Gotham s tools awarded Palantir a new three year contract to track the development of new drugs In January the U S Army hired Palantir to modernize its ground stations This contract which will start with a prototype and expand over four phases could be worth up to 250 million These contracts all indicate Gotham is sticky and will allow Palantir to deploy additional services to boost its average revenue per customer and widen its moat against its potential challengers Growth in the commercial non government sector Palantir also helps enterprise customers process data with its Foundry platform The Wall Street bears often claim Foundry faces too much competition in the enterprise analytics market but Palantir s enterprise revenue still rose 30 year over year to 320 3 million or 45 of its top line in the first nine months of 2020 During the third quarter Foundry signed a new contract with the National Institutes of Health renewed a contract with a big aerospace customer and pulled a major consumer goods company away from an unnamed rival Last December it signed a new two year Foundry contract with the U K National Health Service NHS to track COVID 19 infections Throughout January and February it expanded its Foundry deals with Fujitsu and BP while signing new contracts with PG amp E Rio Tinto and IBM These deals indicate Foundry s tools can be applied to a wide range of industries including energy management services for PG amp E and BP optimizing mining operations for Rio Tinto or optimizing AI tools for IBM and will likely keep growing after Gotham s growth slows down Artificial intelligence is a booming market and I m not talking about boomers themselves The global AI market could still grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42 2 between 2020 and 2027 according to Grand View Research That secular trend will light a fire under companies like Palantir that process large amounts of data into actionable strategies Those tailwinds could help Palantir generate high double digit sales growth over the next decade and help its stock grow into its premium valuation You cannot tell me with a single brain cell that investing in the AI market is something you re gonna regret in the future amp x200B Attention it is receiving from retail and hedge funds The stock has all of wall street s eyes on it it s popular on our daily discussion and CNBC talks about it all the time Then you have funds like ARK buying into it A stock like that does not fade away into the sunset to never be seen again It is a momentum buy Conclusion At 28 per share Palantir is valued at about 52 3 billion or 28 times next year s sales That s still a high price to sales ratio for a company that aims to generate about 30 sales growth next year But Palantir could also be sandbagging its guidance Last September it forecast 42 sales growth for 2020 but it actually topped that estimate by five percentage points If it raises its full year forecast over the next few quarters its stock could actually be even cheaper relative to its sales This stock has tons of room to grow and is in an emerging market Palantir s government hardened reputation and aggressive tools for pulling data from disparate sources are arguably giving it a competitive edge against competitors such as CRM and AYX They had a great earnings and reported Q4 results that included a nice top line beat This is going to the moon and you don t want to miss out on a quality company with meme potential amp x200B Positions Hella Shares 28 50 April 1st calls Will be getting leaps amp x200B Literally cannot go tits up

but let me double down on my thoughts on PLTR Recently we ve seen a little turmoil in the broader market that has scared some growth investors and I do think there is some justifiable fear A lot of folks are going to tell you this is a great discount on names like TSLA or PLUG and I certainly don t disagree with them I just want to have all my bases covered Now we have seen some structural shifts in the broader market The 10 Year shift up to 1 35 is a noticable tick up and this is something all of us have to be wary of As much as I like discounts when the market prices in tighter money the Fed will have to listen I believe Uncle Jay will continue to have the market s back and I think the 10 Year should be capped at roughly 1 5 2 We ll see how this develops but the bottomline is these forward looking growth giants are going to get CRUSHED if they miss expectations And well if technology continues to be a deflationary pressure through innovation as we all expect then regardless and we can cap the discussion here So here s where sweet good PLTR comes into play I really really like how they delivered earnings last week Didn t REALLY disappoint beat earnings on a non GAAP basis and had 45 annual top line growth But that s not even the kicker for me The fact that PLTR leadership is essentially guaranteeing at least 30 growth over the next 5 years read the earnings call transcript which will look like an absolute bonanza if rates actually start to go up Now the thesis is that growth firms future profits are less valuable today if rates start to go up which would not be great for big growth names like PLTR But then here s the thing it would absolutely WRECK mega tech growth like FAANG or the EV battery state field Let s go back to earnings Karp and the PLTR team are essentially setting the bar very low telling investors to sit back and expect ONLY 30 growth for 5 years For boomers they realize this is fucking crazy btw Essentially if there is any surprise to the upside which is totally reasonable with a disruptor like Palantir and this thing will be worth hundreds of billions in the blink of an eye But think of how all these great stories came about Tesla in 2017 2019 Facebook in 2012 2013 Apple in 2008 2009 These tech stars never had a straight shot up and the same goes for PLTR They faced the same problems I m only a college student but I remember for as long as I have been alive from skeptical financial analysts that Tesla was gargantually overvalued and didn t have the cash to survive in the EV market I watched as a kid as some whiz built up a social media platform from his dorm room but Wall St attacked him for wearing a hoodie to his IPO Not only did they not think he could expand his platform from PC to mobile but they questioned how its cutting edge technology differed from Myspace and Tumblr and wondered if he could ever scale ad revenue He shore could Yes PLTR is overvalued What isn t Snowflake trades for 80X estimated sales C3 AI trades at 73 5X its 2020 revenues Salesforce Splunk and MSFT ain t cheap For reference PLTR is trading just under 37X 2021 sales which is lofty but looks reasonable compared to these other names that have way higher multiples and much less sophisticated scalable software And if we look at it PLTR was profitable by roughly 0 06 share if you take out a stockholder compensation expense that otherwise would have left them with 100M in operating profit Is it profitable PLTR has 70 fucking margins How are Finance pricks not creaming over this You want high margin earnings this is it right here man But no no big bad overvalued Palantir want to pay executives advisors shareholders extra money Bad Bad I say they worth 20 in equity research reports and on CNBC instead but still load up behind the scenes Fuck the shills who say Palantir can t continue robust growth or be profitable On top of that yes their revenue base is dominated by gov t clients at roughly 52 but let s pause and realize this is a good thing I mean i don t want to get too political here but broadly you re a fool if you think the Dod DoJ or CDC NIAID are cutting back anytime soon amongst alm of them they have dozens of contracts with PLTR worth hundreds of millions of And let s take what Cathie Wood said the other day roughly along the lines that some of the greatest innovations come from the military I think we can point to the WWW as a pretty decent example of that Given PLTR traces its roots to the CIA s venture capital arm and loading up on national security contracts with all the intelligence agencies after 9 11 I feel pretty confident that this will provide much value in revenue AND earnings to PLTR especially if rates starts to rise Furthermore the cross that bogged Tesla Apple FB and pretty much every mega cap tech company is restraining Palantir right now The Street wonders if they will be able to continue locking down corporate clients which it has been rapidly expanding in recent years The answer is yes But Wall St doesn t want you to think so at the moment B c PLTR was a direct listing they weren t underwritten by investment banks and thus don t receive the same financial shilling that names like Snowflake or C3 AI do But we almost just always double down on our convictions If you have seen Palantir s demos read its financials or listened to their CEO then you know the potential of this company I believe in people I believe in Peter Thiel and his track record I believe a guy who founded PayPal with Elon Musk seeded Facebook when no one else would and decided to seed PLTR w the CIA when no one else would yes I believe he knows what he is doing And I believe he is capable of finding talent like Alex Carp and collaborating with him to build an absolute behemoth As a disclosure I am very long PLTR and am simply sharing my thoughts This is not financial advice PLTR TO THE MOON

due diligence track data and contributor s quality reward contributions and will end up in a decentralized stock market where everyone has the same rights Math over politics ,Hi With the raising concerns regarding manipulation on the stock market we need to realize that right now powerful people takes the rights to manipulate markets at the expense of apes with diamond hands I think we can fix this problem using computer science I m currently working on a software that will enable people to create peer to peer databases decentralized and manage them in a decentralized manner The stock holders of a database rewards people to contribute to their databases by generating new stock to pay for their contributions The customers of that data then buy the stock to consume data from that database Software engineers can then create a software that requests data in multiple databases using a query similar to an SQL query and pay for the data consumption The rendering of the software will be using OpenGL to enable 2D 3D rendering That way we can create a decentralized application store where programmers create applications on top of other people s database and sell them to users Users can then use the applications to retrieve different kind of data and interact with other people without a platform that can alter that data Some communications will be public others encrypted That way private stuff stays private secret stuff is known to only the people that needs to know them and public stuff can be known to everyone Since contributors of databases and application developers becomes shareholders they vote for the vote on tasks that needs to be executed on their database They can buy sell their stock in p2p and or sell contracts using them Service contracts contribution propositions bonds options calls puts will also be easy to create using our scripting language that can bind data from databases inside a contract That way we will be able to activate contracts based on events happening on the network Then we ll build a decentralized network of cash depositors where people will be able to deposit fiat currency to these businesses people and receive a receipt for their deposition and trade it for other cash deposits database stocks options etc At last we will join efforts together and fund acquisition where we buy a private company connect its sales and contracts system to our decentralized network and make all its books open in a decentralized manner Then make the company public and sell its shares in our network I m going to run 2 companies in the network 1 that help companies use the network and 1 that raise funds and buy companies open all the activities of the acquisition to everyone on the network then make the company public and sell its shares on the network to pay back investors You can read more about the plan in this article I wrote on github https github com deepvalue network software blob main WHAT md You can also follow my source code on github https github com deepvalue network software I think this tool will be awesome to discover fraudulent companies badly managed companies and companies that are very good but don t seem like it on paper I also think that its governing system will help make manipulation harder to execute I suspect we ll have legal concerns with this network in the future specially to make securities traded in a decentralized manner But I believe we ll be able to build it while making the law makers happy I will put all efforts in making this possible If I don t succeed Ill try again until I do At last since each person will be able to create their own listing and filtering algorithms I think it will be way harder to mass manipulate the network using bots If you want to join discussion you can do it on our sub at r DeepValueNetwork If you want to help please send me a PM If you have any question please post it in comment Ill answer to all of them in the next few days Thanks everyone for reading this and hope you ll join us in making this world a more just one Thanks Steve Disclaimer I hacked a bank 17 years ago when I was 19 I injected a software inside a file I could upload on their form Their backend used PHP and knew it would execute the code when reading my file That code sniffed the bank s database and all its accessible files and made a bridge in order for me to upload files to their server I created a new landing page on their server and mass mailed their members to get the PIN of their cards I then used the customer s bank and card information to recreate the 2 strips debit cards using an MSR magnetic card encoder At last I went to the ATM and withdrew money in some accounts deposited in others etc I did this because I wanted to show them proof the intrusion worked when I sent them an email explaining their security holes but they just didn t care They told me that security was not a concern at their bank When I sent them the proof of my intrusion they alerted the FBI and the RCMP to get me arrested instead of asking me details about how I fucked them system When I got sentenced 2 years later their only concern was that I never mention their bank name with this exploit to anyone This is why I m not mentioning the bank name here I did an interview got a TV show here in Quebec around 2005 https ici radio canada ca actualite v2 enjeux niveau2 1072 shtml They mentioned the phishing part but never talked about the hacking part I suspect the bank didn t want that advertised This is just an opinion I have no proof of this To this day that bank still uses the same technology making this all possible again Don t ask me how I know this I probably just know it from a friend of a friend I don t intrude in servers anymore I was a deeply arrogant child when I was young I really didn t use the right way to help the bank obviously I deserved the criminal record I got from this experience But this story made me learn that these people don t want to help people They created a system that looks safe to use but is gamified in order for a small group of people to gain from everyone without giving anything of real value back They don t care if they create collateral damage as long as they make profits even if our children needs to pay for their mistake for the rest of their lives We need to get that power back and decentralized it in order to stop mass manipulation and give the same access to information to everyone This is the problem I want to fix for the rest of my career PM me if you want to help

through a minor correction the last few days due to rapid rising of bond yields and so there will be a lot of focus on Powell s hearing tomorrow and Thursday My feeling is that Powell will continue to be consistent in his message that his priority is to boost the economy market and that inflation is not a concern at this moment and that there is no consideration of rising interest rates If this does happen I think we will go right back into heavy green the rest of the month There are a lot of ppl smarter than me on WSB so I d love to hear contrary opinions or agreements or whatever you all think 2 Do not expect hedge funds in any shape or form to get punished or held accountable by any government agency It is all a show We cannot count on any government incompetent and corrupt officials to do anything to make things fair If you need proof just go back and look at the Bernie Maddoff story The one Greek financial analyst reported fraud TEN times to the SEC for like 8 years in a row In some ways he was kind of like the DFV before DFV another legend but a different situation Regardless the SEC did NOTHING each time Maddoff was a hedge fund guy operating a HUGE 20B ponzi scheme and still the SEC did NOTHING The only reason he was even actually caught was when the credit crunch caused the ponzi scheme to fall apart and Maddoff turned himself in The SEC Is a bunch of pansies when it comes to going after the rich They are owned by the rich They only come after the smaller poorer people The other hedge funds new it was fraud too but the only reason they didn t complain was out of fear that their own fraud would be exposed by brining in regulators The vast majority of hedge funds are all BS and a house of cards There is no government agencies that will do shit against them ever We apes autists retards are all we have and we must continue to do the work and fight We must beat them at their own game with better data and better research This is just a discussion board but its up to each of us individually to make the best decisions that make sense for each of your respective situations But pay attention to what those hedge funds do what public info they release what they are shorting etc Beat them at their own game and bang their wives as you are doing it THAT is the goal 3 Despite point 2 there is plenty of hope and I am optimistic about GME Remember these hedge funds also shorted Tesla all year long as admitted by hedge fund douche Gabe last week Surely they tried manipulation there too in order to artificially keep the price down But Tesla was and is too strong They could not keep it down forever and then they eventually had to pay the price which initiated a whole bunch of short squeezes as Tesla mooned to crazy highs I m not saying GME is guaranteed to follow that path but with some good news from RC and with some solid strategic steps GME can break out It just needs some catalysts and then some momentum Patience is key here for those who truly believe in GME as I do Earnings is coming up in March and some good news could go a long way in sparking another gamma squeeze I will point out that even though Melvin shorted Tesla last year they still had a very solid year and made a lot of money I believe I read it was around 500M for 2020 so they will still find other ways to manipulate other things to cover themselves Whether its using their media puppets their short reporting buddies like Shitron short ladders ETF underhanded shorting or whatever else they have a lot of shady dirty tools in their bag Regardless when it comes to GME we can still win this battle if we believe in GME This is not financial advice and people should only be all in if they believe in GME and can afford to be in it 4 The stimulus looms large Congress has estimated a stimulus delivered around March Some say it is already priced in but I don t agree I think the combination of the stimulus combined with market reopening has the potential to really take this market to record new highs This however will not last for the whole year IMHO because inflation concerns will certainly creep up again once we get to the highs If my predictions come true and we do get record highs it will be time to consider the Sell in May and Go Away philosophy I will admit this is prediction is just an estimated guess and I again invite those who are much smarter than me to weigh in on whether they agree with this prediction or things its completely off base 5 Mining stocks like MARA and Riot are interesting and I am watching them Ever since Telsa announced its investment there has been wild speculation that Apple could follow Perhaps it is better to just buy the coin instead of the mining companies That I do not know I will say that I think it is absolutely a strong possibility that one day these coins will replace the US dollar as the global reserve currency Maybe I am just retarded in thinking that but I think its possible That is all I got I again invite all those who are far smarter than me to rip apart any of these points or to agree with me or to just comment their expertise And most importantly of all by far I will end with one thing I LIKE THIS STOCK

Home Depot short term and long term and thought they would beat earnings I m for sure disappointed but I still see the long term value in it Quick Things I m looking for today Powell s speech Quick Thoughts Companies that sell luxury goods that hold their value are hot right now People are scared of inflation and of the stock market This is old news at this point So they re looking for other investments even if it doesn t go up in value it just needs to beat inflation Anything that can make them get rid of their dollars They re not too happy with gold for some reason I explain this in the next section They re trying their hands with beatc01n but that can be a bit risky and too new for some people old people mostly So how about alternative investments Watches wine pens whiskeys sneakers even pok mon cards Anything for the love of god take my god damn money Oh and when I say people I m mostly talking about rich people or anybody with enough disposable income to worry about this stuff It happens a lot in the US and in Europe but a place where it might happen much more than usual is China You see China has this terrible habit of devaluying their own currency This helps with exports and with reducing unemployment But lately they couldn t keep up with the US USA Number One with the trillions poured into the economy So right now China s Yuan is pretty valuable in comparison with the dollar But this will not stay that way or at least the Chinese government will do everyting in their power to not let that happen It needs a good economy low unemployment and overall satisfaction of their population or else their power are in danger And the devaluation of their currency is one of the sure very easy ways of doing so So if I was Chinese I m not I m a martian hiding behind a rock because I ve seen an alien coming out of its spaceship but if I was Chinese I would buy a lot of watches or anything americans do I say If I was Chinese but again it s really if I had a lot of disposable income and want to diversify my assets to hedge against inflation and currency risks and Chinese people are just a more extreme case of this So yeah anyway nice story to say that companies that sell luxury goods that hold their value are hot right now because People want to put their money somewhere really anywhere Chinese people want to buy US luxury goods to hedge against the devaluation of their currency Rich people want to buy stuff that hold their value without the risk of the stock market A lot of rich people made money during the pandemic and don t know where to put it A lot of people are bored and shopping for anything cool luxury goods being one of those things Might want to short gold Gold has been for decades the best hedge against inflation and stock market risks That s because it s decorrelated from any currency dollar euro yen or the swedish krona if that s what you re into because there s a fixed supply of it by gold mining companies and because a lot of it is stored safely in Central Banks reserves The price of gold is not too volatile either so it s the perfect hedge to diversify a bit Any metal are viewed as an hedge but gold became the standard for it That s because a lot of currencies were using the gold standard Not only that drove Central Banks to store a lot of gold and keep it even after they switched to the monetary system we know now Money printer brrr and all that but that safety feeling that gold had back then stayed in the minds of a lot of people What kept that feeling alive even further was that it s a tangible asset that had a real world use not just a piece of paper that holds value just because some big entity said so So all that to say Gold is a good hedge against the market and inflation Except right now investors don t want to touch it that much even when the risks are as high as ever So why Well Let s explore those reasons a bit Before that I want to give a few disclaimers First not financial advice but also this is mostly speculations While we can have a good idea as to why the market behaves the way it does gold is mostly driven by the sentiment of a lot of very different investors with very different perspective strategies and personal risk tolerance The stock market and other commodities are like that too but fundamentals play a much bigger role for them Gold on the other hand is mostly a speculative asset So that s for the warnings Now let s see what those reasons are First gold went up a lot at the beginning of 2020 From 1 500 in March to 2 000 in August That s a nice 33 increase in an insane bull market People were eager to put their money in any asset mostly the stock market but gold was nice too But in August gold became overvalued and signs started to appear that this bullish sentiment was not sustainable Add to that the fact that the Armageddon that investors feared in March didn t actually happen Investors wisely switched from gold to stonks and other assets But stonks are not the only asset that was down a lot during March Oil too There was a mix of geopolitics and people staying at home so didn t need gas Anyway when all that fear calmed down investors bought a lot of oil at those very cheap prices And oil became the commodity of choice for hedging purposes Another asset was chosen beatc01n you know what I mean While it didn t have as much impact on gold as oil and stonks it still probably hurt it a little So you might say that s a nice writup buddy you re explaining the past here but you said we should short gold now so what gives Well first thanks I put a lot of effort into those posts and it s nice that it s appreciated But also all of those reasons still apply today and there s more The rising bond yields make T Bund much more attractive than gold Much lower risk with a pretty nice ROI And if institutions want bigger yields they are probably ok with buying high yield bonds since the FED and governement seem to do everything they can to keep businesses afloat Also a lot of institutions invest in beatc01n making it a more attractive and legitimate investment That drives the price higher therefore making it more attractive and so on So if there s no catalyst that shifts this bearish sentiment this slow downtrend is set to continue The biggest catalyst that I can see for gold is that America and the rest of the world there s not just america reopens but if it does then that means the economy will be much better and investors will buy stonks even more instead of gold Another small catalyst is that beatc01n becomes very risky again Institutions will sell and write off those losses Elon Musk already said he would do that with his Tesla investment They will probably buy gold again as a result So in my opinion the bear thesis boils down to stocks oil beatc01n and bonds and other assets being attractive while gold is being forgotten a bit and that might not change for a while while the bull thesis is that a catalyst might change that sentiment Ok Bye

Technologies https ibb co C6nyVHY went public in October 2020 raising more than 1 billion at a valuation of 2 8 billion 1 The company manufactures tracking systems for utility scale solar energy projects 2 Array Technologies has completed more than 900 of these projects in the past 30 years 3 Array mainly operates in the United States generating 87 of their 2019 revenue in the country More than 30 of U S utility scale solar generation uses an Array product Its second largest market is Australia at 8 of revenue 4 The company has installed its systems in 30 countries total 3 Its headquarters are in Albuquerque New Mexico 4 Products Array s primary product is the DuraTrack HZ v3 tracking system https ibb co vLccZPt The DuraTrack platform works with the company s SmarTrack software to automatically adjust solar modules in response to unique site terrain and weather conditions SmarTrack is machine learning based allowing significant adaptability 4 Note that Array s combined DuraTrack SmarTrack systems is currently its only product offering There are three main factors that influence demand for solar tracking systems 1 Levelized cost of energy LCOE Companies have no incentive to purchase tracking systems when the cost of the tracking system outweighs the value of the additional energy generation This means tracking systems are only viable in areas with high electricity costs Expanding the areas of viability requires decreasing the cost of the tracking system Array Technologies accomplishes this in a few ways Less than 1 motor is in use per MW 5 A single tracker block maneuvers 32 rows with 100 modules 5 Uses few moving parts and the design is quite simple 5 SmarTrack requires no additional sensors or hardware 6 The above design choices allow Array to provide trackers that generate the highest amount of energy possible without major tracking costs It is important to note that the most effective solar tracker on an energy basis is often not the most effective on a cost basis Array seems to effectively balance between efficiency and product cost In fact the DuraTrack system is independently verified to achieve 6 7 lower LCOE than competitors 4 2 Operation and Maintenance O amp M It is important that solar modules utilizing tracking systems have high uptimes so the cost of the tracking system is further recouped Additionally repair costs for tracking systems can make their purchase unappealing Array s DuraTrack boasts a 99 996 uptime thanks to its few moving parts 7 The DuraTrack system requires no scheduled maintenance 5 Array provides several case studies proving the product s durability including its operation in the high corrosion environment of Jordan 8 DuraTrack s durable design also includes a fully mechanical wind load mitigation system It is the only solar tracker to use such an automatic system without using sensors or electricity 4 3 Installation Labor and Costs Array Technologies lowered installation cost through 3 single bolt module clamp designs Notably the company claims its RapidClamp design requires just 11 seconds per installation Fast installation times greatly reduce the total cost of installing the DuraTrack system 7 Leadership and Ownership Ron Corio pictured https ibb co c2Sf7Fg is the founder of Array Technologies and currently serves on the board after being CEO from 1989 to 2018 4 Corio is considered a pioneer of solar tracking as he is among the first to develop such a system 20 Corio holds 10 of the company s shares and is the second largest shareholder 10 Mr James M Fusaro is the CEO of Array Technologies serving in the role since Corio s mid 2018 retirement 4 Previously Mr Fusaro served as President of Advanced Materials at Honeywell International Inc NYSE HON In this role Fusaro oversaw the 3 billion Honeywell Performance Materials amp Technology business He has also held executive roles at Avnet NASD AVT and Amkor Technologies NASD AMKR These positions all contribute to Fusaro s lengthy experience in electronics semiconductors and manufacturing He also has over a decade experience as an engineer 9 Fusaro purchased 182 772 shares of ARRY in October 2020 at 22 per share for a total cost of 4 020 984 11 In total Fusaro owns around 1 of the company 10 Institutions hold 78 of Array Technologies the largest holder is Fidelity Investments at 15 of shares Other holders include AllianceBernstein Blackrock the Bank of New York Mellon and Neuberger Berman Group at over 1 each 12 Array s stock fell in December 2020 after Oaktree Capital Management sold a significant portion of its position in the company The selling of these shares is understandable as Oaktree owned a significant percentage of Array through its subsidiary ATI Intermediate Holdings 13 Outlook and Strategy The outlook for the solar industry is very promising Solar is the fastest growing form of electricity generation in the United States Analysts project the solar industry to grow earnings 32 annually over the next five years 17 Estimations indicate U S installations of ground mounted solar generation capacity will reach a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 16 Array sees several tailwinds for the industry regulation of fossil fuels decreasing solar energy costs growing support for clean energy initiatives and accelerating deployment of utility scale batteries 4 Specific to Array s market U S installations of trackers for 1 megawatt systems are growing at a CAGR of 35 Array s products are now present on more than 1 in 4 solar modules installed in the U S to date 5 Over 50 of utility scale solar projects use tracking systems in the United States 14 Array Technologies is positioning itself to achieve more of this market share Array Technologies is executing a three part growth strategy Gain market share in the company s core U S business Array s order book increased by 31 year over year from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020 15 Expand internationally In the last nine months of 2020 the company increased its international footprint by over 50 15 Perform bolt on acquisitions As of their Q3 2020 earnings call Array is currently pursuing several acquisition targets 15 Array s existing revenues have protection through the company s patents on its DuraTrack system and components The company s linked row rotating gear drive system also has patent protection until 2030 The patent protects their single axis tracking system that uses just one electric motor to drive the rotation of multiple rows of solar modules using articulated driveline joints The patent also protects DuraTrack s wind mitigation stowing system The company believes its patents force competitors to use less efficient designs maintaining Array s competitive advantage 4 Competitors NEXTracker Inc is Array s main competitor and also the largest solar tracking company in the world NEXTracker is a subsidiary of Flex Ltd NASD FLEX after its acquisition in 2014 Flex s stock rose significantly after Array s IPO indicating NEXTracker being further priced into Flex s valuation Flex does not report individual financial data for NEXTracker in its filings This makes it difficult to perform a fundamental comparison between the two However analyzing the difference in their products provides valuable insight NEXTracker s solar trackers use one motor per row of solar panels compared with DuraTrack s one motor for several rows NEXTracker s use of more motors leads to increased cost and is one reason for Array s superior LCOE although NEXTracker s systems are more advanced technically NEXTracker is unable to switch to a single motor system because of Array s patents IArray Technologies is currently in litigation concerning an ex employee who allegedly shared trade secrets with NEXTracker in violation of a non compete agreement 4 Competitively Array s only real moat is its patents which expire in 2030 The company does have certain product advantages over NEXTracker because of DuraTrack s lower cost simplicity LCOE and wind mitigation system Array s patents on these systems will eventually expire It is also possible that competitors mirror these features without infringing on Array s patents 4 Investors should be aware of Array s low non existent moat Financials Array Technologies is working to decrease product costs while drastically increasing revenues and profits The company is already profitable with positive free cash flow The table below illustrates Array s revenues earnings and cash flows 18 Category TTM 2019 2018 Total Revenue 975 116 647 899 290 783 Gross Profit 248 141 150 761 11 555 Operating Income 171 402 83 409 61 206 Net Income 121 046 39 745 60 764 Normalized EBITA 196 502 110 692 33 203 Operating Cash Flow 141 016 386 073 11 727 Free Cash Flow 139 488 384 376 18 157 Array Technologies 2019 revenue was 647 899 000 growing 123 over 2018 Array has grown revenues 51 in the trailing 12 months Margins have increased since 2017 with the exception of a 3 increase due to COVID 19 supply chain disruptions 15 Currently gross margins are at just over 25 18 Array holds 27 14 million in cash and carries very little debt The company is not at risk of insolvency with a current ratio of 1 8 and Debt Equity of 0 03 Array is using its low debt status to pursue bolt on acquisitions and has the cash pile to do so 19 ARRY trades at ratios of 51 33 P E 5 40 P S and 2 09 PEG 18 These valuation metrics are inline or slightly higher than the industry averages of 59 32 P E 4 53 P S and 1 85 PEG 17 Fundamentally the valuation appears high but Array s extreme growth in revenue and earnings makes it seem more reasonable The company s valuation is inline with other companies in the solar industry and growing faster The mean price target for ARRY is 51 05 which translates to a 30 upside The lowest price target is 37 from Morgan Stanley NYSE MS and Credit Suisse NYSE CS The highest price target is 60 from Piper Sandler NYSE PIPR 21 Risks There are many risks to consider before investing in Array Technologies These risks include but are not limited to Array Technologies is reliant on the success of a single product Array does not have a significant if any moat Array has a high valuation due to its growth which may stop or slow ARRY is an extremely volatile stock The company releases its fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings report on March 9th 2021 Major shareholders selling could cause the stock to fall Low reviews on Glassdoor employee morale may be low following management changes

philosophers stone on making fat stacks My part 2 I feel like im doing you guys a disservice and leading you to the slaughter house if you dont crawl before you walk Hopefully I can help one of you Thats all that matters to me making one of you beautiful The basics the first frontier to making bank You can be free You can live and work anywhere in the world You can be independent from routine and not answer to anybody This is the life of a successful trader Many aspire to this but few succeed A loser reaches for the money and loses He reaches again and loses more Losers lose because the game is hard they are ignorant and lack discipline Im gonna help you lovable losers out many losers say they want to be successful but keep making impulsive trades going for the short term thrills of gambling in the markets They want to lose Psychologically they are not ready to win Bookstores are full of good books on dieting but the world is full of overweight people Psychologically they are not ready to be skinny You may base your trades on fundamental or technical analysis You may trade because of hunches about economic and political trends use inside information or simply hope This does not matter only the aftermath When you closed out a trade did you feel elated or humiliated The feelings of thousands of traders merge into huge psychological tides memories sentiment that move the markets and sets resistance the top price and support the bottom price The majority of losers spend most of their time looking for good trades Once they enter they lose control and squirm from pain or grin from pleasure They miss the essential element of winning the management of their emotions Their inability to manage themselves leads to poor money management of their accounts If you re not in gear with the markets or if you ignore that your mind is not in gear with the markets or if you ignore changes in mass psychology of crowds then you have no chance of making money Live with your eyes open to be a good trader recognize real trends and turns and not waste time or energy on regrets and wishful thinking ahem gamestop Successful trading stands on three pillars psychology market analysis trading systems and money management manage your emotions as a trader Play the crowd psychology of markets and their mood swings and you will make fat stacks Chart patterns reveal crowd behavior Mass behavior is more primitive If you understand how crowds behave then you can profit from their mood swings and avoid being swept up in their emotions Trend following indicators help identify market trends ex Force index use on daily chart is one of the best indicators for combining both price and volume into a single readable figure When force index hits a new high a given uptrend is likely to continue When force index hits a new low the bears have greater strength and the downtrend will usually sustain itself ex The Elder Ray indicator or Ray use on weekly chart measures buying and selling pressures from bulls and bears to determine which group is driving the market While oscillators show when trends are ready to reverse ex Stochasticfull it has a high degree of accuracy in indicating whether it s time to buy or sell Set it to 3 when looking at weekly charts or set it to 1 when looking at daily charts Volume and open interest reflects crowd behavior Time crowds have a very short attention span and a trader who relates price changes to time gains a competitive advantage Sentiment interest Crowds follow trends and it pays to join them when prices are moving Sentiment indicators show when it is time to abandon the crowd before a reversal Trading systems It will tell you when to buy or short and greatly increase your odds of getting big fat profits Money management if your money management is bad then a short string of losses will destroy your account Trading without proper money management is like trying to eat tide pods without dying Most of you losers cannot believe this just as medieval peasants could not believe that tiny invisible germs could kill them Place a limit order it is filled at your price or not at all When you feel eager to enter or exit the market it is often filled at the worse price or the worst possible time Dont act like a peasant who drinks from a communal pool during a cholera epidemic Be disciplined Markets need a fresh supply of losers just as builders of the pyramids needed a fresh supply of slaves Losers bring money into the markets which is necessary for the prosperity of the trading industry Wsb Brokers exchanges and advisors run marketing campaigns manipulate the media to attract more losers to the markets Part 3 will cum tomorrow Read Dr Alexander Elder books download trading view if you dont have access to oscillators or trend following indicators There you can add them to your stock charts

chair grab a tub of cheese balls change the password on your wife s IRA so she doesn t find out you dropped 20k on TLRY FEB 26 100C that literally couldn t go tits up and get ready for papa MRE to tell you a story Everyone back Great I know you Asperberger laden assholes can t read too good so I ll do my best to give you TL DRs in emoji form Skim if you wish I would amp x200B Numbers Overview amp Leadership TL DR NASDAQ RAVN Market Cap 1 5B Shares Outstanding Float 35 9M 35 4M Held by Institutions 80 07 EPS 0 61 P E 69 78 Price Book 4 63 I know numbers make some of you dizzy and I wish I didn t feel like I needed to include this but for you fellow tards that keep investing in companies that don t have products yet EPS is Earnings per Share and P E is Price to Earnings These things mean the company is actually making money Looking back the company got pretty fucked by COVID Their EPS dropped from over 1 00 in 2019 to the 0 61 listed above in 2020 but their earnings have largely recovered as of Q4 2020 0 28 in 2019 vs 0 24 in 2020 Also of note they indefinitely suspended read axed their dividends in 2020 to more aggressively invest in their growth areas Overall there s nothing exceptional about those numbers My key take aways were that unlike some other companies in the sectors Raven is in the price isn t insanely inflated The fact that over 80 is held by institutions Blackrock Vanguard and Thrivent are the top 3 holders all of whom added last quarter is also reassuring As for the leadership no one really stands out as an all star or an asshole The CEO President is a home grown dude who started at the company as an intern back around the time of Christ Everyone is about what you d expect a dude with a masters from MIT a buncha dudes with MBAs etc Bottom Line this isn t some artificial hyped up bullshit amp x200B History TL DR Let s go back in time To the time of dinosaurs 65 whole years ago when the contiguous 48 was the only 48 Some chucklefuck busts into his boss s office at the cereal factory they work at Chad GOD DAMNIT IM DONE WITH THIS SHIT HARRY MAYBE THIS BETTY CROCKER MAKING ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE SPONSORING BULLSHIT IS NOT FOR ME MAYBE I WANT TO FLY Harry Sounds good Mr Chad sir U S Navy AND MY AXE And boom A Raven baby MRE I don t understand Fuck I gotta spell everything out huh Back in 1956 a bunch of duders working at General Mills yeah of cheerios fame High Altitude Research Division broke off to form Raven Industries after their big brained leader Ed Chad Yost got a 47 000 grant from the US Navy after he built and flew a tethered hot air balloon You remember all those old ITS A UFO Nah bitch it s a weather balloon stories Turns out a bunch of those were made by our boy Ed Chad both from his time at the cereal station and from Raven itself MRE THAT SOUND LIKE AN OLD COMPANY I DONT LIKE BOOMER SHIT Yo shut the fuck up If Pfizer founded in 1849 is still around and providing little blue fat green gains you bet your undescended testies that a company like Raven can do the same But I hear you That was then this is now What s Raven done for me lately Raven Aerostar TL DR Decades later Raven still gets some of those fat military contracts Last month https www prnewswire com news releases raven aerostar and persistent systems network constellation of stratospheric balloons in comms demo 301217001 html they demoed a platform where they use a constellation of stratospheric balloons to create an on demand low cost reusable wireless networking system above battlefields or other points of interest These aren t your kids party balloons And Dorothy these aren t the wizard s balloons either They have a bunch of different types created for different things Some of these things go to the edge of space Remember that dude who drank too many redbulls and jumped out off a balloon That was Raven You remember Google Alphabets Loom project where they were going to float hot spots around the earth using balloons Yeap Raven In 2015 NASA needed to test their Supersonic Decelerator To do that they had to drop it from the edge of space Guess how they did it You bet your ass it was a big fucking balloon made by Raven Raven got a special award for that btw But that wasn t the end of the relationship In 2020 alone NASA threw 3Mil at Raven for all sorts of weird studies cosmic rays the magnetosphere atmospheric sciences seismic events on Venus they used balloons and raven for ALL that shit MRE I don t give a fuck about balloons Well you should Along with that shit above Raven s balloons have a bunch of capabilities that have yet to be fully realized simply because we don t have the technological capability to use it Lets say for example that we wanted a worldwide network of autonomous delivery drones What if there was a platform that could float around providing both a charging base and a warehouse simultaneously Amazon has already thought of doing this with blimps airships I don t want to mislead you there have been no public discussions between amazon and Raven that I ve found but I am sure that Raven would be a leading candidate to build them What if you want to carry 8000lbs of fuel up to 110 000ft and let your futuristic spacecraft or drone or whatever refuel when it gets there What if you want to go and survey an alien planet Balloons can do all that shit They can lift a shit ton of stuff for cheap they re semi autonomous and can control where they re hovering and they stay up for MONTHS at a time I get it though fuck balloons I guess Raven Aerostar also makes Military Radars and early detection systems Payload recovery parachutes think rocket parts falling back down high altitude payload drops etc Stratospheric airships Aerostats which the army keeps buying Various Dry suits and other PPE Wait Dry suits Why Raven Engineered Films TL DR You thought Raven Industries was just Aerospace and Defense Fucking Wrong Raven is a conglomerate For you smoothbrained fucks that means it s a business slaver Its a business that makes money by owning businesses that actually do work These include Raven Aerostar Aerostar International Inc and Aerostar Technical Solutions but also other shit When Raven started doing crazy shit with balloons there literally weren t companies making the materials that they needed So what did they do Started making it themselves Along with the various materials for the balloons Raven learned to make all sorts of materials Ultra thin ultra light films Check Thicc ass fiber reinforced shit Check Everything in between double check Seriously You want some shit to wrap around your plants so you re not wasting water How about shit to put over one field while another one is being fumigated What if you wanted to build a temporary structure to keep something warm while a more permanent structure was being built What if you had a shit ton of nasty ass shit that you didn t want leaking into mama earth land fills fracking water etc What if you had a fuck ton of cotton that you had farmed but if it got wet shipping bills would be 5x more expensive What if you needed to ship some veggies across the country You ever see those half built houses getting carried down the road with big ass pieces of plastic on them so you can t see in the living room What if you want to build your own living room but you got argon seeping up out of the ground Yeah All of this is Raven And I m just scratching the surface I was going to try to cover everything but fuck I still need my fingers to buy FDs Go look for yourself https ravenefd com products Then check out geomembranes https en wikipedia org wiki Geomembrane Applications And again that s just one of their products And they have all sorts of ways to do this They do blown film heh cast film sheeting laminating coating and basically anything you could think to do with large pieces of single materials So they re fucking with space military farmers builders energy and more They got flying shit beeping shit floating shit anti seeping shit Honestly it s kind of hard to stay on track writing all this Speaking of staying on track though Raven Applied Technology TL DR Yeah I get it This is long as fuck I ma keep this part short Raven one of the leaders in autonomous farming tech and precision agriculture Want to make the best possible use of some specific land and get that bitch farming itself Raven is the company to call They make and use field computers and GPS to measure with sub meter accuracy and then provide the data crunching to plan it all out They even have a software suite designed to enhance efficiency on the office side of farming businesses Also of note they acquired an autonomous agriculture startup SmartAg as well as majority ownership in another autonomous tractor startup Dot Technology Corp at the end of 2019 they acquired the rest of DOT in 2020 and have been folding their stuff into Raven s pre existing systems ever since the first revenues from this acquisition are probably just now coming to fruition with much more potential Review and Future TL DR 50 65 End of March 70 90 EoY So if you re keeping up Raven is an established company that came from at the time futuristic ideas and has recently made moves showing it s still looking toward the future At the base of this growth it already has Long standing relationships and active contracts with both the US DoD and NASA A ton of products with space and futuristic applications Ownership of production for proprietary materials used in aerospace construction farming and just about everything else Autonomous agriculture solutions and precision agriculture planning software Fuck this sounds like something Mama Cathie would like Because it is ARKQ currently owns 3 33 of RAVN and that number has been increasing Cathie has been using the past few red days to buy some shit on sale but she s also been buying RAVN at 52 week highs She s bought RAVN 4 out of the last 5 trading days excluding today or maybe not I don t have that info at time of writing I m not gonna spout some bullshit about guaranteeing it ll be in ARKX Anyone saying something is a lock is just lying to you Mama Cathie does as Mama Cathie wants and we ll all fucking like it That said I would be extremely surprised if it s not a consideration for her So where do we go from here Just like the balloons we go up Obviously Nasdaq has been doing its best to keep this bird s wings clipped the past few days but RAVN has been growing regardless at least prior to today may have finally gotten it to come down temporarily but I m not ruling out a late rally Regardless I m looking at hitting a new ATH around 50 1 7B valuation before the end of March sooner if NDX can quit being a bitch If it s added to ARKX I think 60 65 2 3B valuation could be realistic in that same time frame Because of their re found focus on growth again shown by their cutting dividends to reinvest and recent strategic acquisitions I m targeting 70 2 5B valuation without ARKX or 90 with 3 2B valuation EOY amp x200B Upcoming Events March 23rd Earnings Release March 29th First Possible date for ARKX launch assumedly the holdings will be announced by this date amp x200B POSITIONS 16 April 21 45C 20 Aug 21 50C amp x200B Note Yes I know that this a new account I have my reasons and you can go fuck yourself If you think this is bot spam well your glass licking ass probably belongs here so I guess I can t blame you Also I started writing this before the market opened and just now got back to it I didn t update any of the numbers and made very few changes Also I didn t spell or grammar check it Again fuck you e Formatting cause my brain is smooth af

instead of simply disputing the charge Tidal wave of fraud charges In the links below you will find pages of people reporting small and large fraudulent transactions I ve read 300 comments of affected people Many of them note that customer service has told them that a lot of other people are disputing similar fraud charges Moreover these charges are bizarre in their diversity of payment networks banks and workarounds that they use E g Some fraudulent charges are on prepaid gift cards Some fraudulent charges are on cards that were cancelled re sent and fraudulently charged while still in the mail Some fraudulent charges posted to cards that were closed possibly by manipulating a recurring charge mechanism Below are links to some of the data points I broke the links because my previous

bggQxARK haADas8e1JTmMKufpzXWM6RgHn7fR3I d27Ec4nrYPg amp x200B To summarize the table almost all major credit card issuing banks and almost all major credit card payment networks have been hit Mastercard has been maybe less affected Some cards have only been used once One card was never used Some cards were gift cards Some cards were cancelled and then charged when a new card was sent but before it was received in the mail One of the most interesting leads is the commenter who said this data is being shared on the dark web and he got that from a source called idx I have no idea what that is Inferences 1 This was probably not an attack on a retailer s database because many cards were only used once 2 This was probably not an attack on issuing banks since so many were affected One possible exception is BBVA since their cards were the victims of the earliest attacks and have been attacked in relatively large quantity 3 Likewise Amex and Visa are more sus than other payment networks but still not high on the list of suspects 4 Some agent that many banks and payment networks use is the most likely culprit This could be a software vendor It could be a faulty pipeline to a credit report company TransUnion Equifax Experian that is adding payment info 5 This breach is deep in the system if they are able to hit cards that are ostensibly locked and that are being sent in the mail after the first is cancelled 6 Likewise this is probably not a stale breach from long ago since the fraudsters are able to update their card info to these newly mailed cards 7 Many are reporting the same fraudulent charges e g coloadtest Angela Singleton cfxb and sumup so we know these are part of the same breach or set of breaches by the same hacker 8 The sumup charges are being sent to Brazil That s a good place for international financial crimes since Brazil does not extradite citizens Suspicions I think the most likely source of the quantity and variety of breached cards is a deep attack on a acquirer processor An acquirer is the bank that handles the transaction for the merchant Merchant acquirers are the banks that handle transaction risk Acquirer processors actually process the transactions Some banks do both for example Chase JPM Some banks do not for example Wells Fargo WFC hands off the processing to Fiserv FISV A processor is the most likely to be able to generate the kind of data needed for this attack They would see data from across many banks and payment networks They would have the ability to collect new card data after reissues and data from cards that were never used In the 2011 hack of FIS the hackers were able to get into prepaid debit card vanilla gift card data That hack led to a sustained 35 downturn in the FIS stock price I suspect a similar breach will do the same krebsonsecurityDOTcom 2013 06 fdic 2011 fis breach worse than reported I collected data below from people who only ever used their card at a very small number of retailers to get a sense of which acquirer processor is most likely to have been hacked The data is unfortunately not very conclusive https preview redd it 65ya90kc2aj61 png width 2281 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 51aadd82f159f196b5ccc483901f4878abcec3b3 There s also a possibility that there were multiple breaches and these attacks are being mixed to obscure the origin I m hoping some of you know more about the innards of the payment network system or legacy software that banks use to support it I m hoping that we can put together a case for a most likely suspect company and make a killing with our early DD amp x200B Positions I have a small quantity of OTM puts in BBVA FIS and FISV I m not ready to YOLO the account until I have more confidence the right targets are selected

for all of you on WSB If you think BB is a distraction from any other stock then scroll on past these tendies new blood https presentations akamaized net FileLibrary 1218 4 AWS BlackBerry Final Slides pdf Blackberry and Amazon Web Services just finished their webinar explaining their multi year global agreement to develop BB IVY They are addressing the undeniable need for software development in the growing and evolving automotive space in terms of apps shared mobility and software development and updates and how they can help solve and transform them TLDR Blackberry will help automakers address the security issues while delivering constant updates to a vehicles software in their infotainment system apps voice assistant capabilities and also active safety features including self driving They will also help monetize on the ecosystem of in vehicle apps and services and BB will also be a bigger giant in this space because compared to Apple or Google who want to own this information BB offers it to their OEM partner They are transforming the UI and product design of their products in cars and also working on a way of allowing customers to communicate to other endpoint destinations and operating systems not just QNX Key Points 1 Ivy benefits the whole value chain because modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components These components which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors produce data in unique and specialized formats This requires highly specific skills required to interact with this data and with BB IVY there is no need to worry about special automotive programming languages hardware variations or proprietary sensor data formats This means the developers won t need specialized or automotive software skills and the consumer driver gets more frequent feature updates allowing for better performance experience along with safety of their data 2 Data is the new Gold Oil Blackberry pivoted from phones many years ago and has had a vision to build a data analytics platform for years which they showcased at CES 2 years ago In a Bloomberg interview John Chen says that this new business model creates a recurring data business for BB This revenue stream should not be overlooked as a Mckinsey amp Co report outlined that connected cars will allow for the OEMs to monetize data from connected cars We all know that 7 10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data based services Chen explains that Amazon is interested in BB 1 QNX provides Amazon with a secure safety certified OS aka the plumbing or ecosystem Ivy will be built on 2 BB secures all endpoints in the Internet of Things 3 Potential move to provide endpoint based security platforms to Amazon Alexa Amazon delivery drones Smart stores etc What does Amazon provide BB 1 AWS experience with user interfaces 2 AWS Cloud 3 Machine learning models from AWS Management Console So what about competition Chen points out that he is not worried about Apple and Google entering the space as they also only have experience with user interfaces and but they lack experience in the OEM space with the ecosystems The leverage BB also has over them is that Google and Apple want to own the data themselves where BB would offer it to their OEM partners which is very valuable data to automakers End note The automotive space is changing rapidly as every single company is rushing to make more technologically advanced cars If you own a Tesla you are already aware how crucial the Apps Self driving Car software updates etc are all crucial to the experience of next generation cars 61 of the EV market already use QNX and soon every car will be needing more security and BB is already in 175 million cars that haven t even scratched the surface of being next gen Among Amazon Baidu and Motional Lucid motors is also on the plate and hiring a QNX specific engineer at the moment Bear s Case The opposition says that BB s revenue has yet to prove that it has grown as a software company in the automotive space One of the first disadvantages according to analysts is that it s still a small scale company compared to several of its software security competitors This will make it very difficult to compete with competitors much larger The company also hasn t proven it can consistently grow its business solely as a software company Furthermore BlackBerry stock has slowly been losing market share for years especially in endpoint management So although operations may be stabilizing as of recently analysts still see a tough path to consistent growth for BlackBerry But in my bias opinion BB has tackled many of these obstacles just this year Partnering with big names in different spaces has provided recognition new sources of revenue AND public awareness Nobody is forcing you to read BB updates and I ain t trying distract you from shit BB isn t a boomer phone company anymore educate yourselves in any stock before investing My non professional price target 20 00 is feasible and modest

Market Makers AMD Swing Trade Thesis Introduction What s poppin fellas Ape gang professor Flux here with another heater post You may know me from my AT amp T DD post which taught you how to follow unusual options flow to make some coin or from my Hut 8 DD post which taught you how to make money using financial arbitrage amp nbsp Today we re going to be learning how to identify optimal entry and exit prices for our trades by analyzing simple charts and spotting trends This will be done using the chart for my favourite ticker AMD To all you illiterate paint huffing apes who dropped outta highschool and don t like learning I ve attached a TLDR at the end of the post which tells you which contracts to buy to get some free money Let s get to it amp nbsp Building The Foundation To begin let s take a look at the AMD one day chart https www tradingview com x X5hkIw6s and see if we notice anything odd or unusual Do you see anything in particular Does anything jump out at you No What about now https www tradingview com x 1DzmPafE Still nothing If you still don t notice anything that s fine these patterns can be difficult to spot initially What about now https www tradingview com x uHY32HCB As you can see from the final chart for the past year AMD has traded within very tight specific ranges I have highlighted these areas on the chart using the pink boxes As we can tell amp nbsp Box 1 Starting from mid February to mid April AMD traded within a 10 range between 39 and 49 It started at 49 went down to 39 back up to 49 down to 40 before once again going back up to 49 where it then smashed through the top of our current trading range creating a new range Box 2 Now starting from mid April going all the way until earnings in August AMD traded within a 10 range again between 49 and 59 This range was extremely tight and pronounced bouncing from the bottom of the channel up to the top of the channel seven times throughout its lifetime before smashing through the top of the channel again Box 3 August through December 74 to 87 channel This range was slightly messier but still pronounced nonetheless 6 clean bounces Smash through the top into our new range Box 4 This is where our most recent range lies with an 85 bottom and a 95 top We haven t surged out of this range in either direction so it is safe to assume we are still trading within this range How can we use this information to our advantage amp nbsp Applying our Knowledge To summarize our findings from above for the past year AMD has consistently traded within a predefined range before surging higher and entering a newer higher range These ranges have held and contained 27 different bounces without breaking Only one single trade has bounced lower than a given range but it recovered within hours Twenty seven times this thesis has held true so why the fuck would it be different on the 28th amp nbsp At this point I assume most of you glue sniffers know how we can use this information to our advantage We know that AMD trades within a tight range We know that we are currently within the 85 95 range We coincidentally also happen to be sitting right at 85 As a result we know that it is extremely likely that a bounce off of 85 is going to take place amp nbsp Since we know that 85 is likely a bottom and a bounce is likely going to take place we can enter a monthly position here and make some awesome money Personally I picked up some 03 19 90Cs as well as some 04 16 95Cs And just like that we managed to catch the literal bottom of a trade and have the opportunity to make some free money We can also use our findings to know when to exit our trade amp nbsp Extending our Knowledge Since we know we are trading in a channel we also know roughly when we can expect to exit our trades We know that the closer we get to 95 the more likely it is that we will bounce so we can plan accordingly Personally with my 90C I will look to set a stop loss when AMD is trading around 90 and manually sell out of the position if AMD manages to break 92 93 amp nbsp Even though I m a perma bull I also trade the flipside of the channel as well If I see AMD trading at 95 I ll enter a short position and play the trade on the way down In this case I set my stops a little tighter and keep a greater watch over the trade since we all know that stocks always go up Furthermore since every single channel ended with a blow off top I don t want to get caught in a random blowout and have my options expire worthless I would rather be conscientious beforehand and manage my risks accordingly amp nbsp Conclusion As you can tell we can learn a lot about the price movement of a stock by simply looking at its chart Although the AMD example was painfully simple it s also painfully effective The best part about all this is that there are dozens of opportunities like this within the market simply waiting to be discovered I hope you all learned something new today and had fun while doing so If you guys want to check out my other DDs or follow me on my socials they can all be found on my profile Discord saw this DD first I love you all and wish lots tendies upon each and every one of you amp nbsp TLDR Buy AMD 2021 03 19 C 90 and AMD 2021 04 16 C 95 amp nbsp 2 23 Update AMD held 84 50 on this brutal red day and stayed within the channel wow shocker I am extremely confident this is the bottom Feel free to scale your positions in and get some tendies
