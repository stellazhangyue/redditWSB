company Monday price prediction,In this DD I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence historical trends market valuation exponential growth and more That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name potential stocks while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane 1 What is Virgin Galactic Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is to be the Spaceline for Earth means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space This by itself doesn t give the company any value Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable However due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world 2 The market s value system Lets say hypothetically within a certain sector there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2 of the overall sector and company A contributed 79 to said subsection Now it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79 of its subsection it wouldn t be a big player as it s entire subsection consists of only 2 of the overall sector But what if I told you that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars and the runner up Company B accounting for roughly 10 of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars As I m sure you ve guessed by now this isn t hypothetical Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla Tesla A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up Why While you could ague it s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market Simply put Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason Their potential You can debate whether or not it s rational but it s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector s projected growth and the company s own potential While Tesla is the most drastic example almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly Modern Criteria Value is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector 3 Virgin Galactic s exponential potential On January 1st 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St Petersburg Florida to Tampa Florida While not realized much at the time this one flight would led to the creation of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines And now with interest in space travel at an all time high and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality one has to ask What s stopping history from repeating itself and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become As Virgin Galactic push s to make itself the number one most valuable space company past private companies like SpaceX with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks As far as Monday s flight is concerned how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday s price The main determinant in Monday s price action will be how Virgin Galactic s flight is portrayed by the media If it is portrayed poorly or average We will most likely see a rough sell off However I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole over exaggerating for attention In this case we will see a massive run on Monday with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring I hope you enjoyed reading my personal take on the overall situation regarding SPCE And I wish all of you a good evening

much in the attempt The common sense when doing DDs,Hi everyone I am a novice investor I started a year ago to get into the world of investment when it became clear to me that if I wanted some financial solvency I needed to do more than working 8h day and putting my money in an account just losing its value Since then I have tried to learn as much as I can through books articles and of course internet I am still ignorant I m not gonna lie and I still have a long way to go as long as life itself to start seeing results But that s OK It takes time a lot of time especially if investing is not your main task as in my case Nevertheless I can say that I am rather happy with what I have learnt That is why I would like to share with you a summary of what I have been able to acquire I think that as I am still a novice my point of view could be also useful for those who are still starting out like me And of course thanks also to those with more experience who can contribute with their feedback Let s get started with the guide I use for investing Before we start 1 There are certain terms that we need to remember very well First we must understand the basic principles for the accounting of a company Accounting Where can you find it What does it explain How should it be Assets Liabilities Net Equity also called Net Worth Shareholder s Equity or just Equity Balance Sheet Solvency Ability for the company to pay its debts and going though Net Equity should grow regularly Income Sales Expenses Net Income also called Net Profit or Net Earnings Income Statement Profitability Positive which can be used by the company for reinvesting paying debts or in dividends Where to find this data The EDGAR database from SEC contains every listed company along with their reports The most important ones are 10K and 10Q Remember to compare the values with the same moments during the year 10K reports annual and must include audited financial statements 10Q reports quarterly and include unaudited financial statements EDGAR Database https www sec gov edgar searchedgar companysearch html https www sec gov edgar searchedgar companysearch html 2 Also is essential to know what we are investing in Stocks can be classified as Type of Stock Description What does it suppose Growth stock When it grows faster and higher than the overall stock market Better prospects for growth in the immediate future but more risk Value stock When is priced lower than the value of the company and its assets Steadier growth over a longer term but have less risk You may ask yourself which stock is better After all both Seek solid value oriented companies in growing industries Value oriented approaches to growth investing are the best imo Analyze the company fundamentals seek value when you are buying and analyze the company s prospect to grow On the other side in the case of growth stocks buy only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where it generates sales Doing your own DD amp x200B Previous Steps The question we all do ourselves How to choose a winning stock Let s start answering first some questions 1 You never start looking to the stock tables you finish there Start informing yourself about the environment technology politics economics demographics and choose an industry that you believe will benefit Example Audi will stop manufacturing combustion cars by 2030 and focus on electric mobility Company X partners with Nvidia to open a R amp D center for DL Hospital X makes the first successful operation with a surgical robot brand XYZ You know what I am talking about 2 Once you have an industry we can start looking for companies The tedious work Only golden rule Do Not Trust only one source Get multiple views search search and search and don t base your investment on just one comment article opinion This should be obvious but we all included me have made this mistake 3 Have a company Let s start crossing points in the checklist Now it comes the serious business For a noob like me when I started reading and researching on my own I couldn t imagine the diversity of opinions and different strategies out there when analyzing the value of a stock In fact I was surprised to see so many people though that is virtually impossible to get ahead of the market since a company s real value is and will be always reflected by its current stock price and nowadays news and therefore the economy travel so fast that every time something good or bad happens for a company it will be already reflected in the stock In the end there are many multiple variables that affect the price Not only technical you have hype hedge funds market manipulation and other thousand factors that I neither understand nor have any control over In the end I came to the conclusion that one has to fight with one s own weapons Obviously you re never going to outperform an investor who works 10 hours a day but you don t need to be one either In the same way that you don t need to be a professional cook to make a fucking good lasagna Assuming that the lottery of timing the market is almost impossible we can still do a lot of things Choosing a good healthy growing company will be always a much better bet At least doing this you will be sure that there is a reasoning for your investment you will be more confident you will follow up much more close the news related to that company industry and above at all you will have more PATIENCE to hold and ending up seeing green numbers amp x200B First Filter You want a company that gives you a yes for the following questions Is the company making more Net Income Sales Expenses than it did last year You want to invest in growing companies Are the company s sales greater than they were the year before The company needs to make money so you can make money too Is the company issuing press releases on new products services inventions or business deals You want to invest in a living company amp x200B Second Filter Are you happy so far If so let s go deeper into the details To do this follow a simple rule The 10 s rule From now own you are gonna compare values with respect to the previous one two or three years and see how the change is You want to have a company that ideally improves with a magnitude of 10 compared to the previous year Note Go to the table at the beginning if you need to remember each term and where to find it Balance Sheet Total Assets Has it grown in the last years If yes how much exactly Total Liabilities what you own debt Has it decreased in the last years If yes how much Net Equity Has it grown in the last years If yes how much exactly Income Statement Sales Total Revenue Has it grown in the last years If yes how much exactly Expenses Has it decreased in the last years If yes how much Net Income Has it grown in the last years If yes how much exactly Here you need to make some numbers Just make an Excel where you can put the values for each year do the math and see if is actually improving Did you get a yes for every question Or even better almost 10 of improvement some of them Then we continue amp x200B Third Filter Let s see the ROE Return on equity It is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing the Net Income by Net Equity Because the Net Equity is equal to a company s assets minus its liabilities debt the ROE is considered the return on net assets ROE is a measure of the profitability of a corporation How much should the ROE be Exactly around 10 with respect to the previous year That would mean that the company is in good hands amp x200B Fourth Filter EPS Earnings per Share This is calculated as the company s earnings divided by the outstanding number of shares In other words it indicates how much money the company makes for each share of its stock It is normally used to estimate its corporate value A higher EPS means greater value as the company has higher profits relative to the share price P R Ratio Price Earnings Now take the price of one share and divide it by the previous EPS This is the P E Ratio In other words i t indicates how much you can expect to invest in order to receive one dollar of that s company s earnings In other sentence it tells how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings Example If the P E is 20 then the investor is willing to pay 20 for 1 of earnings All these gives you an idea about if the company is over or under valued A higher P E Ratio caused by high stock price and or low earnings suggest that investors expect higher earnings growth in the future although it may have low earnings even if that means it is over valued A low P E Ratio caused by low stock price and or high earnings indicates that the company might be undervalued and or that the company is actually doing pretty well high earnings given a low stock price In this last case it could mean that you are looking at something worth paying attention to When the P E is N A the company does not have earnings or is in loss Compare always this ratios with peer companies in the same industry group to have a reference or the P E of that market itself e g S amp P 500 P E Ratio is 15 more or less In general terms for the P E ratio you can expect the following P E N A No earnings in loss P E 1 15 The company s value should be more compared to its earnings under valued OR there is less sentiment regarding growth They are less risky investments P E 15 20 Normal value according to the growth of the market P E gt 20 The company s value should be less compared to its earnings over valued OR there is a high sentiment regarding growth They are more risky investments Are you a value stock investor Look for a P E between 10 and 25 More oriented to growth stocks Get higher But remember higher the P E Ratio higher the risk amp x200B Fifth Filter Keep doing research This was just a extremely simple guide Do you find a parameter that you don t have a clue what does it means and is very different compared to a peer company Search what it means It s difficult to be sure when you should invest in the stock but if you follow the previous steps at least you will now that you did your job You can even make an excel where you feel comfortable Import the data to have all the info at once so you can know if the company is worth investing And above all have patience You are in this game for many years If this helps at least one person it will have been worth it I hope you guys liked it and please do not hesitate to tell if you have any comment or feedback Cheers

written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don t have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn t follow the instruction manual CH 1 The History Lesson The Past Informs the Future From the moment one is born there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive Things that you need to survive as opposed to wanting When one looks at their needs versus their wants it is imperative to look at Maslow s hierarchy of needs A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die and this does not change as you grow into adulthood These are your foundational needs from which everything else can grow You need food water sleep and shelter The land is the only thing in the world worth working for worth fighting for worth dying for because it s the only thing that lasts Gerald O Hara Gone With The Wind Land is a finite resource and land in desirable areas are even more so While population density in areas ebb and flow this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb However this is not a function of only the finiteness of land but of the conceptual theory of ownership Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access such as a public park freely available to everyone Even though there are some restrictions to this common land the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust On the other hand when an individual or small unit owns land they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun common land is One for all and Private Land is All for one With that said let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis After all the house of cards fell apart for land didn t it No what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader For you see land and property are not irrational Humans are In the years leading to 2008 and 2008 itself there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices In fact I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates The first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments which meant they had no skin in the game if property values went down The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent Finally ARM loans otherwise known as adjustable rate mortgages were huge back then and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans Therefore a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month and to be clear these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments As you can imagine most of these loans went to people of color or low income families Finally these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans and packaged into investment products known as mortgage backed securities with an A rating misleading to say the least Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits After all when you have no equity in your home and you are suddenly underwater There is no reason to stay is there Ch 2 The Present Is a Function of The Past Now that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008 we can clarify why today is different The first reason and the simplest is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3 8M homes and it will take years if not almost a decade to rectify Household formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group millennials are aging into their prime home buying years This will continue for at least the next five years There is ongoing additional demand for an additional 1 2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now Homebuilding starts sit at around 1 577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data 1 https new reddit com r wallstreetbets submit ftn1 Building Permits stand at around 1 681M That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as they have been So let us go with a hypothetical Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one However there are only homes for three people available 10 people are fighting for three homes which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply Hence bidding wars start Then to add to this conundrum in the next year 1 2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home So there are 11 2 people now looking for a home but home supply has only increased to 4 4 So while supply has increased slightly relative to demand it is quite slight To add to this a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend These people either owned and sold their homes in said higher cost of living area or They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area When they move to a lower cost of living area they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard They are also fine on a net net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price most likely Additionally these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market amp x200B These people by virtue of paying all cash cannot go underwater on their home loans There will be no crash for these people Furthermore underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt to income ratio down payments and the income verification So people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home for the same fixed mortgage payment When I say fixed mortgage payment I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise Ch 3 The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low with Continued Home Appreciation Congratulations you got this far So you want to know why people can buy so much house Well that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage backed securities and treasuries as well as strong bond purchases This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3 for months now With that said the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market which is highly fragmented in the process For the last month and a half the largest wholesale lender United Wholesale Mortgage has been price matching 15 competitors 2 https new reddit com r wallstreetbets submit ftn2 Rocket in the meantime has made it s Broker Freedom Credit which gives a 50bps discount permanent 3 https new reddit com r wallstreetbets submit ftn3 While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage s ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023 This means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines To add to this home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4 4 in a forecast by Freddie Mac CoreLogic a property data and analytics company expects home prices to increase by 3 5 4 https new reddit com r wallstreetbets submit ftn4 Ch 4 Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners First the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement The policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower s student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment which is often lower and helps home buyers who with student debt meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA insured mortgage 5 https new reddit com r wallstreetbets submit ftn5 Secondly with the supreme court s decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria s removal by President Joe Biden there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed This added roughly 1 400 in costs to the average home borrower which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later 6 https new reddit com r wallstreetbets submit ftn6 Finally Starting on June 5 Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now Freddie Mac s version called Refi Possible is set to launch on August 30 Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80 or less than their area s median household income will qualify The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements For example borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt to income ratio as high as 65 amp x200B The FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between 1 200 and 3 000 a year or an average of 100 to 250 each month 7 https new reddit com r wallstreetbets submit ftn7 Ch 5 Forbearances are not the Armageddon As of June 25 the forbearance rate fell below 4 for the first time in a year There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U S economy is on its way to doing better 8 https new reddit com r wallstreetbets submit ftn8 The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July which the S C has permitted 9 https new reddit com r wallstreetbets submit ftn9 The reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small time landlords In the words of Brett Kavanaugh those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds Chapter 6 Owning is almost always better than Renting 1 Rent increases with inflation Your mortgage will however even if 25 years pass 2 Rent unless you live in a VHCOL area must account for the mortgage payment homeowner insurance HOA Property Taxes etcetera As a result it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later 3 You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make 4 You get beneficial tax advantages especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life 5 The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house I couldn t cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1 or 2 rule In those cases it s better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15 and you live in NYC I am sorry you are not getting a house Move to W Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars It sucks but it is what it is Ch 6 What you can do to Buy a Home 1 Step 1 Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government A lot of states have this including loan assistance with low or no interest For example Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers down payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers The total assistance is not to exceed 5 000 this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan According to the PHPA The program provides homebuyers with up to 10 000 and a minimum of 1 000 in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no interest second mortgage loan HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program 2 Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping mismatching flooring mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors terrible paintjobs termites eating at the shingles of the roof etcetera You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this The principle is like this 1 Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home s configuration run at around 220K but 2 The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above 3 The cost to improve the home runs around 5 20K which then brings your home s value to that of your neighbors look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home Again there is a youtuber for that 4 This leaves you extra cash to outbid if need be up to whatever it is to be equal Once you fix up the home have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later 3 If you need a move in ready home get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes with 2 baths etcetera If you have two kids that are on the younger side you can get a bunk bed for them and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then move up in 5 years 4 Buy in a less desirable area but with a low level of crime then work your way up while building equity in your home 5 Remember that rental properties count as income for last I checked 80 percent of the rental income If you have bought a wedge property and then reappraised you also likely removed PMI 6 Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental or a less desirable house there is less competition and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors For example a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6 real estate commission cost when he flips it 7 Alternatively just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere to be frank The End Or Out to Lunch 1

bagholders but not just any PSFE bagholder the one who is convinced he s uncovered the tutes secret moon party itinerary that they ve been planning out for months right in front of our eyes on PSFE In fact they re using the exact same playbook that they ve been using successfully for a hundred years That playbook once again comes courtesy of OG Ape Lord Richard D Wyckoff and his century old accumulation schematic As in my last post I won t ramble on with an explanation of the schematic or how it works You can find that in my initial post here https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments o9ptcy psfe wyckoff schematic and the great tendie heist You can also check out pt 2 of this saga where I discussed what I was looking for going into this past week the mysterious WSB pump and an explanation of the Wyckoff psychology here https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments od73un psfe wyckoff pt 2 the dark night of the diamond To those who read my last post I hope you re feeling positively springy To those who didn t that s okay I ll make it simple for you The point of the Wyckoff accumulation structure is to illustrate an age old way in which institutions like to accumulate a ton of shares as cheap as possible without alerting the masses to their strategy and risking having to chase the price up How do they do it By poaching retail stop losses panic sellers liquidity any chance they get and demoralizing them through frequent false breakouts As a PSFE holder who has watched this thing day in and day out for months Check and check PREFACE Honestly I wasn t sure a pt 3 would be necessary at least until we ended up closer to the end of the structure or behind the Wendy s dumpster which always remains a distinct possibility However we gained a lot of information this week that further validated what I had laid out in pt 2 and which I think you might be interested in reading My position 2009 15 21 and 30 August 12c so far and a few up the chain for July for good measure and because they ve already been eaten alive so why sell lol Okay now on to an update of where I see us in the schematic RECAP When last we talked PSFE had begun steadily coming back down from our 10 day following a suspicious pump on WSB that I do believe was an orchestrated attempt by the whales to generate more bagholders and in turn panic sellers Remember they want every last paper hand shaken out of this channel so that when they give the signal for liftoff they can be certain that all liquidity has been drained giving them a cement floor and a cabin full of all their big money friends and only the most battle tested diamond hands They need to know that they ve bought up all that they can and need to for a successful launch Here s our chart going into this past week as well as the Wyckoff schematic https preview redd it irz41es5afa71 png width 2376 amp format png amp auto webp amp s eab7a8aede022008bc5db1ec09d0582859437e5d https preview redd it

the one where institutions gradually test for liquidity at each support line just hoping that they ll find capitulating retail waiting to be robbed With each move down they would put just a little more pressure on your diamond hands begging you to bail We had already seen it start following relatively high volume institutional accumulation happening at the 12 level on 6 29 and 6 30 with 7 1 s low volume bounce off of 11 67 to close at 11 77 corresponding support 11 72 and 7 2 s low volume close at 11 42 support 11 41 No discernible panic selling or institutional unloading here What happened Tuesday and Wednesday 7 6 7 7 saw a move down into the original supply zone 11 08 11 28 on pitiful volume each with a bounce off of 11 13 and closes at 11 25 and 11 15 respectively No paper hands liquidity there either https preview redd it cn0i6deiafa71 png width 2376 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5cd92b24cf5fd8b26f12d9d7de469a4942fb40ce And then A Dream of Spring One of the hallmarks of the Wyckoff C phase is what s called the spring Not every schematic has to have one but it is the point in the structure where big money attempts one final shake out by pulling the rug out from underneath retail in an attempt to suck in every last stop loss they can before demand seizes back control These usually look like an aggressive sell off on suspiciously low volume that breaks beneath the structure and incites hopelessness the world over I had said to look out for it It could have gone all the way down past 10 23 the selling climax but it seemed to me that based on where our demand had shown up in the past it would likely see upper 10s at the lowest At last 7 8 PSFE opens all the way down at 10 81 smashing below the demand zone Admittedly it was in the midst of a brutal day in the market but surprisingly the bottom didn t fall out Diamond hands prevailed in our darkest hour and from there we would see bulls carry us all the way back to an 11 16 close while testing the bottom support of the demand zone To be honest I was hesitant to call the spring there as it was hard to discern how much of the plummet was the result of macro factors and how much was indeed that spring we were hoping for However yesterday 7 9 gave us even more information https preview redd it vyjv9pgmafa71 png width 2376 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

a192d4691fa5a17cf5f8b163f58caa4c9760704e C Phase What I would hope for following a spring would be a similar gradual test of support resistances and liquidity this time on the ascent In other words I was hopeful that we would at least reclaim 11 28 on a move up likely with some measure of volume restraint but tilted towards the bulls on rises Remember the institutions are in total control still They aren t ready to mark her up yet They just want to know that the channel is bone dry What we got A 3 move up all the way to an 11 52 close on absolutely embarrassing volume Even more interesting buying volume seemed to increase throughout the day consistent with moves up What this tells me is that not only is liquidity pretty well completely drained from the channel much of the buying pressure was actually coming out of the float and not in their secretive price pinning sort of way Great sign in my opinion Why this matters for you After this week s action I believe the darkest night for Paysafe is now behind us in terms of the Wyckoff This looks like a textbook C phase to me with the potential of today being the start of a D phase Congratulations to those who jumped in this week looking for a spring but for those who didn t I do believe the rocket is looking to be in the final stages of prepping for take off This is not me saying BUY Do your own DD It is simply me a

9e9add03c4ea2c4fd9886986c736e78e59aade13 What to watch for Within the structure it is entirely possible that we have another test of that 11 28 level to complete a C phase and then our measured move up over the top of the structure for the final test of strength or it is possible that we are now currently sitting at the beginning of a D phase We ll need to see where it goes from here to determine that I ll post again if I see the signs of a sign of strength test when we get there if anyone out there finds this content useful or at least mildly entertaining What follows the D phase The mark up This is when the rocket ship loaded to the brim with big money seek the upper reaches of the galaxy with every tailwind they can muster at our back They will aim to get it as high as they can before either re accumulating more or entering into a distribution phase where the roles are reversed and they want to sell us all a rocket ship that s run out of fuel You ll know all this when you see it

point is make your own call and obviously remember I certainly could be looking at this all wrong but it has played out in textbook enough fashion that I think it s worth continuing to hand over the plans as I see them because I like the idea of retail not losing hope and eventually crashing the moon party I m always open to feedback Also worth noting Next Friday has a good amount of open call interest starting at 12 5 which falls dead center of the supply zone 11 4 11 64 That will be an interesting level to watch I have a hard time thinking they ll cede those options unless institutions are the ones loaded up though it ll be worth seeing what happens there Further check out the section of my last post that discusses the first PIPE lockup expiry language Like I said there I personally believe they re unlocked and clearly haven t been sold though there are some who interpret that expiration as happening on Monday July 12 It s finally going to be fun to watch the new 13Fs pouring in PSFE already had 58 11 WITHOUT Q2 purchases being reported yet We had one roll in today that I expect to be the first of many It s also interesting to note that Fintel Pro lists a float of only 146 7m before subtracting the 22 67m 15 45 of float shares shorted Yes that 146 7m is awfully close to the initial number given for public shareholders when PSFE went public and I don t have a way that I know of to go back and see when Fintel has that number starting but I feel it s worth mentioning here merely with the intention of saying I do believe this PSFE has a massive float argument is unfounded which can be corroborated imo by some of the extreme price control and volatility on low volume within a channel that some sites still list as having an enormous float This Fintel number would translate to 82 59 of the OS being spoken for including shorts FWIW Yahoo Finance now has it down at 164 47m Make your own judgement on it I ll include a picture of the Fintel Data as well as the share breakdown in the original filings so that you can make your decision NOTE The relevance of the Wyckoff analysis doesn t at all hinge on this float discussion but again I thought it was at least interesting enough to include If the float is indeed that small though it does suggest to me that the mark up phase will be all the more extreme https preview redd it bh0pmu6ldfa71 png width

6bb8aa2fdde0e1ead231ccaf58efed1696e29333 All in all safe travels apes TL DR After this week I believe even more strongly that Paysafe is playing out a textbook Wyckoff accumulation schematic where whales have been buying up every last seat for an inevitable rocket launch under our noses Further I believe we fulfilled the spring of the C phase meaning the bottom is now behind us and we re currently witnessing the gradual raising of the rocket from the subterranean bunker up to the launch pad This is not investment advice whatsoever I m just a guy on Reddit It also still isn t me begging or telling you to buy here It s just me giving you some telltale signs to look out for as you do your own DD Some have suggested waiting until you can buy into the strength of a mark up phase your call Never a bad idea especially since the hallmark of this phase of the structure is painfully low volume indicating low liquidity but I personally believe institutions have been loading this entire channel for months at these very prices All in all I think the rocket engines are being gradually powered up here Whereas there is still so far as we know 22 67m shares shorted 15 45 according to Fintel I don t consider that the important part rather I see this as an opportunity to crash a moon party big money has been planning all for themselves for months Consider climbing aboard if it suits ya If you re already aboard hodl on tight

bagholders but not just any PSFE bagholder the one who is convinced he s uncovered the tutes secret moon party itinerary that they ve been planning out for months right in front of our eyes on PSFE In fact they re using the exact same playbook that they ve been using successfully for a hundred years That playbook once again comes courtesy of OG Ape Lord Richard D Wyckoff and his century old accumulation schematic As in my last post I won t ramble on with an explanation of the schematic or how it works You can find that in my initial post here https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments o9ptcy psfe wyckoff schematic and the great tendie heist You can also check out pt 2 of this saga where I discussed what I was looking for going into this past week the mysterious WSB pump and an explanation of the Wyckoff psychology here https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments od73un psfe wyckoff pt 2 the dark night of the diamond To those who read my last post I hope you re feeling positively springy To those who didn t that s okay I ll make it simple for you The point of the Wyckoff accumulation structure is to illustrate an age old way in which institutions like to accumulate a ton of shares as cheap as possible without alerting the masses to their strategy and risking having to chase the price up How do they do it By poaching retail stop losses panic sellers liquidity any chance they get and demoralizing them through frequent false breakouts As a PSFE holder who has watched this thing day in and day out for months Check and check PREFACE Honestly I wasn t sure a pt 3 would be necessary at least until we ended up closer to the end of the structure or behind the Wendy s dumpster which always remains a distinct possibility However we gained a lot of information this week that further validated what I had laid out in pt 2 and which I think you might be interested in reading My position 2009 15 21 and 30 August 12c so far and a few up the chain for July for good measure and because they ve already been eaten alive so why sell lol Okay now on to an update of where I see us in the schematic RECAP When last we talked PSFE had begun steadily coming back down from our 10 day following a suspicious pump on WSB that I do believe was an orchestrated attempt by the whales to generate more bagholders and in turn panic sellers Remember they want every last paper hand shaken out of this channel so that when they give the signal for liftoff they can be certain that all liquidity has been drained giving them a cement floor and a cabin full of all their big money friends and only the most battle tested diamond hands They need to know that they ve bought up all that they can and need to for a successful launch Here s our chart going into this past week as well as the Wyckoff schematic https preview redd it ome0jm93bga71 png width 2376 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 7aecd98bf3e44f43676f65a0e63d5981ba306fc9 https preview redd it

the one where institutions gradually test for liquidity at each support line just hoping that they ll find capitulating retail waiting to be robbed With each move down they would put just a little more pressure on your conviction begging you to bail We had already seen it start following relatively high volume institutional accumulation happening at the 12 level on 6 29 and 6 30 with 7 1 s low volume bounce off of 11 67 to close at 11 77 corresponding support 11 72 and 7 2 s low volume close at 11 42 support 11 41 No discernible panic selling or institutional unloading here What happened Tuesday and Wednesday 7 6 7 7 saw a move down into the original supply zone 11 08 11 28 on pitiful volume each with a bounce off of 11 13 and closes at 11 25 and 11 15 respectively No paper hands liquidity there either https preview redd it 8vsynp86bga71 png width 2376 amp format png amp auto webp amp s ec5d274e0fdfecde206c909240f8ebe0b14c1f18 And then A Dream of Spring One of the hallmarks of the Wyckoff C phase is what s called the spring Not every schematic has to have one but it is the point in the structure where big money attempts one final shake out by pulling the rug out from underneath retail in an attempt to suck in every last stop loss they can before demand seizes back control These usually look like an aggressive sell off on suspiciously low volume that breaks beneath the structure and incites hopelessness the world over I had said to look out for it It could have gone all the way down past 10 23 the selling climax but it seemed to me that based on where our demand had shown up in the past it would likely see upper 10s at the lowest At last 7 8 PSFE opens all the way down at 10 81 smashing below the demand zone Admittedly it was in the midst of a brutal day in the market but surprisingly the bottom didn t fall out Diamond hands prevailed in our darkest hour and from there we would see bulls carry us all the way back to an 11 16 close while testing the bottom support of the demand zone To be honest I was hesitant to call the spring there as it was hard to discern how much of the plummet was the result of macro factors and how much was indeed that spring we were hoping for However yesterday 7 9 gave us even more information https preview redd it orgd12aabga71 png width 2376 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

ace275d46176aaae37e214829e73b2a3c4c01cb2 C Phase What I would hope for following a spring would be a similar gradual test of support resistances and liquidity this time on the ascent In other words I was hopeful that we would at least reclaim 11 28 on a move up likely with some measure of volume restraint but tilted towards the bulls on rises Remember the institutions are in total control still They aren t ready to mark her up yet They just want to know that the channel is bone dry What we got A 3 move up all the way to an 11 52 close on absolutely embarrassing volume Even more interesting buying volume seemed to increase throughout the day consistent with moves up What this tells me is that not only is liquidity pretty well completely drained from the channel much of the buying pressure was actually coming out of the float and not in their secretive price pinning sort of way Great sign in my opinion Why this matters for you After this week s action I believe the darkest night for Paysafe is now behind us in terms of the Wyckoff This looks like a textbook C phase to me with the potential of today being the start of a D phase Congratulations to those who jumped in this week looking for a spring but for those who didn t I do believe the rocket is looking to be in the final stages of prepping for take off This is not me saying BUY Do your own DD It is simply me a

auto webp amp s 0d228040be043ad4524762cec04b07e83519c78d What to watch for Within the structure it is entirely possible that we have another test of that 11 28 level to complete a C phase and then our measured move up over the top of the structure for the final test of strength or it is possible that we are now currently sitting at the beginning of a D phase We ll need to see where it goes from here to determine that I ll post again if I see the signs of a sign of strength test when we get there if anyone out there finds this content useful or at least mildly entertaining What follows the D phase The mark up This is when the rocket ship loaded to the brim with big money seek the upper reaches of the galaxy with every tailwind they can muster at our back They will aim to get it as high as they can before either re accumulating more or entering into a distribution phase where the roles are reversed and they want to sell us all a rocket ship that s run out of fuel You ll know all this when you see it Check out the volume trendline compared to the OBV on the above charts https preview redd it x5uwbbzhbga71 png width 775 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 21af7b9ecf4d2b9e9e437156fefe0b5303a5f168 The point is make your own call and obviously remember I certainly could be looking at this all wrong but it has played out in textbook enough fashion that I think it s worth continuing to hand over the plans as I see them because I like the idea of retail not losing hope and eventually crashing the moon party I m always open to feedback Also worth noting Next Friday has a good amount of open call interest starting at 12 5 which falls dead center of the supply zone 11 4 11 64 That will be an interesting level to watch I have a hard time thinking they ll cede those options unless institutions are the ones loaded up though it ll be worth seeing what happens there Further check out the section of my last post that discusses the first PIPE lockup expiry language Like I said there I personally believe they re unlocked and clearly haven t been sold though there are some who interpret that expiration as happening on Monday July 12 It s finally going to be fun to watch the new 13Fs pouring in PSFE already had 58 11 WITHOUT Q2 purchases being reported yet We had one roll in today that I expect to be the first of many It s also interesting to note that Fintel Pro lists a float of only 146 7m before subtracting the 22 67m 15 45 of float shares shorted Yes that 146 7m is awfully close to the initial number given for public shareholders when PSFE went public and I don t have a way that I know of to go back and see when Fintel has that number starting but I feel it s worth mentioning here merely with the intention of saying I do believe this PSFE has a massive float argument is unfounded which can be corroborated imo by some of the extreme price control and volatility on low volume within a channel that some sites still list as having an enormous float This Fintel number would translate to 82 59 of the OS being spoken for including shorts FWIW both Yahoo Finance and Finviz now have it down at 164 47m still a notably small number compared to MarketWatch s 491 99m Make your own judgement on it I ll include a picture of the Fintel Data as well as the share breakdown in the original filings so that you can make your decision NOTE The relevance of the Wyckoff analysis doesn t at all hinge on this float discussion but again I thought it was at least interesting enough to include If the float is indeed that small

safe travels apes TL DR After this week I believe even more strongly that Paysafe is playing out a textbook Wyckoff accumulation schematic where whales have been buying up every last seat for an inevitable rocket launch under our noses Further I believe we fulfilled the spring of the C phase meaning the bottom is now behind us and we re currently witnessing the gradual raising of the rocket from the subterranean bunker up to the launch pad This is not investment advice whatsoever I m just a guy on Reddit It also still isn t me begging or telling you to buy here It s just me giving you some telltale signs to look out for as you do your own DD Some have suggested waiting until you can buy into the strength of a mark up phase your call Never a bad idea especially since the hallmark of this phase of the structure is painfully low volume indicating low liquidity but I personally believe institutions have been loading this entire channel for months at these very prices All in all I think the rocket engines are being gradually powered up here Whereas there is still so far as we know 22 67m shares shorted 15 45 according to Fintel I don t consider that the important part rather I see this as an opportunity to crash a moon party big money has been planning all for themselves for months Consider climbing aboard if it suits ya If you re already aboard hodl on tight Tag u DarkByte

to fully vet the science behind Atreca s technology and science That would require a gt 100 page presentation in itself I will be adding some further readings at the end of the presentation for company background However I will be introducing some broad concepts so you understand the critical events around data readout that are screaming towards an acquisition This data readout could happen any day in July as communicated by Atreca s management for their lead program ATRC101 amp x200B amp x200B Table of contents What is Atreca and did it drop 50 in the recent months with a 30 50 short interest Are they trying to steal shares for cheap 1 Current state of affairs and CEO s comments during Jefferies interview on June 2nd 2 The History of departures of executives a few months before an acquisition in Biotech 3 Suspicious departure of Chief Business Officer 4 Suspicious departure of Chief Scientific Office Why is Atreca an immediate Acquisition Target 1 Merck s acquisition target Part 1 Merck s likely angling for Atreca since 2016 and now they have the cash 2 Merck s acquisition target Part 2 President of Research Dr Dean Li specific remarks 3 Seagen acquisition target 4 Significant derisking factors as an acquisition Closing Summary Further reading amp x200B Who is Atreca Atreca was formed in 2010 by Stanford researchers Their focus is to reproduce antibodies produced in responding cancer patients that bind preferentially to numerous tumor types It s done with differentiated and proprietary bar code technology that can pair and recreate both heavy and light chains to recreate a native antibody expressed by a B cell with greater than 99 998 accuracy The technology was developed originally and later exclusively licensed from Stanford by Atreca Forty Seven Inc s platform was also licensed from Stanford and with their foundational drug CD47 like atreca Forty seven was acquired for 5B by Gilead The concept of foundational drugs is described later in this presentation Their lead drug ATRC101 binds to a RNP complex acting as a flagpost initiating an innate and adaptive immune response Its a very abundant protein but tumors seem to produce their own version of this RNP complex ATRC reacted 50 of the time in 1000 s of different tumor type samples That means a 50 chance of a response as monotherapy more on combo later This specific tumor RNP happens in autoimmune disease but was unbeknownst to science in cancer prior to Atreca s discovery and unlikely to be discovered without Atreca s platform and approach Hence when validated this is a huge breakthrough foundational drug like PD1 and CD47 PD1 drugs like keytruda form 1 3 of Merck s entire revenue at 14B even though it works for only 25 of patients Its the highest revenue generating cancer and drug top 5 drugs by revenue on the planet ATRC101 is looking to enhance PD1 response work synergistically or in many cases replace PD1 entirely amp x200B amp x200B Now how did Atreca drop 50 in the recent months with a 30 50 short interest The Chief business officer left March 15 2021 followed by The Chief Science Officer on March 31 2021 right before data readout The CEO said originally that the monotherapy data readout will be in the First half of 2021 in the Q3 2020 update A few months ago he said it would be July That bred a guaranteed period of uncertainty When it was first half of 2021 originally the data could have dropped anytime As you all probably know the stock market doesn t price uncertainty well Here is a clip on uncertainty https www youtube com watch v 3LKpC opSg0 https www youtube com watch v 3LKpC opSg0 There was a note in the Q1 readout that said 2 of the 3 patients at the 10 mg per kg dose Atreca and its investigators decided out of an abundance of caution to enroll three additional patients in the fourth dose cohort 10 mg kg after the first two patients enrolled experienced rapid deterioration associated with disease progression assessed as unrelated to ATRC 101 All of the above points created a perfect storm of uncertainty creating a very high short interest 30 50 amp x200B Surely I would have heard about this company before amp x200B Well 93 5 of the company is owned by institutional investors and it IPO d in 2019 There is only a handful of biotechs with this much institutional ownership and 3 that are micro cap The other two s institutional ownership is not nearly the same caliber To that effect the real float is super tiny gt 2 million shares Here are select pre IPO e top tier biotech funds investors 1 Bill Gates

preferentially to numerous tumor types in various weaponization formats amp x200B Current state of affairs and CEO s comments during Jefferies interview on June 2nd Part 1 One thing you should know about Atreca s management like a lot of high value IP biotech s they have been EXTREMELY SECRETIVE in general two undisclosed partners and just one disclosed Xencor ESPECIALLY for the results of the trial and use the same messaging amongst when asked about trial updates since early 2020 like robots No DLT s dose limiting toxicities have been reported thus far was mentioned so the safety part seems to be covered which is the primary endpoint of the phase 1b trial Remember according to preclinical models 50 of tissues reacted in response to 2 out of 3 patients that progressed Is it possible that 1 did see an amazing response and hence FDA recommended to double verify the toxicity before adding more CEO John Orwin made a very interesting comment on June 2nd during the Jefferies conference call There could be instances where one metastasis is progressing and the other is regressing so the doctor would keep them on the drug recording unavailable so paraphrased amp x200B That is the first clue ever given of any 101 efficacy but I don t think it stops there amp x200B ATRC101 The 100 Billion Drug amp x200B Preclinical doses and tumor volume Atreca may 2021 corporate presentation https preview redd it mg5g33kfdha71 png width 583 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e2fd9b6a843827db38a338f88e5afbf43896c56e CEO John Orwin was also asked why did he enroll additional patients at 3 mg per kg and not at higher His response was that they had patient demand at 3mg per kg and that was the only approved dose at the time so instead of turning patients away they dosed them at 3mg per kg This is another blatant clue for efficacy These clues for efficacy as a mono therapy is a huge deal because if the biomarker data lines up the PD1 and Chemo combos will have closer to 75 to 90 response rate for all targeted cancer types and is not a stretch given the mechanism of action That means a 100B dollar drug 10mg kg and up are the doses that really matter as a mono therapy according to their preclinical data Please see the diagram above 0 3 mg was deemed as the lowest efficacious dose and that s what they started with but in the models tumors clearly progressed even though it was efficacious based on the diagram on the right its likely with one patient out of the 9 6 at 10mgk and 3 30 mgk saw an amazing response Maybe more amp x200B amp x200B A foundational drug poised for very high Response rates with PD1 and lower doses of chemo amp x200B According to the remarks at the 3mgk cohort expansion from in the previous slide from John Orwin on June 2nd 2021 hints at efficacy at lower doses as well Great for PD1 combo For these type of foundational drugs as President of research Dean li from Merck seems to call them what is more important is the biomarker data that aligns the preclinical data Even the first Pd1 inhibitor trials for the likes of Opdivo had to convince regulators to adapt trial to focus on Overall survival instead of resist criteria alone In Summary If no CR s etc but there is clear signs of stable disease and biomarker data that is inline with their preclinical data that still keeps them on course of a blockbuster drug which was happened with anti PD1 opdivo early trials If there preclinical data is inline with the biomarker data with are talking about 75 90 response rates or yes even higher with chemo and PD1 Chemo induces the target not all

science behind Atreca s technology and science That would require a gt 100 page presentation in itself I will be adding some further readings at the end of the presentation for company background However I will be introducing some broad concepts so you understand the critical events around data readout that are screaming towards an acquisition This data readout could happen any day in July as communicated by Atreca s management for their lead program ATRC101 This is not financial advice do your own DD amp x200B Who is Atreca amp x200B Atreca was formed in 2010 by Stanford researchers Their focus is to reproduce antibodies produced in responding cancer patients that bind preferentially to numerous tumor types It s done with differentiated and proprietary bar code technology that can pair and recreate both heavy and light chains to recreate a native antibody expressed by a B cell with greater than 99 998 accuracy The technology was developed originally and later exclusively licensed from Stanford by Atreca Forty Seven Inc s platform was also licensed from Stanford and with their foundational drug CD47 like atreca Forty seven was acquired for 5B by Gilead The concept of foundational drugs is described later in this presentation Their lead drug ATRC101 binds to a RNP complex acting as a flagpost initiating an innate and adaptive immune response Its a very abundant protein but tumors seem to produce their own version of this RNP complex ATRC reacted 50 of the time in 1000 s of different tumor type samples That means a 50 chance of a response as monotherapy more on combo later This specific tumor RNP happens in autoimmune disease but was unbeknownst to science in cancer prior to Atreca s discovery and unlikely to be discovered without Atreca s platform and approach Hence when validated this is a huge breakthrough foundational drug like PD1 and CD47 PD1 drugs like keytruda form 1 3 of Merck s entire revenue at 14B even though it works for only 25 of patients Its the highest revenue generating cancer and drug top 5 drugs by revenue on the planet ATRC101 is looking to enhance PD1 response work synergistically or in many cases replace PD1 entirely amp x200B Now how did Atreca drop 50 in the recent months with a 30 50 short interest amp x200B The Chief business officer left March 15 2021 followed by The Chief Science Officer on March 31 2021 right before data readout The CEO said originally that the monotherapy data readout will be in the First half of 2021 in the Q3 2020 update A few months ago he said it would be July That bred a guaranteed period of uncertainty When it was first half of 2021 originally the data could have dropped anytime As you all probably know the stock market doesn t price uncertainty well Here is a clip on uncertainty https www youtube com watch v 3LKpC opSg0 https www youtube com watch v 3LKpC opSg0 There was a note in the Q1 readout that said 2 of the 3 patients at the 10 mg per kg dose Atreca and its investigators decided out of an abundance of caution to enroll three additional patients in the fourth dose cohort 10 mg kg after the first two patients enrolled experienced rapid deterioration associated with disease progression assessed as unrelated to ATRC 101 All of the above points created a perfect storm of uncertainty creating a very high short interest 30 50 Surely I would have heard about this company before amp x200B Well 93 5 of the company is owned by institutional investors and it IPO d in 2019 There is only a handful of biotechs with this much institutional ownership and 3 that are micro cap The other two s institutional ownership is not nearly the same caliber To that effect the real float is super tiny gt 2 million shares Here are select pre IPO e top tier biotech

2000 antibodies that bind preferentially to numerous tumor types in various weaponization formats amp x200B Current state of affairs and CEO s comments during Jefferies interview on June 2nd Part 1 amp x200B One thing you should know about Atreca s management like a lot of high value IP biotech s they have been EXTREMELY SECRETIVE in general two undisclosed partners and just one disclosed Xencor ESPECIALLY for the results of the trial and use the same messaging amongst when asked about trial updates since early 2020 like robots No DLT s dose limiting toxicities have been reported thus far was mentioned so the safety part seems to be covered which is the primary endpoint of the phase 1b trial Remember according to preclinical models 50 of tissues reacted in response to 2 out of 3 patients that progressed Is it possible that 1 did see an amazing response and hence FDA recommended to double verify the toxicity before adding more CEO John Orwin made a very interesting comment on June 2nd during the Jefferies conference call There could be instances where one metastasis is progressing and the other is regressing so the doctor would keep them on the drug recording unavailable so paraphrased That is the first clue ever given of any 101 efficacy but I don t think it stops there ATRC101 The 100 Billion Drug Preclinical doses and tumor volume Atreca may 2021 corporate presentation CEO John Orwin was also asked why did he enroll additional patients at 3 mg per kg and not at higher His response was that they had patient demand at 3mg per kg and that was the only approved dose at the time so instead of turning patients away they dosed them at 3mg per kg This is another blatant clue for efficacy These clues for efficacy as a mono therapy is a huge deal because if the biomarker data lines up the PD1 and Chemo combos will have closer to 75 to 90 response rate for all targeted cancer types and is not a stretch given the mechanism of action That means a 100B dollar drug 10mg kg and up are the doses that really matteras a mono therapy according to their preclinical data Please see the diagram above 0 3 mg was deemed as the lowest efficacious dose and that s what they started with but in the models tumors clearly progressed even though it was efficacious based on the diagram from Atreca may 2021 corporate presentation below its likely with one patient out of the 9 6 at 10mgk and 3 30 mgk saw an amazing response Maybe more amp x200B https preview redd it 8ptwiwp1mha71 png width 583 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

the remarks at the 3mgk cohort expansion from in the previous slide from John Orwin on June 2nd 2021 hints at efficacy at lower doses as well Great for PD1 combo For these type of foundational drugs as President of research Dean li from Merck seems to call them what is more important is the biomarker data that aligns the preclinical data Even the first Pd1 inhibitor trials for the likes of Opdivo had to convince regulators to adapt trial to focus on Overall survival instead of resist criteria alone In Summary If no CR s etc but there is clear signs of stable disease and biomarker data that is inline with their preclinical data that still keeps them on course of a blockbuster drug which was happened with anti PD1 opdivo early trials If there preclinical data is inline with the biomarker data with are talking about 75 90 response rates or yes even higher with chemo and PD1 Chemo induces the target not all patients could have the target like the tumor samples suggested ie 50 It is

trials ATRC 101 is an obvious IO agent to IO agent bet Out of all of the combo trials there are some strong suitors to be acquisition targets but none of them are as derisked as Atreca in the gt 7 b price range They did more critical event deals with Velosbio and Pandion have been done the fact they have planned capital allocation gives them time to structure a partner buyout that might come with a higher price tag An Atreca acquisition completes the Merck equation with the VelosBio and Pandion modalities as described in later slides Out of the publicly partners established 2020 I don t see a

population where you can have a beachhead but also recognize that given that beachhead there are many other applications And the reason I sort of lay that out is some people talk about rare disease or precision targeted I like molecules where I can quickly find out whether I m right or wrong in a limited patient population and expand quickly Dr Dean Li https s21 q4cdn com 488056881 files doc events

world saw what happened to keytruda and they want to repeat history Fundamentally if you don t have the right target it doesn t matter what technology you put on it you re going to go nowhere So there s this whole focus of what s the right target and how to get that target When people often talk about the technology they focus on what I would call the technology around modality or the composition of matter And the critical question for that is often what can you touch with that that you couldn t touch already previously assuming that it s a really good target Dean Li https s21 q4cdn com

going to play in that space where small molecules are getting larger Those are places that you have to make a commitment but it s very important that you don t make the commitment made on the platform

acquisition would fit well Prior acquisition history and comments above allude to desire on continued platform acquisitions Dean s background and ideologies seem very similar to Tito Serafini You may laugh at this but Dean has publicly stated that you can put whatever you want on powerpoint slides but the most important thing is trust on both sides Ben Thorner Head of Business development which is in Merck Labs for which Dean li is the President said in an interview that he is most proud of acquisitions that sat harmoniously with Merck s internal efforts Atreca would be a clear acquisition that meets that criteria that would be additive to their internal pipeline with their technology platform The Seagen Case amp x200B Seagen is baker brothers largest holding and merger with Atreca would be an extremely shrewd move Atreca s CEO John Orwin said ADC s is of particular interest a few times including for the latest EphA2 candidate Merging with Seagen is a classic Baker Brothers move like they tried to do with BCRX Great Point Partners a Connecticut hedge fund that owned shares of BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc wrote a letter to the drugmakers board in February 2018 opposing a proposed merger with Idera Great Point co founder David Kroin argued that the deal appeared to favor Idera s largest shareholder who was also a significant investor in BioCryst to the detriment of other BioCryst investors He didn t name Baker Bros but the firm was the biggest Idera shareholder at the time and also held a smaller stake in BioCryst https www bloomberg com news articles 2019 11 01 baker brothers turn biotech prowess into a 3 8 billion fortune https www bloomberg com news articles 2019 11 01 baker brothers turn biotech prowess into a 3 8 billion fortune 5C Atreca s CEO John Orwin has been on the board of Seagen even prior to joining Atreca Derisking factors ATRC 101 has many applications akin to PD 1 inhibitors Their second publicly disclosed antibody is against a validated known and potentially high value target over expressed in many many tumors that worked in prior trials i e EphA2 These trials were abandoned due to negative adverse events There is only one other program in the clinic i e Bicycle therapeutics No reactivity of toxicological significance observed in a human tissue cross reactivity study for EphA2 candidate They have 2000 antibodies that bind to tumor tissue preferentially across tumor types Based on prior data they have shown they should have a library of 120 antibodies that can be investigated in a bispecific Tcell engaging format 350 antibodies in directed killing ADCC 40 antibodies in ADC formats This technology can be used in Autoimmune diseases which is actually the lab of where the technology came from anti PD1 keytruda was also being toyed in autoimmune diseases originally The company is extremely secretive and given the way they are reverse engineering responding cancer patients they could also be holding validated assets that are in the clinic by other companies but that would require them to go head to head with later stage assets and beat that data with bigger companies which would be a bad decision Atreca platform is a competitor to Abcellera and many others in the Antibody Repitoire Sequencing arena They act as a service providers with market caps of 5 10B Atreca is the best at what they do and their antibody library partnerships candidates prove so Summary ATRC 101 is a foundational drug where the biomarker activity is more important than actual responses like former PD1 trials Having said that it is likely be some amazing responses and or stable diseases based on the preclinical data and the clues given by Atreca CEO John Orwin If ATRC101 is inline with preclinical data this is a 100 s of Billions USD drug John Orwin s comments allude to that CSO CBO departures are extremely suspicious and executive departure is commonplace prior to acquisition Merck has planned 9B capital stating they are looking to augment keytruda and acquire a earlier stage asset Dean li has expressed his extreme interest in good targets platforms and foundational drugs No other company or partner fits that bill On top of a foundational drug that also augments keytruda The Atreca platform would sit well with Merck s internal efforts and recent acquisitions Likely the best acquisition for Merck from 2020 partners and combo trial partners with keytruda they were all reviewed Seagen or other Mega deal is also possible Shares trade at 9 book value is 7 I believe So that s the likely downside if any 220 m cash goes till H23 24 All 6 analyst at a buy with a 27 30 PT 30 50 short interest 500 on data and 2000 is not out of question if we compare other foundational drugs BO like CD47 After all we are

how to DD a stock instead of listening to crap from motley fool or your wife BF A few apes asked me to have a crack at GME using the method So after i could finally be bothered here we go Strap yourselfs in its gonna be a long one Ill try and remember a TLDR this time and a few emojis since yall cant read Should I Buy GameStop Stock I get it some of yall are late to the party and are wondering If I still buy GameStop can I get a lambo and impress my wife gf Well look no further this is Should i Buy gamestop stock Disclaimer just like the rest of yall i got no idea what I m doing this place is a casino I m not a professional Im just an ape that knows how to read DYOR Not advice Opinion only and all that GameStop Share Price The famous GameStop Short Squeeze commenced that means started in January 2021 This initial spike sent the share price rocketing with a massive 2 741 jump over a month Insert a shit load of rocket emojis to keep them entertained Directly following the spike the share price recorrected to a price of around 44 For the dumb asses jumping in on the peak that s a drop of 91 Yikes Over the year GME has actually climbed 4 392 more rockets maybe a moon to its current valuation of 191 38 The 52 week range of the company is 3 77 483 a difference of 12711 67 To put this all into perspective an initial investment of only 1 000 at the trough of 3 77 would have been worth a life changing 127 116 7 at the peak Yeah keep dreaming apes https www carsguide com au lamborghini aventador price should of put more in Share Price Prior To The Short Squeeze Leading up to the short squeeze we can see the massive bearish trend of GameStop stock over the course of eight long hard years Investors over the course of this period saw a paper loss of 93 4 Again putting this into perspective if you threw in your lifesaving of 1 000 you d be left with measly 66 enough for a few tendies https www recipetineats com truly golden crunchy baked chicken tenders less mess About GameStop yall know what GameStop does they sell games In here scrolling with cheeto dust asking what Gamestop does you know full well what they do The Big Gamestop Short Squeeze Yeh once again yall know what happened more than i do Melvis and Citro or someshit idk HEres what happened if u forgot https www reuters com article us volkswagen idUSTRE49R3I920081028 hope that s the right link same shit anyways Dividend History Gamestop had paid a dividend since 2012 Their dividend payment was sporatic random ranging from 1 3 payments per year during this time period The company completely cut its dividend in 2020 None have been paid this year During this period the Gamestop s average dividend yield was 6 15 ranging from 3 4 to 13 9 in 2019 Gamestop was largely regarded as a dividend stock In 2019 Gamestop repurchased 34 6 million shares for 178 6 million at an average price of 5 14 per share This represented a massive repurchasing of 34 on the total shares on offer Fundamentals Based on the current market cap of GameStop the stock seems largely overvalued no shit The last EPS of the company represented a loss equivalent to 1 78 per share Based on the last previous profitable period the company is still massively overvalued in terms of earnings multiples with a theoretical PE of 503 63 Prior to the short squeeze the standard PE for GameStop appeared largely undervalued averaging around 10x Gamestop shares are supported by 5 60 in net tangible assets At the current price of 191 38 this only represents 2 92 whereas a standard amount would often be around 20 or higher Income Statement GameStop s revenues have been on a downwards trajectory since 2018 In 2020 the company realized revenues of 5 Billion a 21 3 drop from 2019 This year Gamestop again ended up with a Net Loss of 215 3 Million which has slightly improved from the following two years mostly due to a reduction in expenses and the closing of stores GameStop has operated at an operating loss since 2018 we have seen sales declining year on year I see this linked to the downfall of brick and mortar stores as customers switch to the convenience of online digital retailers Balance Sheet GameStop does maintain a very strong balance sheet with 508 5 Million cash on hand Their total assets as of January 2021 were 2 472 Billion This largely comprised of 508M in cash 602M in inventories 201M in property and 662M in operating lease right of use assets Overall Liabilities were 2 36 Billion thus leaving 436 7 Million in net assets Technicals The general consensus within the Technical Analysis community is currently Bearish on GME Stock The moving averages and Technical Indicators seem to indicate a Sell Supports Resistance and Moving Averages Just draw a few random lines on chart arrows up or soenthign they ll love it GME is currently trading below its moving averages signifying a bearish pattern It is approaching its first level of support at a share price of 159 21 The price seems to be well supported at 159 21 and 104 27 Its level of resistance is relatively high at a price of 306 87 Around 60 5 above the current share price Insider Trading And Ownership GameStop has a large proportion of insider ownership at 18 5 This is something we see as advantageous Having skin in the game ensures management s motives are also in the best interest of shareholders It also incentives them to grow the company s share price General Public is the largest overall holder in GME with an ownership of 44 5 Institutions own 37 Insider Trading We can see there have only been two insider transactions in 2021 Directors Grube and Fernandez Both Directors executed a sale with a combined value of 545 767 We can see from the average share price data that Fernandez sold prior to the short squeeze While Grube sold at a price of 217 78 Paper Hands Current Short Positions GameStop started their 2020 Annual Report with a bit of a warning A short squeeze due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to and may continue to lead to extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock The number of shorts has dramatically fallen since the beginning of the year At the peak 136 03 of the float was shorted compared to today whereas only 16 68 is shorted a total of 9 670 000 shares or 2 15 Billion worth is shorted This represents 16 68 of the float Given the current average trading volumes of 25 233 920 shares the market seems capable of easily accounting for all current shorts GameStop Stock In The Media GameStop has been the most discussed share of 2021 Arguably two ingredients are needed in a short squeeze 1 A significantly over shorted stock 2 Media attention Media talked about the stonk Apes bought Stonk go up Simple Future Prospects Given the current number of shorts The market is probably well equipped to facilitate the current transactions or something idk That being said a large arguably key ingredient to GameStop s success was the media attention creating a self fulfilling prophecy A Pump and Dump is possible no matter what percentage is shorted Disclaimer SEC I am not encouraging a pump and dump just pointing out the flaws in the system I Swear So i just wanted to quote one thing my mentor once said gt Number one rule of Wall Street I don t care if you re Warren Buffett or Jimmy Buffett nobody knows if the stock is going to go up down sideways or in circles Competition GameStop competes with all the other blokes ya buy your little games from like Walmart Target best Buy and online PSN XBoxes Nintendogs etc amazion The current brick and mortar stores offer a competitive advantage over GameStop due to their diversification of products We do believe that GameStop will continue to command a large portion of sales compared to brick and mortar stores I see the biggest threat to the future of GameStop is the rise in eCommerce especially direct from software publisher platforms COVID has accelerated the push towards digital gaming stores with GameStop reporting a 191 increase in global E Commerce sales to represent approximately 29 of total net sales So it is clear GameStop is adapting their business model well but likely not as efficiently as the direct digital companies A lot of their sales have increased in low margin PSN and Xbox vouchers This alongside declining sales is why it was shorted in the first place Market Size The market for new physical console video game products was approximately 18 0 billion in 2020 in the countries GameStop operates It is also estimated that the market in North America for content in digital format was approximately 26 billion in 2020 From these estimates that is a total addressable market of 44 Billion GME s sales were 5 Billion representing 11 36 of the market Prophet s Take It s no surprise that GameStop looks extremely overvalued in terms of fundamentals Gamestop is currently loss making with crashing sales The shares are supported by only 5 60 in net tangible assets which represents 2 92 of the share price Prior to the short squeeze we did see GameStop stock as very undervalued But at the end of the day who rly cares about fundamentals right At the current short interest a short squeeze is no longer a certainty I think it is important to mention that the market is unpredictable GameStop seems to be trading largely on hype making massive share price swings Obviously it s possible to make money on the swings but I see it just as likely to lose Welcome to the casino gt Speccies are just sentiment and hype TLDR Number 1 rule of wall street I don t care if you re warren buffett or Jimmy Buffett Nobody knows if the stonk is going to go up down sideways or in fucking circles Think i just wasted my time analysing soenthign that trades on hype but anyway BBBBut you re missing stuff and what about the pictures last time yall complained when i posted like 1500 words so i couldn t be fcuked throwing in all 3000 word i wrote and putting pics on reddit takes for ever ill hide a link in the comments somewhere if u feel like reading all the shit and looking at

s technology and science That would require a gt 100 page presentation in itself I will be adding some further readings at the end of the presentation for company background However I will be introducing some broad concepts so you understand the critical events around data readout that are screaming towards an acquisition This data readout could happen any day in July as communicated by Atreca s management for their lead program ATRC101 This is not financial advice do your own DD Who is Atreca Atreca was formed in 2010 by Stanford researchers Their focus is to reproduce antibodies produced in responding cancer patients that bind preferentially to numerous tumor types It s done with differentiated and proprietary bar code technology that can pair and recreate both heavy and light chains to recreate a native antibody expressed by a B cell with greater than 99 998 accuracy The technology was developed originally and later exclusively licensed from Stanford by Atreca Forty Seven Inc s platform was also licensed from Stanford and with their foundational drug CD47 like atreca Forty seven was acquired for 5B by Gilead The concept of foundational drugs is described later in this presentation Their lead drug ATRC101 binds to a RNP complex acting as a flagpost initiating an innate and adaptive immune response Its a very abundant protein but tumors seem to produce their own version of this RNP complex ATRC reacted 50 of the time in 1000 s of different tumor type samples That means a 50 chance of a response as monotherapy more on combo later This specific tumor RNP happens in autoimmune disease but was unbeknownst to science in cancer prior to Atreca s discovery and unlikely to be discovered without Atreca s platform and approach Hence when validated this is a huge breakthrough foundational drug like PD1 and CD47 PD1 drugs like keytruda form 1 3 of Merck s entire revenue at 14B even though it works for only 25 of patients Its the highest revenue generating cancer and drug top 5 drugs by revenue on the planet ATRC101 is looking to enhance PD1 response work synergistically or in many cases replace PD1 entirely Now how did Atreca drop 50 in the recent months with a 30 50 short interest The Chief business officer left March 15 2021 followed by The Chief Science Officer on March 31 2021 right before data readout The CEO said originally that the monotherapy data readout will be in the First half of 2021 in the Q3 2020 update A few months ago he said it would be July That bred a guaranteed period of uncertainty When it was first half of 2021 originally the data could have dropped anytime As you all probably know the stock market doesn t price uncertainty well Here is a clip on uncertainty https www youtube com watch v 3LKpC opSg0 https www youtube com watch v 3LKpC opSg0 There was a note in the Q1 readout that said 2 of the 3 patients at the 10 mg per kg dose Atreca and its investigators decided out of an abundance of caution to enroll three additional patients in the fourth dose cohort 10 mg kg after the first two patients enrolled experienced rapid deterioration associated with disease progression assessed as unrelated to ATRC 101 All of the above points created a perfect storm of uncertainty creating a very high short interest 30 50 Surely I would have heard about this company before Well 93 5 of the company is owned by institutional investors and it IPO d in 2019 There is only a handful of biotechs with this much institutional ownership and 3 that are micro cap The other two s institutional ownership is not

GlaxoSmithKline GSK Johnson amp Johnson s JNJ Janssen Sanofi SNY and Novartis NVS Private parterships at least 2 They have a library of 2000 antibodies that bind preferentially to numerous tumor types in various weaponization formats Current state of affairs and CEO s comments during Jefferies interview on June 2nd Part 1 One thing you should know about Atreca s management like a lot of high value IP biotech s they have been EXTREMELY SECRETIVE in general two undisclosed partners and just one disclosed Xencor ESPECIALLY for the results of the trial and use the same messaging amongst when asked about trial updates since early 2020 like robots No DLT s dose limiting toxicities have been reported thus far was mentioned so the safety part seems to be covered which is the primary endpoint of the phase 1b trial Remember according to preclinical models 50 of tissues reacted in response to 2 out of 3 patients that progressed Is it possible that 1 did see an amazing response and hence FDA recommended to double verify the toxicity before adding more CEO John Orwin made a very interesting comment on June 2nd during the Jefferies conference call There could be instances where one metastasis is progressing and the other is regressing so the doctor would keep them on the drug recording unavailable so paraphrased That is the first clue ever given of any 101 efficacy but I don t think it stops there ATRC101 The 100 Billion Drug Preclinical doses and tumor volume Atreca may 2021 corporate presentation CEO John Orwin was also asked why did he enroll additional patients at 3 mg per kg and not at higher His response was that they had patient demand at 3mg per kg and that was the only approved dose at the time so instead of turning patients away they dosed them at 3mg per kg This is another blatant clue for efficacy These clues for efficacy as a mono therapy is a huge deal because if the biomarker data lines up the PD1 and Chemo combos will have closer to 75 to 90 response rate for all targeted cancer types and is not a stretch given the mechanism of action That means a 100B dollar drug 10mg kg and up are the doses that really matteras a mono therapy according to their preclinical data Please see the diagram above 0 3 mg was deemed as the lowest efficacious dose and that s what they started with but in the models tumors clearly progressed even though it was efficacious based on the diagram from Atreca may 2021 corporate presentation below its likely with one patient out of the 9 6 at 10mgk and 3 30 mgk saw an amazing response Maybe more amp x200B https

high Response rates with PD1 and lower doses of chemo According to the remarks at the 3mgk cohort expansion from in the previous slide from John Orwin on June 2nd 2021 hints at efficacy at lower doses as well Great for PD1 combo For these type of foundational drugs as President of research Dean li from Merck seems to call them what is more important is the biomarker data that aligns the preclinical data Even the first Pd1 inhibitor trials for the likes of Opdivo had to convince regulators to adapt trial to focus on Overall survival instead of resist criteria alone In Summary If no CR s etc but there is clear signs of stable disease and biomarker data that is inline with their preclinical data that still keeps them on course of a blockbuster drug which was happened with anti PD1 opdivo early trials If there preclinical data is inline with the biomarker data with are talking about 75 90 response rates or yes even higher with chemo and PD1 Chemo induces the target not all patients could have the target like the tumor samples suggested ie 50 It is still extremely likely they are going to have a couple smashing responses based on the hints given by CEO john orwin amp x200B https

months before an acquisition in Biotech It is actually quite common for executives to leave prior to an acquisition in biotech You could call it a coincidence but it s better for all parties involved that it happens Its bad optics if key executives leave after an acquisition From a career perspective why would you take a title downgrade for a less incentive those large stock options are no longer existent at a larger org like Merck They never sell their stocks Here are some examples of prior executive departures followed by acquisitions a few months later There is a common theme especially

according to SEC filings Seems like the right thing to do if the company is getting acquired i e CBO role likely to be axed irrelevant if absorbed by a larger company If things are not going to shit as indicated in the previous slides why did she leave Suspicious Chief Scientific Officer departure Timing amp Terms of leaving subsequently joining a startup is EXTREMELY suspicious The Chief Scientific Officer Michael Norman Greenberg left his role at Atreca March 31 2021 according to SEC filings roughly 2 weeks after Chief Business Officer left His terms of leaving combined with leaving a few months before a historical data readout is extremely suspicious His shares vesting was extended by 21 months according to the separation agreement This does not seem to align with his original employment contract He joined a startup called Prellis Biologics founded in 2016 as an Executive Vice President which in itself is very suspicious He title originally stated Executive Vice President

price range They did more critical event deals with Velosbio and Pandion have been done the fact they have planned capital allocation gives them time to structure a partner buyout that might come with

they want to repeat history Fundamentally if you don t have the right target it doesn t matter what technology you put on it you re going to go nowhere So there s this whole focus of what s the right target and how to get that target When people often talk about the technology they focus on what I would call the technology around modality or the composition of matter And the critical question for that is often what can you touch with that that you couldn t touch already previously assuming that it s a really good target Dean Li https s21 q4cdn com 488056881 files doc events 2021 06 MRK USQ

for a target centric company to be very attractive based on the above statement that too being largely novel In terms of technology I think we say that we re modality agnostic but we can t do

small molecules are getting larger Those are places that you have to make a commitment but it s very important that you don t make the commitment made on the platform because platforms don t make

Transcript 2021 06 22 pdf Merck s past few acquisitions are platforms that generated products with great modalities and initial clinical data Pandion Velos Bio adc s An Atreca acquisition would fit well Prior acquisition history and comments above allude to desire on continued platform acquisitions Dean s background and ideologies seem very similar to Tito Serafini You may laugh at this but Dean has publicly stated that you can put whatever you want on powerpoint slides but the most important thing is trust on both sides Ben Thorner Head of Business development which is in Merck Labs for which Dean li is the President said in an interview that he is most proud of acquisitions that sat harmoniously with Merck s internal efforts Atreca would be a clear acquisition that meets that criteria that would be additive to their internal pipeline with their technology platform The Seagen Case Seagen is baker brothers largest holding and merger with Atreca would be an extremely shrewd move Atreca s CEO John Orwin said ADC s is of particular interest a few times including for the latest EphA2 candidate Merging with Seagen is a classic Baker Brothers move like they tried to do with BCRX Great Point Partners a Connecticut hedge fund that owned shares of BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc wrote a letter to the drugmakers board in February 2018 opposing a proposed merger with Idera Great Point co founder David Kroin argued that the deal appeared to favor Idera s largest shareholder who was also a significant investor in BioCryst to the detriment of other BioCryst investors He didn t name Baker Bros but the firm was the biggest Idera shareholder at the time and also held a smaller stake in BioCryst https www bloomberg com news articles 2019 11 01 baker brothers turn biotech

Seagen even prior to joining Atreca Derisking factors ATRC 101 has many applications akin to PD 1 inhibitors Their second publicly disclosed antibody is against a validated known and potentially high value target over expressed in many many tumors that worked in prior trials i e EphA2 These trials were abandoned due to negative adverse events There is only one other program in the clinic i e Bicycle therapeutics No reactivity of toxicological significance observed in a human tissue cross reactivity study for EphA2 candidate They have 2000 antibodies that bind to tumor tissue preferentially across tumor types Based on prior data they have shown they should have a library of 120 antibodies that can be investigated in a bispecific Tcell engaging format 350 antibodies in directed killing ADCC 40 antibodies in ADC formats This technology can be used in Autoimmune diseases which is actually the lab of where the technology came from anti PD1 keytruda was also being toyed in autoimmune diseases originally The company is extremely secretive and given the way they are reverse engineering responding cancer patients they could also be holding validated assets that are in the clinic by other companies but that would require them to go head to head with later stage assets and beat that data with bigger companies which would be a bad decision Atreca platform is a competitor to Abcellera and many others in the Antibody Repitoire Sequencing arena They act as a service providers with market caps of 5 10B Atreca is the best at what they do and their antibody library partnerships candidates prove so Summary ATRC 101 is a foundational drug where the biomarker activity is more important than actual responses like former PD1 trials Having said that it is likely be some amazing responses and or stable diseases based on the preclinical data and the clues given by Atreca CEO John Orwin If ATRC101 is inline with preclinical data this is a 100 s of Billions USD drug John Orwin s comments allude to that CSO CBO departures are extremely suspicious and executive departure is commonplace prior to acquisition Merck has planned 9B capital stating they are looking to augment keytruda and acquire a earlier stage asset Dean li has expressed his extreme interest in good targets platforms and foundational drugs No other company or partner fits that bill On top of a foundational drug that also augments keytruda The Atreca platform would sit well with Merck s internal efforts and recent acquisitions Likely the best acquisition for Merck from 2020 partners and combo trial partners with keytruda they were all reviewed Seagen or other Mega deal is also possible Shares trade at 9 book value is 7 I believe So that s the likely downside if any 220 m cash goes till H23 24 All 6 analyst at a buy with a 27 30 PT 30 50 short interest 500 on data and 2000 is not out of question if we compare other foundational drugs BO like CD47 After all we are

a stock instead of listening to crap from motley fool or your wife BF A few apes asked me to have a crack at GME using the method So after i could finally be bothered here we go Strap yourselfs in its gonna be a long one Ill try and remember a TLDR this time and a few emojis since yall cant read Should I Buy GameStop Stock I get it some of yall are late to the party and are wondering If I still buy GameStop can I get a lambo and impress my wife gf Well look no further this is Should i Buy gamestop stock Disclaimer just like the rest of yall i got no idea what I m doing this place is a casino I m not a professional Im just an ape that knows how to read DYOR Not advice Opinion only and all that GameStop Share Price The famous GameStop Short Squeeze commenced that means started in January 2021 This initial spike sent the share price rocketing with a massive 2 741 jump over a month Insert a shit load of rocket emojis to keep them entertained Directly following the spike the share price recorrected to a price of around 44 For the dumb asses jumping in on the peak that s a drop of 91 Yikes Over the year GME has actually climbed 4 392 more rockets maybe a moon to its current valuation of 191 38 The 52 week range of the company is 3 77 483 a difference of 12711 67 To put this all into perspective an initial investment of only 1 000 at the trough of 3 77 would have been worth a life changing 127 116 7 at the peak Still ain t enough for a lambo Share Price Prior To The Short Squeeze Leading up to the short squeeze we can see the massive bearish trend of GameStop stock over the course of eight long hard years Investors over the course of this period saw a paper loss of 93 4 Again putting this into perspective if you threw in your lifesaving of 1 000 you d be left with measly 66 enough for a few tendies About GameStop yall know what GameStop does they sell games In here scrolling with cheeto dust asking what Gamestop does you know full well what they do The Big Gamestop Short Squeeze Yeh once again yall know what happened more than i do Melvis and Citro or someshit idk Dividend History Gamestop had paid a dividend since 2012 Their dividend payment was sporatic random ranging from 1 3 payments per year during this time period The company completely cut its dividend in 2020 None have been paid this year During this period the Gamestop s average dividend yield was 6 15 ranging from 3 4 to 13 9 in 2019 Gamestop was largely regarded as a dividend stock In 2019 Gamestop repurchased 34 6 million shares for 178 6 million at an average price of 5 14 per share This represented a massive repurchasing of 34 on the total shares on offer Fundamentals Based on the current market cap of GameStop the stock seems largely overvalued no shit The last EPS of the company represented a loss equivalent to 1 78 per share Based on the last previous profitable period the company is still massively overvalued in terms of earnings multiples with a theoretical PE of 503 63 Prior to the short squeeze the standard PE for GameStop appeared largely undervalued averaging around 10x Gamestop shares are supported by 5 60 in net tangible assets At the current price of 191 38 this only represents 2 92 whereas a standard amount would often be around 20 or higher Income Statement GameStop s revenues have been on a downwards trajectory since 2018 In 2020 the company realized revenues of 5 Billion a 21 3 drop from 2019 This year Gamestop again ended up with a Net Loss of 215 3 Million which has slightly improved from the following two years mostly due to a reduction in expenses and the closing of stores GameStop has operated at an operating loss since 2018 we have seen sales declining year on year I see this linked to the downfall of brick and mortar stores as customers switch to the convenience of online digital retailers Balance Sheet GameStop does maintain a very strong balance sheet with 508 5 Million cash on hand Their total assets as of January 2021 were 2 472 Billion This largely comprised of 508M in cash 602M in inventories 201M in property and 662M in operating lease right of use assets Overall Liabilities were 2 36 Billion thus leaving 436 7 Million in net assets Technicals The general consensus within the Technical Analysis community is currently Bearish on GME Stock The moving averages and Technical Indicators seem to indicate a Sell Supports Resistance and Moving Averages Just draw a few random lines on chart arrows up or soenthign they ll love it GME is currently trading below its moving averages signifying a bearish pattern It is approaching its first level of support at a share price of 159 21 The price seems to be well supported at 159 21 and 104 27 Its level of resistance is relatively high at a price of 306 87 Around 60 5 above the current share price Insider Trading And Ownership GameStop has a large proportion of insider ownership at 18 5 This is something we see as advantageous Having skin in the game ensures management s motives are also in the best interest of shareholders It also incentives them to grow the company s share price General Public is the largest overall holder in GME with an ownership of 44 5 Institutions own 37 Insider Trading We can see there have only been two insider transactions in 2021 Directors Grube and Fernandez Both Directors executed a sale with a combined value of 545 767 We can see from the average share price data that Fernandez sold prior to the short squeeze While Grube sold at a price of 217 78 Paper Hands Current Short Positions GameStop started their 2020 Annual Report with a bit of a warning A short squeeze due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to and may continue to lead to extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock The number of shorts has dramatically fallen since the beginning of the year At the peak 136 03 of the float was shorted compared to today whereas only 16 68 is shorted a total of 9 670 000 shares or 2 15 Billion worth is shorted This represents 16 68 of the float Given the current average trading volumes of 25 233 920 shares the market seems capable of easily accounting for all current shorts GameStop Stock In The Media GameStop has been the most discussed share of 2021 Arguably two ingredients are needed in a short squeeze A significantly over shorted stock Media attention Media talked about the stonk Apesbuy Stonk go up Simple Future Prospects Given the current number of shorts The market is probably well equipped to facilitate the current transactions or something idk That being said a large arguably key ingredient to GameStop s success was the media attention creating a self fulfilling prophecy A Pump and Dump is possible no matter what percentage is shorted Disclaimer SEC I am not encouraging a pump and dump just pointing out the flaws in the system I Swear So i just wanted to quote one thing my mentor once said Number one rule of Wall Street I don t care if you re Warren Buffett or Jimmy Buffett nobody knows if the stock is going to go up down sideways or in circles Competition GameStop competes with all the other blokes ya buy your little games from like Walmart Target best Buy and online PSN XBoxes Nintendogs etc amazion The current brick and mortar stores offer a competitive advantage over GameStop due to their diversification of products We do believe that GameStop will continue to command a large portion of sales compared to brick and mortar stores I see the biggest threat to the future of GameStop is the rise in eCommerce especially direct from software publisher platforms COVID has accelerated the push towards digital gaming stores with GameStop reporting a 191 increase in global E Commerce sales to represent approximately 29 of total net sales So it is clear GameStop is adapting their business model well but likely not as efficiently as the direct digital companies A lot of their sales have increased in low margin PSN and Xbox vouchers This alongside declining sales is why it was shorted in the first place Market Size The market for new physical console video game products was approximately 18 0 billion in 2020 in the countries GameStop operates It is also estimated that the market in North America for content in digital format was approximately 26 billion in 2020 From these estimates that is a total addressable market of 44 Billion GME s sales were 5 Billion representing 11 36 of the market Summary It s no surprise that GameStop looks extremely overvalued in terms of fundamentals Gamestop is currently loss making with crashing sales The shares are supported by only 5 60 in net tangible assets which represents 2 92 of the share price Prior to the short squeeze we did see GameStop stock as very undervalued But at the end of the day who rly cares about fundamentals right At the current short interest a short squeeze is no longer a certainty I think it is important to mention that the market is unpredictable GameStop seems to be trading largely on hype making massive share price swings Obviously it s possible to make money on the swings but I see it just as likely to lose Welcome to the casino Speccies are just sentiment and hype TLDR Number 1 rule of wall street I don t care if you re warren buffett or Jimmy Buffett Nobody knows if the stonk is going to go up down sideways or in fucking circles Think i just wasted my time analysing soenthign that trades on hype but anyway

INTRODUCTION Here is a quick run down of Tattooed Chef and what they do They are a food company selling frozen foods products in the freezer isle at major grocery outlets Products are plant based to take advantage of vegan vegetarian and plant based food trends While products are sold in the United States production takes place in Italy Production costs are much cheaper overseas and allows for higher margins here in the U S TTCF is vertically integrated allowing for greater control of product quality and adaptation It s a new age food company clicking on all cylinders and picking up steam competing against companies of yesteryear Revenue Growth For TTCF This company is growing like a BEAST Here s some of the numbers from 2017 and on 2017 Revenue 32 5 Million 2018 Revenue 47 9 Million

where just top line revenues do not tell the whole story TTCF sells Tattooed Chef branded products as well as some private label products What are some of the most valuable assets in the world Loyal brands Tattooed Chef realizes this and for the last few years they have been solely focused on its core brand rather than private label deals Why does Coca Cola dominate the drink space for decades Because the brand is globally recognized and it s a product people trust Is TTCF there yet No Will it ever get there Maybe But so far they are on the right track to do so amp x200B HERE ARE THE GROWTH

webp amp s a8b4d87ba756ec394a7c5ba9d18ad30cc38b5fd1 As you can see branded revenue is what is really important for this company The CEO himself has publicly stated that private label revenue over time will be phased out In my opinion private label revenue is mostly irrelevant with this growth story While 50 60 and 70 revenue growth may be impressive the numbers that really matter branded products are growing well over 100 year over year Earnings amp Profitability Potential The CEO and founder of the company see information below has had a long history of running food businesses Before running public companies the businesses were ran to feed his family and live a prosperous life So Tattooed Chef is ran with the intention of being profitable AND growing rapidly For a company in its early growth stages this is very rare Most businesses regardless of the industry typically lose money hand over fist The fast cash burn usually requires companies in these early growth stages to take on debt and issue additional shares This usually leads to weaker balance sheets and diluted long term shareholder value For Tattooed Chef this is not the case Shareholder dilution is unlikely and debt is unnecessary for the ALREADY profitable business I doubt long term debt will accumulate unless a large acquisition is made amp x200B https preview redd it rlu2svcgpha71 png width 1101 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 11fe6e3696caee38cf4553493bf723f7524bda67 So far TTCF has produced minimal profits This is mainly due to them reinvesting virtually all profits back into the business for further growth The chart is more accurate for results from late 2019 and early 2020 The chart is unfortunately skewed heavily in the last few quarters due to a large tax benefit changing from S corporation to C corporation and other things such as the recent acquisition More on that later But as you can see the company can make money AND grow revenue for their flagship Tattooed Chef branded products gt 100 The hardest part of this analysis is trying to determine future profitability While profits are growing it is hard to know what type of net income and EPS numbers this company will be doing in 2026 In the chart below revenue is expected to reach 1 0 Billion annually in 2026 Forecasts this far out can sometimes be a far cry from actual results But in this case I believe it is an attainable number by 2026 The big question here is How much of that will turn into profit amp x200B Photo From December 2020 Guidance Has Been Revised Upwards https preview redd it c0mxkpilpha71 png width 801 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0dfc93fbb7a12654cd7a0f6ec275d4d402a3ac16 Food businesses generally have lower margins Once again trying to forecast net income for a company like this in 2026 is very difficult But we will use an assumption of 10 of revenue turning into net income in 2026 Margins will be higher for TTCF versus competitors such as Tyson Foods See Below A Tyson Foods for example generally turns 5 into net income TTCF could make 10 an attainable number in the next five years So assuming 10 into net income out of 1 0 Billion in revenue that means net income would be an assumed 100 Million in 2026 Here are valuation stock price estimates based on those profitability estimates The stock currently currently trades at almost exactly 20 00 as of the time of writing at 07 10 2021

trades at a market cap of 1 65 Billion For a growth company at this stage P S ratio likely a better metric to use in terms of valuation rather than P E ratio Here are the numbers for 2021 and 2022 2021 P S Ratio 6 89 2022 P S Ratio 5 11 This company is trading at 5 times next years revenue Considering the growth trajectory moving forward I would consider this to have considerable value The company also has 185 Million in cash Considering this very large cash pile relative to the company s size it makes the company s market cap a bit more attractive MERGERS amp ACQUISITIONS In May of this year Tattooed Chef announced the acquisition New Mexico Food Distributors Inc and Karsten Tortilla Factory This acquisition was approximately 35 Million The company still has 185 Million in cash as of the last earnings report This leaves lots of room for further expansions and acquisitions While only 35 Million was spent a significant amount of revenue will be generated from this acquisition We will be immediately addressing the 1 billion Frozen Mexican Food category once the transactions close At full capacity we believe Foods of New Mexico can contribute up to 200 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years and create significant value for all our stakeholders 200 Million in annual revenue for only 35 Million Sounds like a good deal to me amp x200B https preview

be found listed online in certain areas of Kroger s website Two different shareholders I have personally spoken to have been able to buy TTCF at Kroger locations This would obviously be HUGE for TTCF

numbers we talked about for Tattooed Chef branded products Well until 2021 the budget for marketing and advertising TTCF products has been 0 00 Until this year 100 of their growth has been through their own making NOT with a massive marketing budget Small TV campaigns and mobile ads are being paid for as of the last few months More importantly brand ambassadors influencers will also be sponsoring TTCF as well Now that advertising will be impacting the company I expect brand recognition to steadily increase TARGET LAUNCH IN THE LAST QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL THE CEO STATED THAT TARGET CLAIMED TATTOOED CHEF WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FROZEN FOOD LAUNCH IN THE HISTORY OF TARGET This is obviously huge for the company Target is already a big deal for this company and this level of confidence from Target is exciting BALANCE SHEET Going over everything on a balance sheet would make this already long post even longer But I have two main things on the balance sheet I would like to point out Cash as of 03 31 2021 is 185 Million Meanwhile long term debt 1 9 Million The company currently has almost no debt and is cash loaded Considering this is a company which has 1 65 Billion

an extremely competitive market The food industry will always have big money moving products in and out and competition will continue to be ruthless The many retailers TTCF has gotten into could give away the hard earned shelf space This goes hand and hand with competition risks If Target Walmart Costco etc finds a better product TTCF is at risk of losing the valuable real estate of shelf space Sam and Sarah are the backbone of the company The bulk of shares are owned by them and they are what makes the company the success that it is If for whatever reason they were to part ways with the company it is questionable how successful this business would be I believe plant based diets are a trend not a fad But if vegetarian vegan plant diets die off in popularity then Tattooed Chef would likely begin to follow suit as well Low margins are kind of the norm for food based businesses Low margins means less room for error Profits will likely remain constrained to certain levels for the lifespan of the business Inflation has been a big talk in the markets recently and rising costs of raw materials for their products could rise This could potentially hurt profitability Risk free rate of return drives valuation for all equity securities The risk free rate of return is currently at rock bottom If this were to change then stocks with profits that are future oriented would likely see their valuation contract TTCF falls into this category of valuation contraction DISCLOSURE I own 700 shares of TTCF stock at 17 21 each Over half of my net worth I own 13 calls at 20 strike for 1 55

AND ALZHEIMER S DISEASE Initial Observation Scientists noticed that individuals with gum disease chronic periodontitis were at high risk for developing dementia Ref 1 2 Porphyromonas gingivalis Pg is the bacteria that causes gum disease Big deal a bunch of people with oral hygiene problems developed Alzheimer s Disease so what Just give them broad spectrum antibiotics and problem solved Well no Broad spectrum antibiotics have been shown ineffective against Pg Pg releases molecules called gingipains virulence factors that are essential to Pg survival in a host organism These molecules make the host environment suitable for the survival of Pg by aiding in nutrient acquisition and disable certain immune defenses There are several types of gingipains Ref 3 lysine Kgp and arginine RgpA and RgpB Instead of targeting Pg itself Cortexyme CRTX developed a small molecule COR388 that targets the gingipains essential to Pg survival in human brain and gum tissue Ref 4 amp x200B COR388 Mouse Study Scientists infected the mouths of mice with Pg oral infection After 6 weeks they took brain tissue from the mice and found migrating Pg had infected the brain Ref 4 More importantly amyloid beta 1 42 AB1 42 production increased significantly after infection Ref 4 AB1 42 is the hallmark protein aggregate amyloid plaque that amyloid theory is based upon including Biogen s Aduhelm Remarkably Dominy s and Lynch s work co founders of Cortexyme shows that AB1 42 has antimicrobial effects that attempt to disrupt the membrane of Pg to kill it Most work on amyloid theory hasn t presented a causative reason for the accumulation of AB1 42 in the brain Cortexyme presents 1 an ability for oral Pg to infect the brain 2 how Pg can induce AB1 42 production 3 a rationale for why the brain would increase production of antimicrobial AB1 42 and 4 most importantly that inhibitors of Pg virulence factors can prevent death of the Gad67 interneurons of the hippocampus the part of the brain responsible for memory after Pg infection Ref 4 Cool story bro but this is one group publishing some outlandish theory Not quite Dominy and Lynch were pioneers but there have since been many peer reviewed publications from independent groups that validate these findings Ref 5 amp x200B COR388 Human Study Presence in the Alzheimer s brain An analysis of post mortem brain tissue of Alzheimer s Disease patients shows the presence of gingipains in the hippocampus region for learning and memory processing and cerebral cortex gray matter Ref 4 Further the DNA of Pg was found in the cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer s Disease patients Electron microscopy images show that gingipains are even present within neuron cells see here https www cortexyme com wp content uploads 2021 03 ADPD2021ePoster131DominyFINAL pdf https www cortexyme com wp content uploads 2021 03 ADPD2021ePoster131DominyFINAL pdf amp x200B AB1 42 Amyloid beta AB is a protein well known as a hallmark of Alzheimer s Disease The precursor protein APP can be cut multiple ways to generate various forms of AB AB1 42 is the hallmark plaque forming variety commonly associated with Alzheimer s Disease An experiment where Pg was mixed with AB1 42 showed higher levels of Pg death relative to Pg mixed with other forms of AB like AB1 40 Ref 4 In the brain tissue of Alzheimer s Disease patients fluorescent microscopy showed that intracellular amyloid aggregates and gingipains RgpB often are found in the same location Ref 4 This suggests that AB1 42 is being produced by the brain in an effort to kill invading Pg and that the build up of amyloid plaques is a potential consequence of this anti microbial response amp x200B Tau and pTau The fragmentation of Tau protein and phosphorylation of Tau pTau is a hallmark of Alzheimer s Disease Tau protein incubated with purified gingipains was subjected to mass spectrometry This showed that gingipains cut Tau at multiple sites The cells in the brain hyperphosphorylate Tau making pTau to try to prevent these cuts from occurring but the phosphorylation negatively affects Tau function Importantly there is a significant correlation between the amount of gingipains in the brain and amount of Tau Ref 4 This is an elegant causative explanation for the presence fragmentation and phosphorylation of Tau in Alzheimer s Disease progression amp x200B APOE We all carry the APOE gene There are three main types of this gene APOE2 APOE3 and APOE4 It has been repeatedly shown that people with APOE4 are at significantly higher risk for developing Alzheimer s Disease than people with APOE2 This perplexing finding has been difficult to reconcile with the other seemingly disparate hallmarks of Alzheimer s Disease like AB1 42 and pTau In an absolutely incredible experiment Cortexyme demonstrated that the gingipains released by Pg are able to cut apart ApoE4 protein much more efficiently than ApoE2 or ApoE3 Ref 6 ApoE protein is critical to many cellular functions in neurons such as lipid transport inflammation and even AB1 42 removal Even more incredibly Alzheimer s Disease patients treated with gingipain inhibitor COR388 see Phase 1 clinical trial below showed significant reduction of ApoE fragments in cerebrospinal fluid compared to control In my opinion this is an incredible finding that for the first time presents a causative hypothesis to explain both the inherent genetic risk of APOE4 carriers as well as accumulation of the hallmark biomarkers AB and pTau Poster from 2020 AAIC conference highlighting these experiments

Alzheimer s Disease is obviously the main indication for Cortexyme the company has cortex in its name However it is important to keep in mind that COR388 and the other gingipain inhibitors COR588 COR788 COR822 etc in Cortexyme s portfolio were developed out of the observation that most Alzheimer s Disease patients have gum disease COR388 seems like a good bet in the billion dollar periodontitis market and Cortexyme was clever enough to include a sub study for peritonitis in the GAIN clinical trial In my opinion this was a deft move by company s management to mitigate risk and build in a safety net for the company to fall back on if the GAIN clinical trial flops for Alzheimer s Disease Here s a very brief glimpse of what else Cortexyme has announced so far amp x200B

experiencing increased profits as a result of the China ban and have begun to retain the coins that are minted resulting a strong macro outlook for higher prices going forward in addition the GTC NAV premium is capturing a lot of the institutional demand due to the NAV premium I know the Sub s stance on Magic Internet Money that being said to properly evaluate HUT or any of the other miners for that matter as an opportunity this will necessitate a brief discussion around some of the fundamentals at play mining migration and GTC NAV in particular sources will be listed below I hope the Mods understand my intention and have mercy on my soul That being said let s take a look at a nice opportunity IMO in HUT Hut8 Mining Firstly I will touch on what the TA rrot cards is telling us 1 Bullish MACD divergence has been present since the recent low in mid late June this has been present in both the shorter term MACD yellow and the longer term MACD teal Divergences are my favorite signal bar none particularly for exits with bearish divergence 2 Short term MACD is above the zero line whilst of little consequence on it s own this does highlight the attempt to get a rally going 3 Strong volume following the up listing to the NASDAQ I would hazard a guess that there will be some decent support between the 3 4 range from investors who were on the sidelines until the US listing This coupled with the nice rebound above the 200 MA dotted white line hints at some accumulation 4 Overall the TA is leaning more towards at an attempt to enter accumulation consolidation i e there is little to suggest a strong breakout is imminent that being said the signs of accumulation are present strong uptick in volume divergences on momentum despite falling price and a rounding horizontal support resistance pattern I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS STOCK PURELY ON A TA SETUP HUT Price Basic Overview https preview redd it xa8tzy8nxha71 png width 1867 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b16abd3bf1756f7f6c95203d1cd7e7402e0d79c3 What the on chain data is telling us We have all heard that China is cracking down on mining in the country this has lead to a large contingent of the Hash rate to drop off and relocate to more favorable jurisdictions this has a two fold impact for the remaining miners such as HUT As on chain analytics Glassnode notes link below amp x200B gt Hash rate has since recovered and stabilized around the 88 to 110 EH s range reflecting an overall decline of 38 to 49 of hash power This provides a gauge on the proportion of the network that is currently offline and affected by the ban in China gt When was trading in the 50k to 60k range in April hash rate was at its peak and the aggregate mining industry saw incomes of 50M to 60M per day Whilst prices have since declined by around 50 the miners who remain operational have just seen an estimated 38 to 49 of their competition switch off in the short term amp x200B gt The daily aggregate revenue now around 25M to 30M per day but is shared amongst a smaller pool of miners Same daily TC issuance fewer competitors to share the spoils What this translates to is a decrease in competition for the miners and an uptick in the of coins minted from each block that go to the few remaining miners increased revenue DESPITE the 50 price correction amp x200B gt This implies that following the latest difficulty adjustment operational miners are incurring the same OPEX expense but are seeing profitability rise almost 2x approaching similar profitability levels to back in April The Most Important Factor Despite this uptick in profitability the China rigs will at some point come back online and negate the short term sugar high that Miners like HUT are enjoying what this does do however is help to reinforce the cash reserves of the remaining miners also allowing them to expand operations and increase hash rate and therefore share of the block rewards and revenue But what is truly the major catalyst for future price movement is highlighted in the chart below Miners Are No longer NET Sellers Into The Market gt In fact since early 2020 the macro spending behavior of miners has changed dramatically For almost all of trading history miners have consistently spent more coins than they accumulated such that unspent supply was in a structural downtrend As noted in the Glassnode report highly recommend reading one of the fundamental drivers of this shift in sentiment is the ease ing of access to finance to fund their ongoing operations rather than selling the mined coins they are able to pledge them as collateral and go into the traditional financing market to fund their operational expenses In effect miners are accumulating their mined rewards to benefit shareholders MARA for example amongst others including HUT have spoken about the benefit to shareholders of keeping the mined rewards on balance sheet akin to MSTR amp x200B https preview redd it

in TC aside from the pressures in China the tweets of a particular CEO and the natural process of profit taking during a bull run the other fundamental driver of demand is GTC and the institutional demand that comes with that Below is the GTC NAV premium plotted against the price of TC in effect whether GTC is trading at par with the assets under management AUM or whether it is trading in excess or at a discount to those assets under management 1 As you can see the GTC premium has been negative for quite sometime this means that the holdings are trading for LESS than what the spot value of those holdings are arbitrage opportunity 2 This is one of the major drivers for the lackluster institutional demand for TC as of late why would you pay spot price when you can buy at a steep discount to spot with the view that the NAV will return to par or even a premium to the AUM 3 The other driver is of course the forced selling of coins from China whereby market makers and institutional players will realize that miners forced to relocate will have to sell to raise capital for the logistical moves needed to survive therefore walking the bids down is a natural way to capture these forced sellers G TC NAV Premium https preview redd it 9pxz1590wha71 png width 1820 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 44765ac03de8e9d2dbf5ac95eadea1551ae9abfb So Why HUT The obvious question after reading this DD is Ok but why HUT in particular The answer is simple it has favorable technicals for accumulation MARA has already had a nice pop and it is not prohibitively expensive to allow for volume the above macros outlooks IMO will serve to benefit the mining sector as a whole that being said MARA or RIOT are equally valid plays on these drivers albeit they are a little more extended IMO from a technical side P S If the mods decide to remove this post so be it that being said this DD was done in good faith and to discuss these stock plays it is necessary to discus the underlying product they produce If anyone has any questions or comments let me know as this was not as in depth as I would have liked but I think it is a good jumping off point for the discussion around HUT and others as a viable trade opportunity I own 300 shares of HUT and 100 shares of MARA for those wondering currently running CCs on them to lower cost basis r thetagang represent P S Had to remove
