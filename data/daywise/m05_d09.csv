become another GME but if it reaches even 10 of the GME potential then we might have a really good play here amp x200B Chamath is one of the big investors in this stock CLOV was made public through one of his SPAC S I know lots of apes hate him sure he should have diamond handed GME But should that be the reason not to buy CLOV His track record is incredible nonetheless A little more about the investment Chamath made Short term wise he can t pull out his investment as he did with SPCE because his lock up expires in July 2021 I have to say that he wouldn t jeopardize his reputations if he thought Clover was a scam and didn t see the potentials Vivek Garipalli is the co founder and CEO of Clover Health Prior to founding CLOV he founded CarePoint Health in 2008 a fully integrated healthcare system in New Jersey He owns 83 5m shares in CLOV which is classified as class B shares which is looked until the price reached 30 for a period of 90 consecutive days In his early days he worked as an Healthcare Investment Banker at Credit Suisse he also has worked at Blackstone Group and JPMorgan Partners What is Clover Health Well it s an insurance company providing cheaper solutions for customers but with a focus on the individual In their own words Clover s Medicare Advantage plans are built on technology from the ground up Integrating our systems with doctors clinicians and nurse practitioners Clover s data team helps healthcare professionals in the field intervene directly into patients wellness to help them avoid acute health episodes The development of this software is led by the Andrew Toy the President and Chief Technology Officer at CLOV and a former Product Director from Google working with things such as Develop Platforms Develop Ecosystems and AI Machine Intelligence amp x200B What s the difference between Clover health and Original Medicare Original Medicare covers some of the costs of hospitals and doctor visits but does not cover prescription drugs or vision dental or hearing care It can have high copays and coinsurance which can lead to high costs if a beneficiary needs to go to the hospital Clover s Medicare Advantage PPO plan covers hospitals and doctor visits like Original Medicare as well as prescription coverage and additional benefits aimed at keeping members healthy all at a low cost and on an open network amp x200B Besides being an insurance company CLOV also seeks to develop the industry s best most well informed and useful physician assistant tool to empower its partners to deliver better primary care to Clover members They focus on PCPs because they are the trusted quarterback of each member s care that have the most significant impact on their care journeys Arming them with relevant patient information and data driven insights empowers them to take better care of Clover s members amp x200B https preview redd it e37rbng6xyx61 png width 853 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 041f3c92d1df4f667ea028e73f14311996e47977

term so it is highly unlikely they will sell in short term This also makes it way harder for short sellers to fully cover their short positions as they would need a lot of shares which is locked up in these mutual funds amp x200B Revenue In 2020 they made 672 9m with a net loss of 92 7m and 462 3m in 2019 with a net loss of 181 5m Revenue grew 46 from 2019 to 2020 Guidance for 2021 is 820 850m that s a YoY growth of 24 1 They expect to be fully profitable in 2023 pretty impressive Compared to the average 8 9 growth YoY in the medical insurance sector CLOV is doing way better amp x200B EBITDA may not be sexy but they can easily beat EPS for sure They will flush 44 8M gain on derivatives in Q1 officially published which can shoot up net income Also they flushed all the unnecessary expenses losses in Q4 i e IPOC and CLOV Merger legal costs etc In Q1 2020 they had a loss of 28M So this one time boost on derivatives in Q1 will beat the EPS estimate at least for Q1 Also they said they will

enrollment as of Dec 2020 increased to 66 395 enrollment as of April 2021 they released earlier in April So far this increased 14 compared to the prior year i e their revenue is also expected to increase by 14 from 166M in Dec to 189M in Mar 2021 Note that their annual guidance is 68K 70K so we are already halfway there meeting the target excluding the CMS contract in 10 states that opens the door up to 200 000 which was already approved and started on April 1 There was an email from Andrew IR guy he said that he will release at the right time Quiet period until ER so I would assume this will be released on ER If not when is Andrew ever going to release this positive news officially amp x200B As of today there are 117 open job positions on Clover Health s website Definitely a sign of growth Lowering the age of Medicare to 60 from 65 would add another 23m Americans to the TAM In money that equals around 250b more This would definitely help CLOV expand further amp x200B In 2021 the Government would open the MA enrollment period for the whole year so you can expect more people to enroll throughout 2021 April 1 2021 Clover issued an 8 K statement to correct loss on derivative from 51 1 million to 6 3 million This is a one time adjustment that occurred after Dec 31 so this will get flushed as an adjustment in Q1 This is material because considering their budgeted MCR of 92 6 Q1 profit is expected to be 13M based on high level calculations This adjustment is 4 times that of profit loss so it will boost profits substantially in Q1 and the outlook of YTD 2021 Note if you are a long term investor you shouldn t care too much about this because this is just paper profit But because analysts price target is based on the bottom line DCF this will substantially boost their price target further increase the price target So in Q1 Clover Health is expected to be in a net profit position Q1 instead of loss which is impressive for a start up amp x200B So if everything sounds so great why is the stock price 50 down from Dec Jan highs Well there s a couple of reason why Money flowing out of Growth stocks and SPACS Manipulation from short sellers Very high SI Hindenburg short report down below is a further explanation to this report The short report by Hindenburg covers some issues regarding a DOJ investigation and points out the losses over the year There s some more minor stuff besides this The DOJ investigation looks to have been sorted out they will probably announce something regarding this in the upcoming ER The losses Hindenburg is pointing out are to be expected for a newly started company and in my eyes this is nothing to worry about as the company states they will be profitable in the fiscal year 2023 In fact they already cut losses in half from 2019 to 2020 while generating 46 more revenue impressive amp x200B After the short report by Hindenburg short sellers beat the crap out of CLOV CLOV responded to this in a long report and the CEO Vivek Garipall went on a phone call with Forbes saying There is no more real person than I am about this shit he contended casting himself as an honest broker in a fucked up healthcare market during a meandering phone call And I don t care like publish whatever But don t publish stuff without people like us being able to comment and tell you what we think This is a CEO that would do anything for his company his shares are even locked up until the price reaches 30 for a period of 90 days amp x200B Next week when they release short interest info from NASDAQ Tues AH May MA enrollments and earnings May 17 PM and options expiry date on May 21 can you feel something big and positive will come in the next few weeks I sure as hell can amp x200B Macro wise NASDAQ had a little correction this

could become another GME but if it reaches even 10 of the GME potential then we might have a really good play here amp x200B Chamath is one of the big investors in this stock CLOV was made public through one of his SPAC S I know lots of apes hate him sure he should have diamond handed GME But should that be the reason not to buy CLOV His track record is incredible nonetheless A little more about the investment Chamath made Short term wise he can t pull out his investment as he did with SPCE because his lock up expires in July 2021 I have to say that he wouldn t jeopardize his reputations if he thought Clover was a scam and didn t see the potentials Vivek Garipalli is the co founder and CEO of Clover Health Prior to founding CLOV he founded CarePoint Health in 2008 a fully integrated healthcare system in New Jersey He owns 83 5m shares in CLOV which is classified as class B shares which is looked until the price reached 30 for a period of 90 consecutive days In his early days he worked as an Healthcare Investment Banker at Credit Suisse he also has worked at Blackstone Group and JPMorgan Partners amp x200B What is Clover Health Well it s an insurance company providing cheaper solutions for customers but with a focus on the individual In their own words Clover s Medicare Advantage plans are built on technology from the ground up Integrating our systems with doctors clinicians and nurse practitioners Clover s data team helps healthcare professionals in the field intervene directly into patients wellness to help them avoid acute health episodes amp x200B The development of this software is led by the Andrew Toy the President and Chief Technology Officer at CLOV and a former Product Director from Google working with things such as Develop Platforms Develop Ecosystems and AI Machine Intelligence amp x200B What s the difference between Clover health and Original Medicare Original Medicare covers some of the costs of hospitals and doctor visits but does not cover prescription drugs or vision dental or hearing care It can have high copays and coinsurance which can lead to high costs if a beneficiary needs to go to the hospital Clover s Medicare Advantage PPO plan covers hospitals and doctor visits like Original Medicare as well as prescription coverage and additional benefits aimed at keeping members healthy all at a low cost and on an open network amp x200B Besides being an insurance company CLOV also seeks to develop the industry s best most well informed and useful physician assistant tool to empower its partners to deliver better primary care to Clover members They focus on PCPs because they are the trusted quarterback of each member s care that have the most significant impact on their care journeys Arming them with relevant patient information and data driven insights empowers them to take better care of Clover s members amp x200B https preview redd it prdb60gez3y61 png width 853 amp format png amp auto webp amp

either mutual fund amp long term so it is highly unlikely they will sell in short term This also makes it way harder for short sellers to fully cover their short positions as they would need a lot of shares which is locked up in these mutual funds amp x200B Revenue In 2020 they made 672 9m with a net loss of 92 7m and 462 3m in 2019 with a net loss of 181 5m Revenue grew 46 from 2019 to 2020 Guidance for 2021 is 820 850m that s a YoY growth of 24 1 They expect to be fully profitable in 2023 pretty impressive Compared to the average 8 9 growth YoY in the medical insurance sector CLOV is doing way better amp x200B EBITDA may not be sexy but they can easily beat EPS for sure They will flush 44 8M gain on derivatives in Q1 officially published which can shoot up net income Also they flushed all the unnecessary expenses losses in Q4 i e IPOC and CLOV Merger legal costs etc In Q1 2020 they had a loss of 28M So this one time boost on derivatives in Q1 will beat the EPS estimate at least for Q1 Also they said they will increase their guidance per the linked publication https preview redd it py3kf0bgz3y61 png width 2346 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

Facts 58 040 enrollment as of Dec 2020 increased to 66 395 enrollment as of April 2021 they released earlier in April So far this increased 14 compared to the prior year i e their revenue is also expected to increase by 14 from 166M in Dec to 189M in Mar 2021 Note that their annual guidance is 68K 70K so we are already halfway there meeting the target excluding the CMS contract in 10 states that opens the door up to 200 000 which was already approved and started on April 1 There was an email from Andrew IR guy he said that he will release at the right time Quiet period until ER so I would assume this will be released on ER If not when is Andrew ever going to release this positive news officially amp x200B As of today there are 117 open job positions on Clover Health s website Definitely a sign of growth Lowering the age of Medicare to 60 from 65 would add another 23m Americans to the TAM In money that equals around 250b more This would definitely help CLOV expand further amp x200B In 2021 the Government would open the MA enrollment period for the whole year so you can expect more people to enroll throughout 2021 April 1 2021 Clover issued an 8 K statement to correct loss on derivative from 51 1 million to 6 3 million This is a one time adjustment that occurred after Dec 31 so this will get flushed as an adjustment in Q1 This is material because considering their budgeted M C R of 92 6 Q1 profit is expected to be 13M based on high level calculations This adjustment is 4 times that of profit loss so it will boost profits substantially in Q1 and the outlook of YTD 2021 Note if you are a long term investor you shouldn t care too much about this because this is just paper profit But because analysts price target is based on the bottom line DCF this will substantially boost their price target further increase the price target So in Q1 Clover Health is expected to be in a net profit position Q1 instead of loss which is impressive for a start up amp x200B So if everything sounds so great why is the stock price 50 down from Dec Jan highs Well there s a couple of reason why Money flowing out of Growth stocks and SPACS Manipulation from short sellers Very high SI Hindenburg short report down below is a further explanation to this report The short report by Hindenburg covers some issues regarding a DOJ investigation and points out the losses over the year There s some more minor stuff besides this The DOJ investigation looks to have been sorted out they will probably announce something regarding this in the upcoming ER The losses Hindenburg is pointing out are to be expected for a newly started company and in my eyes this is nothing to worry about as the company states they will be profitable in the fiscal year 2023 In fact they already cut losses in half from 2019 to 2020 while generating 46 more revenue impressive amp x200B After the short report by Hindenburg short sellers beat the crap out of CLOV CLOV responded to this in a long report and the CEO Vivek Garipall went on a phone call with Forbes saying There is no more real person than I am about this shit he contended casting himself as an honest broker in a fucked up healthcare market during a meandering phone call And I don t care like publish whatever But don t publish stuff without people like us being able to comment and tell you what we think This is a CEO that would do anything for his company his shares are even locked up until the price reaches 30 for a period of 90 days Next week when they release short interest info from NASDAQ Tues AH May

ass info from some random ass sources along with my random ass thoughts to help you make some random ass tendies Hello Everybody Echo Hello Doctor Nick It s me HewhoSleepsNot here with another fantastic product for you and I have a question for you all at the end of the post from The infamous TeB So disclaimer this is not financial advice we are not financial advisors and we are certainly not YOUR financial advisors This is a labor of love and a thought experiment I am hoping that you all will push me further in my analysis so that I become better over time These are just our personal thoughts and views based upon news shared out in the world This information is not groundbreaking but more us gathering from various sources some interesting stories news and tickers to share with the community I will note where I found the material from when I can remember or when my notes include it but some are just from memory and came from places like Twitter emails reddit etc Now lets get into it shall we From the recent articles of Fortune we have some socially conscious companies and companies that are good to work for A couple of ETF s mentioned and then one stock I pulled from this set ETFs ICLN etf focusing on clean energy should be seeing benefits from he shift towards environmental focus for at least 2 years of full dem control and 4 years of Biden TAN solar ETF same rationale as above PBW clean energy ETF same rational as above Then we have RKT Rocket Companies including Rocket Mortgage Innovation in an old field Taking care of employees exceptionally well which should pay dividends in loyalty and retention which I think is extremely valuable in the tech field During the pandemic they gave extra free time off and made it mandatory because had noticed no one was taking PTO to stay at home and twiddle their thumbs This should help morale and employee satisfaction and avoidance of burnout All 24 000 employees had shares during to prior to the IPO so they should as a majority be invested in the companies market performance personally Yahoo 1 year price target consensus of 24 75 and it was 22 65 so only a small upside at current prices I may sell a cash covered put or 3 over the next few weeks to see if can make some premiums and then possibly get a block of stock with strike of 20 or below Not sure yet I just had some cash secured puts I sold expire OTM so will be deploying that capital this week and will include my moves in my next report From Swaggy stock reads DKNG I am long DraftKings and currently very excited to be a hodler THe analysis in swaggy stated that they are a market leader with 20 40 market share varying by state or sport I forget and deleted the email so shrug I m good like that Main competitor is FanDuel who has yet to IPO followed by Barstool and BetMGM Online sports betting legalization is moving forward to help govt generate tax revenues And my sports ball boy TeB likes it for the Daily Fantasy Sports and knows people who have made line ups for over 180 days straight That is some dedication or addiction and we know addiction is great for reoccurring revenue even if it may not align with personal morals From some MarketBeat emails website articles we have some interesting news for insider trades CSX director sold 1 4 million shares at an average of 100 93 worth 142 million and now only owns 12 399 shares worth 1 2 million This could be a bad sign of the prospects of the company if directory bailed out of nearly ALL of his shares Would check other insider trades for this company before taking this to the bank though for sure FDX CEO and MMM VP both sold small blocks of share but hold much bigger blocks so probably just wanted to put some money down on a new Ski Chalet or super car From market sentiment we have some facts RKT fell 16 Thursday following 1Q revenues rising 236 and net income up 170 but the guidance of loan volume was disappointing along with worries of rising interest rates and inflations May be good entry point if you re bullish long term Or may want to do what I do and make some cash flow selling cash secured puts waiting to be assigned blocks of stocks in companies you are ultimately fine holding for year and either sitting on or selling covered calls on to keep the cash flow coming Etsy was down 13 at some point despite good 1Q results because guidance for 2Q was disappointing Corsair 6 down despite exceptional growth And finally from pits most foul the depths of my memory GDRX discount pharmacy deals makes decent money there and also making inroads into telemedicine to compete with likes of TDOC was 38 a share and Yahoo had a 1 yr target consensus of 53 Should be fine as long as Pharma system not overhauled which is certainly a concern right now AAPL quietly making acquisitions Instead of large blockbuster billion dollar buys of competitors like we see FB doing or of new areas to expand in like we see AMZN do AAPL has largely been buying smaller companies with the main goal seeming to be talent acquisition which is critical in the tech field I m sure you ve all seen the graphic comparing AirPods revenue to entire companies and man is that intoxicating The amount of product apple sells is INSANE but that s why their market cap is also INSANE I do think they have a fair chance of being the one to make one of the next big technological break throughs given their focus on talent acquisition think AI AR VR Currently have 5 7 shares and selling cash secured put for 125 after having a stock secured call getting exercised for 127 I am bullish on public storage companies and storage REITs as we have huge housing demand yet not enough supply so people maybe selling houses to capture the insane mark up but not have a place to go yet or place of same size so that s some storage business Then we have the disparity between main and Wall Street and historically public storage does well during down turns and evictions where people are unfortunately removed from their homes and have to find someplace to store their belongings I am long PSA and SAFE maybe some others but I have over 200 separate tickers and didn t spend more than a minute quickly scanning trying to find all of my tickers in this space SCI have about a grand here Cemetery s and death shit People always be dying Just had big quarter so not sure best time to buy in Yahoo 1 yr price consensus is 56 88 and currently 56 71 1 57 dividend 19 69 P E ratio AMZN I think is safe bet to keep growing and growing and growing and growing until government intervention One of my beta readers questioned why Bezos has been dumping a lot of his stock My response Cash burn at Blue Origin private space company has to be huge right now so until the flights become regular and he is actually making money on space tourism this should be the reason behind much of the sales Then again he also has access to private companies venture caps so he s investing money in companies that he thinks will be the next big thing that none of us have access too See https www cnbc com 2021 05 05 amazon ceo bezos sells nearly 2 billion worth of amazon shares html NFLX has incredible amount of IP and reach on hand DG another recession play Yahoo 1 yr target consensus is 233 12 0 78 dividend currently 216 Defensive stocks like grocery stores essential suppliers utility companies etc with dividends may be safe recession plays if think the future is not as Rosey as it looks when you re 4 corona seltzers deep and just boofed some MDMA after smoking one of them blunts dipped in resin covered in keef or wtf ever the young bloods are doing these days CLX i have some of this Clorox I think people will have germs on the mind for a while I don t know about you all but my hand washing has gone up at least 2500 since last March wish my gains matched Think this focus on cleaning will last at least a couple years post pandemic Yahoo 1 yr consensus is 191 92 and dividend of 2 46 This weeks question With American birth rates not exceeding death rates are there any stocks you think will suffer if this trend is not continued and the population of America continues to trend downwards

most unique and frightening periods in history Never have there been so many extremes in so many different areas In the last 100 years everything seems to have developed so much faster including population technology inflation debt money printing budget deficits stock bond and property prices digital money etc All of these areas are now in an exponential growth phase The final stage of exponential growth is explosive and looks like a spike that goes straight up A spike for a major sample like global population or the Dow never finishes with just a sideways move Once a spike move has finished it always results in a spike move down It seems that everything in the world is developing much faster today like computers and mobile phones or robots The world assumes that this exponential growth in so many areas will continue or even accelerate further But sadly that is unlikely to be the case EXPONENTIAL MOVES ARE TERMINAL There is a more scientific illustration how these exponential moves occur and also how they end Imagine a football stadium which is filled with water Every minute one drop is added The number of drops doubles every minute Thus it goes from 1 to 2 4 8 16 etc So how long would it take to fill the entire stadium One day one month or a year No it would be a lot quicker and only take 50 minutes That in itself is hard to understand but even more interestingly how full is the stadium after 45 minutes Most people would guess 75 90 Totally wrong After 45 minutes the stadium is only 7 full In the final 5 minutes the stadium goes from 7 full to 100 full That is the simple explanation why we are seeing this very fast exponential move in so many areas It is of course impossible to say exactly when the global stadium or individual stadiums will be filled especially since we don t know the size of these stadiums What we do know is that when it is full the water level will not only stop rising but the stadium will collapse We are probably now in the final minute or probably seconds of the move since we are in the exponential phase that has lasted around 100 years WORLD POPULATION DO DECLINE BY 2 3 BILLION If we look at a few examples of exponential growth we can start with world population For thousands of years global population grew very slowly but finally reached 1 billion in the 1850s Since then it has gone up over 7x to 7 5 billion Many experts now forecast that we will soon reach 15 or 20 billion Yes global population could grow slightly from here but more likely is that we will see a major reduction in the coming decades It could even happen a lot faster depending on the type of event that the world is facing Looking at the size of the exponential move 6 5 billion people have been added to world population since the mid 1850s A normal correction to such an exponential growth would be 38 to 50 This would mean that world population could go down between 2 5 and 3 7 billion to 3 8 to 5 billion people This clearly sounds horrendous and improbable but looking at the chart it is likely to happen It is of course possible that we could see some further growth before global population goes down But the risk of the downturn starting soon is much greater than a significant further increase The triggers for such a major reduction could be manifold like war epidemic disease economic collapse leading to poverty and famine or a combination of these events ETERNAL WEALTH PORTFOLIO Depending on the magnitude of the problem including the geographical spread it is very difficult to prepare for it for normal people Very few have their private jet and residences in many parts of the world However for people who have savings now is the time to take defensive measures if you haven t already I heard of very old family wealth who for hundreds of years have kept their wealth in property art and gold silver with 1 3 in each With productive land this has of course been a superb portfolio and will continue to do very well during the coming downturn Gold silver and agricultural land are real wealth preservations assets whilst some art today is a bubble asset and therefore will suffer But 2 3 of the assets in this family s portfolio are likely to perform extremely well in coming years A contrarian or a risk averse investor can today look at any chart of stocks bonds or property which will all tell him that we are now at extremes On a risk reward basis very few investors make money by buying in the very final stages of a move Yes it is true that anyone who bought into the Nasdaq in early 1999 had more than doubled his money by March 2000 The problem is that more than 95 of investors stayed in at that point and most did not get out until they had lost 50 80 DON T BE A VICTIM As the superb Chairman of Sprott USA Rick Rule stated at the New Orleans Investment Conference in 2017 Either you are a contrarian or you will be a victim The reality is that most people will be victims in coming years Very few will realise that what we will see next is the end of a major era or cycle of a major degree Whether it is a 300 year cycle or a 2 000 year cycle doesn t really matter Historians will know afterwards What we need to focus on today is to protect ourselves against these risks rather than to become victims BUY UNLOVED AND UNDERVALUED ASSETS RATES GOING FROM 18 TO ZERO CREDIT BUBBLE Also Greenspan s easy money policy had started in 1987 when Fed Funds reached 10 With a weak economy and weak asset markets Greenspan started his stimulative policy and lowered rates down to 3 in 1992 They had gone under 2 in early 2002 Eventually rates came down to 1 on Greenspan s watch When Bernanke then needed to sort out the mess during the great financial crisis rates were lowered from 5 in 2007 to 0 in 2009 where they stayed until 2021 The continual reduction of rates from when Greenspan took over in 1987 had already started in 1981 when the Fed Funds rate was 18 5 That was the top of a 35 year up cycle since WWII This policy of lower interest rates for 35 years combined with credit expansion and money printing has created the biggest global asset bubble in the history of the world MASSIVE EXCESSES WILL BE PUNISHED We are now at the point when the world will be punished for 35 years of excesses which is the culmination of the 100 year experiment of Fiat money started by the Fed in 1913 Looking at the exponential nature of where we are now in history it is clear that next time around the central banks will not succeed in saving the system Interest rates are now so low and still negative in many countries that there is very little flexibility to stimulate by lowering rates The only tool that remains is money printing Interestingly central banks who are always behind the curve are now believing that they can withdraw liquidity from markets rather than needing to add CENTRAL BANKS TO DRAIN LIQUIDITY BY 10 TRILLION Anyone who has the slightest knowledge of markets knows that it is the trillions of dollars of credit expansion and money printing that has created the biggest asset bubbles in history and especially inflated stock markets To stop feeding an addicted world with debt will not only kill stock markets but also all the other bubble markets Addicts don t just stop feeling good when they no longer receive their daily injection No they start feeling absolutely awful and go into a crisis that they seldom recover from It is the same with the world economy It is today totally dependent on continuous injections of credit and liquidity THE BIGGEST ABOUT TURN IN HISTORY The effect will be collapsing stock property and credit markets leading to panic in the financial system That will lead to the biggest Volte Face ever in global monetary history in the next 6 18 months Central banks will panic and start printing more money than ever before First in the tens of trillions of dollars leading on to hundreds of trillions and eventually trillions of dollars as the derivative bubble blows up The initial printing might have some short term beneficial effect on markets But soon the world will realise that worthless pieces of paper or zeros on a computer can never create wealth or save the world whatever the Keynesians or Krugman says Eventually this will lead the world to hyperinflation followed by a deflationary implosion But the course of events will not be straight forward in this process because we will have a combination of hyperinflation and deflation simultaneously The value real assets including many commodities like precious metals food and agricultural land will increase in value Money will of course hyperinflate as it is printed in unlimited quantities whilst stocks bonds and property will collapse in real times NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY WHAT NOBODY IS LOOKING AT For anyone with capital to invest this is probably one of the most interesting opportunities in history But that presupposes that the investor is prepared to take the contrarian position Now is the time to buy what nobody wants but which has a high intrinsic value and will benefit from the coming collapse of conventional bubble assets I particularly favour Physical precious metals stored outside the financial system Agricultural land in politically stable countries From a wealth preservation point of view precious metals especially silver is my favourite due to low gold silver ratio actually 67 1 and expect 30 1 even 15 1 When buying stocks an investor is exposed to the financial system the survival of which is doubtful The only way to avoid that is thorough direct registration which is difficult for most investors Also direct ownership of agricultural land is not practical for everyone And if it is bought via a fund it entails exposure to the financial system Thus in my view the biggest exposure should be in physical gold and silver with a smaller allocation to the other areas above Anyone who is not prepared to take a contrarian view today risks to be a real victim in the next couple of years addendum Egon von greyerz

Jeff Bezos Company went public in 1997 stock price was 1 73 at that time Bezos sold his 1st batch of shares in 2003 six years after his company went public He sold 2 95M shares at price range 28 49 He

immediately when the company is still bleeding money and cash negative You only exercise these options if you think that there is little to no benefit of keeping these options for long time and you can get more money if you exercise them now even after paying the tax on it Some people are saying Karp only getting 1M in salary Oh boy You have no idea why a CEO take cash salary less than 1M and take options and stocks worth billion Karp is taking only 1M salary but his total compensation is over 1B That means he is taking a salary in cash that is less than 0 1 of his total compensation Do you know why Because that s the maximum cap that you can deduct fully from your expenses If his expense is 3M in 2021 he will basically pay 0 income tax on his cash salary But if his cash salary was

were pretty sound 1 Earnings out earlier than scheduled which is very bullish 2 They just did a 305M raise priced at a 25 premium to market which was led by Mr Li Ka Shing 29th richest man in the world who put up 105M of his own money 3 Completed the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the company to over 300M in revenue and 50M in free cash flow 4 JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from 200M to 300M 5 0 debt on the balance sheet and 80M in the bank after the recent financing 6 What looks like a partnership with Apple They are now the first Canadian company to offer EMR records on Iphone 7 They have historically beat earnings guidance and I think could do the same here given how strong of a close they had on Friday amp x200B I decided to take it one step further and dive into the charts Canadian company so I m going with the Canadian ticker WELL as it seems to get most of the action I like to start my TA by zooming out to the maximum relevant period for any story This last year given the pandemic seems like the most logical time frame for this The stock performed exceptionally well throughout the pandemic and is now finding itself consolidating in the 7 range Now the key for me is that within this consolidation period the company has made immense progress as I stated above This is an entirely new story management was able to use their operational skills and really take advantage of this situation 1 They raised an additional 305M led by the 29th richest man in the world who has invested in every single round to date This one priced at a 25 premium 2 They used that capital to acquire CRH Medical which is going to bring revenues to 300M and free cash flow to 50M 3 They acquired Circle Medical a leading silicon valley company which is going to allow them to compete with any US Healthcare company 4 They are now the first Canadian healthcare company to directly integrate into Iphone 5 and still they have 0 debt and what I calculated to almost 80M in cash To put it simply they are on a hot M amp A streak and doing it very very well no pun intended lol SO this is where it gets interesting for me If we zoom out a year to the point they last started bolstering up M amp A activity around March April we see WELL is sitting clean on its 200day SMA before making a monster move for the better half of the year Now this is where they stood apart Unlike other companies who experienced monstrous returns over the year and didn t focus on the operational aspect Cough cough CLOV WELL was able to use this time to focus on operations and exponentially increase its revenue brands cashflows and ultimately justify its stock price up here Now here is where the TA comes in A year ago they were sitting flush on the 200 Day SMA right as they started increasing M amp A Activity Now again after making hugely successful acquisitions with CRH Circle etc while in this consolidation period WELL is again sitting clean on its 200day SMA and has double bottomed with a higher low and is further shown with the RSI being oversold and coiled in the right direction There is also a massive Bull Flag forming Further suggesting a huge breakout 1Year Daily 200day SMA confluences https preview redd it rloh016ij5y61 png width 2874 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

256fa9d69a481aacc997a97dd96fe378a0894415 Now this 7 18 level is key to break so the next stop would be 7 80 as we see here 10 amp x200B https preview redd it 2oktpnxep5y61 png width 2872 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 509a680d5f995a9009e64078c057aec47b500404 Once that 7 80 level is reached which I believe earnings will help us achieve then we need to zoom out again and look at where this really could go The answer to that is obviously subjective based on what happens in the business but I think as they are exponentially increasing the value of their core business via M amp A activity the very same thing could happen with the stock amp x200B https preview redd it snwojxnzp5y61 png width 2634 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 1a929096195ed04fb7402f0879c6e964fff8f345 I believe if earnings are positive that WELL could break out of this 7 9 consolidation zone and find itself trading in a new zone likely blue skies somewhere in the teens or 20s I really have conviction in this because they just raised 305M priced at a 25 premium to market at the time 9 80 which the 29th richest man in the world put up 105M of Now the question is to load up before earnings or watch and see what happens but potentially miss out on this move

822,n8n8o1,t2_6jm9c53p,1620593437,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n8n8o1/what_if_fed_misunderstood/,1,What if fed misunderstood , The mainstream financial media focused on the positive headlines only fed FOMC like Fed officials back dovish Powell view despite brighter outlook This headline is a perfect example because it clearly states that the Fed remains dovish but cleverly adds that this is in spite of an optimistic economic outlook This way we get the continuation of easy monetary policy and an improving economy at the same time What could be better However having read the all I have a very different take on what the Fed said The following is just my opinion Make up your own mind as to what the Fed is truly saying participants continued to see the uncertainty surrounding that outlook as elevated In other words while they may be optimistic the Fed cites several significant risks why they could be wrong and they clearly admit that the risk to their outlook is high i e there s a strong possibility that they could be wrong So much for that optimism a couple of participants expressed concerned that highly accommodative financial conditions could lead to excessive risk taking and the build up financial imbalances Mainstream commentators focused on the comment above but as far as I can tell completely ignored the following within the same paragraph disorderly conditions in treasury markets or a persistent rise in yields that could jeopardize progress towards the committee s goals were seen as a cause for concern This was far more significant imho because the Fed is basically saying that they will intervene to cap bond yields should they continue to rise While many people including myself have stating this expectation this is the Fed confirming it themselves The fact that the Fed has chosen to cap yields at a specific level that only they know has enormous implications for markets I ll explain why later but for now let s switch to their comments in relation to inflation The Fed took pains to emphasize that there are currently no signs of inflation They cited several indicators to support this assertion It s almost as if they are desperate for us to believe them Why Because there are signs of inflation everywhere One only has to look at the recent increases in commodity futures But it is not the current level of inflation I am focused on it is the future direction that matters to me and this is where it gets really interesting The Fed clearly stated its inflation objective as follows 2 percent on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time They also added the following assets purchases will continue at least at the current pace until then Note the highlighted words above They stand ready to print even more paper or digital dollars until they hit their inflation target The Fed just restated their plan to do whatever it takes when the time comes which means much more dollar printing out of thin air if yields rise or the economy stumbles again What if their economic optimism is wrong What if all of that money printing coincides with supply chain shocks i e more dollars chasing fewer goods and services I ll let the Ourselves find this answer Note the use of the word temporarily by fed Again What if the Fed is wrong and such supply shocks are neither temporary or transitory but persistent and become more widespread Exactly what I forecast back in March 2020 The Fed assumes that prices will moderate after a spike in prices but what if they re wrong and they keep rising Finally here is the icing on the cake changes in path of policy should be based primarily on observed outcomes rather than forecasts I understand the Fed s rationale for taking this approach given the level of uncertainty in the world today and their horrific track record with respect to forecasting The problem with it is that inflation is a lagging indicator They can t raise interest rates meaningfully due to the massive and rising amount of debt and the resultant increase in interest costs CONCLUSION My takeaways from these are as follows The Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy and markets i e much more dollar printing Inflation will rise drastically up to 4 level my imho Addendum my dd on wallstreetbet on 09 05 2021 yield won t increase

were pretty sound 1 Earnings out earlier than scheduled which is very bullish 2 They just did a 305M raise priced at a 25 premium to market which was led by Mr Li Ka Shing 29th richest man in the world who put up 105M of his own money 3 Completed the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the company to over 300M in revenue and 50M in free cash flow 4 JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from 200M to 300M 5 0 debt on the balance sheet and 80M in the bank after the recent financing 6 What looks like a partnership with Apple They are now the first Canadian company to offer EMR records on Iphone 7 They have historically beat earnings guidance and I think could do the same here given how strong of a close they had on Friday amp x200B I decided to take it one step further and dive into the charts Canadian company so I m going with the Canadian ticker WELL as it seems to get most of the action I like to start my TA by zooming out to the maximum relevant period for any story This last year given the pandemic seems like the most logical time frame for this The stock performed exceptionally well throughout the pandemic and is now finding itself consolidating in the 7 range Now the key for me is that within this consolidation period the company has made immense progress as I stated above This is an entirely new story management was able to use their operational skills and really take advantage of this situation 1 They raised an additional 305M led by the 29th richest man in the world who has invested in every single round to date This one priced at a 25 premium 2 They used that capital to acquire CRH Medical which is going to bring revenues to 300M and free cash flow to 50M 3 They acquired Circle Medical a leading silicon valley company which is going to allow them to compete with any US Healthcare company 4 They are now the first Canadian healthcare company to directly integrate into Iphone 5 and still they have 0 debt and what I calculated to almost 80M in cash To put it simply they are on a hot M amp A streak and doing it very very well no pun intended lol SO this is where it gets interesting for me If we zoom out a year to the point they last started bolstering up M amp A activity around March April we see WELL is sitting clean on its 200day SMA before making a monster move for the better half of the year Now this is where they stood apart Unlike other companies who experienced monstrous returns over the year and didn t focus on the operational aspect Cough cough CLOV WELL was able to use this time to focus on operations and exponentially increase its revenue brands cashflows and ultimately justify its stock price up here Now here is where the TA comes in A year ago they were sitting flush on the 200 Day SMA right as they started increasing M amp A Activity Now again after making hugely successful acquisitions with CRH Circle etc while in this consolidation period WELL is again sitting clean on its 200day SMA and has double bottomed with a higher low and is further shown with the RSI being oversold and coiled in the right direction There is also a massive Bull Flag forming Further suggesting a huge breakout 1Year Daily 200day SMA confluences https preview redd it rloh016ij5y61 png width 2874 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b480d9d3d67d44c2c757dd4234ed8803d9072309 Now obviously one time frame doesn t tell the whole story so I went deeper Right 6 month Daily shows the same thing Massive consolidation Bull flag Higher low

amp s 573ba72ecbdc124b99ebddf9f92860e17c6fd40b Analysts are expecting record earnings Tuesday so that s more than likely the cause Now that brings me to my final question Where can this go On a short

256fa9d69a481aacc997a97dd96fe378a0894415 Now this 7 18 level is key to break so the next stop would be 7 80 as we see here 10 amp x200B https preview redd it 2oktpnxep5y61 png width 2872 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 509a680d5f995a9009e64078c057aec47b500404 Once that 7 80 level is reached which I believe earnings will help us achieve then we need to zoom out again and look at where this really could go The answer to that is obviously subjective based on what happens in the business but I think as they are exponentially increasing the value of their core business via M amp A activity the very same thing could happen with the stock amp x200B https preview redd it snwojxnzp5y61 png width 2634 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 1a929096195ed04fb7402f0879c6e964fff8f345 I believe if earnings are positive that WELL could break out of this 7 9 consolidation zone and find itself trading in a new zone likely blue skies somewhere in the teens or 20s I really have conviction in this because they just raised 305M priced at a 25 premium to market at the time 9 80 which the 29th richest man in the world put up 105M of Now the question is to load up before earnings or watch and see what happens but potentially miss out on this move

FUBO QS SNDL and More, Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation Week 4 PLTR BABA XPEV DIS SPCE FUBO QS SNDL and More amp nbsp What s poppin bull gang Flux here with Week 4 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week cause it s time to do it all again This week is a little janky because a whole boatload of new companies are reporting so we don t actually have comprehensive historical data for them Instead of the standard 25 datapoints we ve got closer to half that and in some cases even less Trade carefully everyone I ve omitted Monday AM and Friday AM reporters due to there being no relevant companies reporting on the given days amp nbsp All that being said I fucking love earnings season It s an absolute battleground out there Insane volatility breaking announcements and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time What s not to love Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers roll the dice and amass a small fortune That being said the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders many find that they re one bad trade away from a complete blowout so you always need to think about each trade critically No shame in sitting it out altogether amp nbsp The Spreadsheet To aid us in planning our trades this week I ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week https docs google com spreadsheets d 14TOO6S W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh Fl pN3dxsREv0 edit usp sharing Using this spreadsheet we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker Obviously past performance isn t indicative of future success but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information If you re struggling to find a given stock click on the ticker symbol on the index page it should hyperlink you straight to the table If the above link isn t working for you refer to the link below amp nbsp Spreadsheet HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 14TOO6S W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh Fl pN3dxsREv0 edit usp sharing amp nbsp Please note that scraping and compiling this data took hours If the sheet has helped you out in any way please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials It would mean alot to me Most websites also require you to pay for this data which I think is a load of shit amp nbsp Interesting Observations and Sample Plays Below I ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance If I missed anything feel free to bring it to my attention amp nbsp First and foremost expect extra volatility this week Many of the companies who report this week are young and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their true values Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies Be wary of second time reporters such as Opendoor QuantumScape Upstart Poshmark etc Having only reported earnings once before we can t necessarily make any reliable predictions on these tickers so it may be best to avoid them all together The IV is cranked and even though the moves have the potential to be massive the risk just isn t worth it Lots of heavy movers report this week Some notable names include Magnite Novavax Canada Goose Vroom and Sonos Expect some insane post earnings moves and high volatility if you plan on playing these tickers It s tough to tell which way either of these tickers will go but according to the historical data at 10 move isn t uncommon Similar to PENN and DKNG last week we can make a similar play with VLDR and LAZR this week VLDRs report before LAZR and as a result we can use VLDR s price action to gage the expected movement of LAZR when it reports Thursday after hours Keep in mind this method can be used to predict the direction the price will go but not the magnitude Don t be afraid to play tickers who have never reported earnings before Some names include household favorite s UWMC PSFE RBLX and COIN All of these tickers report earnings for the very first time since going public this quarter so if you re looking to roll the dice on some newly minted tickers this is your opportunity Each company has some fun catalysts in the pipeline so you ve got a good chance to bag some gains should you choose to do so amp nbsp Obviously since I gave data on over 50 companies there s plenty that I ve missed Dive in have a look around and have some fun with it Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes and get the best risk reward possible Feel free to share your findings too I d love to see what you guys come up with amp nbsp Conclusion We ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week meaning there s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles Use the spreadsheet https docs google com spreadsheets d 14TOO6S W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh Fl pN3dxsREv0 edit usp sharing to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio and play accordingly If enough people found these useful I ll continue making them throughout the earnings season If the sheet has helped you out in any way please consider dropping an upvote or a comment and checking out my socials it would mean a lot to me Happy Trading Everybody
