natgas status 1395412696103858177 s 21 This tweet may be a tease but we all know what they re trying to tell us South Korea was the top country for US LNG exports in September 2020 What is Tellurian Tellurian was founded in 2016 by two industry icons Charif Souki and Martin Houston Charif set in motion the first liquefied natural gas LNG exports from the United States Lower 48 and founded Cheniere Energy Martin originated the concept of LNG destination flexibility ensuring that LNG became a commodity Tellurian is currently a debt free company What is LNG Liquefied natural gas LNG is natural gas that has been cooled down to liquid form for ease and safety of non pressurized storage or transport It takes up about 1 600th of the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state LNG is odorless colorless non toxic and non corrosive When LNG is returned to its gaseous state it is used across the residential commercial and industrial sectors for purposes as diverse as heating cooking generating electricity and manufacturing a wide variety of products LNG is also used as a fuel for heavy duty and other vehicles Who is Charif Souki To put it in simple terms Charif Souki is the Elon Musk of LNG Charif co founded Tellurian and serves as Executive Chairman of the Board He also founded Cheniere Energy Inc in 1996 and served as Chairman of the Board of Directors Chief Executive Officer and President until December 2015 Prior to Cheniere Charif was an investment banker He serves on the board of trustees of the American University of Beirut and as a member of the Advisory Board of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University Charif received a B A from Colgate University and an MBA from Columbia University Charif Souki was the highest paid CEO in 2013 this proves that he s the real deal Charif Souki was voted out of his position at Cheniere by Carl Icahn Charif Souki was fired because he wanted to expand Cheniere with projects such as Driftwood whereas Carl wanted to spend their cash flows on dividends Carl Icahn to date has never met Charif Souki in person Charif Souki resurrected his Driftwood plans by co founding Tellurian What is Driftwood Driftwood LNG LLC owned by Tellurian Inc is developing a liquefied natural gas LNG production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River south of Lake Charles Louisiana Once complete the terminal will be able to export up to twenty seven million six hundred thousand tonnes of LNG per year to customers worldwide Tellurian s Team The team at Tellurian together accounts for 75 of the LNG export from the USA today In 2020 5281 BCF of Natural Gas was exported from the USA At current JKM Asian Market prices for June 2021 that is equivalent to around 37 508 302 500 At current TTF prices European Market prices for June 2021 that is equivalent to around 32 161 290 000 These numbers tell you that the team at Tellurian is no joke and should not be taken lightly The President amp CEO of Tellurian Oct vio Sim es brings 38 years of impressive energy industry experience to Tellurian s remarkable infrastructure team Previously he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG amp Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra s efforts to develop build and operate liquefied natural gas LNG receipt terminals liquefaction facilities natural gas pipelines and storage facilities He led the company s efforts at Cameron LNG Energia Costa Azul LNG and Port Arthur LNG where he focused on reliability of deliveries to customers safety and gas sourcing strategies that assure reliable production of LNG Oct vio has deep relationships in the LNG market and an unmatched tenacity for developing new projects Martin Houston the Vice Chairman and Co founder is also an LNG veteran with nearly 40 years of experience He s managed all forms of enterprise in the energy industry has established a strong external reputation in the international gas business and is largely credited with being the key architect of BG Group s world class LNG business In recognition of this in 2011 he was the first recipient of the CWC LNG Executive of the Year award Why hasn t Driftwood started construction yet The Driftwood project will cost 27 5 Billion including pipelines Driftwood will produce 27 6 MTPA of LNG Tellurian has been looking for Equity partners to help with the funding of Driftwood Tellurian currently has one equity partner which is TOTAL SE If FID for Driftwood isn t reached by June 2021 then TOTAL can choose to back out of their position If they choose to exit it won t be an issue for the company as Charif Souki said building the terminal is no longer dependent on the Total agreement Tellurian currently has all permits required for Driftwood and Charif Souki confirmed that they are intending on starting basic construction this summer and planning on giving Bechtel the green light to begin full construction early next year What s going on with commercial agreements In a recent interview with Citi Group Charif Souki stated that We want to finish our commercial agreements which will happen in the next few weeks Souki said the offering has been very popular and if Tellurian hits its target in the next few weeks would be oversubscribed A recent video targeting Short Sellers was posted by Tellurian Charif Souki asked the shorts What do you think is going to happen when we start announcing some of these long term commercial agreements that we ve been working on for so long This will be an interesting question and we will see how the market reacts when this happens We are the market and it s our time to react Short Information Short Interest SO 8 67 Short Interest Float 18 36 Short Interest Shares 33 517 410 Days To Cover 3 65 Short Volume Here Short Squeeze Score 73 26 99 Our Friends over at Citadel decided to buy Puts for TELL How many times do we have to tell them not to mess with us Is TELL a quick trade or a long term hold Charif Souki has made it clear that he is building a business and that TELL is not a trade If you just want quick profits then this stock is NOT for you Tellurian s Competition Although no one in the US will be able to come up with a business model more profitable than Tellurian s Driftwood Qatar in many people s eyes is seen as a big competitor and one that will destroy all US LNG exports but this is simply just not the case Countries that import LNG diversify their LNG portfolio and will buy from a variety of countries and not just anyone in particular No matter how profitable Qatar s LNG plan is Success is almost inevitable for TELL Charif Souki personally talked about this and with utmost respect reassures us that Qatar is not a competitor Stock Price Tellurian themselves have implied that the TELL stock will have a value of 12 17 at FID TELL is currently trading for 2 62 In the Citi Interview Charif Souki said that the stock will have 7 FCF in a couple of years The multiple for the FCF is decided by the market but is usually around 10x The top 3 institutional shareholders for Tellurian are State Street Corp Blackrock INC amp Vanguard Group INC State Street Corp recently disclosed that they added 20 783 999 shares adding to a grand total of 23 481 581 Shares Blackrock and Vanguard own upwards of 13 million shares each Blackrock Vanguard and State Street don t invest in companies that they don t believe in They believe in Tellurian and have proved it with the positions they have Why am I invested in Tellurian I am invested in Tellurian because I believe in the business model and also believe in the team Charif Souki is a very intelligent man and Tellurian s weekly 2 minutes with Charif videos keep investors up to date about what is going on with LNG throughout the world along with the occasional updates about Driftwood TELL has been through a lot these past few months but we have been setting high lows and higher highs last week which makes it appear as so we are in the c or correction wave according to the Eliott Wave Theory The fundamentals of this company haven t changed and things are only getting better I am long TELL as you can tell by my positions TL DR Tellurian teased their agreement with South Korea earlier today and TELL is basically in a correction The announcements of commercial agreements will help the stock reach a fair value This is not your regular start up company as the team has a shit ton of experience With a highly profitable business model along with big connections in the business Tellurian is lined up for success and is just waiting for the perfect time Carl Icahn a short seller caused the highly respected Charif Souki to be fired from his own company and shorts are betting against his new company It s time for the bulls to takeover Disclaimer This is not financial advice nor am I a financial adviser Please do your own DD before buying shares

significant catalyst,One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the MSCI World Small Cap Index starting on May 27 This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week and I will lay out the reasons why here The list of new additions deletions to this index can be found in the link to MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions Deletions on this page https www msci com index review UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as UWM HLDGS A There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 preliminary IPO addition list and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index First the list published by MSCI is already the final list It s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27 The other key difference and one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a meaningfully greater catalyst than UWMC s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index for real this time is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the small cap index Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the small cap index It has to do with relative weighting within the index Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index For example the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0 23 of the index This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0 23 of the total assets of the fund So how is this bullish for UWMC Because when UWMC is added to the index it will likely be one of the top ten in ranking or just outside the top ten based on its current market cap This page https www ishares com uk individual en products 296576 ishares msci world small cap ucits etf usd acc fund from BlackRock s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings TPR is the 9th company in this list top is cash as of May 20 2021 with a relative weighting of 0 16 As of the close of market Friday TPR has a market cap of just under 12 Billion In comparison UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of 12 95 Billion So this means that upon official inclusion UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position which should give it a weighting of approximately 0 16 This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added I found three main ETFs that track this index There are likely other funds but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst gt BlackRock iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF https www ishares com uk individual en products 296576 ishares msci world small cap ucits etf usd acc fund Net Assets 4 12 Billion gt gt 0 16 4 12 Billion 6 59 Million corresponding to 816 800 shares 8 07 gt gt Vanguard Global Small Cap Index Fund https markets ft com data funds tearsheet summary s IE00B42LF923 USD Net Assets 3 69 Billion gt gt 0 16 3 69 Billion 5 9 Million corresponding to 731 600 shares 8 07 gt gt SPDR MSCI World Small Cap ETF https www ssga com uk en gb institutional etfs funds spdr msci world small cap ucits etf zprs gy Net Assets 950 Million gt gt 0 16 950 Million 1 52 Million corresponding to 188 350 shares 8 07 In comparison when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000 it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap giving it a weighting of 0 03 It s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index But because of the 5 3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH legitimate financial term Studies have shown https www nber org digest nov13 stock price reactions index inclusion that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap the share price tends to move up shortly thereafter because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index with a higher respective weighting rather than one of the smallest TL DR it is better to be a BIG fish in a small cap index than to be a small fish in a large index Thus I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC s inclusion in the MSCI World Small Cap Index

stocks in the tech semiconductor sector that offers Value amp Growth with a potential near term window for a short squeeze HIMX is currently trading at 10 36 share They crushed their last earnings

better gross margin of 45 47 INSANLELY UNDERVALUED at 10 36 share If you can find a better value in the tech semiconductor sector let me know But these numbers are getting to be a little insane The stock saw a pop up to 15 share after a pre earnings announcement in April But since then it s been the target of a short campaign and been forced down by general market feelings toward the tech sector as well as inflation fears But look at these numbers Trailing P E is 16 09 Forward P E is 5 41 Market Cap is 1 8 Billion Trailing revenue is 1 billion Cash heavy with d 245 8 million in cash in Q1 and

this past week at the 10 50 strike price and low and behold the stock closed at 10 36 on this past Friday I m no options expert but I think it s clear we have some manipulation perhaps with the intent to for MM s or hedges to drive price down and exercise cheap puts to pick this stock up even cheaper But how far can the stock get driven down There s a few things to take into consideration on the downside 1 Taiwan Drought Drought in Taiwan has effected chip industry So far it hasn t effected Himax though and the claim to have secured supply chain growth for the remaining of the year 2 Taiwan Covid There s been an outbreak of Covid cases This could disrupt production but Taiwan seems to be working quick to curtail the issue This is definitely an unknown at this point 3 Past Fraud

we have no had a significant drawdown we re still close to ATHs on these indices and specifically I look at QQQ s chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year IWM appears to have formed a range which I d say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value shown

further alternatively we ve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between which could be a sign of weakening and indication of possible further downside Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets With the growing proliferation of the latter we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on with equities or other markets If a bubble is bursting here does it signal a growing risk off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year I m just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above market sentiment and some stuff I ve been reading this is what I have in mind right now but all of this can change in an instant of course Summer expecting the reflation trade financials energy industrials value to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform June FOMC There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting August Jackson Hole Meetup If we haven t heard anything regarding tapering prior speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change as that s what happened last year with inflation targeting With fear of a taper tantrum we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this Late Summer If we haven t had one by now I d expect a meaningful 10 pullback Inflation Data June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes but if we continue to get high prints into July August and later this year inflation will become a real issue Fall We start to get murky here I d look for a late year rally to follow any pullback but it s hard to say too many unknowns EOY Targets CNBC s median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800 Consider we re already 11 12 4 YTD on SPY IWM and QQQ respectively and 86 119 92 since the March 2020 lows is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near term Considerations Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way the reflation trade is the trend and no reason to fight it Consider seasonality We re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall It s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short term trades going forward Have long exposure but be careful with positioning and time horizons I have to echo the same

downside Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets With the growing proliferation of the latter we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on with equities or other markets If a bubble is bursting here does it signal a growing risk off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year I m just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above market sentiment and some stuff I ve been reading this is what I have in mind right now but all of this can change in an instant of course Summer expecting the reflation trade financials energy industrials value to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform June FOMC There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting August Jackson Hole Meetup If we haven t heard anything regarding tapering prior speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change as that s what happened last year with inflation targeting With fear of a taper tantrum we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this Late Summer If we haven t had one by now I d expect a meaningful 10 pullback Inflation Data June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes but if we continue to get high prints into July August and later this year inflation will become a real issue Fall We start to get murky here I d look for a late year rally to follow any pullback but it s hard to say too many unknowns EOY Targets Median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800 Consider we re already 11 12 4 YTD on SPY IWM and QQQ respectively and 86 119 92 since the March 2020 lows is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near term Considerations Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way the reflation trade is the trend and no reason to fight it Consider seasonality We re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall It s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short term trades going forward Have long exposure but be careful with positioning and time horizons I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit but there is no way you can t be long right now Stay with the trend amp nbsp I think right now if you re long you need

go from here,Recently I ve been trying to put some my thoughts down in writing instead of just living in my head as a way to fully think through what s rolling around in my head as I look at charts read articles listen to podcasts etc I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I ve consumed lately amp nbsp Let s start with a look at overall market performance by sector I like to use this to establish a point of reference what kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly Sector Performance 1y Sector Performance 2021 YTD I m using ARKK here as a proxy for high growth unprofitable companies since that s a lot of what they own Some notes Tech and in particular unprofitable tech has underperformed YTD since about mid Feb Financials Industrials and Energy have out performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart This reflation trade started in about mid February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year s growth trade has lagged and given back Now let s look at index performance SPY 1y QQQ 1y IWM 1y I ve tried to highlight ranges pullbacks and bounces in these Take Aways Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce seemingly fueled by panic buying at the Thursday open The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces for SPY the 50DMA has held QQQ support at 316 Despite the recent volatility we have no had a significant drawdown we re still close to ATHs on these indices and specifically I look at QQQ s chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year IWM appears to have formed a range which I d say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value shown below that started around this time This chart is something to watch if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value Selected ETFs 1y Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post crash Conjecture You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop we ve held some established support and

weekend DD ASO is Academy Sports a retail store that sells sports clothing outdoor equipment guns etc Sounds boring Yeah that s okay I m sure it s a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls You buy calls it craters you buy puts and it trades sideways It s a zero sum game out there and they ve got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass Retail doesn t get to make money on fun stuff anymore If you wanna play the game try playing retarded on some boomer shit May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30 MT Newswires Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods BGFV rallied more than 30 in Wednesday afternoon trading a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend Late Tuesday the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of 0 96 a share compared with a net loss of 0 22 a share for the same period in 2020 Revenue rose to 272 8 million from 217 7 million Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to 0 18 a share from 0 15 a share payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1 A special cash dividend of 1 per share was also declared payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17 Looking ahead Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of 1 05 to 1 25 a share Price 25 20 Change 6 13 Percent Change 32 14 Coincidentally that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3 2M share buyback On that day it moved from somewhere around 30 to over 36 May 5th UBS adjusts price target of Dick s from 75 up to 90 I don t know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other March 9th 2021 Dick s increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16 I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren t going to be around much longer I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic 5 10 21 JP Morgan raises price target to 40 5 11 21 UBS Adjusts price target from 32 to 40 5 12 21 Credit Suisse raises price target to 39 ASO has a 100 buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from 39 40 while it closed this last Friday at 34 21 in after hours We don t have ASO earnings until maybe June July but Dick s is going to report earnings on May 26th Now I cannot say with 100 certainty that they will beat expectations but I do think that they will have favorable results We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens If Dick s has a good earnings report than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it s most predominant store in the sector Why do I not want calls on Dick s or Big 5 I don t see Dick s expanding or becoming larger Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I m already late Academy Sports on the other hand is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth They have a P E ratio less than 10 while DKS is running around with a P E ratio of 15 and in my opinion no room to grow Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns Entirely speculation but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze which ASO is absolutely not but I think the short interest is very relevant here As of April 30th 32 of the float was sold short When that was reported the price saw a high of 31 08 This month we have been trading between 36 60 and 33 90 As a whole with 13 180 000 shares sold short if those position are held assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of 33 90 they would be down 2 82 a share and for them that s a best case scenario That s 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn t gone down signifying that most if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again If I held a large short position not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to 40 I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector I believe Dick s is going to serve as a catalyst warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss If Dick s has a favorable earnings call ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted Smart money says a stock is overvalued SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something it s just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong You are actually retarded if you re looking to buy calls on a company only because it s shorted heavily Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it In this case their initial stance was reasonable Academy Sports shouldn t have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did They blew the fucking roof off and now there s no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze it s going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet large cash reserves is doing a share buyback exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it s market share until it becomes a better Dick s aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138 yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019 Also of note Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms gun accessories and ammo when it s not all sold out especially in comparison to their competitors Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them I m sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a safe haven and I think ASO is the perfect choice In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear I ve been told it s packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I m going to go check for myself Positions Yeah I m sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here especially with the way the market has been moving If you are losing and need a break this is a good place to pause and take a breather However I m retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning For the smooth brains that need extra help here you go JUNE 18 35C JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C Lastly if you look at the options chain you ll notice there is massive open interest at the 40 strike price A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low With IV around 70 a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM Keep in mind if Dick s has a good call the sector is very likely to react on that report alone Following that Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector All in all good luck I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways TL DR If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon as the price moves towards analyst s target at 40 Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does

DKS TD BMO and More, Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation Week 5 NVDA SNOW CRM COST BBY ZS DKS TD BMO and More amp nbsp What s poppin bull gang Flux here with Week 6 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week cause it s time to do it all again Earnings season is just about over so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around Thank you all for joining me for the ride amp nbsp All that being said I fucking love earnings season It s an absolute battleground out there Insane volatility breaking announcements and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time What s not to love Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers roll the dice and amass a small fortune That being said the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders many find that they re one bad trade away from a complete blowout so you always need to think about each trade critically No shame in sitting it out altogether amp nbsp The Spreadsheet To aid us in planning our trades this week I ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week https docs google com spreadsheets d 1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft ZMAM315Xtw edit usp sharing Using this spreadsheet we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker Obviously past performance isn t indicative of future success but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information If you re struggling to find a given stock click on the ticker symbol on the index page it should hyperlink you straight to the table If the above link isn t working for you refer to the link below amp nbsp Spreadsheet HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft ZMAM315Xtw edit usp sharing amp nbsp Please note that scraping and compiling this data took hours If the sheet has helped you out in any way please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials It would mean alot to me Most websites also require you to pay for this data which I think is a load of shit amp nbsp Interesting Observations and Sample Plays Below I ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance If I missed anything feel free to bring it to my attention amp nbsp All major Canadian Banks report this week Some names in the lineup include BMO RY TD and CM BMO reports first out of the four so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks Similar to the American banks in Week 1 I m expecting huge beats across the board alongside some comfortable upwards movement amp nbsp Those with OTC TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks Again similar to Week 1 you could ve played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag Those looking to run that play back should look into ZEB The IV is low as hell and it only holds Canadian banks Options on it are dirt cheap with an option less than 1 OTM going for a grand total of 0 10 Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3 bagger Unfortunately the ticker isn t liquid whatsoever and the bid ask spread isn t too appealing You re gonna be buying at the ask and selling at the bid so even if we get a nice move we re still gonna get trashed by slippage ITM options may be the way to play this one I couldn t find a better ETF alternative so this one is the best we got This play is definitely one of the riskier ones amp nbsp Piggybacking off the last point liquidity is suspect this week Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains If you think you see an awesome play make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it You ll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain so there s gonna be a fucking crater in the bid ask spread You re guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners amp nbsp ZScaler options are inefficiently priced Historically ZScaler moves roughly 15 post earnings but the options chain is only pricing in a 5 move this time round This gives us gambler a huge edge since we won t get IV crushed as hard and we can buy our options for cheap There are lots of strategies you can run this week but I m personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills amp nbsp Obviously since I gave data on over 40 companies there s plenty that I ve missed Dive in have a look around and have some fun with it Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes and get the best risk reward possible Feel free to share your findings too I d love to see what you guys come up with amp nbsp Conclusion We ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week meaning there s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles Use the spreadsheet https docs google com spreadsheets d 1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft ZMAM315Xtw edit usp sharing to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio and play accordingly If enough people found these useful I ll continue making them throughout the earnings season If the sheet has helped you out in any way please consider dropping an upvote or a comment and checking out my socials it would mean a lot to me Happy Trading Everybody
