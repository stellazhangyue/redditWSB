BB is winning cybersecurity Some stuff from my head others from presentation at JP Morgan conference I have been long BB since June 2019 waiting for this pop to happen I used to work at RIM BB 10 years ago nothing confidential here but I know the security culture well 1 Pervasive security culture that s decades long from history of building the most secure phones networks and servers End to end encryption is not a new thing to BB It has been a thing since the very very early days Only in the last few years are other companies starting to talk about it I worked there 10 years ago and the security culture was insane It was harder to go into the prototype plant RIM 8 than airport security There s a reason why BB sold phones without cameras because we needed them ourselves If your BB had a camera you leave it at the door with security 2 Strong customer base of critical infrastructure that cannot fail or get hacked think nuclear power plants the International Space Station and cars driving down the road All the top G20 governments all the top 10 global banks Remember Obama had a cell phone It was a BlackBerry and was the first device ever to get approved for use by a president This was 2008 but he wasn t using a fucking iPhone 3 Strong enterprise and government sales experience BB has so much experience selling into the enterprise B2B sales is not easy as any startup would know but they have been able to do so since the first RIM pager to BlackBerry smartphones and enterprise servers Back in the day BlackBerry was the only phone to work in disasters because they had dedicated networks and servers BlackBerry Internet Service BIS and BlackBerry Enterprise Server BES All your traffic gets routed separately from the general public 4 QNX security certifications for defense government automotive medical industrial ISO 26262 ASIL D 61508 ASIL 3 These come from a fundamental design principles used for QNX and if competitors are to copy they would have to start from scratch QNX hypervisor uses microkernel virtualization to compartmentalize critical processes from non critical ones So if you have your autonomous driving or steering system controlled by BB software your music app that gets hacked ain t touching the steering system Other companies run through the same kernel meaning that it is easier to hack 5 Customer markets are growing massively Autonomous driving and connected cars is blowing up That means automakers need to either build their own or buy secure software platforms Considering the cost and time everyone is buying except maybe Tesla As more cars are connected you also attract more hackers and bad actors which make automakers more likely to buy industry leading platforms like BB It s a positive feedback loop And more customers on this same platform mean more and more security because it makes fixed costs hiring engineers make more sense More customers gt more secure gt more customers gt more secure 6 Most cars use multiple chips to run the different systems One for the infotainment one for the drive system one for the dashboard etc Increasingly automakers are consolidating into single high performance controllers ECUs What this means is that point A 4 above is increasingly more relevant because a single chip needs to be uber secure QNX is designed for this And 19 of the top 25 EVs already use QNX 7 AWS partnership to create middleware IVY that allows more companies to build applications to use with the QNX platform You can have all the best tech in the world but if no one knows how to use it or no one has easy access to it it s useless Well this solves that problem as software engineers can now build on it much more easily SWEs are like water and they use the tools with least resistance This will create an ecosystem that Amazon and BB will push to the OEMs together 8 AWS IVY the middleware is OS and cloud agnostic This means that if Amazon is being a shit partner they can leave and move somewhere else Obviously this is not ideal and would require some work but it s not the end of the world What this means is that Amazon won t be able to hold BB hostage with more fees if this takes off It s 50 50 partnership with Amazon Think of the concept where you are a restaurant and you are getting good sales The landlord sees that and they raise your rent Well shit you just did more work and your profits stay the same 9 Pivot from hardware to software means subscription revenue What this means is that it is going to go on forever and customer has zero leverage until they want to rebuild their software If you re an OEM and you build a car around this platform you re paying BB until you redesign the car from the ground up all the while you are paying BB every single fucking month And if the OEM s contract with BB is running out well BB can raise their rates even higher What is the OEM going to do Stop producing a car and spin up another platform redesign another car around that platform and retool factories to build it That takes years and billions so they pony up to BB whatever fee increases they want This is how AWS makes so much money

Rocco I m planning on growing my portfolio at least 50 per year over the next 10 years and becoming a multimillionaire I think battery metals will be the vehicle to help me exceed my goal The Second Electric Revolution is underway and it is creating some of the best investment opportunities of this decade I have investing in companies that provide essential ingredients to the EV and energy storage industries I m talking about battery metals EV and energy storage technologies require vast amounts of metals like lithium copper nickel and manganese The average battery electric vehicle for example contains about 180 pounds of copper that s about half as much as the average American home So it s likely that the boom in EVs and energy storage will create major echo booms in several metal markets To capitalize on these prospective booms I ve purchased several battery metals plays like Ivanhoe Mines Ltd IVPAF Galaxy Resources Ltd GALXF Western Areas Ltd WNARF Eramet ERMAY Conic Metals Capital Corp CONXF Lynas Rare Earths Ltd LYSCF and Glencore Plc GLCNF as well as call options on Freeport McMoRan Inc FCX Here is the stock and research associated with it Largo Resources Ltd OTC LGORF It is the largest vanadium miner in the Americas Vanadium is key to an innovative energy storage technology called the vanadium redox flow battery VFRB that is quickly becoming a desired solution for stationary energy storage applications Energy storage is just another way of saying batteries Increasingly renewable energy installations like wind and solar include a meaningful energy storage capacity Currently the dominant form of stationary energy storage is lithium ion technology but VFRBs possess some major advantages They last longer and can be charged and discharged repeatedly without any significant drop in performance Vanadium flow batteries also utilize nonflammable material making them safer and more reliable for large scale stationary applications than combustion prone lithium batteries Currently only about 100 VRFB installations are operating around the world But the pace of new installations is gaining momentum worldwide Most likely that pace will ramp up even more as the entire energy storage market expands The research firm Wood Mackenzie predicts the global energy storage market will skyrocket between now and 2030 from a starting point of less than 15 gigawatt hours to 741 Gwh Incidentally this new forecast is double the forecast that Bloomberg New Energy Finance issued about two years ago Parabolic growth trajectories of this scale are rare To boost energy storage from where it is today to 741 Gwh by 2030 would require an annualized growth rate of nearly 40 That s big A few key details about this mine It is the only operating vanadium mine in the Americas It holds the highest grade vanadium deposit yet discovered It is one of the lowest cost producers of the element in the world Vanadium s story is just beginning to attract attention from investors thanks to its growing role as a green element In the steel industry vanadium is something of a wonder element Steel that contains vanadium is lighter stronger and more durable than other steel alloys Just one kilogram of vanadium in a tonne of steel increases its tensile strength by 84 Therefore building a given structure with vanadium steel requires a smaller volume of steel than building one with a conventional carbon manganese steel Additionally producing vanadium steel requires much less energy i e less smoke belching from steelmaking furnaces than conventional steel Because of these two traits vanadium steel is more environmentally friendly than conventional steel Thanks to Largo s low cost of production and debt free balance sheet it possesses plenty of staying power to endure the current conditions and then to generate substantial profit growth when vanadium prices firm up Although Largo isn t in the forecasting business it expects the vanadium price to increase to at least 6 50 a pound over the next year Largo produces all of its revenues from vanadium mining its share price tends to track closely with the vanadium price Thanks to a recovering steel market and to vanadium s growing cache as a green element it should attract robust demand growth over the next few years especially if VRFBs gain market share faster than many industry experts are predicting Yesterday the stock jumped on news that it will soon be listed on a US Stock exchange https finance yahoo com news largo resources announces special meeting 123000405 html I recommend purchasing ASAP I don t believe Largo s stock price is even close to reflecting the company s profit potential Based on consensus analyst estimates Largo is trading for just seven times 2021 gross earnings EBITDA And these estimates anticipate very little improvement in vanadium prices So if the vanadium price recovers faster and more forcefully than the analysts expect Largo would book much larger profits All in Largo shares offer a compelling play on a dynamic corner of the battery metals market Currently holding a big position in this stock Let s ride baby I recommend purchasing Largo Resources Ltd LGORF at 1 75 or less Use a limit order not a market order I am not a qualified licensed investment advisor Do your own due diligence I m not responsible for any losses or gains

Well here you fucking go because it is not too late not by a long shot 1 THE SHORTS ARE FUCKED I know you know this but honestly the evidence to so obvious but it just so fucking hard to believe because the shorts are almost as retarded as us ALMOST Short Interest We have been collecting shorts faster than we are losing them The fee to borrow the shares is now at 45 per year meaning shares are becoming very scarce normal rates are 0 3 and there are only 100 000 available short An estimated 77 44 MILLION SHARES are still short While the daily volume of shares traded has has surged well beyond 70 million most of the trading has not been short covering and lots of it has been shorting The Shorts are still in massively shorts are currently deep underwater holding each day costs them a ton they will scrabble for the nearest exit as quick as they can ONCE it really gets going DON T GIVE THEM AN EASY EXIT HOLD Borrow Fee https iborrowdesk com report GME https iborrowdesk com report GME Daily Short Volume https www nakedshortreport com company GME https www nakedshortreport com company GME Estimated short interest https www ortex com stocks 26195 shorts https www ortex com stocks 26195 shorts 2 SHORTS ARE REALLY FUCKED RYAN COHEN Our lord and Savior Ryan fucking Cohen He took Chewy from nothing and now its worth 47 Billion and he started from scratch Oh but what about digital downloads and amazon and other retailers killing GME business Did your Pets go hungry before Cohen created CHEWY NO Did Cohen capture a huge chuck of the market share of well established businesses with innovative thinking and create a company that was focused on the customers and E commerce YES 3 Fuck the E Commerce say it with me E Commerce it s up 800 year over year and the E commerce genius RYAN COHEN just stepped in by buying 13 percent of the company GME is not a dying company and we have t even got close to the fair market value When the company wasn t posting profits and we had a board full of Boomers holding onto way too many poorly located retail stores I could see why people lined up to short this thing But with THREE BOARD SEATS our soon to be CEO is going to pull off the most massive turnaround of any company we have ever seen He said GAMESTOP will be the Amazon of Games and MORE And games is big big fucking business 44 Billion in the US and 165 Billion globally last year and growing fast 4 GME to the MOON and staying there Cohen is going to gut the unprofitable stores we all know there were way too many in dying malls and make the remaining stores the hub for all things even remotely gaming or high end consumer electronic related The stores he does keep will be the thousands of wonderful little warehouses delivering your NEW and USED games consoles phones drones monitors high end PC parts and so much more Not to mention the fact that gamestop will almost certainly start selling used digital games If your buy your digital copy at gamestop they will let you sell it back to them so you can make a few bucks and they can make a lot more Win Win Oh and how about some store credit to keep Gamestop customers loyal This will come to pass and it will be hugely profitable for Gamestop and rip the thesis to fucking shreds 5 Market Cap Expectations are all that Matter We all know that expectations front run real winners by a huge amount Many of you have been feasting on Tesla and EV stock tendies for a while now Tesla is now worth more than the largest nine car companies combined while only selling a tiny fraction of the cars WHY Because it is lead by a visionary who can deliver He will deliver and so will Cohen Ryan Cohen will be a household name soon Gamestop is not stopping at 100 because that would put its market cap at 6 96 Billion I think 25 Billion or 360 a share is fair value I am not SELLING TLDR part 2 Buy more shares because Gamestop is still extremely undervalued and you should expect price to go to at least 100 but very likely way higher on fundamental expectations alone Add in the short squeeze and we will be in Valhalla soon if YOU DO YOUR PART AND FUCKING HOLD The shorts can t exit unless we let them We are an army and we are in this together Positions or Ban right https preview redd it 8lsi46lajhb61 png width 876 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 9df640ff8afb7464b384ea0a587f21ea89dcc8fd If you are still looking

squeezed hard Real Hard Went from 30 to 141 and everyone I mean everyone knew and still knows its a fucking fraud It is hovering around 60 today and its garbage Just think what GME can do when people

investing in anything CCP related because our short sightednes is being used against us for our medium long term destruction what do you think of this amp x200B https harrisbricken com chinalawblog chinas nationalist agenda behind its opening up to foreign banks https harrisbricken com chinalawblog chinas nationalist agenda behind its opening up to foreign banks In a recent op ed https www usnews com news best countries articles 2020 10 06 commentary mulan disney and the dilemma of doing business in china I wrote how the controversy over Disney s Mulan embodies some of the ethical dilemmas and pitfalls that face companies doing business in China On one hand to maintain their presence in China these companies must comply with the demands and expectations of the Chinese Communist Party CCP On the other hand doing so comes with the cost of significant reputational risk at home But the influence Beijing seeks to gain on Western media companies such as Disney and Comcast is but a subplot in a much larger story and China is playing a series of bigger games in which its Communist Party is thinking a dozen moves ahead of their chief opponent the United States Since China s path to victory over the United States will depend in large part on our ignorance the what games it plays and the strategies it employs the U S must quickly become privy to both to stand a chance Though the strategic game of choice in much of the world is chess in China it is wei qi China is employing a comprehensive strategy to encircle us across many domains of competition The CCP knows it cannot win a kinetic war with the United States and so it is finding other ways to fight the hundred years war against the United States And among those ways is using our short term thinking our hunger for market opportunities aka greed and our openness against us 1 China s Most Dangerous Game To understand China s game it helps to studying their primary tactic at the moment which involves aggressively opening their financial markets to the U S in ways they never have before and China is doing this despite tense political relations https www cnbc com 2020 07 21 us china relations will remain tense says former american ambassador html between the two nations Just in the last few months China has given approval to leading Wall Street firms like BlackRock Vanguard Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase to expand their businesses in China In August BlackRock received official approval https www wsj com articles blackrock gets go ahead for a mutual fund business in china 11598687419 from the Chinese government to set up a mutual fund business in Shanghai Days later Vanguard announced it was moving its regional headquarters https www ft com content 46683cde 9707 4023 9378 52e6491f8817 to Shanghai JPMorgan Chase meanwhile is set to pay 1 billion to become the first foreign company to assume full ownership https www ft com content f785d18e e4c8 4b67 85ea da71e9f8f6f2 of a pre existing Chinese mutual fund business This is all in marked contrast to Beijing s previous requirement that Western firms partner with local Chinese entities to do business in China s financial markets Why is China opening up their financial markets and why now China is not doing this because it needs the money Part of the reason it is doing this is because it wants to study Western banking models There are numerous examples of China bringing in Western companies and letting them make money in China but essentially forcing them to teach Chinese companies that are positioning themselves to set up competing enterprises that will eventually destroy the China opportunities for these very same Western companies When a Western company fights back via the legal system as the Dallas based Tang Energy Group has done against the state owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China AVIC they find China to be a formidable opponent even when fighting on home turf https apnews com article 055b6cebe41649999d48fa1b5265fb19 If you study China s past collaborations with the West in other industries its partnerships with Disney and Comcast being notable examples a pattern comes into focus Essentially what Beijing is doing is laying down the foundations for an ecosystem set up to extract commitments and support for their policies from Western companies This ecosystem consists of numerous interlinking components including the social credit ranking system https harrisbricken com chinalawblog chinas new company tracking system comply comply comply the national security law and cybersecurity laws https harrisbricken com chinalawblog china cybersecurity no place to hide With these components now in place the CCP is inviting into China an increasing number of Western companies from varying industries most of which will not be able to resist the prospect of tapping into what is now the world s largest economy For its part the CCP is not interested in providing access to its markets without getting something in return and what it wants most of all is for foreign financial institutions to favorably represent and support their nationalist narratives and policies back home in the United States U S banks and financial companies are the perfect vehicle for Beijing to achieve these aims since the financial sector has tremendous lobbying power in Washington and is by far the largest source of campaign donations https www reuters com article us usa banks lobbying banks spent record amounts on lobbying in recent election idUSKBN16F26P to political parties and candidates This is not just an abstract hypothetical China has already done this very recently in fact with Standard Chartered and HSBC two British banks with operations in Hong Kong and the mainland Beijing gave the ultimatum to these two British banks that if they did not publicly express support for the national security law https www bbc com news world asia china 52765838 in Hong Kong they would lose the right to continue doing business in China Both banks complied https www cnn com 2020 06 04 business hsbc standard chartered hong kong law intl hnk index html in a move widely criticized by https www reuters com article us hongkong protests hsbc hldg stanchart hsbc stanchart criticised for backing hong kong security law idUSKBN23B0FD the international community But the CCP didn t stop there it also demanded both companies crack down on clients with ties to the pro democracy movement in Hong Kong The banks complied with this https www reuters com article us hongkong security wealth exclusive exclusive global banks scrutinize their hong kong clients for pro democracy ties idUSKCN24L096 as well Another more recent example is the CCP abruptly slamming the brakes https www wsj com articles

down this IPO and then disappeared Jack Ma https www ft com content 751c2500 f50d 47c9 8f04 a28ad62285fd as retaliation and as a reminder that the CCP controls all private industry in China Duly

been seen nor heard from for going on a month now These are tactics China has been before and will use again with the foreign banks and financial institutions rushing in now 2 Why Companies Comply With China s Demands Why do Western companies not just refuse to comply when China makes these kinds of demands Why would they support policies that so clearly run counter to the democratic principles of their home countries First as part of the contractual conditions for doing business in China the Communist Party requires foreign companies to not say or do anything disruptive to the stability of China s social fabric What is considered disruptive however is deliberately left ambiguous and open to the CCP s arbitrary interpretations Companies that violate this rule may not only lose their right to operate in China they may also be required to forfeit the intellectual property they brought with them To illustrate if the CCP were to disapprove of something Disney said Disney might not only be forbidden to release any future films in China their highly profitable Shanghai Disneyland and other joint ventures would thereafter belong entirely to their government owned Chinese business partners This is likely why Disney has been slow to answer https www reuters com article us disney mulan china u s lawmakers quiz disney ceo over xinjiang connection to mulan idUSKBN2630AZ questions from U S or U K lawmakers about their involvement with Xinjiang or answered those questions in only the vaguest terms They do not wish to provoke CCP ire Of course Western companies could always just say no to the CCP s demands or they could conclusively prove their commitment to their home countries and democratic principles by being willing to sever their ties with China The reason they do not do this is simple once these companies have invested resources to establish their presence in China and particularly once they are generating profits in China they have too much to lose But why would Western firms agree to such contractual terms in the first place For the same reasons they comply when the CCP makes its demands money The prospect of tapping into the world s largest economy is too enticing for companies to pass up Perhaps corporate America s proclivity to focus on short term profits blinds companies to the very real risks of making deals with China Or perhaps they do not believe China would actually try to manipulate them in such a way though it is clear from the examples of Standard Chartered and HSBC that China very much would https www cnn com 2020 06 04 business hsbc standard chartered hong kong law intl hnk index html These companies also may ultimately be agnostic about the countries and the principles to which they are loyal But for whatever permutation of reasons foreign banks right now are happily walking into the honeytrap the CCP has set for them Insidious as all of this is one cannot help but marvel at the strategic genius of using our own short term thinking against us As I often say China looks miles down the road we look inches down the road 3 Why This Matters for the American People From tech to fashion to the media Western industries are becoming increasingly complicit in China s manifold human rights violations https www amnesty org en countries asia and the pacific china report china I fear banks soon will be as well but there are two bases for cautious optimism One is the bipartisan support in Washington for sanctions against China for its human rights abuses If enough political momentum can be built before China exercises its influence over American banks and their lobbying power this could prevent serious problems down the road However there would need to be an international effort on this because the U S cannot deter China alone Though the Republicans have sought to frame Joe Biden as being China s choice the reality is that Biden is not only a China hawk he also has the diplomatic dexterity to bring world leaders back to the U S s side for a concerted effort The other source of hope lies with U S citizens becoming increasingly aware of China s game plan and articulating their concerns through their purchasing patterns The banks need to understand that we know they have choices in this matter and that the best choices would be those that are loyal to U S interests Activist led movements like the recent call to boycott Disney s https www washingtonpost com world 2020 09 05 mulan disney china hongkong boycott Mulan https www washingtonpost com world 2020 09 05 mulan disney china hongkong boycott raise the likelihood that Americans will become more concerned about these issues The challenge here is that the Covid 19 pandemic and ensuing economic crisis in America have created an atmosphere of self preservation and this has emboldened China to push harder and faster to take their plan to the next stage We the people can and should become more active players by bringing China s nationalist agenda to the center of the national discussion not at the expense of the other issues we care so deeply about the economy the coronavirus the preservation of democracy but precisely in the name of them

fellow astronauts I bring good tidings from a planet you have yet to notice in the observatory GME and BB are going to Mars but I d like to pull some of your attention to Keywords Studios Nobody on Reddit has discovered this baby yet so I d like to introduce her to you and your wife s boyfriend BACKGROUND KWS is a UK based outsourcing video games company with studios across the globd Their goal is to become the go to provider of video games services If you ve ever played a game and seen the long list of credits from all the different studios that work on a game many are outsourcing studios hired to assist with production Right now video game outsourcing is very fragmented You have small studios here and there doing work but let s say that you need help with artwork voice acting and quality assurance you d need to hire three different studios to do all that work which takes time and effort KWS want to be a provider of every kind of service If I need artwork voice acting and QA I go directly to KWS as a single company and they set me up with studios that they own all across the globe The video gaming industry is expected to grow to 300 billion by 2025 a CAGR of 13 As the industry grows and games get larger and more ambitious it becomes impossible for these single studios to handle the workload Just take a look at the recent Cyberpunk 2077 with all the time it had for development and see how bugs and glitches defined its release When games get more ambitious more help is needed The outsourcing industry will grow right behind the gaming industry Even movies require loads of different studios working together to produce the final product Gaming is moving in this direction as we speak But why not invest in TakeTwo or EA Don t they make a lot more Absolutely but it s a lot riskier Imagine being a CDPR investor and watching your stonks turn to dust because of one bad release Gaming companies are unpredictable Keywords avoid this uncertainty by signing contracts that guarantee them money based on the time and resources that go into helping out They don t see any money that comes from the actual sales of the games This means that if a game does incredibly well and racks in millions from microtransactions Keywords don t see a dime from that extra cash But it the game absolutely blows and nobody buys it Keywords aren t burned as they still get paid for helping make the game It s the safe bet if you want exposure to the gaming industry without getting your hands dirty THE DETAILS Since 2013 Keywords have been acquiring studios left and right to grow their family and they recently made one of their biggest acquisitions High Voltage Studios for 50 million High Voltage were the studio helping pump out content for Fortnite These guys were entertaining your younger siblings and you probably had no idea In 2020 alone they acquired 7 studios and they have no plans on slowing down Covid has hit some of these independent studios hard and this is where KWS come in and swoop them up By far the two biggest sectors for Keywords are Game Development and Functionality QA making up 22 and 21 of revenue respectively in H1 2020 Game development grew a staggering 25 7 organically in H1 2020 despite all the challenges with the pandemic Now it is fair to say that the game development sector is one that KWS have recently entered into only taking the dive in 2017 However generating 38 7 million of revenue in H1 2020 after only 3 years is quite impressive and this is before some of the big acquisitions they made at the end of the year In total for H1 2020 they made 173 5m representing a YoY growth of 13 Their EBITDA was 30 8m growing 19 3 YoY Not only are they making more more revenue but they are becoming more profitable in the process They also reinvested in their current studios back in 2019 with more workstations and equipment They expected to reap the benefits of this in 2020 but that s been delayed into 2021 so this will be a big year for them Keywords aren t a new company They IPO d in 2013 and since formed excellent relationships with the biggest gaming companies in the world They ve worked with the likes of EA Disney Blizzard etc I mentioned earlier that they want to be the go to provider and they are already proving this in the numbers In the whole of 2019 they had 108 clients using 3 or more of their services In H1 2020 alone they already have 124 clients using 3 or more of their services These clients love the convenience of going to one company for all your outsourcing needs Rumours are going around that Keywords could be looking into movies and TV but that s a tough industry to break into and they ve found a great niche already But more movies and shows are using Unreal Engine and other game related tools for production so it isn t a far fetched idea H2 2020 is going to be massive with the effects of their acquisitions being felt I m expecting huge earnings COMPETITION As I said before the outsourcing industry is very fragmented so the studios you ll find directly competing with Keywords are small and often only provide one or two services The only noteworthy competitor I ve seen is Virtuos Studios although they are much younger than Keywords much smaller in terms of workforce only provide two services and aren t publicly traded STOCK ACTION Keywords has had a huge run up this year up over 70 since the dip in March This was due in part to institutions upgrading it to a BUY Barclays was one of the big ones to upgrade stating Keywords Studios offers low risk video games exposure and setting a price target of 29 50 Since the run up Berenberg have downgraded Keywords from a BUY to a HOLD but still raised their price target to 28 90 from 25 10 basically stating that they were worried that accelerated growth will place pressure on margin how stupid So the stock has been dipping since then and is down nearly 10 this week If you re looking for a good entry point you won t find a better one UPCOMING NEWS Keywords won t be releasing their full year results until April so there s gonna be slow movement in the stock Be smart and get in now before the lead up to earnings THIS IS A LONG TERM PLAY FINAL VERDICT Clearly you guys won t read my DD but this is a solid buy 2021 is KWS year and I won t be surprised if it s worth 4 5 billion by the end of the year MY POSITION I m a broke student so I m only 14 shares deep but I m dollar cost averaging on these dips so expect me to have 100 end of year TL DR KWS offers low risk exposure to games industry They have basically no competition and are becoming big The stock has dipped so this is a good entry point Obligatory rockets since my wall of text is boring Let me know your thoughts on the company

or Sell AMZN , Should you buy Amazon stock or has it run out of growth opportunities What is my price prediction for Amazon Read until the end of the post as I reveal my price target for Amazon and why I believe it can deliver insane returns Very Very Long Post Hello everyone and welcome to another stock price prediction Today we are going to talk about Amazon and what s the upside for the company So let s go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental technical analysis predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years amp months So let s start by talking a little about Amazon https ibb co 47vPnY2 yeah I know it s one of the biggest companies in the world but I believe Amazon is still undervalued amp underappreciated compared to some of the highflyers that have generate insane returns in the past months though most of them are still far from profitability and don t have the growth across all the board like Amazon Maybe the market doesn t put as much attention in the numbers as I do but I would rather invest in a business which I consider to be healthy and growing rather than a what if stock like many of the recent inflated IPOs Amazon is a trillion dollar company growing at a double digit pace as many companies that are a fraction of their size would kill for this numbers but this hasn t helped Amazon since September On a global scale e commerce is expected to increase from 16 to 22 of retail sales by 2023 With the U S expected to increase its retail e commerce sales from 374 billion to 476 billion by 2024 This is another thing that supports the growth that e commerce has in front of it both as total and as a of the total retail sales With the latest report https ibb co jRMvB7x showing a 24 increase in holiday e commerce transactions and a 19 increase for the 2020 fiscal year E commerce is showing signs that it will continue to gain share of the total market as a recent report projects that digital sales during the Black Friday to Cyber Monday period will grow by about 35 YOY reaching penetration https ibb co 3StWbwz of around 32 and growing by more 10B as this continues to eat up market share from more traditional B amp M retailers I think one of the biggest problems the company has it s the actual share price of the company not the value We have seen that a stock split can and will attract more buyers and the share price would probably see an accelerated rate of growth just look at what happened with Tesla and Apple recently https ibb co GFqGsjV By splitting the stock just like Apple https ibb co d766wL5 has done a number of times this allows more individual investors to invest in the company as they will be attracted by the cheaper share price Amazon https ibb co XStd5Jf hasn t done a share split since the dot com era and it might be time for the company to take advantage of this hot bull market to actually go ahead with something like at least a 5 10 1 split So let s go a little through the latest quarter results https ibb co Y8JHWdc and guidance https ibb co mCT3T43 The company increased the operating cash flow by more than 55 to over 55B for the latest twelve months with free cash flow also increasing by 6B while they managed to avoid significant dilution https ibb co 6bYCLhx of the company with only 7M additional shares being outstanding The net sales also increased 37 in the last quarter to just over 96B an increase of more than 26B over 2019 which is an insane 36 increase y y yet again This year Amazon has also pushed their Prime Day https ibb co 1RPqhMv ahead of schedule which resulted in the two biggest days ever for third party small amp medium sellers which saw an increase in sales of over 60 over 2019 even bigger than Amazon own retail business Amazon continues to expand into multiple revenue streams with the first Amazon Fresh https ibb co 9ZBqwKM grocery store opened in California which is offering both in store and online products We also saw Amazon s more profitable revenue streams meaning the services revenues increasing with Amazon Studios continuing to produce original movies and TV series while also expanding their offering to live sport games The company is also seeking to expand into the red hot Video Gaming market as they launched a new service Prime Gaming available for free for Prime Members and also announced Luna which will be a cloud gaming service that will allow customers to play high quality games on previously owned devices thus not requiring bigger investments for many customers They also continued to improve their devices https ibb co VVkyDXX like the Echo Alexa Ring and FireTV line of products which feature more amp more AI Improvements Amazon has also announced an expansion into the pharmacy business which put a lot of pressure on traditional pharmacy companies like CVS amp Walgreens while also announcing a new Halo service aimed at helping customers improve their lifestyle I like companies that make me a lot of money but I also like that they are involved https ibb co r7C6NXs in projects aimed at helping poorer communities around the world with their latest Project Kuiper being a low earth orbit satellite constellation that is aiming to provide reliable amp cheap internet access around the world And last but not least let s not forget about the biggest income provider as margin goes the Amazon Web Services AWS https ibb co MkHgG7d Amazon continued to see significant customer demand for this product with multiple big companies like Global Payments amp Moderna using their services Alongside these 2 companies we also saw AWS providing even more data services for the NFL https ibb co zbYySCp and many more other companies AWS has been a terrific revenue stream for Amazon with AWS https ibb co 87614m9 having 1 3 of the market share for cloud infrastructure in the first half of 2020 as the compound annual growth of AWS has been 40 in the recent years just below the other profitable services https ibb co 0Byn2R7 they offer on subscriptions services advertising amp payments with the only revenue stream seeing a negative growth being the physical stores Overall the company has seen a 28 compound annual growth https ibb co mCwDCTb in revenues since 2016 and an even bigger 68 growth https ibb co jk57Qq9 in earnings share which is incredible to say the least So before even starting you should now that I am bull on Amazon but I am willing to hear other opinions so don t be afraid to leave a comment down below I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates So keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on Firstly let s start with the Guidance that Amazon gave us for the 4th quarter as they are expecting net sales between 112B and 121B implying a growth of between 28 38 over 2019 They also provided guidance for the operating income but this is heavily impacted by the problems we had in 2020 and that still continue to be around The company also is aiming to optimize https ibb co 0ZTfncc the free cash flow which was up 26 y y for Q3 as they are trying to dilute the shares as little as possible The total net SALES https ibb co 7jsRCN5 for the last twelve months is nearing 348B which even adjusted for forex is still up 31 Amazon has only 12 of their revenues coming the AWS right now but this is by far the most profitable revenue for the company as the increases in AWS sales have led to an over 90 increase https ibb co ts6VKrb in operating income from the previous year Let s take a look at the last quarter s results We saw a big INCREASE https ibb co qrpk3wR in all 3 big revenue streams for Amazon with the first 9 months of 2020 brining over 160B in sales in North America 67B from International sales and almost 33B from AWS For my projections https ibb co 4FCPJ8N I actually just added another quarter like this one to the end results which actually is a conservative estimate of 96B compared to the guidance of 112B and the growth rate that Amazon s net sales has seen in the past year with North America Sales rising by 37 International by 31 and AWS by 30 For the cost of sales I did pretty much the same and with cost margin https ibb co wcP1Wrj standing at 75 of net sales for the last quarters I think this is pretty safe to say it will remain mostly the same if not even improve due to bigger revenues from the AWS I also estimated the full yearly costs by adding another identical quarter just like for the revenues so that things stay even For the other operating expenses I also took this from their financials as I expect both SG amp A https ibb co QN7YWxQ and R amp D https ibb co DwmXmsK expenses to start to normalize a little after the huge spending to ramp up capacity this year due to the increase in demand while I also did the same thing for the Capex https ibb co f0dSK7B spending of Amazon as they have invested massively in the last 12 months to ramp up things Meanwhile for the interest income https ibb co rdc1HRZ and expenses I also just averaged things out for the full year while maintaining the other sources of income but these have such a small impact that they don t even matter Amazon has had a pretty wild effective TAX RATE https ibb co N3vtKJn in the past decade but I decided to see what the avg was for the last 4years and that was 16 but for safety and due to the change in administration in the US I decided to bump this up a little to 18 And one last number that is important is THE https ibb co SnQGLXT earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization which has seen a 36 increase y y for since 2016 So let s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow PROJECTIONS https ibb co 89jHggN though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon I used the trailing Twelve month EBITA which means Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation amp Amortization and assumed a growth starting from of 15 in 2021 and slightly lower each year ending with a 10 growth for EBITA in 2025 EBIT is calculate after subtracting the depreciation and amortization costs from the EBITA for which I implied an annual increase of 10 so it keeps the pace with the EBITA I used my projection of the effective tax rate of the company of 18 which is 2 above the last 4 years avg NWC is the net working capital of the company and it can be summed up in 2 ways the simpler method is current assets current liabilities or you can use the more complex formula which I have used which is made up of the total amount of cash amp cash equivalents market investments trade accounts receivable and inventory from which you subtract the trade accounts payable so this is the formula I used for this DCF I also implied the same 10 growth for this as the company will become even more solvent overtime I estimate And last but not least I implied a 10 growth for Capital Expenditure as well which seems pretty reasonable despite this level being very high due to the rapid growth of the company Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method but for this company I think the growth approach is better suited as you will see with my other method which will show close results to growth approach So this means we have an estimated 584B worth of FCF for a 10 discount rate which I believe can be even lower for Amazon but just to be conservative let s use this 10 rate for the next 5 years I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 5 rate after 2025 and that would mean that Amazon will be worth over 3T by 2025 which is mind blowing So let s do the math with an estimated diluted share count of 531M that would mean a stock price of 5732 and would imply a return of 83 by 2025 This are insanely huge numbers so let s take a look at the EBITDA approach also The nominal value for the EBITDA multiple is usually 25 so with this multiple the company would only be worth 3200 that would be only a 2 6 gain from where it is now If you do want to be conservative you can also do an average of this and the average price would be 4470 with an average return of 43 which would be pretty much in line with the annual SP500 growth You can also check and do your own multiple valuation of the company for example with Amazon right now has been trading at very high EBITDA multiple until recently so if you use a 50x multiple https ibb co VWDxGcg the actual projections of the stock would be very close with 71 return for the EBITDA approach and a 77 upside on average but I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation approach which is not the DCF method I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings So let s take a look at what Amazon earnings share will be by 2025 I implied for the 3 main streams of revenues https ibb co KVnYyqC which are North American Sales International Sales and AWS sales a rate of growth similar to the one we had this year but with gradual declines each subsequent year I also used pretty much the same average cost of sales https ibb co 3sv40Sf which includes the actual cost of sales and the fulfillment costs This has stood at about 75 of the net revenues for the past years and might actually improve but I do want to stay on the safe side So by 2025 the gross REVENUES https ibb co xSdQX9P should reach around 244B assuming margins stay pretty much in line though it s likely they will improve margins with International sales becoming a little more profitable and AWS brining more amp more money We also have to estimated what the Capex amp Operating expenses https ibb co HHM0PfS would be by 2025 I think Amazon should see somewhat of a slowdown of Capex R amp D amp SG amp A spending as they have seen a huge boost in the past year and I think it should normalize so I will imply an 8 annual growth for these which is still very high Next https ibb co F75r4jN we look at the interest income expense and other losses or incomes for the company This numbers are small compared to the vast cash flows of the company that they can even be ignored but let s assume they see a 10 decrease both in income and expenses related to interest while also not suffering losses but having a smaller other income by 10 year This would results in an almost 114B income pre tax for 2025 As I showed you earlier the effective tax rate for Amazon has been around 16 in the past 4 years despite the nominal US tax rate For safety reasons I will use an 18 tax rate though this should stay closers to 16 on the back of the International taxes So with an 18 tax rate the FINAL https ibb co d7ZCstY income for the company after everything has been taken into consideration should be 93 25B For the outstanding shares https ibb co x33HyxP I will be conservative and imply a 5 increase in outstanding shares as the company has been very careful in avoiding the dilution of the stock So with that increase by 2025 we should have around 531M shares So BASED https ibb co 282sK42 on Price to Future Earnings share we can see Amazon is currently trading at almost 18 times 2025 earnings share which compared to the 90 multiple it s trading right now would be insanely low I can see Amazon continuing to trade at very high P E for the foreseeable future So with a 25 PE price the company should trade at 4400 while with a 50 PE ratio the stock should be close to 9000 share which is insane when you think about that number but maybe Bezos will listen and split the shares finally Compare https ibb co ChhMP6Z this to the DCF https ibb co 1TM7FWd valuation and you see that the Perpetuity approach is similar to a 35 PE ratio while the AVG approach is similar to a 25 PE Ratio which I don t expect Amazon to trade at not even in 5 years So after all these estimates what are my price targets HERE https ibb co 2d2KPV4 are my actual price targets I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Amazon trade at is 4828 which would imply a return of over 54 while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Amazon will trade at 6145 share by the end of 2025 implying a 96 5 return on the current price https ibb co FwrMhnY My most bullish case though is 7900 which would imply a return of 152 with that number being mind blowing given the current valuation of the company but I guess we do have to start getting used with such high numbers I guess decades ago when we saw the first millionaire or billionaire people would have also thought that it was crazy but crazy is for the limited minds only I believe So yeah guys here is my OVERALL https ibb co XF5h87q price targets for 2025 my bear case is an average of the 25 amp 30 PE ratio while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 40 PE s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 40 50 So HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 1O rAl569qptpB1n1k6hpLLdOroX045 JDHrXLj81 u0 edit is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for Amazon by 2025 if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below I think I have been conservative in most of my projections but feel free to give your opinion Keep in mind these targets might sound ridiculous but just look at the growth Amazon has in the past The company has increased in value https ibb co QpDg4mp by more 450 in just the past 5 years and is over 160 000 up since it started trading https ibb co KyDzqWq So yes the valuation is mad right now for the company So are you willing to bet against one of the biggest and fastest growing companies in the world The company also has pristine FINANCIALS https ibb co Bgxf91m with more than 112B in current assets vs only 102B in current liabilities with over 282B in total assets So the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future And let s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts We can see that the analysts expect a similar EPS https ibb co R48nrDF by 2025 of around 166 compared to 171 shares that my Growth Valuations are projecting So it seems that this could be a very reasonable upside for the company So what do I expect in the next couple of days weeks and months for Amazon Let s look at this CHART https ibb co kHwWq4x so starting with the high the stock made before the September sell off The stock has been trading in this wedge formation for the last couple of months with increasingly higher lows The stock isn t overbought and hasn t been since it saw an RSI of 73 when it reached the all time highs I think with this wedge formation building up with increasing higher lows and with the pattern of trading likely being an Elliot Theory 5 WAVE https ibb co MBqPyc2 formation I think it s very likely we see a breakout in the near future maybe just before earnings and I expect this breakout to mimic the last run the stock had of about 23 up So with that 23 increase mirrored that would result the stock should peak around 3900 https ibb co VBpRv6j which I expect to see by the end of the year And let s take a quick look at what 47 analysts https ibb co YT0BPTP on wall street are saying They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of 3800 and a high price target of 4600 which is insane for a return in the next 12 months as 46 of the 47 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Amazon So yet again the 3900 isn t that out of possibilities even as Wall Street s analysts expect So what would I do Well I own Amazon stock and I believe it still has tremendous room to grow so I would start building a position as I expect the company to resume its uptrend sooner rather than later and the next catalyst may be just a couple of weeks away with the last quarter earnings https ibb co nLhCJpk expected to be announced by the end of January And I shouldn t forget to mention that I believe Amazon is one of the most stable stocks out with very good leadership https ibb co 7KS3yS6 and with large institutional holders https ibb co 8Dj1W3C like Vanguard BlackRock and Morgan Stanley owning huge amounts of the company So THIS https ibb co 2d2KPV4 are my projections and my expectations for the company and if you do want to check

or Sell AMZN , Should you buy Amazon stock or has it run out of growth opportunities What is my price prediction for Amazon Read until the end of the post as I reveal my price target for Amazon and why I believe it can deliver insane returns Very Very Long Post Hello everyone and welcome to another stock price prediction Today we are going to talk about Amazon and what s the upside for the company So let s go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental technical analysis predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years amp months So let s start by talking a little about Amazon https ibb co 47vPnY2 yeah I know it s one of the biggest companies in the world but I believe Amazon is still undervalued amp underappreciated compared to some of the highflyers that have generate insane returns in the past months though most of them are still far from profitability and don t have the growth across all the board like Amazon Maybe the market doesn t put as much attention in the numbers as I do but I would rather invest in a business which I consider to be healthy and growing rather than a what if stock like many of the recent inflated IPOs Amazon is a trillion dollar company growing at a double digit pace as many companies that are a fraction of their size would kill for this numbers but this hasn t helped Amazon since September On a global scale e commerce is expected to increase from 16 to 22 of retail sales by 2023 With the U S expected to increase its retail e commerce sales from 374 billion to 476 billion by 2024 This is another thing that supports the growth that e commerce has in front of it both as total and as a of the total retail sales With the latest report https ibb co jRMvB7x showing a 24 increase in holiday e commerce transactions and a 19 increase for the 2020 fiscal year E commerce is showing signs that it will continue to gain share of the total market as a recent report projects that digital sales during the Black Friday to Cyber Monday period will grow by about 35 YOY reaching penetration https ibb co 3StWbwz of around 32 and growing by more 10B as this continues to eat up market share from more traditional B amp M retailers I think one of the biggest problems the company has it s the actual share price of the company not the value We have seen that a stock split can and will attract more buyers and the share price would probably see an accelerated rate of growth just look at what happened with Tesla and Apple recently https ibb co GFqGsjV By splitting the stock just like Apple https ibb co d766wL5 has done a number of times this allows more individual investors to invest in the company as they will be attracted by the cheaper share price Amazon https ibb co XStd5Jf hasn t done a share split since the dot com era and it might be time for the company to take advantage of this hot bull market to actually go ahead with something like at least a 5 10 1 split So let s go a little through the latest quarter results https ibb co Y8JHWdc and guidance https ibb co mCT3T43 The company increased the operating cash flow by more than 55 to over 55B for the latest twelve months with free cash flow also increasing by 6B while they managed to avoid significant dilution https ibb co 6bYCLhx of the company with only 7M additional shares being outstanding The net sales also increased 37 in the last quarter to just over 96B an increase of more than 26B over 2019 which is an insane 36 increase y y yet again This year Amazon has also pushed their Prime Day https ibb co 1RPqhMv ahead of schedule which resulted in the two biggest days ever for third party small amp medium sellers which saw an increase in sales of over 60 over 2019 even bigger than Amazon own retail business Amazon continues to expand into multiple revenue streams with the first Amazon Fresh https ibb co 9ZBqwKM grocery store opened in California which is offering both in store and online products We also saw Amazon s more profitable revenue streams meaning the services revenues increasing with Amazon Studios continuing to produce original movies and TV series while also expanding their offering to live sport games The company is also seeking to expand into the red hot Video Gaming market as they launched a new service Prime Gaming available for free for Prime Members and also announced Luna which will be a cloud gaming service that will allow customers to play high quality games on previously owned devices thus not requiring bigger investments for many customers They also continued to improve their devices https ibb co VVkyDXX like the Echo Alexa Ring and FireTV line of products which feature more amp more AI Improvements Amazon has also announced an expansion into the pharmacy business which put a lot of pressure on traditional pharmacy companies like CVS amp Walgreens while also announcing a new Halo service aimed at helping customers improve their lifestyle I like companies that make me a lot of money but I also like that they are involved https ibb co r7C6NXs in projects aimed at helping poorer communities around the world with their latest Project Kuiper being a low earth orbit satellite constellation that is aiming to provide reliable amp cheap internet access around the world And last but not least let s not forget about the biggest income provider as margin goes the Amazon Web Services AWS https ibb co MkHgG7d Amazon continued to see significant customer demand for this product with multiple big companies like Global Payments amp Moderna using their services Alongside these 2 companies we also saw AWS providing even more data services for the NFL https ibb co zbYySCp and many more other companies AWS has been a terrific revenue stream for Amazon with AWS https ibb co 87614m9 having 1 3 of the market share for cloud infrastructure in the first half of 2020 as the compound annual growth of AWS has been 40 in the recent years just below the other profitable services https ibb co 0Byn2R7 they offer on subscriptions services advertising amp payments with the only revenue stream seeing a negative growth being the physical stores Overall the company has seen a 28 compound annual growth https ibb co mCwDCTb in revenues since 2016 and an even bigger 68 growth https ibb co jk57Qq9 in earnings share which is incredible to say the least So before even starting you should now that I am bull on Amazon but I am willing to hear other opinions so don t be afraid to leave a comment down below I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates So keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on Firstly let s start with the Guidance that Amazon gave us for the 4th quarter as they are expecting net sales between 112B and 121B implying a growth of between 28 38 over 2019 They also provided guidance for the operating income but this is heavily impacted by the problems we had in 2020 and that still continue to be around The company also is aiming to optimize https ibb co 0ZTfncc the free cash flow which was up 26 y y for Q3 as they are trying to dilute the shares as little as possible The total net SALES https ibb co 7jsRCN5 for the last twelve months is nearing 348B which even adjusted for forex is still up 31 Amazon has only 12 of their revenues coming the AWS right now but this is by far the most profitable revenue for the company as the increases in AWS sales have led to an over 90 increase https ibb co ts6VKrb in operating income from the previous year Let s take a look at the last quarter s results We saw a big INCREASE https ibb co qrpk3wR in all 3 big revenue streams for Amazon with the first 9 months of 2020 brining over 160B in sales in North America 67B from International sales and almost 33B from AWS For my projections https ibb co 4FCPJ8N I actually just added another quarter like this one to the end results which actually is a conservative estimate of 96B compared to the guidance of 112B and the growth rate that Amazon s net sales has seen in the past year with North America Sales rising by 37 International by 31 and AWS by 30 For the cost of sales I did pretty much the same and with cost margin https ibb co wcP1Wrj standing at 75 of net sales for the last quarters I think this is pretty safe to say it will remain mostly the same if not even improve due to bigger revenues from the AWS I also estimated the full yearly costs by adding another identical quarter just like for the revenues so that things stay even For the other operating expenses I also took this from their financials as I expect both SG amp A https ibb co QN7YWxQ and R amp D https ibb co DwmXmsK expenses to start to normalize a little after the huge spending to ramp up capacity this year due to the increase in demand while I also did the same thing for the Capex https ibb co f0dSK7B spending of Amazon as they have invested massively in the last 12 months to ramp up things Meanwhile for the interest income https ibb co rdc1HRZ and expenses I also just averaged things out for the full year while maintaining the other sources of income but these have such a small impact that they don t even matter Amazon has had a pretty wild effective TAX RATE https ibb co N3vtKJn in the past decade but I decided to see what the avg was for the last 4years and that was 16 but for safety and due to the change in administration in the US I decided to bump this up a little to 18 And one last number that is important is THE https ibb co SnQGLXT earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization which has seen a 36 increase y y for since 2016 So let s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow PROJECTIONS https ibb co 89jHggN though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon I used the trailing Twelve month EBITA which means Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation amp Amortization and assumed a growth starting from of 15 in 2021 and slightly lower each year ending with a 10 growth for EBITA in 2025 EBIT is calculate after subtracting the depreciation and amortization costs from the EBITA for which I implied an annual increase of 10 so it keeps the pace with the EBITA I used my projection of the effective tax rate of the company of 18 which is 2 above the last 4 years avg NWC is the net working capital of the company and it can be summed up in 2 ways the simpler method is current assets current liabilities or you can use the more complex formula which I have used which is made up of the total amount of cash amp cash equivalents market investments trade accounts receivable and inventory from which you subtract the trade accounts payable so this is the formula I used for this DCF I also implied the same 10 growth for this as the company will become even more solvent overtime I estimate And last but not least I implied a 10 growth for Capital Expenditure as well which seems pretty reasonable despite this level being very high due to the rapid growth of the company Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method but for this company I think the growth approach is better suited as you will see with my other method which will show close results to growth approach So this means we have an estimated 584B worth of FCF for a 10 discount rate which I believe can be even lower for Amazon but just to be conservative let s use this 10 rate for the next 5 years I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 5 rate after 2025 and that would mean that Amazon will be worth over 3T by 2025 which is mind blowing So let s do the math with an estimated diluted share count of 531M that would mean a stock price of 5732 and would imply a return of 83 by 2025 This are insanely huge numbers so let s take a look at the EBITDA approach also The nominal value for the EBITDA multiple is usually 25 so with this multiple the company would only be worth 3200 that would be only a 2 6 gain from where it is now If you do want to be conservative you can also do an average of this and the average price would be 4470 with an average return of 43 which would be pretty much in line with the annual SP500 growth You can also check and do your own multiple valuation of the company for example with Amazon right now has been trading at very high EBITDA multiple until recently so if you use a 50x multiple https ibb co VWDxGcg the actual projections of the stock would be very close with 71 return for the EBITDA approach and a 77 upside on average but I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation approach which is not the DCF method I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings So let s take a look at what Amazon earnings share will be by 2025 I implied for the 3 main streams of revenues https ibb co KVnYyqC which are North American Sales International Sales and AWS sales a rate of growth similar to the one we had this year but with gradual declines each subsequent year I also used pretty much the same average cost of sales https ibb co 3sv40Sf which includes the actual cost of sales and the fulfillment costs This has stood at about 75 of the net revenues for the past years and might actually improve but I do want to stay on the safe side So by 2025 the gross REVENUES https ibb co xSdQX9P should reach around 244B assuming margins stay pretty much in line though it s likely they will improve margins with International sales becoming a little more profitable and AWS brining more amp more money We also have to estimated what the Capex amp Operating expenses https ibb co HHM0PfS would be by 2025 I think Amazon should see somewhat of a slowdown of Capex R amp D amp SG amp A spending as they have seen a huge boost in the past year and I think it should normalize so I will imply an 8 annual growth for these which is still very high Next https ibb co F75r4jN we look at the interest income expense and other losses or incomes for the company This numbers are small compared to the vast cash flows of the company that they can even be ignored but let s assume they see a 10 decrease both in income and expenses related to interest while also not suffering losses but having a smaller other income by 10 year This would results in an almost 114B income pre tax for 2025 As I showed you earlier the effective tax rate for Amazon has been around 16 in the past 4 years despite the nominal US tax rate For safety reasons I will use an 18 tax rate though this should stay closers to 16 on the back of the International taxes So with an 18 tax rate the FINAL https ibb co d7ZCstY income for the company after everything has been taken into consideration should be 93 25B For the outstanding shares https ibb co x33HyxP I will be conservative and imply a 5 increase in outstanding shares as the company has been very careful in avoiding the dilution of the stock So with that increase by 2025 we should have around 531M shares So BASED https ibb co 282sK42 on Price to Future Earnings share we can see Amazon is currently trading at almost 18 times 2025 earnings share which compared to the 90 multiple it s trading right now would be insanely low I can see Amazon continuing to trade at very high P E for the foreseeable future So with a 25 PE price the company should trade at 4400 while with a 50 PE ratio the stock should be close to 9000 share which is insane when you think about that number but maybe Bezos will listen and split the shares finally Compare https ibb co ChhMP6Z this to the DCF https ibb co 1TM7FWd valuation and you see that the Perpetuity approach is similar to a 35 PE ratio while the AVG approach is similar to a 25 PE Ratio which I don t expect Amazon to trade at not even in 5 years So after all these estimates what are my price targets HERE https ibb co 2d2KPV4 are my actual price targets I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Amazon trade at is 4828 which would imply a return of over 54 while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Amazon will trade at 6145 share by the end of 2025 implying a 96 5 return on the current price https ibb co FwrMhnY My most bullish case though is 7900 which would imply a return of 152 with that number being mind blowing given the current valuation of the company but I guess we do have to start getting used with such high numbers I guess decades ago when we saw the first millionaire or billionaire people would have also thought that it was crazy but crazy is for the limited minds only I believe So yeah guys here is my OVERALL https ibb co XF5h87q price targets for 2025 my bear case is an average of the 25 amp 30 PE ratio while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 40 PE s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 40 50 So HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 1O rAl569qptpB1n1k6hpLLdOroX045 JDHrXLj81 u0 edit is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for Amazon by 2025 if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below I think I have been conservative in most of my projections but feel free to give your opinion Keep in mind these targets might sound ridiculous but just look at the growth Amazon has in the past The company has increased in value https ibb co QpDg4mp by more 450 in just the past 5 years and is over 160 000 up since it started trading https ibb co KyDzqWq So yes the valuation is mad right now for the company So are you willing to bet against one of the biggest and fastest growing companies in the world The company also has pristine FINANCIALS https ibb co Bgxf91m with more than 112B in current assets vs only 102B in current liabilities with over 282B in total assets So the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future And let s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts We can see that the analysts expect a similar EPS https ibb co R48nrDF by 2025 of around 166 compared to 171 shares that my Growth Valuations are projecting So it seems that this could be a very reasonable upside for the company So what do I expect in the next couple of days weeks and months for Amazon Let s look at this CHART https ibb co kHwWq4x so starting with the high the stock made before the September sell off The stock has been trading in this wedge formation for the last couple of months with increasingly higher lows The stock isn t overbought and hasn t been since it saw an RSI of 73 when it reached the all time highs I think with this wedge formation building up with increasing higher lows and with the pattern of trading likely being an Elliot Theory 5 WAVE https ibb co MBqPyc2 formation I think it s very likely we see a breakout in the near future maybe just before earnings and I expect this breakout to mimic the last run the stock had of about 23 up So with that 23 increase mirrored that would result the stock should peak around 3900 https ibb co VBpRv6j which I expect to see by the end of the year And let s take a quick look at what 47 analysts https ibb co YT0BPTP on wall street are saying They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of 3800 and a high price target of 4600 which is insane for a return in the next 12 months as 46 of the 47 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Amazon So yet again the 3900 isn t that out of possibilities even as Wall Street s analysts expect So what would I do Well I own Amazon stock and I believe it still has tremendous room to grow so I would start building a position as I expect the company to resume its uptrend sooner rather than later and the next catalyst may be just a couple of weeks away with the last quarter earnings https ibb co nLhCJpk expected to be announced by the end of January And I shouldn t forget to mention that I believe Amazon is one of the most stable stocks out with very good leadership https ibb co 7KS3yS6 and with large institutional holders https ibb co 8Dj1W3C like Vanguard BlackRock and Morgan Stanley owning huge amounts of the company So THIS https ibb co 2d2KPV4 are my projections and my expectations for the company and if you do want to check

have a discount trading bot which gives out https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kuwg1e i have a discount trading bot which gives out amp x200B Background My discount bot to help r wallstreetbets It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard My private codes was used to develop it and it s very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it I rather post updates freely at no cost to anyone than give out the code I will not be posting this hourly It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future I will post during open though Discord and telegram admins don t try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people when you don t even own the codes behind it There are a lot of SPY500 boomer companies within the bot I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there There won t be any sell signals as stocks only go up so I rather just do a discount algorithm Batch 1 Algorithm Bot Human Judgement Batch 2 Algorithm Bot Judgement Only This is a one man bot amp x200B Bot Overview It s showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits Backtesting has not been done do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all Rather use this as a side tool amp x200B Key Pharma companies are very risky Meme Hype stocks are very risky Companies that you don t know how they work are very risky Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train what NKLA is to TSLA I have a very low amount in options less than 500 and I have 100k in shares and cash When doing options have a lot of collateral so you don t hit margin call Take the Calls as very discounted and Potentially A Call as somewhat discounted Old money companies are slow While tech companies are fast paced Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in You don t have to invest every day only when you see the potential amp x200B amp x200B gt At Close of Thursday amp x200B Batch 1 Data Processing amp Outsourced Services MA Mastercard Inc Financial

Stock I started a position in Transocean s stock RIG This is a risky but highly asymmetric opportunity Transocean has 20 short interest which I believe exists largely because shorts haven t appreciated the dramatic recovery in macro They think offshore drilling is a dead industry and over the last decade they have been right But if rigs are materially retired and oil prices come higher dayrates to incentivize new work have to go higher Any rigs built before 2010 will never see another contract per management Transocean has 9 of the top 30 Harsh environment semi subs And all the active rigs can drill in12k feet of water But the real catalyst is the price of oil If I am correct Transocean s EBITDA and FCF figures will be much higher than sellside consensus is penciling today Transocean s assets are actively contracted 80 of the revenue forecast is contracted today Sell side and shorts think that at 60 bbl all producer discipline erodes again Private equity shale turns the taps back on and we re back to massive oversupply But shale can t supply the world the oil it needs The big players need 100M barrel projects to secure the oil future and renewables supply is not even going to be even remotely close to what we need in the next 5 years Shale only lasts 1 3 years and 60 80 of deposits are gone in year 1 Offshore drilling is a 20 year useful life on those mega deposits but is it expensive and hard to drill taking longer for barrels to flow That s why offshore drilling is so expensive Oil bulls basically believe shale won t be enough to fulfill demand so we will need offshore drilling If oil goes to 85 and more RIG could 7x There is no liquidity risk until at least 1H 2023 based on maturities and existing liquidity GS maps 700M liquidity at YE 2022 so 1H2023 would be the potential first filing This is also a reopening play EBITDA doubles when dayrates go up 75 kpd The hope is that when reopening occurs that supply demand imbalance is corrected quickly Shale won t be enough to satisfy world demand and that players stop looking to shale as it s not a great return Offshore is higher upfront capex but way better return especially at low prices Shale is like a bandaid that can only work at sustainably high oil prices What is Transocean Transocean is a large cap a leading provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells Operated 45 mobile offshore drilling units with 28 ultra deepwater floaters 14 harsh environment floaters and 3 midwater floaters They build drilling rigs related equipment and work crews on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells Transocean specializes in demanding regions of the global offshore drilling business with a focus on ultra deepwater and harsh environment drilling services They have one of the most versatile fleets in the world Deep water is the primary focus of large scale offshore oil exploration because most of the shallow water resources have already been explored The cost to remove a barrel of oil from the ground for deep water is higher than for shallow water with the breakeven coming at 60 barrel Given the long lifetime of exploration projects and production after resources have been identified the demand for deep water drilling rigs depends primarily on long term expectations for oil prices Oil prices are steadily increasing so the markets are projecting that deep water drilling will at least be marginally economical Transocean The Lone Survivor Transocean is the only offshore driller still solvent after the collapse of energy Trading at 20 short interest with liquidity and runway through 2022 Opportunity was created when all of Transocean s competitors were filing for bankruptcy Then came some nasty litigation with one of their lenders All behind us Offshore has a reason to exist and that shale is never coming back to 2019 levels It s a levered call option on oil Offshore believer Real business with contracts that weren t cut in the trough commodity cycle but if we don t get higher oil prices by end of Fy22 runway gets thin very fast And the industry is years late on scrapping underperforming assets Transocean has the best assets best cap structure and best management team The majority of Transocean s worse capitalized peers have all filed for bankruptcy and have finally started to retire rigs It is inevitable that there s consolidation and the overall rig asset pool starts to shrink Capital Structure Improvements I firmly believe there is no risk of Transocean filing for bankruptcy until 1H 2023 Transocean has active contracts with the biggest oil majors on the majority of vessels Transocean has total liquidity of 2 9B with cash of 1 4B 200M for debt service and a 1 3B revolver completely undrawn During Q3 2020 Transocean reduced debt by 1B reducing interest expense and extended liquidity runway Recent litigation with one of their creditors Whitebox was recently judged in Transocean s favor and any risk from that litigation creating a near term bankruptcy is completely in the rear view Macro Overview Oil prices going up just another 10 15 bbl makes a big difference for offshore drillers but specifically Transocean because the company has spent a lot of time retooling their wells simplifying designs to make them more profitable at the 50 bbl mark Any sustained pricing increase around 50 bbl bodes very well for offshore drilling where Transocean s competitiveness has increased a lot over the past few years They are taking market share from the bankrupt players The big question is what happens to shale in 2021 I believe short cycle high decline curve projects are not coming back In FY20 oil major management teams were 1 managing their balance sheet and 2 reinvesting in long cycle large deposit projects meaning offshore Over 10 years 0 reinvestment has gone to offshore Dayrates When entering 2020 dayrates cost to rent a rig exceeded 300k and ultra deepwater fixtures were around 250k a day which represented a 100 increase from fixtures signed earlier in 2019 Then Covid crushed demand while temporary increases in supply due to disputes among major producers broke 2020 momentum But delays in awards weren t cancelled they were deferred by 12 months Bidding activity in Q3 2020 doubled from Q2 2020 s low point and returned to pre covid levels During Q3 2020 they participated in 18 bids the same amount they did in Q4 2019 before Covid hit The marketable supply of rigs is likely to fall at a pace which meets contracted rig count which is already happening So when oil prices stabilize at more favorable levels an inflection in rig contracting should have an almost immediate and positive impact on dayrates due to the shortage of marketable rigs and the expense associated with reactivating stacked rigs Rig Oversupply Currently Being Addressed The industry is addressing rig oversupply Old rigs are getting stacked so the real active marketable fleet is shrinking If an oil major wants to sign an offshore driller into a long term arrangement it s going to require a rig reactivation But if it takes 50M to reactivate an asset at today s dayrate it isn t possible Therefore dayrates MUST go higher so the operator can get compensated on the front end for these reactivation costs The relative utilization of high spec assets is only going to get better Management s expectation is that the older less capable assets will be too costly to keep around and are not viable going forward I believe many of these rigs will never find another contract and will be scrapped improving market dynamics Simply put while oil is oversupplied today I think we are much closer to an oil supply shortage than the market thinks Oil amp gas companies have slashed investments in new wells at an incredible rate The reduced spending will take a toll on future production very soon Investors underestimate the amount of money required to build out the required renewable energy infrastructure across the globe Summary Transocean has most competitive floating feet in the industry with the strongest and most lucrative backlog providing visibility on future cash flows They re the leader in harsh environment and ultra deepwater drilling Management showed prudence in shoring up the balance sheet from 2016 2020 and I believe they will be rewarded for those efforts with significant market share gains in 2021 and beyond The setup of 20 short interest and increasing oil prices point to a win for RIG Disclosure I am long Transocean RIG equity

visual storytelling on a three story screen particularly when the film really takes advantage of the format Just think of what it s like to see the Millennium Falcon jump into hyperspace in The Force Awakens or the loving long takes near bodies of water in Moonlight It s tempting to think that sitting in a dark theater staring at a massive white sheet won t matter when everyone has 40 plus inch 4K TVs but scale has a unique ability to sweep you away You get pulled into the sound and color in a way that you don t feel when you re sitting on your couch at home There s nothing inherently wrong with watching Star Wars on your phone tablet laptop or TV It s just that seeing something cinematic blown up big for the eyes to feast on is still a unique worthwhile experience Focus In your own home there are too many things Some of these things are your roommates or family members who talk to you out loud and some of these things are phones computers pets and the temptation to get up and recheck the fridge every 20 minutes Even people who try their hardest to give a movie their undivided attention on a living room screen have fallen victim to temptations like Well I m just sitting here I might as well pay the electric bill In the movie theater all you have is your chair any snacks you brought or bought and the movie you re there to watch You also have an empty bladder because you thought ahead not wanting to have to get up in the middle of the film to climb over people and cause a ruckus Relentlessness Part of the advantage of that kind of focus is that movies that are tense scary or deeply emotional can cast much more of a spell over you when you don t have the option to pause or turn away from the worst then rewind later to catch it safely out of context Watching Get Out at home especially alone it might be tempting to take breaks from time to time to escape the oppressive emotions on the screen In the theater you don t have that option it s going on with or without you which makes everything more intense and insistent and demanding You can t get the same excitement and catharsis from an experience you completely control In the theater it s out of your hands and that loss of control is part of the emotional experience A massive speaker system Is it just me or was there a lot of heavy breathing in Get Out I realized this because I saw it in theaters and if it wasn t in surround sound it was at least a solid C shape Even if you ve got some at home speaker system so fancy it makes you say things like Just listen to those decibels while you re playing a Rush track it s still not as good as the theater s Horror movies in particular benefit from massive movie theater sound the jumps are jumpier the screams more blood curdling But it doesn t hurt to hear a catchy pop song played loud as heck in a romantic comedy s opening credits And now that we ve forced Ryan Gosling to start singing it s on us to listen to his voice in the most dramatic way possible Previews I love a nice music video and in particular a music video that gets me all riled up about Harry Stiles debut film What a nice way to start your evening being reminded of all the movie magic still to come in your life The previews are the perfect time to settle in open your Red Vines and clutch some cutie s shoulder while you shout Oh I want to see that You can always watch trailers on YouTube but the thrill is gone and there s probably no nearby shoulder to clutch Alone time Going to the movies with friends or your significant other can be a cherished pastime especially when you re surrounded by an excited audience But there s nothing quite like being in an empty theater the air conditioning blasting away while you re enjoying a film free from judgment or rude voices Not every film affords this kind of pleasure You certainly wouldn t watch The Rocky Horror Picture Show by yourself because that s a communal experience But the ability to have something as majestic as Princess Mononoke wash over you and you alone is a powerful thrill Disruption No not the kind where the dude in front of you won t stop shouting lame quips or the couple behind you keeps explaining the movie to each other Those disruptions are still annoying I mean disruption in the sense the word has taken on in cultural and professional circles where anything that shakes up the status quo gives you a chance to re evaluate it A problem with watching movies at home is that it makes the film watching experience blur into the same experience as surfing cable channels running a Netflix comedy show in the background while you do dishes or half assedly watching an Adventure Time marathon while stoned Leaving your house and going to a space specifically designed for movies disrupts your mental patterns and primes you for an experience Bragging rights Tell me which one sounds better When I saw A New Hope at midnight at the drive in vs When I watched A New Hope on VHS in 1982 There s no question okay That was just a rhetorical exercise Jordan Peele has succeeded in marketing Get Out as an unmissable event where attendance feels more like getting to go to an enviable concert or one night only stage performance than it does sidling into a matinee because you have nothing better to do I saw it at a sold out showing its opening weekend which was fun not only because everyone was yelling and laughing but also because not everyone in the world got to tl dr The word movie is contained in movie theater Positions 65 contracts of CNK 01 15 2023 65C amp 750 shares of

fuck up about GME for a second and Im gonna make you money y all heard alot about PLUG from a few places as of late Yes it has exploded 135 in the last month alone but it isn t over Right now the sentiment is bearish and I agree in the short term but long term PLUG is only going to keep growing There are a few key points I want to highlight PLUG is single highhandedly the largest hydrogen fuel cell titan in the industry 20 years of industry under its belt it now services Amazon with 40 000 active forklifts and Walmart uses roughly 10 000 active vehicles Now they are partnering with two more titans Renault and SK Group The French and South Korean markets respectively First Renault Renault is well established in France and is backed by the government itself The deal with Renault is HUGE for plug in the European market The two plan to establish an innovation center for development of fuel cell technology in LCV vehicles for future Renault platforms Initially heavy vans and utility They plan on combining manufacturing with Renault establishing a vertically integrated fuel cell stack system and a manufacturing center in France Expansion of refueling systems to accommodate the new market The deal will only accelerate in the future as Renault plans to adopt Plug Power technology in commercial fleets Why is Renault Interested Well the EU announced a plan calling for Europe to have at least six gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2024 A critical period for PLUG for a few more reasons and the production of up to 1 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen Doable sure but the bigger picture is this This is almost exactly how the rise of the solar industry happened EU plans into the future The European Union unveiled a plan this month to invest hundreds of billions of euros in technologies enabling it to get a substantial share of its energy from hydrogen by 2050 This is potentially insane https ec europa eu energy sites ener files hydrogen strategy pdf https ec europa eu energy sites ener files hydrogen strategy pdf Second group SK Group is planning to invest 1 5 billion USD in an intention to form a joint venture next year The goal is to provide South Korea and later a possibility of the larger Asian Market hydrogen fuel cell systems Particularly Infrastructure and electrolyzers power stations basically There is however no information if PLUG is planning on directly partnering with any manufacturers in Korea I will get to this later Why is SK Group interested in Plug Plans call to build a liquid hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 30 000 tons in Incheon in 2023 to be scaled up to 280 000 tons in 2025 The South Korean government s commitment to shift the to Hydrogen with 729 Million dollars this year A 30 increase from last year https www spglobal com platts en market insights latest news electric power 060120 asian countries accelerate hydrogen plans with policies and projects https www spglobal com platts en market insights latest news electric power 060120 asian countries accelerate hydrogen plans with policies and projects Now whats the point of all this infrastructure I understand the powerplants but is the future just going to be us driving in Amazon forklifts Says you a dumbass who doesnt do DD and leaves it up to others in what is basically a Casino Sweet summer child Hydrogen fuel is going to be big in the automotive scene Yes Papa Musk hates it so fucking what keep buying one year out calls 50 OTM and tell Musk to fuck off with how much bank you re going to make GM may have made a statement that they are going for ALL hydrogen back in 2017 but they have since rescinded that statement Their Hydrogen plan still remains though Fuel cell power trains will be used in military and commercial vehicles https twitter com mikewayland status 1283734665157922816 lang en https twitter com mikewayland status 1283734665157922816 lang en Honda is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology The Honda Clarity They plan on expanding on the line greatly as they seem to be extremely set on becoming green Hyundai is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology the Hyundai Nexo Hyundai Motor Group and its suppliers plan to spend of 7 6 trillion won US 6 7 billion through 2030 to raise production of fuel cells by more than 200 fold as the South Korean automaker targets to become a key player in the new energy vehicle technology So much money is flowing into Hydrogen fuel cell technology why is noone capitalizing on it The play Wait for volatility to die down PLUG has had a massive run up Truly tremendous and I m glad to have been in PLUG for a long while The hype is almost certainly blown up and general market attitude is that it is a sell which I agree with TLDR PLUG is going to return from low earth orbit to refuel my price target is 50 by mid FEB before PLUG does a Hindenburg and the price fucking explodes amp x200B Position Wait for good entry PLUG 70C 06 18 Yes its fucking expensive wait for better entry and learn how to do spreads dumbass You bet big and win big If you have more than 6 brain cells or are straight up fucking broke Buy LEAPS and Shares on the dip thats about to happen Im in for PLUG 100C 1 20 23 and will load up even more because its as high as Robinhood s shitty platform lets me go SPREADS LEARN HOW TO DO THEM STOP BEING POOR AND

me tendies in the form of GME and PLTR plays in the past couple months so I thought it was my turn to repay the favor with some DD on a company that I haven t seen posted about on here yet This isn t a short squeeze opportunity or an ARK darling that s up 100 in the past year The play here is Sorrento Therapeutics SRNE SRNE is a biotech company which specializes in researching the use of stem cells for cancer treatments as well as non opiod pain relief treatments However if you recognize the name its more likely due to their developing pipeline of COVID 19 offerings Since the outbreak began in March SRNE has applied their resources and existing competencies to developing treatments and testing kits to combat the pandemic In addition to their ongoing cancer and pain relief projects they have 11 potential COVID 19 related products in various stages of the pipeline You can view everything that they are working on here https sorrentotherapeutics com research pipeline https sorrentotherapeutics com research pipeline Essentially this company is working on projects to combat cancer the opioid epidemic and oh yeah the global pandemic that has dominated the planet for almost a year now There is massive demand in all of these areas for new solutions and Sorrento could be one of the organizations that solves part of the problem Needless to say SRNE has a lot going on in its labs at the moment However each one of these projects represents a potential catalyst for the stock price For example the stock jumped almost 200 on May 15th when the company announced that one of their antibody treatments was 100 effective in inhibiting the virus in early testing I was holding 450 shares 3 15 that I had purchased purely out of excitement for their cancer and pain relief work I was more than happy to dump them at 10 2 during pre market on May 18th https investors sorrentotherapeutics com news releases news release details sti 1499 potent anti sars cov 2 antibody demonstrates ability https investors sorrentotherapeutics com news releases news release details sti 1499 potent anti sars cov 2 antibody demonstrates ability Then in August the share price climbed to a peak of 20 apparently on pure speculation These two examples demonstrate that this stock has a ton of interest in any news or releases on the COVID front which arguably isn t even its main business The share price has been volatile since August moving within the 5 12 range over the past 5 months The reason I am writing this post now is because the stock is up about 20 today again with no news as of this posting On December 22nd the company filed an application for an Emergency Use Authorization for their rapid test product with the FDA This is where I think the real money is there to be made They missed the boat on the vaccine race but there is still a huge need for improved testing which in the past has been inefficient and inaccurate SRNE s COVI STIX can reportedly deliver results in 2 15 minutes With widespread availability of this testing we could even get back to sporting events and concerts as testing could be done quickly at the gates of the arena and any positive cases would be turned away and refunded SRNE is also working on a rapid spit test which would eliminate the need to have a q tip rammed into your brain News on the potential approval of COVI STIX is imminent which could further send the stock price higher in the short term 20 would only be the first step on this moon mission as no real news has even been released yet It s also possible that the jump we saw today could be pure speculation and the price will fall back into the 7 8 range next week and stay there until actual news is released I m not saying buy or don t buy right now but I wanted to get this DD out here before the stock really moons Just wanted to give everyone a chance to read into this company over the long weekend Regardless of this short term spike the play here is the sheer number of possible catalysts in their pipeline at the moment The stock currently trades at a 2 6B market cap which leaves room for a huge move upwards The company has increased their cash while lowering debt in the last year meaning they should be in no danger of going under in the near term They generated 28M in revenue in the first 9 months of 2020 from their one existing product and this revenue could double if they get any of their new products approved SRNE closed at 9 50 today but the average 1 yr estimate on this company is 25 which in my view is completely attainable if any of their products attain FDA approval and make it to the market If you re looking for any other reasons to get on the SRNE train the company has a CEO in Dr Henry Ji who publicly hates shorts as much as we all do I am giving them a fair warning shot Just cover yourself don t ruin your family Ji said of short sellers who he says are trying to manipulate Sorrento s stock https www fool com investing 2020 08 26 sorrento therapeutics opened up 117 after ceo slam https www fool com investing 2020 08 26 sorrento therapeutics opened up 117 after ceo slam Seriously with the amount of hype around this stock it takes almost nothing to move it double digit percentage points Even after this declaration back in August there are still 68M shares sold short as of 12 31 20 It s not GME level short interest but it would accelerate the rockets if any big approval news is released https www nasdaq com market activity stocks srne short interest https www nasdaq com market activity stocks srne short interest I m not as experienced with options trading as most of you are but if you want to buy calls I would buy them at least a few months out The news that could send this stock up 100 is likely imminent but it will be impossible to predict its timing since we are dealing with FDA approval here It could be next week it could be in March My guess is as good as yours I wouldn t buy any weeklies or FD s and expect to hit it big If you like what you read here take some of your GME profits and buy a few shares and hold on till this baby hits 20 As always do your own research into the stock before throwing your money at it Positions Too dumb for options so I m holding 500 boomer shares at 7 21 TLDR Biotech company with over a dozen potential COVID Cancer Pain Relief products in various stages of FDA approval process Potential EUA approval for rapid COVID testing product sometime in the next month CEO hates shorts Buy shares or longer term options to ensure that you are holding when any news hits Obligatory for good luck
