is the largest special acquisition company to date created by Bill Ackman it trades on NYSE it closed AH at 29 85 It has 2 years to get a deal done it IPO d at 20 a share if a deal does not get done holders of common shares get 20 a share paid back to them at the end of the 2 years Which means the downside risk is limited to 20 a share no matter what because it is backed by 5 billion dollars it IPO d 21 JUL 2020 it has until 21 JUL 2022 to get a deal done otherwise holders of common shares get 20 per share Bill was quoted in the fall saying In terms of timing what we said at the time of the IPO is we said it would take us we thought about six months to identify a target that we would be in a position to hopefully announce a deal by sometime in Q1 and then close the transaction in the ordinary course thereafter Nothing that we have experienced to date suggests that we won t meet our expect timeframe We had more than 12 billion of demand for the offering when we stopped marketing the IPO on the second day of the road show We used the excess demand for the pershing square tontine holdings IPO to curate a shareholder list that would be the envy of any public company We selected investors for their reputation as long term value added owners list of institutional investors they curated can be found on the nasdaq website The private company maintains majority interest and voting rights They essentially give up nothing and get a huge cash injection There are only so many companies on this list that even qualify in terms of size If the timing quote is to be believed it would put the announcement of a LOI Letter of intent for a target sometime in Q1 the general consensus expects an announcement sometime between mid jan mid feb most likely after the inauguration to avoid trumptards doing something like storming the capitol again and and scaring the market merger criteria https pstontine com acquisition criteria Simple Predictable and free cash flow generative Formidable barriers to entry Limited exposure to extrinsic factors that we cannot control Strong balance sheet Minimal capital markets dependency Large capitalization Attractive valuation Exceptional management and governance The key takeaway there is formidable barrier to entry They are looking for a titan they are big game hunting They have 5 billion in the warchest and are able to go up to 7 billion Kevin O leary is in big on this https www benzinga com news 20 12 18735011 why kevin oleary is betting on bill ackmans pershing square tontine spac There are rumors that buffet could be a pipe investor he has a large position hidden that eventually has to be released with a 13f filing this is all speculation but check out this video https www youtube com watch t 970 amp v FhOzaN7uI s amp feature youtu be What I can tell you is we met a very diverse base of investors we got one of the largest orders through one of the firms for a great long only very well regarded asset manager This is all speculation but it still sounds spicy There have been a lot of special acquisition company s lately that have done really well Chamath has had some incredibly profitable IPOs but check out this chart for QS https finance yahoo com quote QS They 13 bagged and they are just some shitty EV battery play Now here is where things get SPICY Two parts Part 1 The Tontine structure last man standing gets everything and part 2 upward pressure through incentives the atom bomb of technical plays Part 1 Here is the prospectus https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1811882 000119312520175042 d930055ds1 htm For everyone who owns a common share after merger they receive 2 9ths of a warrant so 2 warrants at 23 strike for every 9 shares This is where things get absolutely fucked though The prospectus on page 5 states We believe our ability to complete our initial business combination will be enhanced by how we have structured this offering First our distributable Tontine redeemable warrants provide our public stockholders with an incentive not to redeem their shares of Class A common stock in connection with our initial business combination We will issue a fixed pool of 33 333 333 distributable Tontine redeemable warrants assuming no exercise of the underwriters over allotment option holders who choose to redeem their shares will lose the right to receive any such warrants Public stockholders who choose not to redeem their shares of Class A common stock will share in this fixed pool with other non redeeming holders on a pro rata basis and will receive the additional warrants that were effectively surrendered by redeeming holders As a result public stockholders who do not redeem their shares will receive at least two ninths of a distributable Tontine redeemable warrant per share they hold and a proportionally greater amount as other holders elect to redeem We believe this structure will likely lead to a lower level of redemptions and therefore we will likely have more funds available for our initial business combination This means if you sell your shares between the LOI Letter of intent the company they are merging with and the actual merger you FORFEIT your 2 9ths of a warrant per share and the shares forfeited get added to a pool and get given to those that held during this period The MINIMUM is set at 2 warrants for every 9 shares but it will be higher than that based on how many people sell shares during the tontine period before the merger date PART 2 The potential spicy atom bomb Roughly 70 is held by instutitional investors that are locked in With 200 million shares that leaves roughly 60 million shares in the float for plebs like us Of those 60 million shares a large group are going to want to hold through until merger to redeem their warrants at 23 the HIGHER the SP goes the MORE those warrants are worth which INCREASES their resolve to hold so they can cash in People will be selling shares in this time period and ADDING to the total warrant pool making people want to hold even more This reduces the float dramatically The crazier it gets the more people will be forced to hold for the warrants The MORE people sell the MORE warrants people that hold will get to collect it could end up being 4 9ths or even higher Making them want to hold EVEN MORE The longer they hold out the more warrants they get from people who forfeited by selling shares in this time period If it ends up being a sexy target like stripe bloomberg starlink anything that generates hype everyone and their moms their dogs and the mailman will want in Except There could be as little as 20 million shares even available for trading on a mega hype stock If this happens fundamental be damned and it could be a technical wet dream Tilray A canadian pot company had a technical stratosphere run in 2018 it IPO d at roughly 20 a share and hit 300 USD There were only 17 million shares in the float the higher it went the more people piled in and it was pure insanity https www investopedia com investing tilray shares halted 5 times wild trading day On Wednesday Tilray s stock gapped up sharply to open at 233 58 a share from Tuesday s 154 98 close The stock hit an intraday peak at precisely 300 a share late in the trading day Risks Bill doesn t get a deal done The stock collapses and hits a hard limit of 20 a share about 30 loss from today s stock price There are risks with everything but the set up based on the tontine structure alone could end up being one of the craziest technical plays of 2021 based on the limited float alone AND the incentive to hold until merger with the tontine structure this setup has never been done before in a SPAC and this is THE LARGEST SPAC TO DATE If you are retarded and have a high risk threshold join me in this retard venture Current position 59 calls december 2021 expiry 35 strike Edit Formatting

FOR DD Warning LOTS OF OC ,I ll start by admitting I was originally going to post the below analysis to a certain S tock A nalysis website that will not be named However I decided to forgo the 42 in CPM revenue and instead take my talents to WSB since I ve been having so much fun shitposting about GME with you guys the past month I also think this might be the first Sum of the Parts SOTP analysis that has even been posted to WSB Now I know most of you can hardly read let alone understand revenue multiples But if you stick with me you re in for a bullish treat Long story short if we apply even the most conservative forward revenue projections and EV revenue multiple to GameStop s e commerce business we arrive at a fair value per share of 74 05 Additionally this fair value DOES NOT factor in the intrinsic value from a potential short squeeze that is an added cherry on top when you buy GME shares SKIP TO THE BOTTOM FOR A TLDR Full analysis behind the 74 share fair value When reading the many bearish articles that have carpet bombed investment websites and now even WSB one thing is apparent The authors want to talk about ANYTHING BUT valuation They would rather base their thesis on BlOckBuSTer instead of calmly and rationally analyzing forward revenue streams and applying a fair multiple based on public comparable companies I believe that is likely the reason we have not seen a SOTP Sum of the Parts analysis for GameStop yet for broad consumption Not even the Wall Street analysts who are being paid piles to analyze this company are performing this analysis they would rather just double down on their 1 60 price target than do the work Preforming a SOTP analysis on GameStop is critical because it is the only way to give the Company credit for the significant e commerce revenues it is achieving and the rich multiple that e commerce sales demand from the market Multiple expansion is a hell of a drug Michael Burry Modeling revenue projections Before we can value GameStop on a forward basis we must reasonably arrive at a forward revenue assumption and the corresponding percentage breakdown between e commerce and brick and mortar sales We can start with GME s recently released 9 week holiday sales figures for the period ending January 2nd 2021 By examining the delta between last year s 9 week revenue figures and the subsequent full quarter figures we can reasonably arrive at an assumption of 2 1bn of revenue for the fiscal quarter ending in February 2021 Management also publicly stated that 34 of holiday sales were e commerce For this analysis we will apply that percentage to the full quarter estimate Processing img cdy97vncf1c61 The next step is to build on the Q4 assumption to model out the next fiscal year through Q4 2022E the fiscal quarter ending February 2022 Luckily we have a great proxy to achieve this we can utilize GameStop s quarter on quarter revenue growth the 2013 console launch We can also reasonably assume an expansion from 34 to 40 e commerce sales over the next four quarters as Ryan Cohen executes his strategic vision Source GME 10 Q filings author assumptions https preview redd it fax5gecjf1c61 jpg width 1866 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 7b59f50aad048decbbc68450c68df3bef15c9640 We can use the above quarterly figures to inform an annual projection model that will be the foundation of our SOTP analysis 5 revenue growth is a conservative estimate based on actual figures from the 2013 console cycle and the uptick in demand for both new and used consoles and games that followed the launch of the new consoles Source GME 10 K filings author assumptions https preview redd it k26jmdinf1c61 jpg width 1544 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s c960121888b8bb0b60074bdeaac898a568e17202 Determining and applying an e commerce revenue multiple based on peer comparables Now that we have a reasonable estimate for both e commerce and B amp M revenue for GameStop s fiscal year ending February 1 2023 we need to apply a multiple to both revenue streams to bridge to enterprise value Upon review of a set of public internet retail peers we find a median EV CY2022E revenue multiple of 3 2x Source Factset

multiple to e commerce sales which is highly conservative It goes without saying that if Ryan Cohen were able to achieve a e commerce revenue multiple equal to Chewy the company he founded the long term growth in GameStop s share price would be enormous Using this conservative e commerce revenue multiple of 2 0x and applying a de minimis multiple of 0 2x to GameStop s legacy brick and mortar business we arrive at a fair value per share of 74 05 on a SOTP basis Processing img b4asaomuf1c61 For fun if we drop Chewy s e commerce multiple into the above table we get a fair value per share of 151 76 Source GME public filings author assumptions https preview redd it u06o5uc0g1c61 jpg width 855 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s a3fec1ebacbb84e7ed48a98406ec5be63acba828 The upside to current implied by this analysis is significant but based on the market s reaction to Ryan Cohen s activism so far a 100 gain on a re rating of projected e commerce revenues doesn t seem so far fetched Clearly the stock has made a run since its lows in April of last year but the market still has not fully priced in GameStop s present and future e commerce revenues at a fair multiple relative to peers Processing img 1uuw4yf2g1c61 Everyone is tunnel visioning on if the short squeeze has squoze yet and or to what extent shorts have covered so far But after doing their DD on a SOTP basis GME holders can sleep well at night knowing that there is still 100 upside once GME s e commerce revs are fairly valued by the market TLDR GameStop s growing e commerce revenues 34 of holiday sales deserve a far higher multiple than the company s legacy brick and mortar business Comparable internet retail companies trade at median EV CY 22E revenues of 3 2x Chewy trades at 4 4x EV CY 22E revenues Even with the recent share price run GameStop still only trades at 0 4x 2022E revenues of which the revenues will likely be 40 e commerce at a minimum SOTP valuation analysis indicates a fair value of 74 05 per share At the same e commerce revenue multiple as Chewy GME s fair value is 151 76 per share

2019 500 million in cash and manageable debt Recent share price increase also opens up the option to raise more cash through equity offerings ACTIVIST INVESTOR RYAN COHEN Activist investor Ryan Cohen is campaigning to focus the company on ecommerce instead of brick and mortar retail Stocks tend to do well if a company is targetted by activist investors and Cohen is the perfect activist investor to drive change at GameStop given his experience running Chewy an online retailer for pet products Cohen and two former Chewy execs were recently appointed to GameStop s board LEVERAGE EXISTING ONLINE FOOTPRINT GameStop can leverage its existing online footprint GameStop com and GameInformer com as a low cost starting point to grow its ecommerce business 5 000 BRICK AND MORTAR STORES FOR OMNICHANNEL RETAIL GameStop s 5 000 brick and mortar stores is unintuitively an asset for its ecommerce pivot Market research shows that omnichannel retail strategies perform better than purely online strategies e g Apple and its iconic Apple Stores The real life experience of physical stores increases customer spending and brand loyalty GameStop s focus on gaming and its many physical stores give it an omnichannel edge over other gaming ecommerce retailers For example its stores can be optimized for gaming experiences while Walmart and Best Buy don t have room to be specific OPPORTUNITY TO CUT FAT GameStop s stores have short term leases 24 months average lease duration which gives it opportunities to cut fat by closing underperforming stores LARGE LOYALTY PROGRAM GameStop s PowerUp loyalty program has 55 million members that are or can be converted to dedicated ecommerce customers LOW PRICE TO SALES RATIO Even with a 2 5 billion market cap 35 5 per share GameStop has a relatively low price to sales PS ratio of 0 4 The SP500 s median PS ratio is 1 5 Chewy the company co founded by Ryan Cohen trades at over 6 times sales Even with just a PS ratio of 1 GME s price would be around 90 GAMING INDUSTRY GROWING RAPIDLY The gaming industry has been growing rapidly over the last few years and GameStop is in a great position to capitalize on this growth if management can successfully pivot the company INVESTOR MINDSHARE GME s explosive move last week caught everyone off guard and now everyone s talking thinking about it especially Jim Cramer With so many people watching the stock expect any modicum of good news to propel the stock upwards SHORT SQUEEZE A short squeeze can happen when many short positions are forced to close at once when the short stock s price increases rapidly This creates a temporary burst in buying pressure that can rapidly increase a stock s price in the short term GME is a heavily shorted stock and is at high risk of short squeezes Bear Case FAILURE TO PIVOT GameStop s biggest risk is a failure to pivot to an omnichannel ecommerce business To reach this goal the company has significant hurdles to clear For one there are many competitors in the gaming ecommerce space Walmart Amazon and Best Buy compete with GameStop in selling physical gaming products like consoles and accessories If GameStop starts to sell digital goods like downloadable games it ll face intense competition from Steam EA s Origin and Microsoft s Xbox Game pass as examples To succeed in this hyper competitive space GameStop needs to find a niche and grow from there This is a difficult journey requiring business acumen finesse and dedication from its executive team UNFAVORABLE BROADER MARKET CONDITIONS GME is a speculative stock and speculative stocks are the hardest hit during a market downturn Economic conditions remain uncertain with the slow rollout of the vaccines the fact that we don t know how practically effective the vaccines are the apperance of multiple COVID 19 strains around the world and the likely resumption of debt payments this year e g end of the student loan moratorium in May and the end of the eviction moratorium in February The chances of a market downturn in 2021 is non trivial In addition even if the pandemic does end and North America and Europe opens up again expect a short term decline in gaming interest as everyone rushes to go back outside This can negatively impact GameStop s earnings for a couple of quarters Trade Plan GME has been a red hot stock in the past few months and last week s giant push to almost 40 will be followed by a period of consolidation as bulls take profit and bears place shorts During this time the stock will trade sideways or downwards If you re a GME bull and hold shares consider selling out of the money covered calls during the consolidation period Adventurous investors could even sell at any price above 37 5 and re enter at a lower support level e g 33 If you re a GME bull but don t hold shares you should wait for price to consolidate to a lower support level before buying in Selling out of the money puts is a good way to get paid while waiting If you are a GME bear I don t recommend shorting the stock Stocks with so much retail investor fervor can skyrocket to astronomical prices before settling back down to reason The next few quarters are key for GameStop s transformation During this time any positive news is a strong price catalyst I m most interested in what changes will come from Ryan Cohen now that he has board representation For example it ll be very bullish if the current CEO George Sherman is replaced Sherman is a brick and mortar retail veteran and not the best CEO to change GameStop into an ecommerce giant I won t be surprised if Sherman stepping down is a similar event to Intel CEO Bob Swan s resignation announcement which caused Intel s stock price to jump by more than 10 I write over at a small blog called FinanceTLDR https www

Friday explaining why that day s dip wasn t problematic a lot of things have happened Once again thank to everyone for holding the line And also thanks to everyone who keeps buying into the cause Stay put aka don t press the f cking sell button Keep in mind that not only are we likely to make big dollars but we are also protecting 45 000 people who work at a company that was important in many people s childhoods and soon will be relevant for future generations again Without further ado here are the updates regarding GameStop amp x200B A Summary of GameStop s moon mission GENERAL INFORMATION At this point we have many different investors that are in it for the long term sorted by investment size Fidelity including their Intrinsic Opportunities Fund Daddy Cohen s RC Ventures Blackrock Susquehanna the OG u DeepFuckingValue and of course us fellow retards among others GameStop is still a Fortune 500 company which operates as the WORLD S LARGEST MULTICHANNEL VIDEO GAME RETAILER The firm has huge potential for expansion including in ecommerce as the video game market is valued at 160 billion dollars with an estimated Compound Annual Growth Rate of 12 9 according to Grand View Research SHORT INFORMATION Ortex Estimates exact Updates not for another week Estimated short interest 72 Million decreased after spike but still up from 2020 EOY Estimated short float still at 101 other estimates as high as 180 GameStop is still on the SEC threshold list for 28th consecutive days Cost to borrow increased by an estimated 14 2 Around 80 to 85 of shorts were likely shorted with a stock price under 20 NEWS Jim Cramer acknowledged that the short busting seems to be working Fidelity IBKR and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated limit margin on GME heavily limiting short sellers Outgoing board members sold a total of nearly 20 Million dollars in stock on Friday sending the stock tumbling bc of the news Having that said s saved the stock from a potential panic selloff Ryan Cohen Tweeted yesterday 1 17 Peanut Emoji amp GIF saying So you re telling me there s a chance The actual meaning remains unclear but many interpreted this as his confirmation that there is a chance for an infinity squeeze Multiple sources have confirmed that PC Building Stations are coming in near future mini microcenter style Uptick rule SEC 210 is in effect until at least EOD Tuesday GS2C Frankfurt is up nearly 17 at the time of writing this DD on a NYSE holiday Webull and Etoro disabled shorting GME OTHER FACTORS There are talks about potential margin calls which would strongly affect shorts Additional stimulus potential will increase the WSB meme buy u TitusSupremus DD post ended up on Reddit s popular page with 300 awards and 11k upvotes making it inevitable for Reddit users outside of this sub to miss out on this This play has literally reached the Front Page of the Front Page of the Internet News about GameStop seem to be never ending This renders technical analysis nearly irrelevant as well Despite some major publications releasing a bearish outlook on the firm the bullish signs are overwhelming amp x200B Outlook over the coming days Expect yet another highly volatile day week on the market Be careful with options at the moment shares are likely the way to go and will also help the cause more There is no doubt that the potential for another squeeze exists maybe even a legendary MOASS Even if the squeeze does not happen for whatever reasons this stock is an absolute value buy as many people before me have explained here Another reason to go with shares rather than options As long as idiots don t there is a fairly low potential for downside and HIGH POTENTIAL FOR LARGE UPSIDE on the LONG POSITION amp x200B Media Outlets Melvin amp other short sellers I feel like I am a broken record but GameStop is here to stay I know WallStreetBets will never change your mind but if you were honest you would go back an analyze past short squeezes Let s take the example of KBIO s 10 000 squeeze KBIO was entirely defunct and insolvent unlike GME which actually has an amazing opportunity in a fast growing space The childhood memories of most American s and brand recognition alone play a huge factor Plus their subsidiaries are solid as well Fundamentals don t matter in these situations it s a result of a variety of different factors that cause a short squeeze and now you have an unprecedented influence bullish individuals who will never give up aka us Most squeezes undergo a similar sequence of events 1 Shares are massively over shorted over 100 is banned by some governments for a reason 2 Big news regarding the overhaul of the firm happened with RC ventures buying in and overhauling board control 3 Forced borrow recall and or margin removal this already started 4 An actual squeeze happens as panic breaks out among short sellers it s just a matter of time before someone starts folding BTW doubling down is a horrible bet and has barely ever gone well after a squeeze News Outlets and analysts tend to focus on patterns or traditional methods of pricing stocks There is no way to say that this will be a good stock to short and therefore short selling downside far outweighs the upside amp x200B EASY TO SHORT does not mean EASY TO COVER Now it s time to realize that SHORTING THIS STOCK WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA and in fact STILL IS A HORRIBLE IDEA For institutional and retail short sellers alike you may see the same consequences as KBIO short sellers did many of which went bankrupt LONG POSITIONS are the way to go amp x200B Note For everyone who is new to this please be aware that options have low impact on share prices and that volatility among many other things plays a huge factor in your trades Be careful with your trades and always do your own due diligence This is for educational purposes only PS PPS Now would be the perfect time for an announcement by GME for future plans Even a small announcement relating to a technology shift will slingshot launch our moon mission Maybe a potential for that happening as GameStop canceled appearance at ICR This is a big maybe hence just a note as PPS amp x200B Positions 190 shares for the long run 5 1 22 38c very risky and make up full reinvestment of my calls that printed last week will buy more shares tomorrow morning CAN T STOP WON T STOP GAMESTOP amp x200B TL DR Over the weekend we have seen more bullish signs than anticipated Even if we don t see a squeeze we for sure have a value stock on our hands GME goes to the moon no matter what

posted to Reddit recently touting the potential that the Uranium industry has over the next few years Specifically u 3stmotivation has done a terrific job with his due diligence regarding the industry If you had bought in to any of his recommendations back in June after reading his thread in r Undervalued here The undervalued case for uranium companies https www reddit com r Undervalued comments gz833b the undervalued case for uranium companies then you likely would ve been up 27 on the large cap Cameco CCJ 128 on Denison DNN and 155 on Energy Fuels UUUU He is not the only one expecting Uranium to make huge gains however but I would like to use his work as a case study so that we can get an idea of what to expect for the industry Just as a note I decided to largely leave fundamentals of the companies and technical analysis out of this post I can provide info about how I feel about them as well but decided to put them on hold for now What is the purpose of this post Simple When I read these posts about the Uranium industry having the potential to explode in the near future I rarely came across reasons as to why it wouldn t skyrocket Before buying in I decided to dive deeper into reactive core to see what I could come up with The current situation summed up If you haven t read through Uranium investment material I ll sum it up now The lack of supply does not meet the current and 10 year expected demand Because of this the biggest producers are buying from the spot market because it s cheaper to do that than to re open their facilities for new production It s predicted that when spot prices hit 50 these companies can get back to work and make great earnings while doing so I d like to be clear here This is not untrue Contracts will likely be renewed over the next couple years starting now driving prices up Uranium voices say we ll have a repeat of sky high prices during 07 and or 11 Remember Fukushima The Japanese Nuclear disaster in 2011 that shut down many facilities driving Uranium supply up and prices back down An important piece to the puzzle of investing in a company is public perception and there is no difference when it comes to commodities For this exercise however I frankly don t care what the public s perception is The reality is that Nuclear power is safer and reduces carbon more effectively than every other way we produce power Nuclear power is only getting safer because of these kinds of disasters Regulations are incredibly strict when it comes to Nuclear power because of the implications bringing my first point into focus Uranium can t be competitive Industries that are forced to comply with significant safety standards set by government regulations cannot adapt quickly to a changing economy With that said the companies that have survived this sector are well suited to withstand the regulations they re forced to deal with But mooning That s out of the equation Renewable Energy is the future can t power the entire grid Renewable energy can t power the entire grid and it s not our only future The reality is that our future is made up of Renewables Nuclear Fossil Fuels and a healthy balance of other energy sources Why is this the case Many reasons Fossil fuels will run out and harm the environment renewables aren t as productive or reliable and take up a lot of space at the same time and Nuclear is damn expensive and takes forever to get running Let s look at this last point Nuclear is expensive and takes forever to get running It costs billions of dollars to get a new Nuclear facility up and running Natural gas takes a fraction of the cost Nuclear while turning a profit at a better rate and with less carbon output than Natural Gas also takes at least a half decade to even be built Out pacing a Natural Gas facility s profitability doesn t begin until nearly a decade after a Nuclear facility is built And that s without further technological improvements of Natural Gas facilities bringing costs down further Who exactly has 10 15 years and billions of dollars to spend on an endeavor that will likely need heavily regulated maintenance and repairs shortly after profitability outpaces its competitors Not politicians that s for sure The billion dollar price tag for Nuclear can only be covered by 1 purse the political purse Let me ask you this how many high level representatives can you name that have been in positions of power for 15 years The way you advance in politics is by winning and you have a short time frame to do that Investing yourself in legislation that pumps up Nuclear energy against horrible public perception will not net you the quick wins needed to continue moving up the ladder No one wants a part of this like they do Renewables or even Natural Gas So is Uranium actually worth investing in The short answer It could be but only for the intermediate term 3STmotivation specifically mentions a horizon over the next few years and how important it is to keep an eye on spot prices and the industry when we get a few years down the road Based on what I ve learned during my research this is not a long term play until significant improvements are made for Nuclear What about for the intermediate term During the bull run from mid 2010 to the beginning of 2011 CCJ DNN and UUUU shot up about 65 150 and nearly 500 respectively Unfortunately over the following 6 month time frame they lost basically all of those gains and have been in decline for the 10 years since Fukushima played its part with reassuring the public that Nuclear was dangerous and may have been a catalyst for this meltdown but the continual decline in value is evident These are huge gains no doubt but be understanding of the industry as a whole and how the market reacts before buying in Final thoughts I ultimately decided not to buy into Uranium I think the industry is Undervalued for a reason ie valued appropriately My investment strategy does not include investing or trading commodities so it was easier to pass on this but that is not to say money cannot be made here I simply don t believe this to be a long term play and the short intermediate term is too volatile difficult to fully grasp and risky for most investors 3STmotivation provided great analysis of the industry and the companies that are probably best equipped to benefit from the upcoming catalysts so I thank him for encouraging my research Remember not everything affordable is worth buying

I thought to myself how to study for this shitty test and then it hit me FUCK COLLEGE let s check how is BB doing right now So I decided to a DD on BB to show you guys why Im bullish on this company Let s start What Is BlackBerry BB and what is it doing right now BB provides intelligent security software and services to enterprises and governments It secures more than 500M endpoints including 175M cars The company uses AI and Machine Learning to improve its cybersecurity software safety and data privacy of the users They state in their reports that they are the leaders in the areas of endpoint security encryption and data embedded systems Endpoint securing entry points of end user devices such as laptops desktops phones IoT and wireless devices from being exploited Endpoint security is mainly on the cloud or the internet embedded security Small computers mainly CPU that are a part of a bigger system and do specific tasks and allow users to interact with the system device or machine IoT Security The growth of devices that are connected to the cloud Internet gives hackers a lot of targets to attack From phones laptops and cars to industrial equipment and servers BB has one of the broadest tools of solutions for these problems with software that gives solutions for every industry for example QNX is best suited for auto medical industrial automation and green energy solution all are industries that are growing and expected for huge growth for years to come SecuSuite for governments which in the last few months saw a huge spike in successful cyber attacks Certicom for automated cars and area that is growing but still is not on a huge scale IoT software is the company s main source of revenue around 50 the downside is that revenue from this segment is on a downturn but mainly because BB is doing a reorganization of the sales force The bright side is the Cylance the company s new acquisition revenue are up 20 5 YOY Company Achievements Launched BB Digital Workplace a workspace integrated with Microsoft Office 365 that gives you secure access to corporate content on and offline Launched together with Zoom a secured version of the app UEM software achieved NSA commercial solution for classified programs allows BB to work with the US government Integration of AtHoc with Microsoft Teams BB UES was able to detect the attack of Russian hackers Released an open source tool for cybersecurity experts that helps with the process of reverse engineering malware attacks AWS partnership to develop and market BB IVY intelligent vehicle data platform and much more stuff like governments contracts more tools release and so on Partnership with ServiceNow and lots of EV company s like Canoo Plus and more partnership with Vodafone and TALUS for crisis solution management amp x200B Processing img 0hbeioxyg4c61 If you read the reports you will find hundreds of agreements and accomplishments that I didn t write This IVY is supposed to be a great growth engine amp x200B Processing img 1abkws2kg4c61 Management John Chen The CEO since 2013 pivoted the company from hardware to software Was the CEO of a company that got sold to SAP and Siemens Nixdorf s open enterprise computing division a member of US China policy advisory under Bush s administration Was a board member of Disney and Wells Fargo Charles Eagen The CTO of the company a huge advocate of IoT Was the Global Head of Electronics Dyson and focused mainly on IoT was formerly Vice President of Engineering for QNX Software where he concentrated on the automotive and embedded markets He also worked at Cisco and directed the development of the seminal CRS 1 carrier routing system Both Guys are tech oriented and focus on IoT and software These guys are brilliant with a great vision for the company Financials The company has Long Term debt of 459M of convertible notes with 1 75 interest duo for Nov 2023 Currently they enough cash to cover a bit less than half of it but enough short term investments to help cover the rest and still be left with cash on hand Goodwill is down mainly because of impairment and new accounting practice that has been adopted That is the main driver for assets being down that much 1B YOY Overall the company has a great Asset to Liabilities Ratio of 2 68 BV of BB is 3 which means that a third of the share price is backed with Equity Revenue is up 15 YOY thanks to software sales software sales up approximately 68 from 2017 to today of course that like a lot of other companies Rona hit the revenue of BB but they are recovering pretty well SG amp A is down to 40 of the revenue as opposed to 56 2 as of the same Q in 2018 expenses are down a lot overall from recent years which helped to increase the margin and pay off the debt of 600M Recurring revenue is greater than 90 for the software segment and BB expects that IVY the software which is a partnership with AWS will start having recurring revenue at around 2023 FCF is positive for the last 5 years maybe more I couldn t find info far dated The gross margin is up to 76 The operating margin is up 7 That s it for now hopefully I will come up with another post that will bring more info in the coming week Positions 200 Shares at 9 I have all the rest at GME and MT TL DR BB is not the same phone company it was becoming more innovative and penetrating

838,kzz9pf,t2_78udj4ju,1610991092,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzz9pf/adrs_and_china/,1,ADR s and China,I ve seen a few posts about ADRs recently talking about how all chinese stocks are based in the Cayman Islands and no one s really buying stock in these chinese companies and that China has no need to uphold these agreements As a disclaimer before I go on I was to say I do own stock in NIO and BABA as well as AMZN AAPL and a few other small AI companies While many of you may be technically correct about ADRs it fundamentally ignores the foreign policy climate of almost all countries and more specifically ignores the way China s foreign policy is being conducted right now I m not an expert and you should of course do your own DD but what I ve noticed from all these posts is that they are all ignoring the idea of Soft Power Lets define what soft and hard power are I ve taken these definitions from wikipedia because they re concise and as always wikipedia is well referenced damn teachers Soft power In politics and particularly in international politics soft power is the ability to attract and co opt rather than coerce contrast hard power In other words soft power involves shaping the preferences of others through appeal and attraction Foreign Aid is an excellent example of the use of Soft Power Hard Power Hard power is the use of military and economic means to influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies This form of political power is often aggressive coercion and is most immediately effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and or economic power Why is this important While China is on its way to becoming a global superpower its not there yet there are more economically reliable countries US and countries with more functional military might Russia and US I say functional here because military might isn t just man power and number of soldiers China uses hard power when it comes to domestic policy through the use of censorship coercion of officials imprisonment of dissidents and so on and so forth https www amnesty org en countries asia and the pacific china report china https www amnesty org en countries asia and the pacific china report china However they ve also learnt from the collapse of the USSR which collapsed in part due their international and economic isolation among other factors https www britannica com story why did the soviet union collapse https www britannica com story why did the soviet union collapse Now China doesn t want that to happen and to ensure it doesn t it s followed an interesting hybridisation of communism and capitalism where private companies are closely linked to the government but are allowed to compete and have private ownership However this has meant that chinese companies and by extension China as a country has to be attractive to outside investors and that s where soft power comes in Throughout the pandemic and even before China has been trying to expand its soft power further in the hope of eventually leveraging itself into the world s leading super power Case and point is the Free trade agreement it signed with 14 other asia pacific countries creating an even larger free market than the eu 16 vs 22 https www theguardian com business 2020 nov 15 china and 14 asia pacific countries agree historic free trade deal https www theguardian com business 2020 nov 15 china and 14 asia pacific countries agree historic free trade deal While this gives it more economic power it also gives china great headlines This isn t the only way China is trying to garner a better image of itself and therefore more soft power For a long time China has been and is commonly viewed as one of the largest polluters in the world https ge usembassy gov chinas air pollution harms its citizens and the world text The 20People s 20Republic 20of 20China health 20and 20the 20world s 20economy https ge usembassy gov chinas air pollution harms its citizens and the world text The 20People s 20Republic 20of 20China health 20and 20the 20world s 20economy pollution that has been killing around a million of its citizens a year so to not only improve their citizens lives though how much of the main motivation that is I m very skeptical but to also capture the ongoing trend of renewable energy becoming the dominant energy market in the next decade or two China has been pouring money into clean energy initiatives so they not only capture a significant slice of an upcoming dominant market but they are also able to position themselves as the clean energy capital of the world Let s be clear though the current pandemic has affected their soft power and reduced it massively which leads onto the crux of my argument How Soft power relates to ADRs and Stocks For China to successfully follow through with their plans leveraging soft power into economic might the tried and tested american way to an extent except america had WW2 and the Marshall plan to reach this point sidenote I know that s massively reductive and there s a lot of other factors involved in america becoming a superpower including a shit load of hard power i e nuclear bombs and military might they require investment not just from domestic sources but foreign sources otherwise they gain no soft power So how does this relate the ADRs If China and Chinese companies were to renege on their agreements with these shell companies it would lead to major banks hedge funds and entire countries to disinvest from the chinese economy a counterpoint I can imagine in the comments may be that it s technically not a reneging because the these chinese companies and chinese law doesn t state that you can own shares but the optics of it certainly are Every major newspaper would be covering it people who have invested would be using their soft power their vote to push for harder line on china and so would banks who would be disinvesting by their droves from chinese ADRs I know I wouldn t be buying anything from China again because the risk is too high and that would be the most dangerous thing for the chinese government They are trying and have until now succeeded in creating an image of a stable thriving economy Disinvestment may sound sensationalist and to an extent I would agree it may be but the most recent example is BABA stock The disappearance of Jack Ma not only lead to a massive drop in BABA stock but countless headlines about how dangerous it is to invest in Chinese companies and while I m sure Jack Ma when he returns will have to change to adapt to his potentially curbed reality the chinese government will have also realised that they ll need to adapt to ensure that they don t lose the soft power they ve spent over 40 years cultivating look up Deng Xiaoping s China reform and opening up policy And to address comments that I m sure will say China can be self sufficient without any foreign investments I m sure they can but that path has until now lead to ruin for other countries the primary example being the USSR and a less prominent example being North Korea The chinese government is ruthless efficient and they re certainly not stupid Of course if anyone thinks I m wrong please let me know I also understand that the BABA example is more nuanced than how far I ve gone into it because of Jack Ma s Ant group going onto central bank turf but the logic behind the point stands TLDR China would lose their soft power banks and people would disinvest in China if they didn t honor their ADR agreements and would set China onto the path of future economic ruin and upheaval I could be wrong though

soft power banks and people would disinvest in China if they didn t honor their ADR agreements and would set China onto the path of future economic ruin and upheaval like the USSR I could be wrong though but read on for my analysis with references mostly amp x200B I ve seen a few posts about ADRs recently talking about how all chinese stocks NIO BABA TENCENT are based in the Cayman Islands and no one s really buying stock in these chinese companies and that China has no need to uphold these agreements As a disclaimer before I go on I was to say I do own stock in NIO and BABA as well as AMZN AAPL and a few other small AI companies While many of you may be technically correct about ADRs it fundamentally ignores the foreign policy climate of almost all countries and more specifically ignores the way China s foreign policy is being conducted right now I m not an expert and you should of course do your own DD but what I ve noticed from all these posts is that they are all ignoring the idea of Soft Power Lets define what soft and hard power are I ve taken these definitions from wikipedia because they re concise and as always wikipedia is well referenced damn teachers Soft power In politics and particularly in international politics soft power is the ability to attract and co opt rather than coerce contrast hard power In other words soft power involves shaping the preferences of others through appeal and attraction Foreign Aid is an excellent example of the use of Soft Power Hard Power Hard power is the use of military and economic means to influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies This form of political power is often aggressive coercion and is most immediately effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and or economic power Why is this important While China is on its way to becoming a global superpower its not there yet there are more economically reliable countries US and countries with more functional military might Russia and US I say functional here because military might isn t just man power and number of soldiers China uses hard power when it comes to domestic policy through the use of censorship coercion of officials imprisonment of dissidents and so on and so forth https www amnesty org en countries asia and the pacific china report china https www amnesty org en countries asia and the pacific china report china However they ve also learnt from the collapse of the USSR which collapsed in part due their international and economic isolation among other factors https www britannica com story why did the soviet union collapse https www britannica com story why did the soviet union collapse Now China doesn t want that to happen and to ensure it doesn t it s followed an interesting hybridisation of communism and capitalism where private companies are closely linked to the government but are allowed to compete and have private ownership However this has meant that chinese companies and by extension China as a country has to be attractive to outside investors and that s where soft power comes in Throughout the pandemic and even before China has been trying to expand its soft power further in the hope of eventually leveraging itself into the world s leading super power Case and point is the Free trade agreement it signed with 14 other asia pacific countries creating an even larger free market than the eu 16 vs 22 https www theguardian com business 2020 nov 15 china and 14 asia pacific countries agree historic free trade deal https www theguardian com business 2020 nov 15 china and 14 asia pacific countries agree historic free trade deal While this gives it more economic power it also gives china great headlines This isn t the only way China is trying to garner a better image of itself and therefore more soft power For a long time China has been and is commonly viewed as one of the largest polluters in the world https ge usembassy gov chinas air pollution harms its citizens and the world text The 20People s 20Republic 20of 20China health 20and 20the 20world s 20economy https ge usembassy gov chinas air pollution harms its citizens and the world text The 20People s 20Republic 20of 20China health 20and 20the 20world s 20economy pollution that has been killing around a million of its citizens a year so to not only improve their citizens lives though how much of the main motivation that is I m very skeptical but to also capture the ongoing trend of renewable energy becoming the dominant energy market in the next decade or two China has been pouring money into clean energy initiatives so they not only capture a significant slice of an upcoming dominant market but they are also able to position themselves as the clean energy capital of the world Let s be clear though the current pandemic has affected their soft power and reduced it massively which leads onto the crux of my argument How Soft power relates to ADRs and Stocks For China to successfully follow through with their plans leveraging soft power into economic might the tried and tested american way to an extent except america had WW2 and the Marshall plan to reach this point sidenote I know that s massively reductive and there s a lot of other factors involved in america becoming a superpower including a shit load of hard power i e nuclear bombs and military might they require investment not just from domestic sources but foreign sources otherwise they gain no soft power So how does this relate the ADRs If China and Chinese companies were to renege on their agreements with these shell companies it would lead to major banks hedge funds and entire countries to disinvest from the chinese economy a counterpoint I can imagine in the comments may be that it s technically not a reneging because the these chinese companies and chinese law doesn t state that you can own shares but the optics of it certainly are Every major newspaper would be covering it people who have invested would be using their soft power their vote to push for harder line on china and so would banks who would be disinvesting by their droves from chinese ADRs I know I wouldn t be buying anything from China again because the risk is too high and that would be the most dangerous thing for the chinese government They are trying and have until now succeeded in creating an image of a stable thriving economy Disinvestment may sound sensationalist and to an extent I would agree it may be but the most recent example is BABA stock The disappearance of Jack Ma not only lead to a massive drop in BABA stock but countless headlines about how dangerous it is to invest in Chinese companies and while I m sure Jack Ma when he returns will have to change to adapt to his potentially curbed reality the chinese government will have also realised that they ll need to adapt to ensure that they don t lose the soft power they ve spent over 40 years cultivating look up Deng Xiaoping s China reform and opening up policy And to address comments that I m sure will say China can be self sufficient without any foreign investments I m sure they can but that path has until now lead to ruin for other countries the primary example being the USSR and a less prominent example being North Korea The chinese government is ruthless efficient and they re certainly not stupid Of course if anyone thinks I m wrong please let me know I also understand that the BABA example is more nuanced than how far I ve gone into it because of Jack Ma s Ant group going onto central bank turf but the logic behind the point stands Hong Kong is an interesting counterpoint to my argument but I would say that to a certain extent Banks knew HK would be bought under the CCP and still think they can make money there also Hong Kong massively damaged Chinese Soft power and if there had been a better president I think the effect would have been huge but there wasn t and the markets are over it if ADRs aren t honoured then Banks and hedge funds would lose money and I think that that s their bottom line and a red line for them I could be wrong though

retarded autistic self as a and ask myself Just how valuable is a share of GME This is a guide to help understand why the shorts have their back against the wall and why is the best play even if you see the stock pop up double digit percentages tldr The potential for MOASS is primed but shareholders collective behavior determines if when it will happen It s a game of chicken Will they cover at any cost or will they spook us into selling We hold the power they are bleeding we are not Do not value your shares simply by price value them by scarcity Do not panic sell even if you can grab 50 gains sell only when you see the sheer panic in their eyes Introduction Hi I m a flaming I saw a company that was dying applied boomer logic and decided to borrow a ton of shares dump them into the market and drive down their share price I now hold a wad of cash but I owe my broker shares No problem I thought I ll buy back those shares when the company goes bankrupt and I ll get to keep the cash I got all my buddies involved in spreading boomer logic about the company having no future and I thought it d be pretty sweet to make some dough off of a chain of irrelevant stores dying It s just business This seemed like a pretty safe bet I mean who would argue against a retail store selling physical games operating at losses closing stores etc who would argue that it won t eventually end up like blockbuster It might still be a safe bet that they go bankrupt but unfortunately that doesn t matter anymore My Situation I borrowed these shares and sold them on the market I have a wad of cash which is cool but now the shares have gone up in value something about positive outlook and some young stud that people believe in At some point I need to buy the shares back to give to my broker This is called covering I might be a but I m also an autist My broker says they re worth X each and I borrowed Y shares so they re charging me interest on X Y every single day The interest rate they are charging me is also getting ridiculously high because my broker has trouble finding shares for me to borrow Those profiteering bastards are charging me high interest because they know shares of GME are hard to come by and they are taking advantage of me Fuckers I want to switch to another broker but they re doing the exact same thing Fuck this fucking sucks Digging my own grave Ok don t panic I have a plan I have a lot of money and the stock has gone up a bunch already I ll borrow more shares dump them on the market and when people see the price go down they ll think to themselves Well shit I just gained 100 in the last month but now the stock is going down I guess I should just sell Hopefully everyone will apply that same logic the price will go down and I can start buying back the shares to cover I ll give it a shot Jan 15th happens Ok that worked a little bit The stock price went down but it didn t tank as much as expected Are these guys going to sell or what I don t know how much longer I can stomach this fucking interest Also what are the other s going to do Do I need to worry Oh shit My Situation Part 2 Ok so it turns out that I m not the only In fact combined s owe their brokers more shares than exist This fucking sucks because if I want to buy shares to cover they probably do too What are they going to do Are they going to cover Because if they do they re going cause the price to go up and then when I want to buy shares I ll have to pay even more Fuck Should I cover now Wait a second what s this on the news People are catching wind that there are so many s in GME and that we are suffering FUUCCCK what if people with shares use this to their advantage What if they see how desperately I need to buy shares off of them and simply refuse to sell until like 200 or some ridiculous price Let me Google this OH FUCK It s called a short squeeze Apparently this happened in similar conditions to VW and KBIO and what the fuck their share prices went up like 10x and 100x in a couple of days How the fuck Makes no sense couldn t possibly happen to me Ok think How about I just cover my position I can go out on the market and buy back all the shares I owe No big deal Let me check the order book Uh this fucking blows I can buy back like 10 of the shares I owe but then the price of the stock will have gone up like 30 Every time I try to cover the stock price will just keep going up There are even a ton of people who won t sell to me unless I pay them 420 69 What the fuck Where are all the people with the shares Come on they ve seen so much gains recently just flip them for a profit Let me check Um I m seeing a lot of institutional investors Well these guys don t really sell that often and they re probably smart enough to see I m in a shitty situation There s this Ryan Cohen dude who owns a bunch of shares but he just tweets random bullshit and doesn t seem like he will sell me any There s this message board full of people just as retarded as me but if I know how desperate I am they probably know that too Alright calm the fuck down I can think of a way out of this What Can I Do Ok I m calm Let me take inventory of what I m dealing with here Pros I have a ton of cash Cons GME has gone up in price Maybe GME s fundamentals have improved I have borrowed far too many shares I keep having to pay interest on these borrowed shares Everyone is aware that my back is against the wall If a short squeeze happens I m fucked Shareholders don t appear to be easily spooked I m retarded Ok I lost The plan now is to minimize my losses I need to buy back shares for as cheaply as possible without causing a huge fucking squeeze How about I go to some big shareholders and cut them a deal I ll buy a ton of shares from them for say 3x the current market value This is probably better than just going onto the open market The question is will they bail me out and at what price Let me take a look at institutional investors Oh fuck it s pretty spread out The best I can do is make deals with a handful and cover maybe 30 of my shares Not really sure actually as I m a fucking autist and too lazy to do all the digging Alright well how about I try to spook retail investors like those WSB retards What if I cover a ton of shares at once bump the price up another 50 and hope they all think this is the squeeze I ll just sit there and buy back shares as they panic sell If it works I can try it again later If it doesn t well at least I covered some shares I think I ll try that this week Ok that s as far as I can stomach You see how shitty it is to be a right now so don t bail them out by selling shares until you re sure all the s are panicking They made their bed make them sleep in it Or go right the fuck ahead and sell your shares The s will still be fucked It will only prolong the inevitable and those of us who continue to will have more leverage for when they inevitably need to cover Personally I m waiting for an ignition of this MOASS and not basing it on any price movement unless it s at least triple digit percentages I think ignition will come in a form of some announcement by some announcing they acquired a ton of shares and will not sell them to shorts This is how it happened for VW and KBIO

autistic self as a of fictitious XYZ stock and ask myself Just how valuable is a share of XYZ This is a guide to help you understand how s can end up with their back against the wall Mods This is not advice about any particular stock This is all hypothetical and simply a thought experiment This is to foster discussion about strategies short sellers might take in certain market conditions Introduction Hi I m a flaming I saw a company that was dying applied boomer logic and decided to borrow a ton of shares dump them into the market and drive down their share price I got a big wad of cash from selling but I owe my broker shares No problem I thought I ll buy back those shares when the company goes bankrupt and I ll get to keep the cash I got all my buddies involved in spreading boomer logic about the company having no future and this seemed like a pretty safe bet XYZ seemed to be going the way of blockbuster and was clearly doomed for bankruptcy Well things changed It might still be a safe bet that they go bankrupt but unfortunately that doesn t matter anymore My Situation So I borrowed these shares and sold them on the market I have a wad of cash which is cool but now the shares have gone up in value something about positive outlook and some activist investor with retarded tweets At some point I need to buy the shares back to give to my broker This is called covering you dumbass My broker is not a saint and they aren t lending shit to me for free My broker says shares in XYZ are worth X each and I borrowed Y shares so they re charging me interest on X Y every single day The interest rate they are charging me is also getting ridiculously high because my broker has trouble finding shares for me to borrow Those profiteering bastards are charging me high interest because they know shares of XYZ are hard to come by and they are taking advantage of me Fuckers I want to switch to another broker but they re doing the exact same thing Fuck this fucking sucks Digging my own grave Ok don t panic I have a plan I have a lot of money and the stock has gone up a bunch already I ll borrow more shares dump them on the market and when people see the price go down they ll think to themselves Well shit I just gained 100 in the last month but now the stock is going down I guess I should just sell Hopefully everyone will apply that same logic the price will go down and I can start buying back the shares to cover I ll give it a shot shorts more shares Ok that worked a little bit The stock price went down but it didn t tank as much as expected Are these guys going to sell or what I don t know how much longer I can stomach this fucking interest Also what are the other s going to do Do I need to worry Oh shit My Situation Part 2 Ok so it turns out that I m not the only In fact combined s owe their brokers more shares than exist This fucking sucks because if I want to buy shares to cover they probably do too What are they going to do Are they going to cover Because if they do they re going cause the price to go up and then when I want to buy shares I ll have to pay even more Fuck Should I cover now Wait a second what s this on the news People are catching wind that there are so many s in XYZ and that we are suffering FUUCCCK what if people with shares use this to their advantage What if they see how desperately I need to buy shares off of them and simply refuse to sell until like 200 or some ridiculous price Let me Google this OH FUCK It s called a short squeeze Apparently this happened in similar conditions to VW and KBIO and what the fuck their share prices went up like 10x and 100x in a couple of days How the fuck Makes no sense couldn t possibly happen to me Ok think How about I just cover my position I can go out on the market and buy back all the shares I owe No big deal Let me check the order book Uh this fucking blows I can buy back like 10 of the shares I owe but then the price of the stock will have gone up like 30 Every time I try to cover the stock price will just keep going up There are even a ton of people who won t sell to me unless I pay them 420 69 What the fuck Where are all the people with the shares Come on they ve seen so much gains recently just flip them for a profit Let me check Um I m seeing a lot of institutional investors Well these guys don t really sell that often and they re probably smart enough to see I m in a shitty situation There s this Ryan Cohen dude who owns a bunch of shares but he just tweets random bullshit and doesn t seem like he will sell me any There s this message board full of people just as retarded as me but if I know how desperate I am they probably know that too Alright calm the fuck down I can think of a way out of this What Can I Do Ok I m calm Let me take inventory of what I m dealing with here Pros I have a ton of cash Cons XYZ has gone up in price Maybe XYZ s fundamentals have improved I have borrowed far too many shares I keep having to pay interest on these borrowed shares Everyone is aware that my back is against the wall If a short squeeze happens I m fucked Shareholders don t appear to be easily spooked I m retarded Ok Clearly I lost The plan now is to minimize my losses I need to buy back shares for as cheaply as possible without causing a huge fucking squeeze How about I go to some big shareholders and cut them a deal I ll buy a ton of shares from them for say 3x the current market value This is probably better than just going onto the open market The question is will they bail me out and at what price Let me take a look at institutional investors Oh fuck it s pretty spread out The best I can do is make deals with a handful and cover maybe 30 of my shares Not really sure actually as I m a fucking autist and too lazy to do all the digging Alright well how about I try to spook retail investors like those WSB retards What if I cover a ton of shares at once bump the price up another 50 and hope they all think this is the squeeze I ll just sit there and buy back shares as they panic sell If it works I can try it again later If it doesn t well at least I covered some shares I think I ll try that this week Another option is I can buy a ton of ITM calls and exercise them immediately I ll lose a ton of money because I m basically burning up the premium I paid for them but I ll get those sweet shares of XYZ It s not my problem to buy the shares of XYZ from the market it s the retard who sold me the call Ok that s as far as I can stomach You see how shitty it is to be a in a possible short squeeze situation
