some long form thoughts on the future of Virgin Galactic stock I ve held 1000 shares since a 9 share price and consider myself very well informed on the stock Take it or leave it but it s my theory that we re due for a solid run provided we see a powered test flight in the next two or three weeks which I believe we will Obvious caveat is it s a risky stock and you shouldn t buy stock without doing your own research etc etc TL DR Multiple near term catalysts Test flight preparations underway appears imminent Approaching all time highs with huge short interest Possible inclusion in ARKX The post Wanted to put some thoughts together on what we ve seen over the last week and why I m feeling very excited about the next few weeks I hope this will provide some value to folks reading and serve as a refresher or at least a quick reality check as to where we are For starters the stock price of the company is sitting in the mid 34s and from a technical perspective is looking pretty strong Aside from the Virgin Orbit news which is totally unrelated but still tends to be a nice little bump For context this is an increase of 10 in share price over just the last two weeks It also happens to have begun this run around January 7th which is the date the company confirmed they have identified the problem from the first test flight and that corrective action was underway The 34 may seem normal at the moment but it s worth remembering that the last time the share price was this high was in February of 2020 We haven t seen these heights for close to a year now and we re back but with profoundly different circumstances If you follow Richard Branson s media appearances you know that in a recent interview about Virgin Orbit he said that Virgin Galactic tests would resume in the next very few weeks Obviously Richard is Richard and you can find video of him saying similar things going back to 1937 but with the recent test flight and more recently VMS Eve hitting the New Mexico skies today and yesterday I think it s fairly certain that that timeline is accurate On November 3rd VMS Eve took off twice on some routine training flights Keep that in mind The original test flight that was cancelled due to COVID restrictions was announced on November 5th and scheduled for November 19th 23rd https twitter com virgingalactic status 1324463611402739716 s 20 From the 5th to the 13th the share price rose 3 on that news alone before the test flight was officially cancelled https twitter com virgingalactic status 1328309312666669060 s 20 It took a small drop and built back up gradually as the company made it clear they d reschedule as soon as restrictions were eased Investors shook it off The last flight window was announced on December 1st https twitter com virgingalactic status 1333906807379652616 s 20 and opened on December 11th 2020 and prior to that the stock price reached 33 80 by December 7th purely off the hype for the test flight Obviously that price cooled down after the abort but it s important to realize that we are now above the place we were with the last test flight before a launch window announcement has even been made This is all to say the stock is in a very strong position and with the two flights from VMS Eve this week we re seeing strong signals from the company that a test flight window announcement is imminent On 1 21 the FCC granted them permission to use the frequencies they typically use during full powered tests https charts stocktwits com production original 276754710 png with a window extending until May The timeline on the announcement is unclear but it seems likely to me that it could be either this coming week or the one after that Should we get an announcement it wouldn t be surprising to see the share price grow another 2 or 3 possibly more if folks are feeling particularly bullish After the announcement based on the last two windows I d imagine the actual flight will take place 10 15 days later Virgin Galactic has yet to go to space as a publicly traded company so it s hard to know what the result of a successful test flight would do to the stock but I d suspect it wouldn t exactly make it go down lol Add on to that fourth quarter earnings call is February 25th https investors virgingalactic com news news details 2021 Virgin Galactic Announces Date of Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Financial Results and Conference Call default aspx VG loves to announce new stuff before or after earnings Assuming the first test flight happens and succeeds before then it will be a huge opportunity for leadership to boast the success of the platform announce the next test date and even possibly roll out the new Spaceship Two projected that it will be complete Q1 early Q2 https twitter com virgingalactic status 1324463980002365446 s 20 These things will also be positive catalysts It s unclear what the time between test flight two and the Branson flight will be but I d imagine the stock will continue to grow or trade sideways until that point What I haven t mentioned yet is short interest Second only to Gamestop Virgin Galactic is a MAGNET for shorts Current short percent of float is 81 https shortsqueeze com symbol spce amp submit Short Quote E2 84 A2 and as the price continues to rise more and more short interest will accumulate as people think a lot of the things you probably read on Reddit about the stock Combine consistent positive catalysts and a very memeworthy industry it will squeeze All of this to say if you ve held this long this is as close to our collective vision s realization as we ve ever really been Of course things could go wrong at any point here or a test flight could fail or yeah they could drag their feet on an announcement and the stock could gradually whittle down from where it is now but I think that the point is the bull case here is as strong as its ever been as far as I m concerned Do your own research make your own decisions and don t make any decisions based off of stuff you read on the internet as always but I thought I d lay out my bull case here

alive We re gonna bust an institutional short hedge fund Robinhood style in the middle of a global pandemic and trigger a great redistribution of wealth So by now you ve probably heard that the price hikes on the past two Fridays were due to gamma squeezes When calls are purchased Market Makers buy some shares just in case they have to pay out or provide shares when the contract is settled This lowers their risk and they are generally good at not losing money So what happened Friday Literally every open call that was sold at any time hit their strike price became ITM because the highest strike available was 60 and the stock closed at 65 Even if the call didn t expire until 2023 their risk management policies dictate that they must purchase shares to cover their potential downside What drives stock prices Supply and demand Supply was already low on Friday and MMs started hedging their positions gobbling up shares left right center at whatever price they could get driving up demand The stock price surged praise be and we collectively did our little happy dances Now apparently these 10 15M shares should be cleared by around Tuesday and in the hands of anybody deciding to exercise their call options If those investors and don t sell those shares it decreases liquidity and increases the ceiling of the gamma short feedback squeeze So the gamma squeeze went like this People bought calls at any price for any date and on Friday they had all closed ITM profitable for those who hold the calls but painful for MMs and the people who sold the calls who now need to find millions of shares to buy New calls at higher strikes 115 will be available next week and the same thing can potentially happen again especially if there s a good chunk of those outstanding 15M shares that still need to be purchased What ll happen when people buy calls again on Monday but MMs still need to buy millions of shares by Tuesday Supply and demand the price will soar again What happens when the price approaches ITM territory for new outstanding calls MMs need to hedge by buying shares What happens when MMs need to buy more shares from a smaller pool of available shares Supply and demand We ve achieved the gamma feedback loop Buying ITM or near OTM calls will force MMs to hedge by buying more shares which will raise the stock price and bring higher strike calls closer to ATM ITM which forces them to buy more shares allin a vicious loop DO NOT SELL YOUR SHARES Now onto the short squeeze There are still 102 5 shares shorted Literally more shares have been shorted than Gamestop has issued As of Friday after market close the short squeeze has not yet squoze So what is the short squeeze A quick background because some are new to this but since it s been explained in plenty of other DDs for months now here s the short version haha Certain huge hedge funds thought GME would pull a blockbuster and implode down to 0 They completely ignored the fact that the ex CEO of Nintendo is now on the Board of Directors along with Ryan Cohen and the two people that helped him build Chewy from nothing to a 3 5B powerhouse that beat Amazon at online retail The legend outcompeted Jeff fucking Bezos after getting denied funding by 100 VCs and he only sold Chewy cause his beloved father amp mentor suddenly died PetSmart bought Chewy and promptly IPOd it to 10B After the last earnings report he threatened the GME BOD to stop dropping the ball OR ELSE He put his money where his mouth is and bought 13 of GME They listened struck a deal with him and are getting ready to pivot GME just like BB GME will do two main things 1 Transform their online presence to make it the Amazon of gaming 2 Update their retail locations to enter into the PC gaming market All of this was discovered thanks to many hard working autists who put together fantastic DDs which are now making us bank We salute you and personally thank you very much because this will measurably change my life which is why I m writing this Previous to the two GME gamma squeezes we were essentially waiting for GME to announce what our hard working autists have been telling us ever since RC released his warning letter to the GME BOD Why is this important Because the bears still believe in their bear thesis The bears still think GME will Blockbuster and they believe the current bump in stock price is the equivalent of a dip for them so they doubled down on their short position Until their thesis is proven wrong outdated via news from either GME or RC outlining GME s new growth plans shorts will cling to their bear thesis and think we are delusional retards Truth is we just figured out GME s plan before the shorts did and we re clinging to the unofficial news because it simply makes sense SO once the news breaks that GameStop actually has a really good growth plan bears will say awe fuck and start buying shares to close out their short position Except wait supply and demand again There are so few shares now that they would have to buy our shares sell them back buy them again at a higher price sell them back buy them again at a higher price sell them again and on and on again to the moon about 13x That will be the true squeeze we have all been waiting for What we didn t realize is that 1 The catalyst to trigger the short squeeze has potentially changed and 2 The timeline might ve just moved a lot closer to the present day I Present To You The Gamma Short Feedback Squeeze The gamma squeeze causes MMs to buy shares driving price up Shares are purchased fewer shares are available to be sold price goes up This increases the loss floor of the shorted shares for short sellers and increases the interest paid to continue shorting them Remember shorting a stock caries unlimited risk because a share price can climb to an unlimited height As the risk increases the shorts get scared If they are forced to cover their losses will be proportional to the increase of the stock price Higher price higher losses for them They can keep paying interest but at some point the risk becomes too great and they throw in the towel Now that GME has hit mainstream media everybody and their grandmother has heard in the news that GME squeeze is incoming and is getting in on the game Supply and demand price goes up supply goes down gamma squeeze forces MMs to buy more to hedge supply goes down price goes up Price keeps going up shorts get mighty nervous They might decide to ride it out for a few years EXCEPT When there are no more shares available to trade margin calls will begin Shares that were purchased with borrowed funds will be forcibly liquidated and you can bet that at some point Melvin s shorts will be forcibly margin called Boom short squeeze triggered by the gamma squeeze The Gamma Short Feedback Squeeze The gamma squeeze will firstly drive the price a lot higher BEFORE the main short squeeze It will also feedback into the short squeeze which increases with probability every time more shares are taken off the board and every time the stock price increases All you have to do is and if you can buy shares or calls This is history in the making an unprecedented event Not only is the ratio of shares shorted to shares realistically available to sell higher than the VW squeeze but it s getting turbocharged by a gamma squeeze too We are double dipping this bitch This went from a once in a decade opportunity to a once in a century play and we get to take from shitty companies counting on others to fail and redistribute their wealth to the average retard If you benefit from this play please remember to set aside funds for taxes bless you tax free TFSA and for charity Position 346 shares 20 doubling Monday once funds transfer Also I listed my 7 series for sale and will buy a 3k shitbox to drive until the squeeze has squoze sinking the sale proceeds directly into GME When this happens I ll be able to upgrade to a lambo instead

take this down again What an exciting time to be alive We re gonna bust an institutional short hedge fund Robinhood style in the middle of a global pandemic and trigger a great redistribution of wealth TLDR Short squeeze trigger might ve changed from waiting for GME RC news about positive GME growth amp direction to the gamma squeeze triggering intolerably high prices for shorts and or margin calling Short squeeze timeline might ve just been moved closer by months and buy shares or calls So by now you ve probably heard that the price hikes on the past two Fridays were due to gamma squeezes When calls are purchased Market Makers buy some shares just in case they have to pay out or provide shares when the contract is settled This lowers their risk and they are generally good at not losing money So what happened Friday Literally every open call that was sold at any time hit their strike price became ITM because the highest strike available was 60 and the stock closed at 65 Even if the call didn t expire until 2023 their risk management policies dictate that they must purchase shares to cover their potential downside What drives stock prices Supply and demand Supply was already low on Friday and MMs started hedging their positions gobbling up shares left right center at whatever price they could get driving up demand The stock price surged praise be and we collectively did our little happy dances Now apparently these 10 15M shares should be cleared by around Tuesday and in the hands of anybody deciding to exercise their call options If those investors and don t sell those shares it decreases liquidity and increases the ceiling of the gamma short feedback squeeze So the gamma squeeze went like this People bought calls at any price for any date and on Friday they had all closed ITM profitable for those who hold the calls but painful for MMs and the people who sold the calls who now need to find millions of shares to buy New calls at higher strikes 115 will be available next week and the same thing can potentially happen again especially if there s a good chunk of those outstanding 15M shares that still need to be purchased What ll happen when people buy calls again on Monday but MMs still need to buy millions of shares by Tuesday Supply and demand the price will soar again What happens when the price approaches ITM territory for new outstanding calls MMs need to hedge by buying shares What happens when MMs need to buy more shares from a smaller pool of available shares Supply and demand We ve achieved the gamma feedback loop Buying ITM or near OTM calls will force MMs to hedge by buying more shares which will raise the stock price and bring higher strike calls closer to ATM ITM which forces them to buy more shares all in a vicious loop DO NOT SELL YOUR SHARES Now onto the short squeeze There are still 102 3 shares shorted Literally more shares have been shorted than Gamestop has issued As of Friday after market close the short squeeze has not yet squoze https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l2xc4o gme moass update ortex data 12221 https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l2xc4o gme moass update ortex data 12221 So what is the short squeeze A quick background because some are new to this but since it s been explained in plenty of other DDs for months now here s the short version haha Certain huge hedge funds thought GME would pull a blockbuster and implode down to 0 They completely ignored the fact that the ex CEO of Nintendo is now on the Board of Directors along with Ryan Cohen and the two people that helped him build Chewy from nothing to a 3 5B powerhouse that beat Amazon at online retail The legend outcompeted Jeff fucking Bezos after getting denied funding by 100 VCs and he only sold Chewy cause his beloved father amp mentor suddenly died while he was getting ready to take Chewy public PetSmart bought Chewy and promptly IPOd it to 10B After the last earnings report he threatened the GME BOD to stop dropping the ball OR ELSE He put his money where his mouth is and bought 13 of GME They listened struck a deal with him and are getting ready to pivot GME just like BB GME will do two main things 1 Transform their online presence to make it the Amazon of gaming 2 Update their retail locations to enter into the PC gaming market All of this was discovered thanks to many hard working autists who put together fantastic DDs which are now making us bank We salute you and personally thank you very much because this will measurably change my life which is why I m writing this Previous to the two GME gamma squeezes we were essentially waiting for GME to announce what our hard working autists have been telling us ever since RC released his warning letter to the GME BOD Why is this important Because the bears still believe in their bear thesis The bears still think GME will Blockbuster and they believe the current bump in stock price is the equivalent of a dip for them so they doubled down on their short position Until their thesis is proven wrong outdated via news from either GME or RC outlining GME s new growth plans shorts will cling to their bear thesis and think we are delusional retards Truth is we just figured out GME s plan before the shorts did and we re clinging to the unofficial news because it simply makes sense SOOO once the news breaks that GameStop actually has a really good growth plan bears will say awe fuck and start buying shares to close out their short position Except wait supply and demand again There are so few shares now that they would have to buy our shares sell them back buy them again at a higher price sell them back buy them again at a higher price sell them again and on and on again to the moon about 13x That will be the true squeeze we have all been waiting for What we didn t realize is that 1 The catalyst to trigger the short squeeze has potentially changed and 2 The timeline might ve just moved a lot closer to the present day I Present To You The Gamma Short Feedback Squeeze The gamma squeeze causes MMs to buy shares driving price up Shares are purchased fewer shares are available to be sold price goes up This increases the loss floor of the shorted shares for short sellers and increases the interest paid to continue shorting them Remember shorting a stock caries unlimited risk because a share price can climb to an unlimited height As the risk increases the shorts get scared If they are forced to cover their losses will be proportional to the increase of the stock price Higher price higher losses for them They can keep paying interest but at some point the risk becomes too great and they throw in the towel Now that GME has hit mainstream media everybody and their grandmother has heard in the news that GME squeeze is incoming and is getting in on the game Supply and demand price goes up supply goes down gamma squeeze forces MMs to buy more to hedge supply goes down price goes up Price keeps going up shorts get mighty nervous They might decide to ride it out for a few years EXCEPT When there are no more shares available to trade margin calls will begin Shares that were purchased with borrowed funds will be forcibly liquidated and you can bet that at some point Melvin s shorts will be forcibly margin called Boom short squeeze triggered by the gamma squeeze The Gamma Short Feedback Squeeze The gamma squeeze will firstly drive the price a lot higher BEFORE the main short squeeze It will also feedback into the short squeeze which increases with probability every time more shares are taken off the board and every time the stock price increases All you have to do is and if you can buy shares or calls This is history in the making an unprecedented event Not only is the ratio of shares shorted to shares realistically available to sell higher than the VW squeeze but it s getting turbocharged by a gamma squeeze too We are double dipping this bitch This went from a once in a decade opportunity to a once in a century play and we get to take from shitty companies counting on others to fail and redistribute their wealth to the average retard If you benefit from this play please remember to set aside funds for taxes bless you tax free TFSA and for charity amp x200B Position 346 shares 20 doubling Monday once funds transfer Also I listed my 7 series for sale and will buy a 3k shitbox to drive until the squeeze has squoze sinking the sale proceeds directly into GME When this happens I ll be able to upgrade to a lambo instead

therapist published scientist etc In academia cross contamination between fields is often encouraged to look at complex issues So it s always healthy to look at phenomena from several perspectives I will offer one from a non market perspective To the boomers from one idiot retail investor with a doctorate I encourage you to expand the way you look at the world and stop placing blame on the interWebs and hackers it will only help you I know people are here to make money and I m not discounting that but I m going to try to touch on everything else that has influenced this trajectory Also probably a good bit of self projection but let me know what you think Also I think u cevin khan s post really did one of the best jobs surmising what has happened Top quality meme https old reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l1u036 wsb gets emotional on mad money The market can be irrational however I think at many levels this is a rational response precipitated by a long string of events environmental pressures and an underlying culture that most experienced investors on Wall Street and the media doesn t understand We really have to zoom out to understand this this is not just about trading stocks and getting rich While most took benefit from WSB DD after being shortsighted ourselves only as we began to believe it formed the deadliest snowball the bears have ever seen We have reached a wild convergence of culture technological access and timing DFV and WSB s can take credit for starting the snowball but what it has become should in all seriousness be studied It is way beyond this sub and is more about people But here s the question Why Why GME Why believe The ridiculous shorting certainly started the roll the hope for big gainz continued it But that s always the hope right Something was different here With the squeeze is being realized and gain porn keeps coming I think that s really just the icing on the cake not the underlying driver behind what has transcended a stock trade People really are YOLO ing money into this at whatever they can afford They want to just be included even if it s 5 shares My case rests with many that have bought 1 or 2 shares They aren t trying to get rich they are making a point Why Culture timing frustration and some hope My GME phenomenon thesis Many people in this sub have been fucked over by two of the largest economic disasters in recent history The 2008 financial crisis and lasting effects and the COVID 19 pandemic We hear boomers who bought houses in 1985 for 20 and a stick of gum cry about how we buy avocados and coffee We watched the banks get bailed out We watched government officials get rich as the same government argued about 1000 for its citizens We watched them tell us to go to school only to charge us thousands with outrageous interest rates Now I m a capitalist clearly stonks only go up bros but there s no denying the shrinking of the middle class and the absolute frustration of the younger generations We got dealt a shit hand But hey we can download an app and buy stock in 5 minutes This combined with our speed access and proficiency with the internet to complete DD is like a fucking interstellar spaceship compared to the boomers horse and buggy sources of Bloomberg and WSJ Guess what We can check Bloomberg and the WSJ too as well as chats twitter youtube etc Our resources are vast and we know how to use them We communicate quickly and enjoy immediate gratification The internet generation So we re pulling ourselves up by our Robinhood bootstraps They told us to use our bootstraps right Many of us grew up going to Gamestop it was a safe place Safe to enjoy and satisfy our videogame desires when our parents and the older generation didn t get it It was a place we were heard a place that supported our interests Maybe we all didn t play video games but we all definitely get video games We understand their lasting place in the real world Also let s be real this is reddit and although more popular now it is a place that has always been a safe haven for those interested in videogames technology and things that would have in the early 2000 s been considered nerdy When I first came to reddit I was looked down upon for using it This is why it has become a particular sore spot and we re not having it Are you trying to fuck with one of us Nope We enjoy videos games reddit enjoys video games even more the GameStop name is filled with nostalgia and maybe we whether consciously or subconsciously reflected upon that a bit more as we have been in this GME game And while I think culture is a huge underlying driver of our behavior in buying this stock our understanding of modern culture is also why we re more confident Cohen and GameStop will succeed and older generations are perplexed Here is where the shorts in an insane irony are insulting a generation of autists and are actively fueling their own demise The more insulted the more I have been reading comments and lurking and many are absolutely offended people would so harshly bet against a company we like What if we just began drowning some safe boomer stock with puts into the ground Would they like it No We don t like it either so fuck you Fair is fair not making any suggestions just a point So then they insult our intelligence as retail investors after insulting a company we love after insulting what we choose to eat after handing us a shit economy and have the audicity to cry about it and potentially investigate it I call bullshit DFV and some great DD is the only reason we are here We re all individually retarded and there s no grand scheme Some truly special retards have lost money in the GME fight We re just a bunch of people that had enough of the bullshit and we were handed a silver platter to provide a resounding fuck you back This is perhaps the only rational response Not financial advice just some perspective Frankly as someone who studies people I think the media is objectively wrong and it is shameful to dismiss and demonize retail investors whether WSBs or otherwise as they have been Again there is so much more going on beyond the stock market and WSB s with GME I m seriously considering writing and eventually submitting a manuscript about what happened here anchored in science as an extra fuck you because really the media doesn t know what they are talking about and it just pisses me off If anyone likes to write hit me up And I hope those that throw conjecture and hearsay at this sub sit down and research this because they will lose until they do It s just good science To the boomers don t hate and blame others on complex phenomena do the science and try to understand Also you shorted an undervalued stock first as it was making a pivot so regardless it was your fuck up anyway dicks It has everything to do with US the people our particular culture at this very moment in time And for that GME to the fucking moon

send to boomers friends or family interested in GameStop, GameStop Why The Gains Won t Stop Disclaimer I am a shareholder in GameStop Corp What is stated below is my opinion and should not be construed as a recommendation or advice First off let me address what you re probably thinking GameStop NYSE GME Why don t I just invest in Blockbuster while I m at it That s what massive hedge funds were thinking too when they bet BILLIONS on this company going to zero I mean brick and mortar in 2020 As Gob from arrested development would say C mon Seriously the writing is on the wall Who could possibly see something in this washed up has been The answer Michael Burry a k a Christian Bale in the Big Short a k a the guy who made 700 million betting against the housing industry after being laughed at by his peers some of the same people betting on GameStop to fail right now In this long winded piece of research nobody asked for I will convey why I believe the hedge funds are wrong inform why I m bullish on GameStop and meet that boomer requirement of writing a page on a stock before investing in it 1 New Leadership with a Proven Track Record One of the company s largest shareholders is none other than Ryan Cohen the founder of e commerce pet supply giant Chewy If Ryan Cohen can against all odds and more specifically Amazon make a 43 000 000 000 company out of dog food what could he do with an established player in the burgeoning gaming industry He s in for the long haul too On January 11th Cohen brought with him to GameStop s board two executives that helped him over at Chewy I m writing this for you right now but the stakes are low Cohen literally brought two of his successful Chewy friends to this company s executive level With stakes that high how sure do you think he is 2 Strong Financials Hedge funds were SURE that bankruptcy was right around the corner Let me just tell you something if that s what they thought was around the corner let s be thankful none of them are map makers because they were dead wrong GameStop ended Q3 2020 the most recent available statistics with 602 6 million of cash and restricted cash compared to 304 4M in Q3 2019 and achieved a reduction in SG amp A of nearly 115 million in Q3 and 315 9 million YTD 3 New Business Model Have you ever noticed that brick and mortar sounds like rick and morty Neither have I until just now when I was thinking of a hook for this paragraph that would entice you to read on about GameStop s RAPIDLY increasing ONLINE sales How rapid GameStop s online sales experienced a 257 increase in Q3 2020 and a 433 increase year to date 2020 And the revolution doesn t stop there GameStop knows that while there is still substantial demand for brick and mortar locations e g the recent PlayStation and XBox releases online sales need to drive overall revenue in the future So in a concerted effort to de densify the store fleet and further omni channel capabilities GameStop has closed approximately 800 stores And while the track that GameStop has chosen is decidedly digital the physical locations that do remain have managed a comparable store sales growth at the start of November 2020 of 16 5 4 Personal Testimony This past Friday I visited my local GameStop While there I held a lengthy conversation with an amicable professional and knowledgeable employee whom had been working at GameStop for about 5 years When I asked them how they felt about the changes GameStop had made as well as its vision for the future I was met with sheer ecstasy and optimism The employee could not even begin to describe how different the store looked today vs when they started Something they liked about GameStop today was in essence it s p vot into esports market and how could you not With 2 5 billion gamers worldwide it s no surprise the global gaming market is set to reach 256 97 billion by 2025 GameStop now sells computer parts accessories games gift cards and is reportedly transforming some stores to include PC build stations I asked a gamer how they felt about such a move on the part of GameStop what was his response That s huge There is a clear and present demand that GameStop could fill as the options for PC build assistance are currently extremely limited You either have to know somebody or go to a Microcenter whatever that is Why GameStop Has Been Dubbed The Orange More on a Potential Short Squeeze Fair Warning this section is where it gets all financy and stuff so I ll try to keep it as low level as possible but please forgive me if it turns out to be condescending Unlike the New York Times I respect my audience 1 What is a Short Squeeze For those of you who do not know what a short squeeze is like me 3 months ago let me copy and paste a paragraph from the Investopedia website to give you an idea A short squeeze occurs when a stock or other asset jumps sharply higher forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall to buy it in order to forestall even greater losses Their scramble to buy only adds to the upward pressure on the stock s price Volkswagen VW German for folks wagon is perhaps the most famous example of a short squeeze The year was 2008 the month was October Not much was going on in the world from what I can remember except for a couple of key moments that would change history and society forever In America iCarly was just starting its second season in Germany Porsche was quietly buying up stock in VW The latter triggered a Short Squeeze which lost shorts people who bet against the stock 30 000 000 000 and briefly made VW the most valuable company in the world Shorts bet against an undervalued company which would be subsequently saved by an investor that saw potential Sound familiar This is exactly in a Stephen A Smith voice what is happening with GameStop To get technical for a second GameStop s short interest SI as of 1 15 was 138 If John Denver could use an adjective to describe such a SI my guess would be high What does it mean As investopedia puts it Extremely high short interest shows investors are very pessimistic potentially over pessimistic When investors are overly pessimistic it can lead to very sharp price rises at times This is over the top pessimism only ever matched by the New York Times such a downer of a newspaper At this point in time every day the shorts don t buy stock to cover their position they lose more money the more the stock goes up the more they potentially lose Shorts will have to buy stock to close their position and in doing so they could drive the price astronomically higher than it already is considering that according to Barron s Brokers have been searching for stock to meet the existing short demand but are coming up empty as virtually all the lendable shares have already been taken down on the street 1 Has not the Squeeze been Squoze You may be thinking You fool There is no more juice left in GameStop We have reached the moon and will be turning back shortly Let me tell you something GameStop s still got enough juice in it to be an MLB player in the late 90s The price movement we saw this past Friday was most likely from a gamma squeeze given that Friday was the day many calls expired in the money which forced brokers to buy shares to cover their position and in turn drive the price up The Morality of Making Money How an Investment in GameStop Helps the Everyman Melvin Capital a hedge fund which has shorted GameStop manages 12 5 billion 12 5 billion To put that in perspective 12 5 billion can get you 3 571 428 571 Chipotle NYSE CMG Chips and Guacamoles enough for almost a whole year Melvin capital bet on GameStop employer of over 53 000 people like you and me to fail If a declining stock price leads to layoffs then one could reasonably assert that hedge funds were hoping to profit off of tens of thousands of people losing their jobs Big money wanted to add another 0 to their bottom line at the expense of the income and security of over 50 000 Americans If these hedge funds were politicians you d want to kick them out of office What if I told you that s possible I bought GameStop because in this industry your voice is tied to your shares and I want to let Wall Street know as loud as I possibly can that I have had enough Do not go gentle into that good night by Dylan Thomas Do not go gentle into that good night Old age should burn and rave at close of day Rage rage against the dying of the light Though wise men at their end know dark is right Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night Good men the last wave by crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay Rage rage against the dying of the light Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight And learn too late they grieved it on its way Do not go gentle into that good night Grave men near death who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay Rage rage against the dying of the light And you my father there on the sad height Curse bless me now with your fierce tears I pray Do not go gentle into that good night Rage rage against the dying of the light

passionate about tech and I think investing in tech firms would be a fun hobby in addition to my main job This is for practice only and not financial advice Any advice you all can give to improve my analysis would be greatly appreciated Background What is Dynatrace Dynatrace is a product that seeks to track and analyze IT operations It is an all in one product that has features for infrastructure monitoring application security business analytics cloud automation and more In practical terms Dynatrace helps automate DevOps processes gives business insights measures how new features are adopted by customers and helps track vulnerabilities in your software Here is a youtube demo video https www youtube com watch v 0ihCziAJ07U https www reddit com r wallstreetbets 22 Other Players The recent field of IT operations monitoring and analytics has seen a raping growth in the number of players Its competitors include Splunk IPO Date 4 18 2012 New Relic IPO Date 12 12 2014 Elastic IPO Date 10 5 2018 Datadog IPO Date 4 19 2019 Sumo Logic IPO Date 9 17 2020 among others Dynatrace is one of the newer players in this space going public on 8 1 2019 The Bull Case Personally I believe that Dynatrace is one of the stronger players in this field and I think that there is a lot of room to grow The reasons are as follows 1 Strong Financials Over the past year Dynatrace has consistently beat the consensus EPS estimates by a significant margin According to MarketBeat in the most recent Earnings release on 10 28 2020 the consensus EPS estimate was 0 10 and the reported EPS was 0 18 beating the estimate by 80 Of course one argument could be that these earnings are inflated by the number of companies switching to technology and the cloud due to the coronavirus but this trend has started as early as 2019 and in the 10 30 2019 Earnings release the expected EPS was 0 04 and the reported EPS was 0 06 beating the estimate by 50 One thing that interested me was that Dynatrace is one of the few software firms that are actually profitable and has an annual recurring revenue growth rate of around 30 Other big names in this space such as Splunk and Datadog have remained unprofitable by EBIT and GAAP measures respectively Of course Datadog s numbers are deceptive in that its unprofitability lies in their heavy stock compensation and it has a YOY growth rate of 83 Dynatrace s growth numbers do appear weak in comparison but I believe that this is set to change According to the Motely Fool Dynatrace is seeking to grow its sales team by 20 25 Currently Dynatrace has a 70 win rate with enterprises they engage with and if they are able to target more customers I can see their revenue growth increasing as well Currently Dynatrace has a market cap of 12 71 billion with a P E ratio of 160 90 Compared to Datadog which has a market cap of 31 98 billion with a P E ratio of 548 84 This makes it seem undervalued in comparison 2 Strong Feature Set I think that Dynatrace measures up to the heavy hitters in the data analytics software field For example we have Splunk a data management and monitoring tool With Splunk you store logs and metrics and can create dashboards using the data you have ingested Dynatrace offers similar features and includes features for the heavy lifting of acquiring the data through monitoring as well The Dynatrace website has a comparison to Datadog as well With Datadog you have the data monitoring service but you require analysts to interpret the data Dynatrace offers artificial intelligence to interpret the data and answer questions This is also just personal preference but I think the UI is clean and attractive a well built product from an engineering perspective Their tech stack is modern as well from their job postings and StackShare I gather they use Typescript Node js React js with D3 js for their graphing and charting Honestly their data visualizations are some of the best I have ever seen 3 Customer Sentiment Dynatrace has a strong base of customers supporting software and non tech giants as well Customers include SAP Citrix Samsung Adobe Ebay Experian Abercrombie and Fitch U Haul Porsche and more In G2 and Gartner the product is rated 4 5 stars out of 5 with 973 reviewers and 1210 reviewers respectively In both sites competitors are usually rated around the same or lower usually with much fewer reviews Overall I think the general customer consensus is that Dynatrace one of the best products in the market for its specific field 4 Analyst Sentiment According to MarketWatch Dynatrace has a low price target of 40 a median price target of 50 and a high price target of 59 dollars Its current price is 45 18 If analysts are correct about these prices then we are seeing a potential 11 50 downside in the low price target a 10 67 upside in the median price target and a 30 59 upside in the high price target According to the Wall Street Journal 17 analysts have given a Buy rating 2 analysts have given an overweight rating and 2 analysts have given a Hold Rating Recent Buy ratings have come from Rosenblatt Securities and Truist Securities Rosenblatt Securities thesis is that Dynatrace is positioned to grow as it expands its total addressable market to 32 billion by breaking into the cloud application security market Truist Securities thesis is that Dynatrace following its transition to a subscription model is well positioned for substantial growth and profitability into the future To add to this point Truist Securities shows that subscription revenue has grown 36 YOY The Bear Case Of course I think that any stock deserves a healthy bit of skepticism before investing The most obvious points I can see are 1 Crowded Market The competitors I listed in the Other Players category are just the ones I could immediately think of from the top of my head from recruiting There are definitely a lot more players and I expect consolidation in this field After all who needs 5 different IT monitoring tools If Dynatrace is unable to innovate fast enough compared to its competitors I can see this stock price plunging fast Furthermore this doesn t even include the internal processes tech companies use to track and monitor their infrastructure In other words there are a lot of players fighting for what may be a smaller number of customers 2 Market Forces Even with strong earnings numbers Dynatrace plunged with the market the last time an earnings report came Earnings occurred 10 28 2020 and Dynatrace s stock dropped 11 the same day I assume this is due to uncertainty in the market as it was around the time of election but it is still concerning that it dropped so heavily despite a strong earnings report 3 Price Despite being highly regarded on G2 one of the main complaints that users had were that this product is expensive compared to the competition Dynatrace may argue that its full feature set is a justification for the price but if users decide that they don t need certain features or use other services to compensate they are likely to go to one of its many competitors This does not bode well if the market consolidation hypothesis is true as being a jack of all trades without having a specific niche may actually end up harming Dynatrace in the long run Another issue I see is that Datadog was able to discover a good niche among small and mid sized companies Dynatrace s cost may inhibit it from competing with Datadog in that niche Although perhaps this may not be too large of a concern as they are mostly competing for the world s largest 15 000 global enterprises which can afford the cost Upcoming News The most important upcoming date is 2 3 2021 Hopefully without another election looming in the future a strong earnings can push this stock up past its 50 price target Current Positions 10 Shares at 46 98 After Apple and Microsoft Earnings I plan to reinvest the money I have in them to buy more Dynatrace to hopefully bring the total to 1k in preparation for earnings I m a poor college student but if I had more to invest I would amp x200B If I missed anything or you guys have any feedback I would greatly appreciate it amp x200B TL DR

retards amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp This is my first long post on WSB and I m here to give you some predictions on what will happen now after GME and the state of WSB after GME Also I m extremely bored being the weekend and all amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp Also this is the first essay that I ve written since my master s thesis I know you can t read for shit but I just have to get this off my chest and hopefully save you some money amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp To the new influx of people here THIS ABSOLUTELY CONCERNS YOU TOO There will be no TL DR nor a TL CR If you can t read or don t want to read here s a Go fuck yourself I What happens now with GME amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp First of all some background on me and then we ll get to the good stuff Software engineer at a very big company ex CTO in 2 failed startups One of the startups failed miserably and the other obtained 500k in VC funding and then failed miserably amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp I don t believe in short squeezes as an investing framework Short squeezes are price actions where one side gets the stick and the other gets the carrot The problem is that more likely than not the side that gets the stick is also the side that s right amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp Shitron in his shitty video although he was wrong 90 of the way he was right in one instance There is a reason why short interest is high in a security the business is failing or expected to fail Now ask yourself this do you want to put money on the line in the hopes of someone although that someone is right gets margin called then his margin call triggers other margin calls and you somehow sell at the top and not left hanging with heavy bags worth nothing Fuck me that s retarded beyond any autism spectrum If you invest in short squeezes you deserve to lose it all or if you orchestrated it go to jail like that Martin Skreli guy amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp GME will get to high triple digits sooner or later thanks to the small amount of float low total number of shares and current low market cap so this isn t done yet The increase is not because of a price action it s because Cohen took over he s serious about digital transformation omnichannel has cash and most importantly has a good management team backing him up The guys that are shorting need to get out not because they will get margin called but because they are wrong amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp There are some pretty good DDs out there and won t go through them as you should start using google reddit search to feed your confirmation bias The only DD that caught my eye is the VC funding one which is why I told you my background https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l0yzb5 a venture capital perspective on gme amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp If you haven t read it go read it it s good it s also a painful trip down on memory lane from the time when I was talking to VCs clients and investors I firmly believe that the guy is right and this is a very possible future of GME amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp Now the other hand GME as a business doesn t want to squeeze amp be known for a pump and dump Why Because they have a business to run and not some elaborate scam GME wants to grow organically but cannot do so with this amount of short interest so they most likely will bail the shorts out at some point Who here don t like free money Their bottom line matters They want to have the capital to pay down high interest rate debts and they also want to have money to start investing in growth When amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp Fuck me if I know If I knew I d be a freaking billionaire not ranting on the internet amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp I think there s a scenario where this doesn t squeeze at all and the price increases instantly then GME issues shares then from that point forward the growth story begins Be ready for this scenario and temper your expectations accordingly amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp To sum up on GME there are 2 very possible scenarios that I see in the near future 1 GME will squeeze hard and reach high triple digits soon go back down hard and then growth begins 2 GME will issue shares bail out the shorts pay down its debt and then have free fuel to rocket into that 50B valuation amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp Either way be prepared to hold for a few years if the 2nd scenario comes to fruition or get back in after the squeeze and hold for a few years II What happens after GME amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp A lot of you are going to have money available A LOT OF MONEY by your standards A lot of you small fish smooth brained extra chromosomal autistic retards are going to want MORE The truth is you got lucky this is one in a decade event there is no next GME Keep in mind that the best funds out there make 20 per year In the long run you will do worse amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp Another thing that we should get out of the way WSB is NOT a pump and dump sub reddit where someone posts some DD and then everyone else puts money in That s stupid that s not how investing works that s not what this sub is about To top it all we don t have the capital to have any meaningful impact on the market But but but shut up nobody is going to pump some worthless piece of shit so you can get out amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp There s a very good post on how to identify a pump and dump here https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments jdvfok the anatomy of a wsb pump and dump amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp Read that motherfucker like it s your bible Better yet fuck the bible fuck Jesus fuck Buddha and fuck whatever else you fucks worship That post needs to be printed on paper laminated by your bedside indexed per line and when someone says 4 23 you d better know the word at that location amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp My GME average is somewhere around 16 per share quite high by some standards but that s because I didn t believe in the original thesis I didn t know when Cohen would get serious and quite frankly from my perspective before October the conditions just weren t there for me to risk money on this I spent 100 hours researching GME before I put a dollar in I only put money in when I was knowledgeable enough to risk it You fucks need to do the same amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp WSB is a corner near the ghetto supermarket where drug dealers hookers retards and currency traders meet up to share ideas If you new retards don t believe me search for a dude named Variation Separate or something like that and the red river of loss that followed Some of the guys here will have had an episode of PTDS after reading that name You fuckers need to understand that there are some shady people here that will sound smart be smart and are after YOUR HARD EARNED CASH Even if they aren t after your money they can still be dead wrong amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp Someone will post a TA chart filled with crayons support lines MACDs and all sorts of math equations and you retards will go all in thinking this is the big one here comes the money train choo choo Yeah the train is here but you are on the tracks amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp So for new traders old traders and everyone else here when investing I have the following pieces of advice for you do well at your job and earn risk free money stick to what you know aka the business segment you re currently employed in You will most likely beat MOST IF NOT ALL analysts because you have more intimate day to day knowledge if you decide to invest in something else than your current expertise like gourds or GME do the research read 10Ks Qs S1s 13Fs 13Ds form 4s etc READ READ READ and get it through your thick skull that nobody else here is going to do it for you learn to spot bullshit Did you play GME amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp Well done you are winning amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp Be humble be smart with your money and most importantly when this is done take some god damn time off the market maybe even time off work and relax I know I will You will have deserved it You didn t play GME amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp Sucks but you have an opportunity to learn Learn why the trade happened learn the conditions that lead to this trade This will happen again 10 20 years from now in another context something will be different but you ll be able to spot it amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp III The state of WSB after GME amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp Re read the previous segment I think Pumps and dumps and next GMEs will be rampant amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp We ll also see 3 main categories joining 1 Noobs You new retards will do well here and lose a lot of money 2 Hedge fund chads These guys will start reading through the shit here and try to find ways to fuck you your wife and your wife s boyfriend Get ready for pegging if you don t start reading 3 Pump and dump scalping sharks These guys will try to trick you into a pump and dump scheme on a company nobody ever heard of and take your money It s your own god damn fault for pressing buy sell so act accordingly amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp This is not financial advice Compulsory GME diamond rockets at the end amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp English is not my native language so if you are here to correct grammar fuck you

and figured I d look into the company I used to have a windows phone and while the OS was absolute shit the phone itself was solid NOK also ended trading at 4 20 on Friday so I figured why not look into it After briefly looking over the past couple quarterly reports I ve found Nokia is as resilient as the phones it manufactures Today I m discussing the long term case for Nokia DISCLAIMER I don t get paid for this I m not a professional I m not giving financial advice I won t have a lot of pretty charts in this so just eat some fucking crayons like you normally do amp x200B The Gossip As some of you less smooth brained retards know Nokia has been getting shat on from shareholder s perspective over the past couple years Seeing a few big dips in share price both in 2019 and 2020 which I will explain later It appears that a lot of traders have left the company by the wayside for corporations like Motorola MSI and Cisco CSCO I see you lookin Investment Journalists have already been discussing speculative success for Nokia long term Here are some examples https investorplace com 2019 12 nokia short term pain clouding long term future https investorplace com 2019 12 nokia short

sweety but hang in there to provide context for my next point https finance yahoo com news cramer shares thoughts nokia intel 140851142 html Cramer said he prefers growth but with Nokia s long existing foothold in many facets of the telecom industry AND Pekka Lundmark s EXPLICTLY EXPRESSED focus for Nokia s efforts on dominating a specific niches of mobile access gt We have a strong position in technologies that are important for critical networks such as open and virtualized radio access networks and we are on course for a 100 cloud native software portfolio We are looking at serious growth within a particular spectrum spectrum like frequency spectrum HAHA TELECOM JOKE and I think it dubious to dismiss Nokia s potential for growth where it wants to grow Oh look blue

Nokia s existing 4G footprint at the end of 2018 and the dark blue represents where a 5G footprint has been created to replace it Notice that some dark blue exists outside the dotted square That s all NEW STUFF LOOKIE THERE FELLA UR SO SMART At the same time some of the 4G footprint remains because of interest in providing service to um legacy products As of the Q3 report Nokia owns 27 of the 4G 5G mobile radio market share excluding the Chinese market for that matter This hasn t been a company that has lacked resources or experience but direction and focus there is a LOT to telecommunications and there are many doors this company can take It has the connections money and focus necessary to achieve these long term goals that its leaders set If done right 2021 won t be a year of killer cash flow and revenue but will establish Nokia with one massive cock I know it s not exactly flashy sexy and won t see immediate results in the next two or three quarters but the newly appointed Chief Technical Officer Nishant Big Daddy Batra knows R amp D and knows the ins and outs of Cloud Service Programs Nokia has some BIG brain boys steering the ship Let s talk about something you troglodytes can follow money amp x200B Processing img mhfymmoejcd61 Net sales operating profit and margin are on track for another consistent year albeit slightly lower than 2019 This is good news considering that it lost a large north american customer this previous year due to its lackluster 5G footprint WHICH Lundmark the aforementioned new president of Nokia has explicitly stated that this will be the primary focus R amp D in tech that will position it as a long term leader in the 5G space They can do it too I ll dumb it down for you retards Boys this is FISCALLY DISCIPLINED leadership BuT sHoUldN T aLL lEadErShIp bE gOoD wItH mOneY First shut the fuck up and let me explain There was a major dip in share price in 2019 after Nokia announced that it would not be paying dividends for two consecutive quarters The boomers and gay bears in r investing didn t like the sound of that and decided to sell to really stick it to Nokia and bought shit like CRUS because MMs told their sheep to Nokia cut dividends temporarily in order to offset the cost of rolling out 5G tech https www bloomberg com news articles 2019 10 24 nokia cuts earnings outlook and pauses dividend to invest in 5g https www bloomberg com news articles 2019 10 24 nokia cuts earnings outlook and pauses dividend to invest in 5g It was supposed to be a short term biting of the bullet for shareholders in order to see long term benefits but God forbid people didn t get their 19 cent a share dividends There has been open discussion of bringing back dividends within the next couple years if the company sees continued growth in its cash flow Nokia mentions the possibility of gt an earnings based growing dividend of approximately 40 to 70 of non IFRS diluted EPS taking into account Nokia s cash position and expected cash flow generation source https www nasdaq com articles buy nokia stock before the company resumes dividends 2020 10 21 If Nokia officially announces a re rolling out of dividends boomers will get Rock Fucking Hard and slurp up shares on the cheap This is where speculation comes in and is ultimately why I am posting this shit in WSB Nokia has some major competition minus Huawei in the United States which is a big fucking deal and I m amazed how that escapes people considering the recent contracts Nokia secured with the US government Some of that competition currently has the leg up on Nokia and betting on them is risky but if Nokia can prove within the next year that it has a plan we have got some SERIOUS upward potential Also check the options activity on Nokia for the next 2 weeks leading up to its Q4 report It s getting me frisky I could further dissect additional strategies associated with Nokia s portfolio including what else it has it s toes in but big picture Nokia will begin to hone in on a specific set of specializations 5G and Cloud native software services Oh and you degenerates aren t paying me TL DR Nokia has potential for skyward trajectory with its new leadership

cant read blind , tldr GME position 3580 shares at 35 amp x200B Hey this is Andrew left at Citron research giving you five reasons why GameStop is going to 20 I ve never seen such an exchange of ideas and people so angry about someone showing the other side of a trade and not just saying a company that let s just say it s supposed to make the world a better place maybe a Tesla or security problems or COVID This is a failing mall based retailer So the amount of people who are so passionate about putting GameStop higher not based on any fundamentals it just shows the natural state of the market right now Or Seth Klarman said today a bunch of frogs in a pot of boiling water So let s just get right to the five reasons why we believe it s going back to 20 Number one is the elephant in the room most obvious how people believe we are in the middle of a short squeeze noted there was a very high short interest in the stock And there still is your first question you have to ask yourself is why is there a high shortage But moving beyond that a stock at 40 right now has an open borrow on it you could borrow it for a fairly decent rate there s plenty of options on the stock And and it s no longer now we re looking at a trading phenomenon is people just keeping it off a lot of call volume there s no short squeeze that is happening as we speak Me personally who is short the stock I have no problem selling the stock higher you re not going to change the story you re not going to change the underlying fundamentals of this company Therefore as long as the borrows available and insiders are still selling and the company needs money you won t see a squeeze from here on in Number two numbers don t lie People lie I know everyone on Twitter never has a winning trade Everyone on Reddit is a market genius I hear it all the time That s fine Those are people Let s look at the numbers Let s look at the numbers for GameStop Now understand as a short seller I was the first short to actually come out and go long Tesla Once I saw the story changed the numbers changed They were eating from the top and they were eating from the bottom And I identified the fact you can t be short this game It s up I think 90 Since then it s the opposite when it comes to GameStop NPD is the gold standard when it comes to gaming reports On January 14 they put out their analysis of what December looked like in the video game season hardware sales had their best month ever up 23 year over year because the two cycles over that time GameStop was down 9 Now I understand this is what physical locations forget about all the future what they re going to lose to downloading and streaming their physical locations We re actually down during the past month they were losing to Amazon Best Buy target and Walmart And the reason why because people are not going in to exchange their old discs anymore or old games for new games That model has become dead and antiquated And that was a cornerstone of GMA So with those numbers that we saw come out of NPD it shows that before they might even try to turn the company around their current business is just drowning You cannot argue against that Number three valuations matter This is not Tesla This is not a company that with a blue sky this is a retailer you will look at valuations This is what no one s looking at on your Reddit forums So forget about the fact that analysts have a consensus 12 target on the stock Let s just go look at Hedgeye and I like Hedgeye I think they do great work We re fans of it We we use that we speak to them They re smart guys they recommended CME when it was 14 And if you bought it then you d be making money At the time It s before Jimmy reported their numbers they were expecting 2021 EBITDA to be around 333 million Now the street is at 71 million And we we think they re gonna have negative even though if they did 330 million which is seems like a completely opposite number now Then they had the price target hydride at 26 The model just does not work And when you want to talk about valuations think about it this way This is a retailer Even if they fix it they re still a retailer trying to get 40 times next 12 months Evie to EBIT da 40 Apple is 23 Best Buy is seven Walmart is 13 So if you like the company the fact that GameStop has actually become an expensive stock is just beyond number four know who s on the other side of the trade I know who s on GameStop right now the people who are ordering pizzas to my house or signing me up for Tinder or doing all those cute things trying to hack my Twitter account I know you ve been going after a specific hedge fund No need to name that s been short game stuff People believe they re short This particular hedge fund happens to be one of the top consumer discretionary funds out there So you should actually listen and see who s short the name and why they re short the name as well Someone who does go short I always look who owns it Ryan Cohen owns the stock at 9 Very smart guy If Ryan sells it at 20 he doubled his money If Ryan sells it at zero he still has more money than me and more money than you So where s the stock today Who owns it and why people are short the stock these are the names right now And last thing is the company can become your biggest enemy We re looking at a company with a billion dollars in debt If the stock goes any higher they should just sell stock right into you and raise money and pay off some debt More importantly if they want to make an acquisition in the gaming space acquisition start in the billions in this place and they re gonna have to sell a lot of stock to do that Me personally I think you could have a pickup This is either going to be JC Penney that brightens in when Bill Ackman brought in Ron Johnson people got excited he was going to turn it but you just can t change a bad retailer Or it can be Blockbuster Video that never adapted the technology You got to look at Ryan Cohen s letter which is well written two months ago to GameStop management how they completely dropped the ball with what they were doing It s the same management right now The stock was 20 before we saw any holiday data there s no reason it doesn t go right back to 20 There s nothing in place there You can get mad you can hack my account you can go to Twitter you can sign on you can call me every name If you want to take the company take your energy go out there and actually buy something from GameStop because that s the only thing that says this Other than that the more you buy I m sure there ll be supply on the other side cautious investing to everyone

here throwing away money on investments they know next to nothing about This is meant to be a basic introduction to options prices I am not a financial professional and this should not be misconstrued as investment advice This will probably be long so TL DR Stop throwing away your money and learn about what you re buying If you don t want to read mike and his whiteboard https www youtube com watch v kmQ20J 3K7Q amp list PLPVve34yolHY43YaBegHMzN9WjrTnQfFr amp ab channel tastytrade is a good resource I am not affiliated in any way Initially wrote this at the end but I think it s better at the beginning Practical Applications General Advice General pointers for the newbies Most of the option trading shown on WSB is OTM naked calls or puts with expiration lt 3 weeks FDs These are like lotto tickets and are not considered responsible investments by anyone including ourselves They are retarded and we know it You should know it too before buying Theta is usually insane and probability you make money is slim On the flip side selling these options is sometimes considered ok but is often referred to as picking up pennies in front of a steamroller due to the low return for high risk If you want to preserve your hard earned money make responsible plays With options that usually means 3 months minimum expiration and strikes somewhat least close to the money if not in the money Consider the implications of IV in your trades and make sure you understand the mechanics of the options before opening spreads Options Basics An option is a contract that gives you the option to buy call or sell put 100 shares of a stock at a certain price the strike price at or before a certain date the expiration date Options are priced per share so a call with a listed price of 1 will cost you 100 total for 1 contract 1 x 100 shares For American style options what most of you are trading you can exercise at any time before the strike price while with European options which are sold for major indices on American markets can only be exercised on the expiration date That doesn t matter too much for our purposes but I ll get into that later Options have both intrinsic and extrinsic value Intrinsic value is what that option would be worth at expiration For example if you have a 60 call in gamestop and gamestop stock is at 65 your intrinsic value is 65 60 5 the difference your strike price vs what price you can sell it on the open market An option will only have intrinsic value if it is in the money ITM which means price is above strike for calls and below strike for puts Extrinsic value is the time value of the option and will vary based on the implied volatility IV of the option The definition of implied volatility is complicated and tends towards circular logic if you apply it practically but is generally it can be thought of as how much options traders expect the underlying to move If the stock moves a lot IV goes up If there s a big event like an earnings report IV goes up If that earnings report passes or the stock stabilizes IV goes down IV varies greatly depending from one stock to another and can change drastically depending on numerous circumstances but as a generalization anything lt 30 IV could be considered low and anything gt 100 IV could be considered high Out of the money options price below strike for calls and above strike for puts have value that is entirely extrinsic for that reason they tend to have larger percent moves than ITM options Greeks The greeks can be an intimidating topic but are extremely important if you want to trade spreads more on this later and I would argue anyone buying options should have a basic understanding of the greeks This will be geared towards average wsb investors I m not going to get into the other greeks here because they usually aren t as important for our purposes Delta How much the option price will move relative to the share price Positive for calls and negative for puts It ranges 0 1 delta of 1 is equivalent to holding 100 shares delta 0 5 is equivalent of holding 50 shares Simple enough This will increase as you are in the money and decrease if you are out of the money An at the money option will typically have 0 5 delta a far ITM option will have delta close to 1 Theta How much time value the option will lose per day This is gt 0 technically lt 0 if you are short more on this later A theta of 0 1 means the value of the option will lose 0 10 share day or 10 day Theta increases as the expiration date becomes closer so an option expiring this week will lose more money day than one expiring next month given same strike For options of the same expirations it will typically increase the further OTM an option is and decrease the further ITM the option is Gamma Rate of change of delta This represents how much delta will change as the stock price moves This is highest for near the money options and lowest for far ITM or far OTM options Vega Change in option price relative to on change in IV High vega means the price moves a lot with changes in IV This will increase with the amount of time left on the contract more time higher vega and is typically highest at the money strikes and lowest for far ITM or OTM strikes Buying Selling Options Just like stocks you can buy or sell individual contracts these are known as naked positions A naked long is when you buy the contract while a naked short is when you sell it You can also create positions that combine both long and short options these are known as spreads Naked positions are fairly easy to understand and trade though they typically come with higher risk reward than their spread counterparts Long vs Short You can buy or sell options Buyers can sell or exercise their contracts to close the position Buyers need the stock price to move for their position to profit Shorts can buy to close or wait for the option to expire They will profit if the price stays the same from theta or moves in their favor Increases in IV will help longs and hurt shorts decreases in IV will help longs and hurt shorts Naked Calls Bulls buy calls Their maximum loss is the initial cost of the call their max profit is uncapped They lose theta Bears sell calls their maximum loss is unlimited and their max profit is the initial price of the call They gain theta Naked Puts Bears buy puts Their max loss is the initial price of their put their max profit is uncaped they lose theta Bulls sell puts their maximum loss is the strike price of the contract stock price can t go below zero minus the initial cost of the contract their max profit is the initial price of the contract Spreads Combination of a buy and a sell These come in all different forms and allow all sorts of strategies that are impossible with shares or naked positions In general there are credit spreads which is when you sell the spread and receive money up front and debit spreads which you buy the spread pay up front When constructing spreads it s useful to know that the resulting greeks will be the sum of the greeks from all the contracts in the spread So if you buy a call with delta 0 5 and sell a call with delta 0 25 your overall delta is 0 5 0 25 0 25 I m only going to cover a few here because I m getting tired but just know there are a ton of options trading strategies out there Vertical Spread Buy and sell different strikes at the same expiration For example if I m bullish on GME I can buy 60 calls and sell 65 calls for 1 29 debit spread The cost of the 60 call is offset by the 65 but the profit is capped at 5 per contract Theta is lower and can be negative although delta and gamma are also lower It s important to note that when the position is ITM the overall spread price will be less than the intrinsic value of the spread due to the extrinsic value of the short leg until you re insanely far ITM For example that 60 65 vertical spread will be worth lt 5 even if GME is 75 The price of the spread will approach its intrinsic value as the remaining time on the contract approaches 0 I can also sell a vertical spread credit spread I will receive the difference in value of the two contracts and will need cash collateral to cover the difference between the strikes For example I can sell a 65 put and buy a 60 put Since the 65 put is worth more I receive a credit lets say 200 then I also need to put up 300 in additional collateral If GME goes above 65 I can wait for the contract to expire useless or buy it back for cheaper than I sold it If it goes below 65 my loses are offset by the 200 credit If it goes below 60 my losses are capped at 300 by my long put I buy shares at 65 sell at 65 and initial credit received Iron condor Combination of two OTM vertical spreads typically of the same width Most people trade these short the nice thing about that is your collateral can be shared between the call and put side because there is no way for both sides to be ITM at the same time If you re short you make money if stock price stays the same or if volatility goes down basically the same Horizontal spreads Buy and sell the same strike at different expirations AKA calendar spreads Most useful for betting on changes in volatility A long calendar spread sell close expiration buy long will be long volatility a short calendar spread buy close expiration sell long is short volatility You can also use this strategy for earnings plays when you know the short dated options will lose more volatility than long dated options These are most valuable near the money and will lose value as they go farther ITM or OTM For this reason some traders will incorporate both OTM puts and calls into these positions Calls are delta neutral at the money slightly delta positive OTM and slightly delta negative ITM reverse for puts That s all I have the energy for Feel free to ask questions Good luck out there Positions GME shares

the most important items first Positions 385 shares cost about 35 2 5 calls and 1 29 calls I know this subreddit has been flooded with GME posts the last few days but its for good reason We are all looking at a once in a lifetime opportunity I have been seeing a lot of posts today about the future and whats going to happen to GME and that we are bad guys and all that shit Who gives a fuck what the talking heads have to say Retail traders are winning this battle and its that simple Last Week First lets look at what happened last week It was a battle all week Every single day was a head to head battle between bulls and bears The price action Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday was very similar You saw a price run up in the morning around the same time every day and then the price faded away and GME went negative for a period of time After the price faded it started to gradually climb again I believe this price action was a coordinated attack by the shorts Just look at the timing All three days at almost the same time showed the same price action If you don t know what I am talking about how about listening to our favorite boomer Jimbo Cramer https www youtube com watch v gMShFx5rThI amp ab channel dehurlock explain it Skip to about 45 seconds in This is nothing new The shorts like Melvin have plenty of weight they can throw around and easily move a stock like GME with a low float and low market cap It didn t work though The bulls prevailed by buying the dip everytime On top of that they began to take control of the media narrative It first started with Citron s tweet and honestly sloppy video about how GME is going back to 20 Why 20 Idk probably their break even price He provided no reason for why 20 was the magic number Ok boomer next But the negative media coverage towards WSB and all retail in general began to heat up on Friday when there was a gamma squeeze if you don t know what a gamma squeeze go back to previous WSB post that explain Acting like it was our fault Market Movers practiced bad risk management It is never the big monies fault if you haven t noticed The negative media coverage is getting serious over the weekend You think Melvin doesn t have any connection at Goldman Sachs You don t think they don t have media connections at almost every media outlet available Bulls 4 Bears 0 The Long Term Future If you believe Ryan Cohen is going to turn around this company than a 50 billion market cap company in 5 10 years is not insane The gaming industry is going to be 500 billion plus in 5 10 years easy Gamestop could control 10 of the market without a doubt But that s only if you believe in Ryan Cohen s vision At these prices we are still looking at a potential 10 bagger in 5 10 years Near Term Future I have no idea whats going to happen this upcoming week But don t get it twisted its going to be a wild week with surprises But if I had to speculate here is what I would say is going to happen 1 Hedge funds will continue to throw their weight around Just more aggresively The hedge funds are bleeding money No question about that I doubt Melvin is going to go out of business because of this though lets be real But they definitely don t want to be known as the hedge fund that got out played by fucking a bunch of retail investors That reputation shot might send them packing Because of this I don t think they will throw in the towel Rich people on that level are arrogant they are cocky They think less of us average people They think we are stupid They are going to come after us all week They will be putting huge amounts of resources into the battle No question Expect them to continue running the price up and then down again and other things that we shaven t seen yet 2 The media coverage is going to heat up and its going to be all negative From the mass media s point of view we are the bad guys We are uneducated gamblers trying to create destruction They are going to talk down about Gamestop and how they are a failing business The media is apart of the system They are big money They are not going to give retail investors positive news coverage Jim Cramer is not going to be positive about retail investors It is in their interest to keep up as the little guy 3 We are going to hear something from Gamestop management Who knows what it will be but at some point they will do or say something There is a lot of talk about Gamestop doing their shelf offering soon I mean yeah why wouldn t they But here is the time Its only a 100 million shelf offering That will not bail out the shorts But people may get scared and think it will bail out the shorts The number of shares shorted are around 70 million if Gamestop was able to do a self offering and offered even just 50 million that would be the most bullish piece of news they can give us I mean 50 million shares at 65 bucks a pop is a cool 3 25 billion dollars That would be EXTREMELY bullish They also wont offer enough stock to bail them out because Ryan Cohen didn t just acquire 20 of the company just to have it diluted back down to fucking 12 Biggest Threats to the Potential Squeeze 1 People sell their stock Simple Retail investors are going to start to get nervous They are going to be listening to the talking heads on the TV that are telling them to take profits because the valuations are too high Even though these are the same talking heads who said Nikola was a innovative company at fucking 50 billion market cap and they were literally pushing trucks down a hill to act like they can move themselves Doesnt matter though most average joes will watch the TV and listen to them because that s what media is used for 2 People sell their stock because they are afraid of the self offering bailing out the short sellers Again I am pretty sure they cant offer enough stock to bail out the short sellers Ryan Cohen wont want to lose his voting power and their 8 k from December only authorized 100 million dollar offering at a time 3 Retial and institution stop buying the stock and calls Dont get me wrong it is not 100 retail traders Institutions are a big factor Matter of fact they own 100 of the float Every share you and I own are all IOUs Everyhting is fucked Institutions wont sell because they are long term players and they would need their shares back in order to sell Here is the bottom line If you are buying in tomorrow its because you have balls of steel and want to make fucking tendies If you are skeptical and are going to buy in then sell if the price drops 10 then don t fucking waste your time on Robinhood Focus on your dead end 9 5 job and stop trying to act like a day trader This is a once in a lifetime opportunity If you re getting in then GET THE FUCK IN Sorry for the long GME post I just wanted people to know that this shit is next level Nobody knows whats going on and the hedge funds are loading up their fucking ICB missiles right now getting ready to launch them The question is are you going to flinch when they launch them Or are you going to fucking shoot those commie missiles out of the sky by buying the fucking dip TL DR If you are going to buy shares buy the fucking shares Then sit on your hands and enjoy the fucking ride If you are going to buy shares only to sell them at the next 10 drop listen to me loud and clear Send me your wife phone number so I can be here boyfriend You have no place here GME to the fucking Moon Disclaimer you re a retard if you buy strictly on my post Youre buying because you are ready to be the first person on Mars After DFV of course

my thoughts on one potential option GME has to make a significant pivot and leverage its current market place position as the leading multi platform video gaming retailer into a digital future This model allows for a lot of optionality and diverse revenue mix Note I do not think this is the only option available to GameStop nor the right one just throwing it out there as it shows how much potential there is to re think this business on a fundamental perspective there is a lot of upside if they can execute on something compelling Summary A digital platform that offers both a subscription service for all you can eat cross platform titles plus a digital games store where you can purchase cross platform titles that are able to be traded in for a credit What revenue would it create At the moment GameStop has over 50 million PowerUp Reward members This program is largely limited to USA whereby this digital platform can be global As a benchmark World of Warcraft has over 110 million subscribers 15 month that s 1 game If this service cost 169 per year cheaper than Microsoft s GamePass Ultimate this is roughly the recurring revenue it would bring in Maybe they could charge a lot more than this 19 99 per month or 239 pa 24 99 per month or 299 pa This service may just sit alongside GamePass or Microsoft may choose to just integrate into GameStop s service so they are getting their Microsoft owned studio titles on more systems See this article Microsoft wants Xbox Game Pass on PS4 https www digitaltrends com gaming microsoft xbox game pass on ps4 Subscribers 50

like Game Pass does but could work more like a library system where you can check out something like a few games at a time Any games And turn them back in Given the potential for license revoking the opportunity of how the model could work on a subscription basis is only limited by your imagination This kind of new approach would be different to what we ve seen to date out there Digging deeper More like Spotify for Games In some ways this model could operate similar to music and movie streaming services e g Spotify amp Netflix where you have the ability to choose from the entire catalogue and the publishers are paid based on what is being consumed streamed used played Play hours could be monitored and factored in Benchmark Netflix has around 200 million subscribers Spotify around 150 million Disney around 85 million Classic Buy Trade In model On top of this purchased games would be sold in full generating more classic sales revenue These digital purchases could work in a number of ways 1 Games sold generate commission profit per sale just like selling a retail disc now and could be integrated into existing digital stores across Xbox Playstation and Nintendo eShop 2 Games purchased through the console stores or other stores could be traded in with GameStop for a small credit It would be some minor work to integrate ability for the existing platforms to disable transfer the digital license Traded in games would encourage more purchasing than what happens currently where they rot in your catalogue never to be played again so publishers are incentivized to be involved and contribute to this DLC and other digital purchases in game could generate a similar commission for GameStop in the same way that the current Microsoft revenue share model has See below Couldn t do this instead Maybe But GameStop has advantages over every other player who might want to become the Netflix of gaming if you will They are neutral compared to other companies in the gaming sector and neutral to the other major tech companies such as Google Amazon Facebook when you put them up against Microsoft in particular Microsoft Sony Nintendo Steam GameStop PC X X X Xbox X X PlayStation X X Nintendo X X GameStop is well connected across the gaming world to act as the global carrier for digital gaming 1 Steam might be able to pivot into this area but GameStop has something Steam doesn t have the console market Primarily this means capturing Nintendo amp Sony into this future 2 GameStop has Reggie Fils Aim former President at Nintendo of America This is a huge card in terms of getting Nintendo of Japan to agree to some kind of involvement 3 Game streaming is something that can be built in now or down the track Again being platform neutral is a big bonus here as the offer they provide would not be limited to other ecosystems such as what would be through XCloud or Stadia Microsoft may even want to develop a deeper partnership to provide the technology infrastructure e g license transfer XCloud like an AWS style relationship and allow GameStop to operate it as a neutral party At the end of the day Microsoft may get slightly smaller cut of a much larger pie through a model like this and not be accused of anti trust monopolization Understanding the Microsoft Digital Revenue Share gt Domo President Justin Dopierala told Ars that GameStop Investor Relations representative Eric Cerny sent an email with the statement We are allowed to state we will receive a portion of the downstream revenue from any device we will bring into the Xbox ecosystem gt gt Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba confirmed what Dopierala said adding that GameStop will get a percentage of the revenue from every full game and DLC download every microtransaction and every subscription made through an Xbox Series X or Series S it has sold through its stores And since the original line in the PR mentions lifetime revenue value it means the retailer will be receiving money from Microsoft throughout each console s lifetime 1 Microsoft want to do these things but know they would never get Sony onboard They probably wouldn t even get Nintendo onboard 2 Sony has been known to bow to pressures in the gaming industry so would come on board with something like this if Microsoft and Nintendo are hooked in Sony caves to the fans Fortnite cross platform play coming to the PS4 https www nintendoenthusiast com cross platform play fortnite ps4 Plus all the other options available for revenue 1 Physical media will likely still exist for a long time Case in point We re still buying up Vinyls Hell there s probably still a case for retaining some stores over the next 2 decades in some capacity 2 There s a waft of physical items that GameStop can continue to sell Collectibles hardware pc parts consoles both outright and subscription based hardware apparel peripherals toys books etc 3 eSports Tournament platforms leagues streaming 4 Private label brands GameStop can expand into its own house brand of gaming accessories 5 Game studio development They can start to make their own games ala what Netflix Original Content is all about There s billions of dollars of potential here 6 Leverage the data 50 million members and growing What else can it do with it TLDR
