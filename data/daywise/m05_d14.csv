of America and why you shouldn t feel stupid for buying the dip ,by now you all should be sick to death of hearing about Palantir shit stock hype company everyone knows this already most of you barely understand what they do some of you do understand and root for the potential of the birth of yet another trillion dollar company but that s not what I m going to talk about There is an aspect to all this that I have not yet seen discussed anywhere and as soon as people figure it out I suspect Palantir will see activity beyond anything anyone right now has predicted Lets start by asking a question If you had to create a company that was perfect in every way that was untouchable by competition and greater than any company before it one that would make google or amazon look like AMC by comparison what would you need to do first it would need to be a monopoly no question there right but a monopoly of what There are currently 2 options that fit best and are also realistically achievable those to things are information and energy both will always exist they will always be in high demand they will never go out of style and whoever finds a way to gain absolute control over one or both will effectively become the most wealthy person ever 100 thousand years from now when humanity has transcended existence and all material wants we will still need information and energy Palantir is attempting to monopolize information and to better understand why this is such a big deal lets see what it would take to monopolize energy the first and surprisingly easiest step would be to create a viable source of free or almost free energy that you would then sell probably through monthly payments to the entire world miniature thorium reactors or breakthroughs in fusion technology could potentially do this There is more to be done however 1 In order for your business to last for centuries your device needs to be impossible to recreate by anybody except your business and those associated with it 2 it needs to be cheap very cheap and yet generate revenue regularly no matter the conditions or state of the world 3 It needs to be constantly improved or somehow protected from the possibility of someone creating an even better idea and putting your company out of business assuming all these goals are met you would now be the owner of a business that will always generate profit that will always exist and bring value to customers and that exists in a market that grows as humanity grows meaning your potential is linked to the success and proliferation of humanity With no possible competition you would be the creator of the most successful company to ever exist How now could this be accomplished with information and how far is Palantir from achieving these same goals is their product impossible to recreate is it cheap and consistent with revenue Is it immune to any possibility of anyone catching up with something even better Almost not quite yet but they are surprisingly close amp x200B 1 can their product be recreated technically yes but both Gotham and Foundry are seeing adoption by some very important organizations Gotham is already joined at the hip with the United States government and with continued proven effectiveness and Palantir s willingness to make deals with other countries its pretty much guaranteed that Gotham will be seeing mass adoption into other countries as well Like a really nice disease eventually everyone aligned with the United States will use it Foundry s the big fish here though The real deal and the reason Palantir is on track with their goal of becoming the biggest software company in the world That s not me saying that they literally make that claim in their most recent earnings report All businesses and people essentially have the same problem Data is very valuable probably one of the most inherently valuable things in existence Don t believe me take a look at your computer data is just the transfer of information and a computer is simply a really big bundle of information and tricks to measure that information A whole bunch of transistors turn on and off and through a massive amount of clever engineering and abstraction all that data of whether or not something s on or off 1 or 0 gets turned into your afternoon midget porn this is an extreme example of how much value can be pulled from data no matter how unimportant or useless it may seem 100 years ago nobody would have ever guessed that stringing a bunch of lights together and having them interact through rules determined by whether they are on or off would possibly lead to what we have today but here we are Data has value The problem that every business has is that they have all this data but how exactly do you extract value from that how do you extract the most value possible everyone has their own solutions to these problems but there is no unification to any of it This is where Foundry comes in Data that the Country or Business or person owns gets fed into Foundry and everyone using it can assign specific rules to this data This is a drastic oversimplification but you frankly don t need to know the gritty details because they don t really matter here All you need to know is that this oversimplification applies to computers as well Computers are a massive collection of data governed by rules where the result and potential uses are completely controlled by the person using the computer There are plenty of questions here how it works exactly how private it is what the use cases look like and you can do this research on your own What s interesting here is that while this product can definitely be recreated its much much harder then it sounds and the fact that IBM and AWS have already given up and simply partnered with Palantir rather than try and recreate this technology just goes to show just how hard it would be to make a better Foundry or Gotham However assuming that everyone eventually starts using this tech what would happen if something better came along 2 Is Palantir s product immune to new and disruptive competition The answer here is yes and absolutely the REALLY neat thing about Foundry is that it essentially creates a perpetually self improving system People input data and assign rules but that data never disappears and those rules never change or are forgotten unless overruled by other more complex rules this means that ANY new data added to the system is used to further improve the system Again if you want more details do the research because I m trying to talk to children here I ve been talking about data a lot but I feel I should stress the fact that your idea of what data is or can be is likely underdeveloped did you poo today what color was it how soft was it was it chunkey or smooth how long were you on the toilet can any of this info be used to determine what you ate how healthy you are what time did you poo do you poo in cycles or does it come randomly can any of this information help predict when you will poo again maybe knowing these things can help you poo even better and more comfortably This is all Data All of it can be used and all of it has value to be found everything you see do feel and think is data The number of ways this data can be connected and utilized to better understand the world and yourself is potentially infinite Therefore a company that is able to create a product that can monopolize this potential could possibly grow even larger then one based on energy a product that is perpetually self improving will never be outpaced by anything else ESPECUALLY if they get a head start which is exactly what Palantir has spent 17 years and billions of dollars of R amp D on 3 Is Palantir s product cheap and guaranteed to be profitably no matter the state of the world I think it goes without saying that Software is the best business to be successful in This is Unfortunately where Palantir is at their weakest currently but as stated in their earnings report they are hell bent on focusing on growth over everything else First they bag huge companies with lotsa money then medium ones then small businesses and finally everyday average people Assuming company s continue to sign contracts there will one day be a turning point where Palantir goes from a WSB name to a household one you wont even notice it happen it will just happen As for profitability regardless of the state of the world Covid has already proven that Palantir s services are in very high demand amp x200B On top of ALL this Palantir is exclusively aligned with United States interests Imagine if every country in the world used Palantir to some extent and all that added value and power was exclusively controlled by the United States There is an even bigger discussion to be had on the current technological race between the USA and China over who will perfect AI first and the role Palantir will play in all this The conclusion here is that whoever does win in the end they will essentially decide the direction the world takes and how people in that world will live This situation is very similar to the race between the U S and Germany over who could invent the atomic bomb luckily for us there s a lot less hot fiery death and a lot more new world order overshadowing the old one through the always watchful eyes of artificial intelligence Elon musk is damn right to be afraid of AI and If I had to pick one country to take it all I would like it to be the USA This means that investing in Palantir is almost like betting on the United states in this all for one game Make no mistake there is a very very good chance that whether or not you care about Palantir your life is going to be affected by them one way or another The moral of the story is buy the fucking dip and don t be a pussy about it when you believe in a company enough it doesn t matter how much it dips because unless Karp and friends die in a fireball of death after boarding a small private jet to their mansions in Hawaii for a night of drug fueled indulgences the future will always be bright If you re unsure about Palantir still don t worry They aren t going anywhere and there will be many many many more catalysts to fomo into and lose 50 of your portfolio on Positions are 700 shares and 20 19 nov 21 calls

reddit com r wallstreetbets comments msv8n1 tbh i only trust retards I am so confident in it that I dared to put my beard which I have for five years already on the line Worth your full read I promise I decided to structure the analysis in the following way first we ll take a look at the VW short squeeze revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA after that I ll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks through which the GMESS https imgur com a Sd4uE1b thesis will be dissected applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example then the process will be repeated but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon Finally all of the data accumulated in the process as well as the major findings made will be applied to the current technical state of GME in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action Buckle up and eat a crayon let s start Oh and one more thing I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first and then in the aggregate zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences interdependences and probabilities Dafaq did

amp x200B amp x200B Remember when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading I bet Pepperidge apes remember The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario orchestrated largely by one very interesting person Back then the former President of Porsche Wendelin Wiedeking must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen In this process he used cash settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche s market operations While being acquired by Porsche Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares As the general public was finding out about Wendysking s takeover plan hedge funds and particularly short sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries approximately 70 While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased the preferential shares stayed put and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence For a moment there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence Only to get blindsided as it turned out later One shorts frying weekend Porsche announced its total holding in VW cornering the substantial part of the float and leaving only 6 in free float In the meantime short sales had risen to 12 of total stock outstanding When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74 1 of the outstanding shares through the in

amp s e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791 Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance don t worry I ll explain There are only two major TA instruments used here namely Fibonacci retracement tool useful for assessing altitude and the crucial support resistance levels check out the in depth explanation of this TA tool in my other post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments mwevzz the big short 20 why bears may soon reconsider The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods pink vertical grid with numbers 0 0 382 0 618 and so on for setting the major time landmarks and zones Furthermore you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures and the purple line which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis In the process of working with VW TSLA and GME charts I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts to one degree or another The most prominent one in my opinion is the killer purple resistance support level For the current VW example it is somewhere around 30 mark or 29 27 if you like precision One may observe on the chart above that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS First the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007 was held back and repulsed by this level s resistance on the last day of October It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008 This was followed by a consolidation with several failed attempts of breakout just below this level which lasted for more than 100 days before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July 08 And guess what Even after that the level played the major supportive role for the price action with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008 You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix I decided to name it Purple Haze Let s inspect the fancy geometric shapes now These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance The first one in orange is a cup shaped consolidation let it be called the Squeezy Grail because why not taking place above 100 Fibo and just below the Purple Haze which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature if you know what else is of a flatter nature comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award which again plays around the main 30 level on the chart The second consolidation highlighted by the pink rectangle a k a the Runway is actually more important than the first one because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens the Purple Haze resistance is blew off in the middle of 0 382 period Based on that observation it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate the Purple Haze has to be conquered at some point inside 0 382 Fibo time zone during the Runway stage Finally the triangular Squieezluminati Confirmed part is self explanatory imho Oh just one commentary worth being made here take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate bipartite and fits well into the isosceles triangle The nature surely knows how to play with stonks too Especially when we talk about Fibonacci The horizontal grid Fibo retracement is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend s depth as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle The 12th of September 07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application because on that day another important resistance of 20 72 was penetrated for the first time then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan 08 Furthermore 20 72 level works like an ideal 100 Fibo retrace level for the current example and supports the Holy Grail comparable to how my granny supports me Also take a note of the Purple Haze being relatively in the middle in between 78 6 and 100 of Fibo retracement an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend based Fib time grid TBFTG to be fucked then go alternatively This one is a complex instrument so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it Just like Fibo retracement TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence but this one applies to time periods instead of the price action and levels In order to use this instrument properly it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods Oh it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends trust me Tbh it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA But the result was worth the effort I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS and hypothetically to GME too TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend plus Squeezy Grail phase The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified and I m talking about all of the examples but possible especially when looking at the TA as a whole referring to how the grid applies to the price action and comparing the examples between each other That is pure rocket science if you ask me And most importantly the TBFTG measurement duration pink dash and dash trend seem to be very similar in length to Squieezluminati basis check the bars measurements on all of the charts blue lines for VW Pay attention to the following features which really help to dissect the squeezes anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework the Purple Haze breakout occurs in 0 382 TBFTG zone and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0 618 zone peaking at 1 TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus Squeezy Grail as it has been mentioned above Furthermore the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized Noice but let s move further amp x200B amp x200B Tesla or how Elon Mask truly is become meme Destroyer of shorts Apr 2019 Apr 2020 amp x200B amp x200B Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis and even after the run ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC for now the former have been winning The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark to market losses of over 40 billion in late 2020 as the company s shares exploded 740 last year This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners a fin anal company Remember the not so distant in past Tesla mania The prospects of Tesla s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price Elon Musk openly criticized the short sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company The taking Tesla private play seemed to work out for the short sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50 from November 2018 to May 2019 After that amidst Tesla s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company s first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations the tables have turned and the bear beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price not without noble WSBetters help definitely Needless to say that previously steady short sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions amp x200B

anatomy checklist thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW First things first the Squeezy Grail is present but it resembles more of a V shape structure Next the Runway stage is good looking a fucking massive gap happened there and this time 78 6 Fibo level is tested during the Runway being indicative of the TSLA bulls crazy power Squieezluminati Confirmed is also really interesting here as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure but rather a chainsaw like volatile price action taking place Furthermore you may see that inside of the triangle there is the after peak 78 6 Fibo zone retest which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of Moon Blessed be the bulls Looking at the Purple Haze which is again in between Fibo 78 6 and 100 important for TSLASS the major price level manifested at 52 46 During the first half of 2019 this level played a role of a magnetizing support with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April Again a lengthy half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level and above Fibo 100 retracement The breakout occurs you guessed right in the TBFTG 0 382 zone And what is really fascinating is the fact that after the breakout the Purple Haze has never been retested But who knows what the future holds And the Fibos The retracement again apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure 78 6 is trialed several times all of the upper levels except for 38 2 were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23 6 Fibo level and the high of 189 4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze Ah almost forgot 100 35 75 Fibo level firmly holds the Squeezy Grail in hand again Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too Particularly the downtrend as opposed to VW uptrend serves as the core for TBFTG s application again refer to the dash and dash pinkish line This core is composed of the pre Squeezy Grail downtrend plus the Grail itself Take a look at gray measurements which cover this phase and the triangle duration again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases Crucially the Purple Haze breakout occurs in 0 382 TBFTG zone again then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0 618 zone with the false first peak during the final stages of 0 618 and the proper peak at 1 Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above if you ask me Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account Two quotes are of a relevance here amp x200B gt

or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way and my beard supports my manly confidence However this is the market and it all may go another way at any point in time that s the nature of things Think critically learn and do your own DD and TA In a good memory of u ControlTheNarrative at least And so it begins Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis s thesis since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to The first and most important one is surely the Purple Haze I should remind you that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated For GME this major price level seems to be at about 233 mark with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above Then the shapes The Squeezy Grail again occurring in between 78 6 and 100 consolidation is also easily identifiable here and it is yet again followed by the rectangular Runway consolidation where the price action currently stands Remember how historically in TSLA and VW the Purple Haze breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action in 0 382 Fibo time zone Well to paraphrase Ian Fleming once is VW happenstance Twice is TSLA coincidence Three times is GMenemy action Fibos Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass Firstly because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument being ordinarily applied to the completed trend But since the situation is not ordinary at all I played smarter or more autistic if you like Due to the fact that the Purple Haze level was approximately in between 78 6 and 100 Fibo in both of the previous examples I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78 6 by the price action on Jan 28th And when these two major levels were identified the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze Fibos initiation point zoomed in https preview redd it t2ouren1d2z61 jpg

shortSqueeze has Canoo ranked 2 of companies that have the highest likelihood of experiencing a short squeeze Okay that s pure speculation that GOEV claims the 2nd spot because I haven t paid to unlock the rest of the tickers but GOEV was 1 15 days ago and I assume it s only dropped once by comparing market caps Days to cover is also 10 days meaning volume is so low it will take shorts around 10 days with average volume to close their position Margin requirements are high but shorts are still doubling down This WAS a solid move look at GOEVs chart but shorts are smart and they ll quickly

com terms d deltahedging asp with shares to gain a delta neutral https www investopedia com terms d deltaneutral asp position An option that is OTM won t be hedged as much as an option that s ITM But as the option gets closer to being ITM market makers need to buy shares to continue being delta neutral See where this is going As a stock increases market makers need to buy more shares to hedge the call options they sold causing the price to rise more causing higher strike call options to become ITM causing market makers to buy more shares to hedge the call options they sold causing the price to rise more so on and so forth This is especially volatile for low volume stocks especially where the number of shares needed to hedge exceeds is a significant amount of the daily traded volume GOEVs average daily volume traded is 5 3m although anecdotally I d say the average for the past month or two has been roughly 2 3m with days as low as 1 5m like today Looking at GOEVs low volume along with

to hit 10 And that s only the 5 21 10c look at the other strikes My bet is if this shit hits 10 next week the damn thing is soaring into the 20s maybe the 30s EARNINGS REPORT The one and only catalyst for this play the earnings report happening on 5 17 Last earnings call went to shit and stock price tanked after Tony Tequila opened his big stupid fucking idiot dumb mouth What this means though is

Total float is 105mm institutional ownership is 6 of total shares 238mm so about 15mm shares This theoretically lowers the float to 90mm shares because most institutions will hold long term So realistically we are looking at gt 30 of float is shorted Also keep in mind that the numbers are estimates and this could very well be higher as utilization has also been 100 for a couple weeks now u Strobe light10 https www reddit com u Strobe light10 Number this number that I m to fucking stoopid to be able to tell you what all this number shit means But this website https fintel io shortSqueeze has Canoo ranked 2 of companies that have the highest likelihood of experiencing a short squeeze Okay that s pure speculation that GOEV claims the 2nd spot because I haven t paid to unlock the rest of the tickers but GOEV was 1 15 days ago and I assume it s only dropped once by comparing market caps Days to cover is also 10 days meaning volume is so low it will take shorts around 10 days with average volume to close their position Margin requirements are high but shorts are still doubling down This WAS a solid move look at GOEVs chart but shorts are smart and they ll quickly abandon their positions once they realize Canoo is a legitimate EV company GAMMA SQUEEZE I m sure a lot of you idiots are familiar with this concept but for those who aren t I ll explain what s going on here in a way that you apes can understand without boring you Someone has to write and sell you the FDs that you bought typically market makers Market makers will delta hedge https www investopedia com terms d deltahedging asp with shares to gain a delta neutral https www investopedia com terms d deltaneutral asp position An option that is OTM won t be hedged as much as an option that s ITM But as the option gets closer to being ITM market makers need to buy shares to continue being delta neutral See where this is going As a stock increases market makers need to buy more shares to hedge the call options they sold causing the price to rise more causing higher strike call options to become ITM causing market makers to buy more shares to hedge the call options they sold causing the price to rise more so on and so forth This is especially volatile for low volume stocks especially where the number of shares needed to hedge exceeds is a significant amount of the daily traded volume GOEVs average daily volume traded is 5 3m although anecdotally I d say the average for the past month or two has been roughly 2 3m with days as low as 1 5m like today Looking at GOEVs low volume along with the open interest https www investopedia com terms o openinterest asp OI for the 5 21 OTM call options is where things get insane For those too lazy to read and don t know open interest is the number of options currently open amp x200B 5 21 Strike Open Interest 10 16481 12 5 6787 15 20273 17 5 7515 20 8164 22 5 16273 25 7868 30 4430 35 7175 Numbers were pulled today at 3 00 HOUSTON TIME If you don t know that each option represents 100 shares then you re a literal moron and belong in this shitty sub So those 16k 5 21 10c contracts are equivalent to 1 6m shares When GOEV hits 10 market maker bitches will have to buy 1 6m shares to cover the call options This is also assuming that market makers haven t hedged the 10c which why would they The stock is shorted to shit and no one expects it to hit 10 And that s only the 5 21 10c look at the other strikes My bet is if this shit hits 10 next week the damn thing is soaring into the 20s maybe the 30s EARNINGS REPORT The one and only catalyst for this play the earnings report happening on 5 17 Last earnings call went to shit and stock price tanked after Tony Tequila opened his big stupid fucking idiot dumb mouth What this means though is that they ll want to send some good news our way and save this shitty boat from sinking In all seriousness I m a fat Canoo bull long term after listening to last earnings call but investors panicked and shorts hopped on the red train Tony mentioned releasing good news soon manufacturing details among other things and this could happen during this call CONCLUSION This powder keg is ready to explode and all Canoo has to do is give us some good news on 5 17 to ignite the barrel Quit FOMOing into shit after it s already popped and jump on the boat before it leaves the harbor This is a short term play with a long term hodl potential so calls if you re a ultra giga chad shares if you re just a chad Pros Short interest is through the fucking roof Open interest is higher than shit and has created a nice gamma ramp that we can walk to the moon on Canoo is feeling a lot of pressure from investors to release some good news GOEV is near its ATL literally can t go any further down Cons This earnings call could be negatively received like the last one It ll be hard to decide whether to buy a lambo or yacht first If you want actual long term hodl DD on Canoo the crazy motherfuckers on the Canoo subreddit who are wanting to stalk Tony Aquila s private jet would be more than happy to tell you why GOEV is a solid investment For now all I care about is that this puppy is hitting 30 next week Positions My entire portfolio is May June 10c TL DR GOEV first car on the moon

1444,ncl6bw,t2_3npyyj37,1621032718,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncl6bw/rblx_dd/,1, RBLX DD, Introduction I m proud to say I ve played my fair share of Roblox games Back in the day there were some goodies It s actually insane how far people have pushed the limits of the Roblox engine there s a surprising amount of at least playable games which isn t what you d expect from a kids platform FPS s RPGs a fucking Pokemon game A FUCKING POKEMON GAME That game was a banger and I miss it it got struck down by the iron hammer of Nintendo Rest in peace Pokemon Brick Bronze it had its own region to explore and everything in 3D Anyway the point of giving this background is that I have personal experience with the platform and if nothing else it can produce relatively solid games although I do think the quality has sunken a bit due to the sheer amount of users that have been accumulated these days I wonder If you re want to hold a stake in Roblox I d recommend checking out some of the games and seeing for yourself whether or not you think it has good prospects Now onto the good stuff We ll be looking at its valuation financial statistics the important bits of Roblox s prospectus I will be referring to the updated prospectus http archive fast edgar com 20210513 A82VN62DZZ2RQZZZ2RJN2ZYPWOAKZZ22Z232 for some financial statistics as well the general moves Roblox as a company are making and how its consumer base actual glue addict children are responding to it Not financial advice I was born without a cerebrum and I m addicted to glue sticks Valuation Finding a valuation for a stock that has only recently become a publicly traded company a company operating in relatively uncharted territory for publicly traded companies no less finding a fair valuation will have a whole lot of margin for error Which is why you should take this section with a grain of salt I ll be using its book value to determine a ballpark for valuation The stock as of 5 14 21 has a market price per share is 70 75 Roblox has 515 310 000 shares outstanding According to their 10k In March Roblox had 2 816 079 000 in assets and they had 2 224 485 000 in liabilities The difference is 591 594 000 which can be referred to as shareholder equity If we take this number and divide it by shares outstanding we get approximately 1 15 per share Now we take their market price and divide it by their BVPS which gives us 61 8 which is our price book ratio Yeah that fucker is a little high Other established gaming companies and their P B ratios EA 5 04 TakeTwo 6 0 Activision Blizzard Fuck these guys I d short the shit out of them if I were a hedge fund 4 70 So this means it s at a shitty valuation and going in will fuck you right Well I d also like to note the P B back in Roblox s last reported quarter 1 847 800 000 1 735 354 000 112 446 000 112 446 000 515 310 000 0 22 BVPS We ll use their IPO price 70 to determine last quarter s P B 70 0 22 Around 318 Jesus fucking christ We can t even calculate P E cause the company s still not profitable By this metric Roblox is overvalued as fuck It s 2021 though JPOW will turn your puts into dust no matter how hard you try However this is only one way to look at it and just because this metric doesn t add up doesn t mean there s not potential for great growth Growth Potential First off let s take a look at its earnings revenue amp x200B https preview redd it j4vzvplrp5z61 png width 338 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b15a82d5f4765e6518840dbf999fa021d8ac8465 Very good revenue growth especially with the pandemic forcing glue eating children to play Super Hero Tycoon However the earnings growth is completely negative Let s take a look at why that could be the case Let s take a look at their operating expenses amp x200B https preview redd it wyxje5ssp5z61 png width 809 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 58a28fec8cc1fc77d8a661dc323133a05454281b Their operating expenses far outstrip their gross profit and in their expenses only doubled from 2019 2020 Here are the reasons I think this may be the case from both using the prospectus and personal experience with the platform amp x200B Developer Exchange Program A program in which developers exchange Robux earned from their games to turn into tendies Essentially Roblox relies on these creators to create fun games for the platform and in return they get tendies Simple Looking at the prospectus from March 2020 2021 will be using these date points a lot developer exchange expenses shot up 267 from approximately 44M to 118M If any of you degens have a useless coding degree put that to use to develop Roblox games In my opinion this is an incredibly bullish sign Creators have figured out sustainable or at the very least there s enough of them business models for their games that incentives children to turn their tendies into virtual tendies to pay for gamepasses basically a purchase to buy something in game Thanks EA This means that developers are exchanging their hard earned virtual tendies for IRL tendies and a whole lot of it They will be incentivized to continue to develop on the platform in a positive feedback loop Infrastructure and Trust and Safety I d imagine these are the expenses they incur from paying for their servers and their moderation Basically this is making sure 14 year old teenagers don t run around making Nazi paraphernalia Fun fact one of my friends got one of my accounts banned for doing that Fucking hell These expenses grew around 55 in the same time period March 2020 2021 Good things here too this is making sure their platform doesn t turn into the wild west where people are role playing Nazis and building strip clubs God I wish it did though it d be terrible for your FDs We ll tackle the R amp D General and Administrative and Sales and Marketing expenses in the same section All of these you can probably make a general assumption about what they do for Roblox as a company so I ll list the statistics below R amp D 95 6 growth from March 2020 21 G amp A 208 3 Sales and Marketing 27 Not much special here it just signals that they still have a lot of room to grow as a company I d also like to refer you to this https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments msq9jg understanding roblox gamings role in education qualitative analysis which explains why Roblox has such a unique business model that gives the platform a ton of potential for future growth If you don t want to read this here are some points that I think are important to this analysis in particular amp x200B Roblox as a platform has the potential to encourage heutagogy wherein students learn to be autonomous and learn different life skills through gaming as a medium I can definitely say Roblox improved my typing speed yelling at kids requires decent typing Roblox can encourage younger people with an affinity for coding programming to learn by developing Roblox games This can be a far more engaging way for a young degenerate to learn how to code instead of reading those weird paper wafers STEM in general has been a weak area for American students and Roblox can encourage habits that directly correlate with the field for young people ex STEM fields Architecture and Cloud Computing Developer Exchange Program is an incredibly innovative model with huge amounts of potential upside for Roblox as a company Hell I ve heard rumors of like 60k a month from profitable Roblox games Don t quote me on that Overall Roblox s business model has huge potential upside if they can achieve these targets 1 Sustainability They need to nurture and keep a strong developerbase to continue to create and update games 2 Reach This large influx of users needs to stay interested in the platform to keep playing games and thereby increasing robux sales I m still kind of mad about them removing tix These two points are in my opinion the cornerstone of whether or not Roblox s model works If their developers leave because Roblox failed to cater to them they re not gonna have a platform it goes up in flames These developers also need players to play their game and incentivize them to keep developing for the platform Assorted Financial Statistics We ve already went over their income statements so let s move on to their balance sheet Asset Growth According to Yahoo Finance and their prospectus their net assets grew by over 52 4 From 1 847 800 000 to 2 816 079 000 However I will note their tangible book value and total capitalization are negative Cash Flow Yahoo finance states that their operating cash flow from 2019 2020 raised from 99 185 000 to 524 340 000 This is an increase by 428 6 Now the quarantine has DEFINITELY skewed this figure by a lot but this creates a really good springboard into later years since this influx of players might stick around Even with a conservative estimate of 40 of users joining the platform being sustained past the pandemic that is still a substantial number of kids using their parents tendies for virtual shit Their free cash flow also grew from 14 456 000 to 411 220 000 An increase of 2744 6 They can and already have been use this cash to either reinvest into the growth of the company or keep in the bank should productivity on the platform reach a lull whether due to school or just a lower amount of players entering the platform during a quarter amp x200B Closing Bits and Personal Experiences I went over my personal experiences with the game but I might as well talk about some noteworthy games Some of these are not what you d consider hugely profitable but they were definitely much more on the entertaining end Phantom Forces Battlefield inspired FPS with surprisingly tight gunplay and movement Plus fat blocky hitboxes and kids with their dad s laptop makes you feel like a god Blood and Iron Pretty niche but it s also pretty fun Basically team deathmatch but its in the 18th 19th century and everyone has muskets and speaks French Also you can play marching tunes with flutes Pokemon Brick Bronze Actual Pokemon game with a development team that got shafted by Nintendo It was so good that it got fucking targeted by our good friends in Japan GodDAMN I miss this game Unique gyms with unique layouts 3D albeit a little scuffed pokemon models using the models in the actual games and great and stylistic locations I think there s remakes floating around but they will never beat the original It was also paid access and there were fucking tens of thousands playing it so it s a very good example of just how talented these developers can be This game gets a mention exclusively because I m salty Fuck you Nintendick Arsenal Fun FPS mini game type where you play Gun Game with various guns They can get fucking wacky It s developed by the folks at ROLVe yes they re named after Valve and it s built similarly to a source game Pretty fun for short bursts of time RoBeats Literally a Roblox rhythm type game 4 bars notes flying down the track no strumming where you play songs and use the currency earned to buy new songs and stuff Other than the fact most if not all of the songs are weird remixes it s still good fun You can play with friends too so you can shit talk them for being bad Assorted Anime Games If I had to give a price target a conservative estimate would be around 85 in the summer months Because of summer break I d say they ll at least beat earnings if not downright fuck it because all the children will have more time to buy robux Currently no positions but to be on the safe side I d buy shares Growth is still not guaranteed as above all else they need to succeed in sustaining a playerbase and a developerbase If they succeed in these two points you ll make money If you really want to live dangerously buy calls dated for after Q2 Earnings Their results will be hugely skewed once again due to summer break for the glue eating kids Or that s at least what I think will happen It may not be as heavily skewed as the beginning of the pandemic but I think they will still have very strong numbers Please voice your opinions in the comments and if you have corrections for any of the numbers here I ll try to make sure I update it but it s not guaranteed I will because I m lazy amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B
