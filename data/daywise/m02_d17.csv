shitstorm but his Reddit account is too new to post TLDR and pics at the bottom With all the bad press going on with Robinhood RH I never thought that it could get worse but boy was I wrong First let me preface this by saying that I have used RH every day for the last 4 years I have grown very comfortable with it and the simplicity of it all is very appealing to me Also anyone that still is using RH and isn t planning on transferring brokerages I wish you the best of luck and at the very worst please make sure your account is secure and that you have 2 factor authentication on Over the course of these last 4 years I have been able to finally grow my account to a respectable size by my standards 350K which consisted of a large amount of long term holds along with various short term speculative moves Given all that has gone on with the reputation of RH I wanted to transfer my account out to a different brokerage that was more respected and that offered better security I was working with Charles Schwab to get approved for a lower margin rate than the one advertised and lower options trading fees I got approved by the promotions team for this and began the transfer process out of RH last Wed I felt relieved that I can finally go to a brokerage that I could trust but RH still had one last trick up their sleeve to screw me over Last night I logged into my Schwab account only to see that the transfer out of RH was unsuccessful so I called my rep at Schwab the first thing in the morning today He assured me that this was due to a minor formality because I was bringing over options and at the time the account was being transferred over I was not approved yet for options trading on their platform He said this was going to be a quick fix and I had nothing to worry about The trading day finally opened and shit hit the fan I tried to login to my RH account to see if maybe they had sent me any messages but I was no longer able to get into my account and it said it no longer recognized that user I thought this was very bizarre and immediately email blasted their support team because that joke of a company has no live support number to call Shockingly sarcasm I received no response Next thing you know I am getting notifications on my app of trading activity on my account even though I cannot get into my account via the app or browser My account was not supposed to be able to trade to begin with because it was restricted due to the transfer that was supposed to take place At this point I start receiving notifications on my phone nonstop of all my positions getting liquidated I am furious at this point and try doing whatever I can to get ahold of RH I reached out to them on twitter sent more emails to the support team and even had my rep at Schwab try to contact them on the back end but none of this worked The trading day continued and so did the nightmare Now I am receiving notifications on my phone of thousands of contracts being constantly bought sold on IO ITP and GME all with varying expiration dates My account has been compromised and all my life savings are at risk of being stolen I continue to reach out to RH support with no avail I then went on linkedin and found the director of security at RH so I messaged him I also saw anyone that worked at RH that I happened to have a mutual connection with and reached out to them literally hoping for a prayer at this point and nothing worked I also contacted the FBI filed a report with them and did the same with the local police All of this was happening while I hopelessly get notifications on my phone of my account that I have spent years building crumble in front of my eyes A friend of my mine referred me to a lawyer who helped fix a similar situation with Coinbase and while I was on the phone with her I finally got a call from a number I did not recognize It was someone from the fraud department at RH I was informed that my account has been frozen and is going to be reviewed for fraudulent activity However no reassurance was provided that my account and funds were safe and I was still not given access to my account and received no timeframe on when this will be resolved The fact that RH can continue to screw over everyday retail investors all while prancing around as if they have our best interests in mind is absurd They lack any sort of accountability they have failed to improve their live support systems and they do not see any ramifications for it At some point the government and SEC needs to put a stop to them once and for all before more innocent lives are lost or ruined I have no idea what is going to happen to my money at this point and need people to understand how dangerous using RH really is Nobody should have to be going through what I am going through right now And the fact that RH is trying to go public without fixing any of the major issues they currently have is irresponsible on so many levels and proves they are nothing but crooks that will do anything they can to improve their bottom line at our expense If anyone has dealt with this or has any suggestions on what I should do please let me know I have attached the screenshots I took of all the notifications I was receiving throughout the day for proof and for your reference Imgur album https imgur com 4hq8dgl TLDR Robinhood account was hacked and I watched helplessly all day while some dude liquidated my portfolio and bought strange OTM calls RH support is almost non existent and I have no idea what is going on

These trading activities are regulated and policed by the marketplaces exchanges the self regulatory organizations and the SEC DTCC is involved in post trade processing which occurs after a trade is completed DTCC has no regulatory authority over trading activity or to release information related to trading activity In fact as we told the WSJ reporters we have no power to force the closing of an open fail no matter what the cause and we do not have the authority to force a buy in They also stated that Freedom to trade is a cornerstone of our equity markets and a fundamental principle in the regulatory schemes that govern the markets The SEC has flatly rejected the argument that there are such things as phantom shares or credits being created in the market See https web archive org web

amp lid 3 Boy would I love the freedom to buy a stock I want even if Hedge Funds mess up and nakedly over short a position during a squeeze The SEC also notes that the DTCC has a surprising amount of power to halt trading on a security for operational transfer issues of a stock or fraud called chills or freezes See https www sec gov oiea investor alerts bulletins ib dtcfreezes html https www sec gov oiea investor alerts bulletins ib dtcfreezes html But does this include jacking up capital requirements for overly shorted stocks without any public notice and explanation behind the billion dollar deposit Let s also get this straight back in 2007 they claimed to have no authority in pre trading Only post So what the hell happened this month with En En Es C prevent auto ban and Robinhood then Congress are you listening Why this matters Recently Robinhood s CEO Vlad spoke with Elon Musk on Clubhouse an app where Musk interviews guests It gets interesting when Musk questions Vlad about the decisions of the En En Es C prevent auto ban the DTCC subsidiary to post 3 billion of capital at 3 a m in the morning during the meme stock trading frenzy I ll put down the most relevant parts of the conversation here 8 55 Musk Who controls those organizations those clearing houses 9 02 Vlad Awkward pause Um you know it s a consortium It s not quite a government agency You know I don t really know the details of all that 9 15 Musk OK 9 16 Vlad But you know and to be fair we were we were uh I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets Like these are events with these meme stocks and there was a lot of activity so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it s not entirely unreasonable Now square this with Vlad s earlier comments during the interview 4 02 Vlad The request was around 3 billion dollars Um which is an order of magnitude of what it typically is Right so um 4 17 Musk This seems like this sounds like an unprecedented increase in the demand for capital What formula did they use to calculate that 4 25 Vlad Well um yeah just to give context Robinhood up until that point has raised uh you know a little bit around 2 billion in total venture capital up until now So it s a big number Like 2 billion dollars is a large number right So um basically the and you know and I the details are we don t have the full details it s a little bit of an opaque formula but there s a component called the VAR of it which is Value at Risk and um that s based on some fairly quantitative things although it s not fully transparent but it s not kind of publicly shared So uh there are ways to reverse engineer it but it s not kind of publicly shared And then there s a special component that s discretionary and that kind of acts like a multiplier And um basically 5 24 Musk Discretionary like meaning it is just their opinion 5 29 Vlad Yeah there uh it s a little bit I mean I m sure there s something definitely more than just their opinion The full interview is available on YouTube Search Elon Musk Grills Robinhood CEO Vlad Full Interview on Clubhouse Can t post the link Breakdown Vlad is asked by this consortium to post 3 billion 150 of Robinhood s entire venture capital amount at three in the morning or presumably trading will not be cleared However Vlad doesn t really know the details of this consortium but decides it s a good idea to deposit over a billion dollars in capital anyway Moreover this so called consortium apparently by contract can demand whatever they want to I guess every reasonable CEO posts almost a billion dollars when asked by a group of people he doesn t really know too much about around 700 million to be exact Further this discretionary posting requirement is completely absent in Robinhood s explanation to clients How do clearinghouses determine how much is required It s pretty technical but the process basically works as follows clearinghouses look at a firm s customer holdings as a portfolio They use a volatility multiplier looking at specific stocks to quantify their risk See https blog robinhood com news 2021 1 29 what happened this week https blog robinhood com news 2021 1 29 what happened this week I mean man is it really technical if the capital requirement can also be an opinion that is discretionary That was conveniently left out TLDR The Rub What is Big Money It s 63 fucking trillion dollars The point here is not to peddle some unsupported conspiracy The point is to expose an apparent conflict of interest and demand those in charge of our markets to reestablish public confidence If you re going to take away the People s literal buy button the People better have a right to know why Don t pull a fast one on the working people at 3 a m in the morning Edit Some of you smooth brained folks actually think I m saying this company is valued at 63T READ the post

shitstorm but his Reddit account is too new to post TLDR and pics at the bottom With all the bad press going on with Robinhood RH I never thought that it could get worse but boy was I wrong First let me preface this by saying that I have used RH every day for the last 4 years I have grown very comfortable with it and the simplicity of it all is very appealing to me Also anyone that still is using RH and isn t planning on transferring brokerages I wish you the best of luck and at the very worst please make sure your account is secure and that you have 2 factor authentication on Over the course of these last 4 years I have been able to finally grow my account to a respectable size by my standards 350K which consisted of a large amount of long term holds along with various short term speculative moves Given all that has gone on with the reputation of RH I wanted to transfer my account out to a different brokerage that was more respected and that offered better security I was working with Charles Schwab to get approved for a lower margin rate than the one advertised and lower options trading fees I got approved by the promotions team for this and began the transfer process out of RH last Wed I felt relieved that I can finally go to a brokerage that I could trust but RH still had one last trick up their sleeve to screw me over Last night I logged into my Schwab account only to see that the transfer out of RH was unsuccessful so I called my rep at Schwab the first thing in the morning today He assured me that this was due to a minor formality because I was bringing over options and at the time the account was being transferred over I was not approved yet for options trading on their platform He said this was going to be a quick fix and I had nothing to worry about The trading day finally opened and shit hit the fan I tried to login to my RH account to see if maybe they had sent me any messages but I was no longer able to get into my account and it said it no longer recognized that user I thought this was very bizarre and immediately email blasted their support team because that joke of a company has no live support number to call Shockingly sarcasm I received no response Next thing you know I am getting notifications on my app of trading activity on my account even though I cannot get into my account via the app or browser My account was not supposed to be able to trade to begin with because it was restricted due to the transfer that was supposed to take place At this point I start receiving notifications on my phone nonstop of all my positions getting liquidated I am furious at this point and try doing whatever I can to get ahold of RH I reached out to them on twitter sent more emails to the support team and even had my rep at Schwab try to contact them on the back end but none of this worked The trading day continued and so did the nightmare Now I am receiving notifications on my phone of thousands of contracts being constantly bought sold on IO automod redacted ticker and GME all with varying expiration dates My account has been compromised and all my life savings are at risk of being stolen I continue to reach out to RH support with no avail I then went on linkedin and found the director of security at RH so I messaged him I also saw anyone that worked at RH that I happened to have a mutual connection with and reached out to them literally hoping for a prayer at this point and nothing worked I also contacted the FBI filed a report with them and did the same with the local police All of this was happening while I hopelessly get notifications on my phone of my account that I have spent years building crumble in front of my eyes A friend of my mine referred me to a lawyer who helped fix a similar situation with Coinbase and while I was on the phone with her I finally got a call from a number I did not recognize It was someone from the fraud department at RH I was informed that my account has been frozen and is going to be reviewed for fraudulent activity However no reassurance was provided that my account and funds were safe and I was still not given access to my account and received no timeframe on when this will be resolved The fact that RH can continue to screw over everyday retail investors all while prancing around as if they have our best interests in mind is absurd They lack any sort of accountability they have failed to improve their live support systems and they do not see any ramifications for it At some point the government and SEC needs to put a stop to them once and for all before more innocent lives are lost or ruined I have no idea what is going to happen to my money at this point and need people to understand how dangerous using RH really is Nobody should have to be going through what I am going through right now And the fact that RH is trying to go public without fixing any of the major issues they currently have is irresponsible on so many levels and proves they are nothing but crooks that will do anything they can to improve their bottom line at our expense If anyone has dealt with this or has any suggestions on what I should do please let me know I have attached the screenshots I took of all the notifications I was receiving throughout the day for proof and for your reference Imgur album https imgur com a bTdPg7P TLDR Robinhood account was hacked and I watched helplessly all day while some dude liquidated my portfolio and bought strange OTM calls RH support is almost non existent and I have no idea what is going on

things It is also likely my last post on GME for a while as I find myself repeating key points and others are doing excellent DD on GME in the meantime In this post I ll share as much understanding as I can about how we got here about shorts and my thoughts on the future of GME I ll also try to include many tips around trading investing with GME going forward TL DR The squeeze has been reset Shorts have re set their short positions at much higher sell points and longs have likely cycled through I don t believe a VW style squeeze is possible because Robinhood will just get choked again but I do

short playbook This is essential reading if you want to understand how the funds that are short GME may have manipulated directed the DTCC to strong arm Robinhood to halt buying on the 28th My key takeaway from all this is that the core investigation needs to be happening with the DTCC NSCC to understand why the margin changes were forced upon RobinHood and who specifically asked for the buying halt on the 28th I believe shorts worked together with brokerages and the DTCC to rob investors of over 40B of value representing what is probably one of the greatest financial crimes of the century

facilitate illegal naked shorting There is an integral relationship between the DTCC and hedge funds On regulation SHO However Wall Street has a bag of tricks to get around this requirement One of which is simply to ignore it Another is to roll the position to another broker dealer Oftentimes fails to deliver can last for months or years The SEC seems strangely unwilling or unable to enforce this provision of Regulation SHO How phantom shares on Wall Street threaten U S Companies and investors https www thekomisarscoop com 2020 03 how phantom shares on wall street threaten u s companies and investors March 2020 This article is a bombshell a former DTCC employee whistleblowing fraud in relationships with DTCC and short funds What s happening with GME happened before with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac evidence that more shares were sold than ever existed The main problem is that Reg SHO has no real teeth for enforcement The brokers are never called to be responsible for their behavior Banks play by different rules The SEC continued to declare that fails to deliver were not an indication of naked short selling That changed when Goldman Sachs and other financial firms needed to be protected Trimbath pointed out that not till the banks broker dealers began to see massive numbers of fails to deliver in their own shares did the SEC put a short selling ban in place but only for the shares of banks insurance companies and securities firms including the very culprits responsible for the dirty system Who controls the DTCC The answer is that the banks and brokers who use DTCC s services who process trades there who fail to deliver there are insiders who sit on the DTCC Board of Directors History of shares and shorts on GME Here s some history on GME that s worth knowing so you understand the context of where we are today GME used to have many many more shares outstanding Back in 2009 there were over 160M shares outstanding and GME has steadily been reducing the number of shares outstanding through buybacks and share retirements concluding with a massive share 40 buyback in 2019 pushing GME under 70M outstanding shares amp x200B When you look at a price history chart you need to factor this in So when GME s share price was 50 in 2008 its market cap was actually 8B not 4B like it is today at 50 share https preview redd it ejtu6zwpw2i61 png width 970 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 39251744113f8248a9b8290193d0df5e7436ae2a GME used to be in the S amp P 500 It was added in December 2007 when it had around an 8B market cap and removed in April 2016 when its market cap had dropped to around 3B In 2016 there were about 25M shares shorted of GME It s very likely GME was shorted out of the S amp P Short interest did not decrease after share buybacks In 2019 GME bought back and retired 40 of their shares yet amazingly the short interest increased How is it possible that shorted shares if not naked did not have to find new borrows to cover How could they have found 30M borrows in such a short period amp x200B Processing img axl9ipwqw2i61 How were shorts able to increase their short position by 20M shares in such a short period of time In July 2019 GME bought back and retired 10M shares At the same time shorts increased their short position by 20M shares How is this possible How could they have borrowed 20M more shares while shares are being retired and removed from float amp x200B https preview redd it d9fdeyrrw2i61 png width 1030 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3efeb376b15e8574e98fa90622c79f1eadcd8772 Shorts did not close at 3 because of a tax loophole Shorts had been shorting GME since it was well over 40 share in 2015 By April 2020 GME had dropped to under 3 and shorts were sitting on billions in profit Why not take profits A little known tax loophole allows hedge funds to pay no taxes if a company they shorted goes bankrupt as they do not need to close the trade so the profit is not realized Many of the major short funds are disciples of Steve Cohen who previously paid billions to settle insider trading charges Maplelene capital Melvin others are all Steve Cohen cronies Who bailed out Melvin Steve Cohen There are many strange connections between DTCC s actions and shorts As you know DTCC NSCC put a gun to Robinhood s head demanding billions in liquidity to support their customers buying GME At that point more than 50 of Robinhood s users had GME Robinhood is only worth around 10B The amount being asked for from DTCC was likely to drive Robinhood into the ground had they not found a solution Key question Who suggested the buying halt Was it Vlad Or did the DTCC suggest a buying halt to as a negotiating tactic to reduce the liquidity requirements Sounds very much like a turn off buying or else kind of arrangement Keep in mind that at this point shorts were on the verge of losing upwards of 50B as GME was well on its way over 500 share So Citadel doesn t care about shooting down Robinhood It s a minor toe amputation to save their leg The 4am call from the DTCC happened 2 days after Citadel and Point72 bailed out Melvin and 1 day after the put call ratio for GME flipped 3 1 for puts not only was this coordinated shorts knew this was coming and profited from it If a regulator lawmaker SEC agent could figure out who bought those puts you d know something interesting Why GME went up Many pundits in the media were extremely confused why the price of GME got so high Let me try and explain this First the current price of an equity is just the last traded price This is a very very critical piece you need to understand When there are 70M shares outstanding and 1M shares get traded back and forth multiple times a day the price you see is just the price of the active float trading back and forth This is why many technical traders pay very close attention to volume When there s high trading volume relative to total float it s easier to believe the price is more reflective of actual underlying value In the case of GME supply and demand is the critical driver of price As I mentioned in EndGame Part 1 https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kwb827 gme endgame dtc infinity the true supply of GME shares tradable float is ridiculously low The demand side comes in 4 parts Value buyers people like DFV who saw a company at 4 valued less than 1 year cashflow and decided to tell the world about how great of an opportunity this was Squeeze buyers people and funds that smelled blood in the water and bought shares in anticipation of someone else needing to pay more Shorts covering shorts that needed or wanted to buy as the trade went against them MM hedging repeated gamma squeezes that had an outsized impact on price due to the low underlying liquidity of GME For a normal equity most of that demand side does not exist Low supply high demand high price That s why GME shot up The Big Reset This wasn t just a squeeze this was a massive reset on investors long and short for GME Any SEC filings 13G 13F showing positions prior to Feb 1 are irrelevant other than insider positions It s very likely many longs liquidated during the squeeze and likely many shorts covered Some of those longs that liquidated may re invest and some of the shorts that covered may re short Shorts were given a huge bailout whereas they previously were sitting on losses upwards of 50B they were instead able to close positions at much lower share prices with GME currently sitting at 49 share a 90 reduction from its peak of 500 share prior to the buying halt on the 28th However this is not the end for GME Everything started with value on GME At 50 we re back to a value play GME s market cap is now under 4B Remember that GME has over 1B in e commerce revenue alone every year and e commerce is growing at 300 For more on market cap potential go see EndGame Part 2 https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l0czgs gme endgame part 2 cohen market cap potential or the excellent gmedd com http gmedd com Nothing that happened in the last few weeks has changed the core fundamentals of the business or the prospects for a Cohen led revitalization so if you were in this for Cohen at 20 35 we re not too far off from that right now If people can afford to hold their shares the float continues to shrink Wild cards remain in order of decreasing likelihood Cohen still needs to buy his 7 He s likely waiting for a good signal from the board that he s going to be CEO as well as a good entry point The officers added to the company on the board also need to buy their shares They are not buying in at squeeze entry points Key point When insiders buy shares their shares are removed from the lending pool This is part of the GME corporate bylaws I believe this is likely what triggered squeeze 1 0 as that happened roughly 2 days after Cohen s 9M shares were likely recalled when he got added to the board Regulatory involvement It s really unlikely the SEC is going to step up and enforce their own fucking rules but hey if they did we might see some reductions in fails to deliver and the blatant naked shorting happening with GME Share recalls for a vote There are a number of reasons this could happen I think it s unlikely but if this were to happen non naked shorts would need to cover People moving out of Robinhood to brokers that can stop lending their shares After this shitshow I moved a few thousand shares out of RH I didn t realize they were being lent out to shorts and Robinhood was pocketing the difference You can only get Robinhood to stop lending your shares if you move to a cash account but interestingly Robinhood s instructions for how to downgrade to a cash account have disappeared from their site Try clicking on downgrade under Robinhood Cash here https robinhood com us en support articles robinhood accounts Shady AF How I m thinking about GME now This is going to sound extremely strange but I ve never been more excited to lose money I am holding several thousand shares in GME but my position is only about 25 of my desired position and I can t wait to buy GME at lower prices I hadn t bought any shares since 35 see my part 2 when I said I went all in and sold on the way up to take some profit but I m slowly starting to add again around 50 with the profits I made from trimming on the way up when it got above my price target I shared in part 2 of 125 None of this squeeze drama broker drama etc changes the fundamentals of the company and why I was bullish in the first place I think that the core short thesis of GME is another blockbuster destined for death is dumb and I think Cohen is going to cause a future re rating of the company Since part 2 some interesting developments have happened at GME including the addition of new officers of the company more Chewy execs and one ex Amazon exec as the new Chief Technology Officer I believe strongly that Cohen has a strong chance of becoming CEO I don t think they would have been able to add the talent recently had it not been for him and the creation of a tech officer position is a clear signal that the thinking of how to run the company is changing Think about it if this was just blockbuster with a website why would they need a Chief Technology Officer Big plans are afoot folks 4B for GME is cheap That being said I m hoping for a further dip I m selling puts from 40 down to 10 hoping to score as many cheap shares as I can and to take advantage of the still insanely high IV Suggestions This is going to be a long fight It is painful for all of us regardless of your cost of entry because longs would have won the battle had the market remained free Instead funds clearinghouses brokers colluded to restrict buying and eliminate the demand side of the market Here s some thoughts on managing your GME positions going forward Take advantage of IV while it is high While IV is still high sell puts if you want to add sell calls to reduce your cost basis For example I sold 2 26 9p for like 0 5 that s a 6 return on capital in less than a month and either I own GME at 9 awesome or I keep the premium also good I personally believe we will not be allowed to squeeze unless regulators step in and open up the market here which will not happen quickly if ever So I m selling calls against my remaining shares I also sold some Nov 70p for 42 Let me explain this trade for those of you that don t sell puts normally Selling puts gets a bad wrap of pennies in front of a steamroller but this is not the case with GME if you do it right Someone paid me 4200 now for the requirement that I would be forced to buy 100 shares of GME at 70 in november total of 7000 So I have to set aside 2800 of my own capital to secure this put Two scenarios So in my mind this is a trade that can t go tits up Downside risks Have your own price target Keep a valuation target in mind below which you believe it makes sense to add and above which it makes sense to trim If you are in need of some research here see gmedd com I also wrote my own long term bull targets in EndGame Part 2 https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l0czgs gme endgame part 2 cohen market cap potential Buy low not high folks don t fomo Stop sharing your positions publicly I know this is anti wsb and I think sharing them is great for this community but in the case of GME it s an attack vector for you Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration Remember the multiple trading halts What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn t resume for the rest of the day All your calls would expire worthless Depending on your broker and your cash positions maybe even your ITM ones Roll or sell if you re taking profits your weeklies well before expiration Get the F out of Robinhood While Robinhood was just a pawn IMO why do you want to use a broker that can F you so easily They lend your shares to shorts and don t pay you for it margin call you when you re winning sell your shares at absolute lows and pass all your data to Citadel I don t think the free commissions are really free RH is worse for your financial future Minimize regret don t maximise profitability I sold some shares early on the way up to take out my cost basis and some profit I missed all the peaks never sold any shares above 400 but holding out for maximum profit led to a bit more regret when things went the wrong way Don t bet more than you can afford to lose I ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing you can be surprised by a new trick If you bet it all on weeklies all at once you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out I ve held through multiple 50 drawdowns in the underlying you need to be ready for the volatility Watch out for stop loss hunts It s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares If you ve set a stop loss be really sure about it Don t sell on dips You re only helping the shorts If you need to sell to take profits sell when it s heading up Sell high not low retards Save dry powder to buy on dips Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points GME has incredible daily volatility Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill Have patience when buying This is not financial advice do your own DD I m holding what previously was valued at over 1M in shares and calls And I added 1500 shares these last 2 weeks as well as sold hundreds of puts to either capture six figures of premium or buy 7 figures worth of GME at price points I find attractive Bonus If I was Maxine Waters what would I ask On February 18th Congress will be interviewing Robinhood Melvin Citadel and DFV Here are some questions I d love to see asked with the answers aired out in public under oath Dear Vlad 1 Have they ever had such a dramatic margin increase request from DTCC before 2 How much time have previous requests been given to accomodate vs this one 3 Who suggested the solution of restricting buying Was it Robinhood or suggested by DTCC as a concession in return for a reduced margin requirement What other solutions were explored and why were they not pursued 4 To his knowledge are there any historical professional or other relationships between the decision makers in the DTCC to the funds that are were shorting GME 5 What is preventing this from happening again should GME s price rise again to 500 share or more Dear Kenny G 1 Could you explain the reasons for your bailout of Melvin capital 2 How many members of the DTCC are former Citadel employees 3 Did you or anyone in Citadel communicate with the DTCC prior to their margin changes to robinhood If so what were the nature of these communications 4 What positions did Citadel take against GME prior to the buying halt on the 28th 5 Did Citadel share any of its order flow data with any hedge funds shorting GME 6 Did Citadel have any communications with Robinhood senior management in the weeks leading up to the 28th Dear Plumpkin 1 Please explain how shorts are able to short greater than the outstanding float of an equity 2 Short interest increased by 20M shares in July 2019 Did Melvin increase their short position in that timeframe If so please explain how you were able to borrow shares when 40 of GMEs float was bought back 3 Please explain the method by which hedge funds do not pay taxes when they have a short on a company that has gone bankrupt 4 Are any members of the DTCC former employees of Melvin Capital If not please share what communications between the DTCC and melvin capital the weeks leading up to the 28th 5 Did you have any agreements written or otherwise with other major shorts of GME I e Maplelene Capital 6 There were 6000 short term puts purchased within 30 minutes prior to Citron s tweet announcing their pending argument against gme Did Melvin capital purchase any puts on that day in that time frame 7 What was the arrangement between citron and melvin capital 8 Have you ever paid for media placements against GME 9 Please explain why you could state that you have closed your short positions when your recent filings say otherwise 10 Did Melvin open short positions on X R T when they closed their short gme positions 11 Please explain your process to locate borrows for shorts With whom in the DTCC do you cooperate with 12 Has Melvin Capital ever been forced to buy to close short positions as a result of Regulation SHO fails to deliver

Palantir Emphatically Closes Out 2020 Resilient Growth Expected Ahead Raising Fair Value Estimate to 24 Mark Cash Senior Equity Analyst Analyst Note by Mark Cash Updated Feb 16 2021 Narrow moat Palantir Technologies 40 year over year revenue growth in the fourth quarter came in well above our prior expectations and management s guidance The company is also benefiting from the transition to a software based firm and its efforts to more efficiently deliver and scale its products Palantir is landing larger deals from more customers while expanding the margin profile of its deployments and we believe the small customer base is indicative of a sizable opportunity as Palantir grows its sales force and channel partnerships After increasing our revenue growth profile while still expecting strong operating margin expansion we are raising our fair value estimate to 24 per share from 18 Shares fell over 10 in intraday trading but we still recommend a wider margin of safety before investing In the quarter government sales increased by 85 and commercial revenue grew by 4 year over year While commercial growth was slower than we anticipated we expect Palantir s 2021 focus of expanding its direct sales force and channel partnerships to accelerate this segment Palantir is showing strong momentum with growing sales and margins with its existing customer base diversification among its revenue streams and ability to land new clients Average revenue per customer increased by 41 year over year to 7 9 million Annual revenue from top 20 customers increased by 34 year over year to 663 million while the customer concentration from those top 20 customers declined to 61 from 67 the year before Palantir closed more than 21 deals in the quarter worth at least 5 million with 10 of those worth at least 10 million Adjusted gross and operating margins of 84 81 last quarter and 32 25 previous quarter respectively were ahead of our prior expectations as revenue outpaced expenses Palantir lowered its cloud hosting costs and go to market efficiency gains are decreasing upfront software deployment costs Business Strategy and Outlook by Mark Cash Updated Oct 22 2020 We believe Palantir is well suited to help organizations consolidate and harness the power of data Between a leading position in the government sector with the U S and its allies and the opportunity for Palantir to expand into commercial enterprise applications we think this narrow moat company is poised for robust growth and margin expansion in the years ahead The uncovering of insights and the easy integration of data is a largely untapped market in our view due to legacy data sets saved around the world various data formats the uptick in cloud based resources and the proliferation of the need for real time access via distributed devices Palantir established itself by working with the U S government intelligence and defense sectors to integrate military data into a consolidated dashboard and then drove actionable outcomes by uncovering hidden patterns with artificial intelligence support Its Gotham software platform is used across various government sectors within the U S and among its allies Palantir sells its Foundry software platform to commercial organizations targeting large scale data operations Holistically combining data has typically involved consulting alongside in house customized development efforts for enterprises however Palantir s commercial offering is attempting to change the industry s procurement motion Its software is used in a variety of industries and Palantir s aim is to be the data operating system for companies and industries By stitching together various seemingly disparate components of the airline industry as one example Palantir has made inroads to become a data platform standard for the industry and looks to other industries to achieve similar results The company rotates its engineers into the field to understand customer and industry issues firsthand to make its platforms more valuable while gaining deployment cost efficiencies We believe a robust growth trajectory comes from new commercial ventures on top of a strongly expanding government base and that installation efficiencies and the strategic shift toward a software as a service model will be conducive to margin expansion throughout the 2020s Economic Moat by Mark Cash Updated Oct 22 2020 We assign Palantir a narrow economic moat primarily based on customer switching costs and secondarily strengthened with a network effect and intangible assets Despite Palantir s lack of profitability today we anticipate that it will rely on these moat sources to generate robust operating leverage and excess returns in the long run Already swift data proliferation is only accelerating as organizations further interconnect disparate systems across on premises private clouds public clouds edge locations and personnel and devices We believe the explosion of data and the management of data in a variety of formats present a confounding issue for organizations Institutions are generating an abundance of data on top of legacy data stored but cannot make sense or gain insights from the data Possibly the pieces of data are not stitched together properly to enable a holistic view as organizations typically deploy siloed approaches among divisions or various data formats and security protocols preclude a unified data platform Organizations have historically relied on in house development and consulting support to solve data integration challenges with the overwhelming results being plagued by unsuccessful outcomes exceeded budgets and delays After solving for these root issues organizations are still left with finding insight hidden within their legacy data and a constant influx of new data to gain competitive advantages Palantir sells software solutions aimed at solving the issues of data integration without requiring organizations to start from scratch and provides a centralized view to gain insight from the data through artificial intelligence supporting manual operations The company has two software platforms Gotham is targeted at government sectors including defense and intelligence and Foundry is aimed at commercial organizations Customers can purchase subscriptions to the Palantir Cloud whereby hosting is done by Palantir or on premise alternatives that can be deployed on site in customers clouds in air gapped environments on computing hardware and edge environments Both versions are ratably recognized over the contract term Palantir typically offers five year contract terms but customers can opt for shorter lengths such as a year Both ways of consuming the platforms are sold with operational and maintenance services and the company also sells professional services Gotham s provenance was in assisting U S counterterrorism operations with finding data insight in Afghanistan and Iraq mapping insurgent networks and roadside bombmakers manually and alleviating the data organizational issues and the attendant danger for soldiers Over time the company expanded into the commercial segment while the stakes may be different the challenges of integrating new and legacy data sets together and gleaning insight from copious amounts of data are ubiquitous Foundry was developed to make the integration of data sets routine in addition to gaining insight through artificial intelligence The platforms are sold across its customer segments as well with financial institutions using Gotham for fraud investigation and government divisions using Foundry While we expect U S government customers to remain a cornerstone of Palantir s business the company has diversified itself with 53 of revenue being commercial based and 60 of revenue derived from outside the U S at the end of 2019 We believe that Palantir s software platforms have become mission critical for governments and enterprises and cultivate high customer switching costs The company targets large scale data operations seen within global enterprises and governments and further focuses on complex situations that have high installation costs and elevated stakes upon failure These installations are associated with prolonged sales cycles that can fortify the cost of changing vendors from the onset with Palantir typically having a 6 9 month cycle but could be greater than a year Our view is that particular enterprise grade software can drive switching costs through the time and costs to deploy and adopt the solutions the software acumen that could be lost from changing platforms and the high risks associated with business disruption or lost data Implementation and integration of software and associated data can drive large barriers to changing from software that is providing a crucial function for business operations As particular software platforms become more widely spread within organizations the higher the cost of changing vendors in our view Palantir s sales motion is predicated on acquiring expanding and scaling accounts The acquire phase typically provides customers with short term pilot deployments of Palantir s software at little to no cost for the customer Palantir ramps up its investment in the expand stage to understand the particular issues faced by the customer and its industry This strategy is aimed at ensuring the software provides appreciable value and that the customer becomes self sufficient with the software which we believe helps lock the customer into the ecosystem Scaling is when revenue outpaces incremental investments margins improve and Palantir s platform starts to proliferate within organizations Palantir has historically operated at a loss which we expect to continue on a GAAP basis until later in the 2020 decade as the company ramps up sales marketing and infrastructure investments to seize its market opportunity Nonetheless we believe that profound improvements in margins because of decreasing the time and number of engineers required to install deploy and manage the software platforms alongside scaling its customer cohort will lead to sustainable excess returns over invested capital in the long run Data has become the lifeblood of enterprises and governments and changing from Palantir s platform presents an extraordinary hurdle in our view Per Palantir the U S Army uses its platform to ensure more than 1 million military personnel are ready as well as drive decisions across dozens of command centers While that particular installation may be Palantir s largest its solutions are used across 36 industries as of June 2020 and we believe each commercial or government customer faces tremendous disruptions if changing from Palantir s platforms Data integration efforts can be monumental and end in failure according to The Standish Group per Palantir s S 1 12 of large and 5 of organization wide platform digital transformation projects were deemed successful Palantir further states a sole U S military agency spent over 1 billion building an enterprise resourcing planning system from scratch but the project was never delivered and unsuccessfully concluded Unlike many solutions offered in the marketplace for data integration and analytics Palantir does not sell unique custom applications or specialized tools for commercial customers The company sells its software platforms with the intention of becoming the data operating system within organizations and industries by being standardized Another snippet from Palantir s S 1 is that after surveying more than 1 000 organizations about 50 000 custom software projects The Standish Group uncovered that 23 of projects started from scratch were completed on time and within budget and 56 of all projects had cost overruns or missed their deadlines In our view Palantir is a beneficiary of high customer switching costs Palantir does not require organizations to completely overhaul their existing technology and infrastructure investments Its software platforms integrate with customers historical systems and new data sources and methodologies can be added to the data operating system We think this integration will make it especially difficult for customers to quickly switch to alternate vendors and believe that this gives Palantir flexibility to address many use cases while simultaneously becoming critical to operations Features added to Foundry intended to maximize the production of crude oil for the oil and gas industry became adopted by medical equipment manufacturers to allocate protective equipment Novel capabilities to handle time series data from oil and gas wells around the globe have been adopted by Formula One race teams automotive line quality control improvement efforts and increasing usage of airline fleets Palantir s platforms enable the use of proprietarily built solutions open source or domain specific models as well with organizations using artificial intelligence and machine learning to conquer healthcare challenges its customers are running university developed models alongside internally developed solutions to map a response to the coronavirus pandemic We also believe Palantir benefits from network effects albeit as a secondary moat source Palantir s platforms are also intended to be collaborative across entire organizations developers and data scientists can write custom applications on top of its platforms in their chosen coding language while nontechnical individuals can use the platforms and make actionable decisions By transforming data into common vernacular and views that are easily comprehensible we believe a network effect exists within organizations as well Each additional user brings a unique viewpoint and the platforms can spread across an institution With data constantly being ingested and analyzed Palantir s platforms can uncover new insight and notify appropriate individuals that may have not been privy to the new information making the platforms more powerful as more users participate Going further Palantir has been able to establish its platforms as the data operating system within government operations and the airline industry with partnership plans intended for the healthcare and financial services industries as well A few of the numerous U S government agencies that use Palantir include the U S Department of Defense Army Navy and Air Force Department of Veterans Affairs Department of Health and Human Services and the Securities and Exchange Commission Commercially through its Skywise partnership with Airbus Palantir s Foundry connects more than 100 airlines 15 suppliers and 9 000 aircraft globally by integrating flight engineering and operations data In summary with each new data source or organization joining Palantir s platform we believe its solutions become more powerful and valuable for other customers solidifying a network effect Further we believe that Palantir has valuable intangible assets associated with specific customer and industry acumen In an approach to alleviate the issues with these complex projects that can rely on a patchwork of solutions Palantir rotates its software engineers between field and development efforts to gain insight about customer and industry specific challenges that can strengthen its platforms capabilities We believe that this unique customer and industry acumen creates intangible assets for Palantir s platforms while also fortifying a network effect As more organizations adopt Palantir s platforms the company gains additional unique industry specific capabilities to meet customer demands which then creates more industrywide demand for its software Palantir also benefits by lowering the integration complexity with each additional install within specific sectors in our view By selling commercial software products instead of using a contract model the company bucked the historical trend of customers requiring high customization and those clients owning the associated intellectual property As of December 2019 Palantir had 475 U S patents and over 500 patents outside the U S as well as 800 patents pending in total Its software was also built with stringent security auditing and compliance capabilities while still enabling functionality and collaboration Data protection and collaboration are typically at loggerheads but Palantir s roots working on classified operations within the government intelligence community required robust data security requirements We believe this security differentiation is attractive to potential commercial customers as well meeting prerequisite requirements for government agencies Each piece of data is tracked and breadcrumbs are recorded a centralized access control works with existing identity security providers or acts as the primary security solution for authorization that can restrict certain data to various departments and an audit trail is recorded The company enables strict compliance conditions for various regulations for government healthcare and individual data privacy requirements Palantir sizes its total addressable market at 119 billion 56 billion as commercial 26 billion as U S government and 37 billion as international government To arrive at its estimate the company used third party industry publications projected software spending in areas such as data management software integration and orchestration middleware analytics and artificial intelligence security system and service management application development and applications for enterprise resource management supply chain and content and workflows Palantir included subsegments that are applicable to its platforms within those categories commercial firms with at least 500 million in annual revenue 6 000 companies estimated government spending based on software and consulting spending and the company excluded potential spending based out of China and Russia Third party market sizing and share estimation attempts have varied significantly for Palantir based on considering the company s capabilities from analytics to artificial intelligence While we believe its market sizing is inflated Palantir s approach is reasonable and we appreciate the challenge of attempting to peg Palantir into certain verticals due to the flexibility of its product offerings and nascency of institutions unifying and harnessing the power of their data from a commercial offering Fair Value and Profit Drivers by Mark Cash Updated Feb 16 2021 Our Palantir fair value estimate is 24 per share which is consistent with a 2021 enterprise value sales multiple of 32 times and free cash flow yield of 1 We also foresee Palantir rapidly growing sales and gaining operating leverage in the years ahead We forecast a 35 five year revenue CAGR driven by Palantir expanding its government and commercial operations By segment we model the commercial sector growing quicker in the near term with a 37 five year revenue CAGR while the government segment has a 34 five year revenue CAGR Looking further out we expect the revenue contribution from the commercial segment to surpass the government sector late in the 2020 29 decade In the government sector we believe Palantir s successful lawsuit regarding U S government agencies considering commercially available options before custom alternatives should propel robust growth and having incumbency should help the company become the data operating system standard across agencies For the commercial segment we expect strong growth as more companies and industries strive to understand actionable insights from their data stores and new data generated We believe the company has opportunities as it has done within aviation to become the de facto data operating system that various clients feed data streams into within the commercial sector Channel partnerships will be key to long term growth in our view Led by requiring fewer resources to deploy its platforms higher margin commercial contracts expansion of government deals and economies of scale for hosting its software we model gross margins expanding into the low 80 range through the 2020s versus 68 in 2020 After winning accounts we believe the company can proliferate its software through organizations as firms look to extract insights by further stitching disparate data sources together With higher gross margin and less incremental investments required for sales and developments per customer we expect operating margin expansion per customer over time We model the GAAP operating margin expanding to the mid to high teens range in 2025 up from negative 107 in 2020 and adjusted operating margin expanding into the mid to high 30 range by 2025 compared with 17 in 2020 Risk and Uncertainty by Mark Cash Updated Oct 22 2020 We assign Palantir with a high fair value uncertainty rating Although we believe that Palantir should have strong revenue growth and margin expansion over the 2020s we believe there are a few notable risks that can impede its trajectory and our outlook The integration of disparate data sources and uncovering actionable insight with the assistance of artificial intelligence is challenging and may not be a widespread problem that customers require solving While Palantir may be able to execute on this task a big enough market may not exist and push the company into a niche Palantir has historically had very high customer concentration with its top 20 customers representing 67 of revenue in 2019 As of its IPO filing Palantir had a small customer base of 125 institutions so losing any key government or commercial customers who have flexibility not to expand contracts with Palantir could be overly damaging Palantir has also stated its intention to not enter contracts with organizations that Palantir considers inconsistent with its mission to support Western liberal democracy and its strategic allies including the Chinese market This limits overall market size could increase cyberattacks and working with military operations could cause potential investors to avoid the name A differentiated selling point is the commercial aspect of its software platforms however customers may choose to keep their historical method of employing consultants and system integrators to assist inhouse developments for data projects Alternatively large established firms may attempt to copy its commercial approach and limit any premium Palantir can demand Without strong revenue growth and an improving operating profile Palantir may not achieve profitability The company went through many rounds of funding before announcing its direct listing IPO and investors may not be willing to support a long term arduous journey to profitability and possible shareholder returns Capital Allocation by Mark Cash Updated Feb 16 2021 We assign Palantir with an Exemplary capital allocation rating The rating reflects our assessments of a sound balance sheet exceptional investment efficacy and appropriate shareholder distribution policies Palantir ended 2020 with 2 0 billion in cash and investments and only 197 million in debt and we expect the ability to generate free cash flow to greatly improve over the 2020s We do not expect any shareholder returns through common dividends Share repurchases may occur as the company s presence in the public market matures but we believe investments in development and sales would be the best use of capital during the rapid growth stage and capture a broader customer base In our view Palantir is properly using its capital for the large opportunity in helping customers extract insights with their data with notable investments in developing SaaS platforms and use case modules as a simpler way to drive customer adoption CEO and board member Alexander Karp co founded the company with Stephen Cohen company president secretary and board member and Peter Thiel the chairman of the board since 2003 Palantir has three share classes Class A has one vote per share and Class B has 10 votes per share and is convertible to one share of Class A Class F has a variable number of votes and provides the founders the ability to control nearly 50 of total voting power In terms of electing board members as long as 20 million shares of convertible stock remain outstanding from Palantir s Series C D and E rounds the holders of these shares voting as a single entity can elect one board member out of the six at the time of S 1 Holders of Class A and Class B shares voting as a single entity elect two board members The combined holders of outstanding convertible preferred stock and common stock elect the remaining board members With this structure we believe that Class A investors have to be comfortable with trusting the founders strategic imperatives and use of capital Investors must be comfortable with Palantir s beliefs and ideals The firm will forgo opportunities if the company feels the potential deal does not match its culture however lucrative and while knowing that these contracts will go to competitors With the voting power concentration we believe investors must be comfortable with Palantir not taking part in deals that are not aligned with its vision to support Western liberal democracy and its strategic allies In our view Palantir is making the best long term strategic decision for its business and not wavering from that stance could be fruitful in winning future government deals with the U S and its allies We also believe the expansion into commercial markets and previous investments to improve installation costs are moves in the correct direction for the entire business The company has been criticized in the U S for how its software may be used to infringe upon civil liberties and data privacy concerns Palantir believes it has purposely developed its software to safeguard such concerns while also employing a privacy and civil liberties team to aid in using its technology responsibly We believe some potential investors may be wary of challenging accusations regarding what Palantir s software enables government customers to do with data with the potential to infringe upon civil liberties Importantly Palantir does not mine purchase or monetize data and the data is owned by its customers Close Full Analysis TL DR Somewhat overvalued at the moment However the company seems to be well positioned and has good growth prospects If this company hits it s stride FAT tendies Not Financial Advise Dumb Ass

Conglomerate not Oshkosh B gosh I have also put TLDR s in the beginning because I know you are all lazy cunts TLDR Full Series Oshkosh is a boomer company with the Pilot Rocket and Jet Fuel to take off to infinity and beyond It has the resources allowing it to dominate in its current market and propel it to the hottest market of them all EV It has a small downside but its upside is so massive that the green dildo will tear my ass apart TLDR Part 2 Oshkosh s current operative sectors are currently printing cash for the business It has a strong debt to asset ratio with a TTM Free cashflow of 328M This gives them a lot of room for R amp D in the commercial electric vehicle space without diluting shares or taking on massive debt In other words they have fuck you money to go against competitors looking to get into the commercial EV space A large portion of their current revenue comes from municipalities and government entities so they have mastered the art of lobbing and government contracts USPS Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor of any sort This is my opinion and it should not be taken as the word of God Full disclosure I am also fucking retarded and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself Oshkosh s Rocket Ship will take us beyond the Universe In my last post Part 1 https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments liixp0 osk oshkosh to infinity and beyond part 1 I discussed the management of the business and why they have the track record to continually grow the company It was fairly short as the numbers essentially spoke for themselves This post will be focused on the business of Oshkosh in terms of its products and financial strength To reiterate Oshkosh is a manufacturing conglomerate in the sectors of access equipment defense fire amp emergency and commercial The 2021 Q1 revenue for each sector is 563 7M 550 3M 273 9M and 195 7M respectively I have attached a diagram https imgur com a iajdpei to show the breakdown of the sectors As shown on the diagram the largest money makers for Oshkosh are Access equipment and Defense comprising 35 6 and 34 7 of the revenue respectively Fire amp emergency consists of 17 3 and the commercial sector consists of 12 4 Look at the diagram it s easier to comprehend The business diversification shows that Oshkosh has a healthy revenue across different sectors meaning that it does not have all its eggs in one basket This was evident with Covid hitting Although the revenue of Oshkosh was affected negatively it was balanced out in different sectors For example the 2021 Q1 revenue for the Access equipment sector decreased by 21 5 and the Commercial sector fell by 12 7 compared to 2020 However the total change in revenue only decreased by approximately 7 because the Defense and Fire amp Emergency business grew This shows that there is a small downside risk to Oshkosh The source is taken from Q1 presentations https s24 q4cdn com 975203404 files doc financials 2021 q1 Q1 2021 Earnings Slides FINAL pdf from Oshkosh Q4 2020 numbers will show a bigger dip in revenue but you get the point The business isn t reliant on one type of business and the management team was able to adapt quickly and bounce back TDLR Paragraph Certain manufacturing sectors were affected by Covid but Oshkosh was able to withstand the hit due to different businesses This means that it is hard to wipe this business out Skip this if you don t care about each business sector Oshkosh s Access Equipment business is under JLG and a variety of brands and it essential manufactures different types of lifts for the construction market What is exciting about this business is that they have an all electric scissor lift that was recently just released This shows that Oshkosh is innovating and looking to transition from offering only diesel products to electric products Moreover it shows that they are capable of it The Defense sector brings in a lot of money for Oshkosh and it does not seem to be slowing down They received an order for 911 million in 2021 Q1 alone Moreover they have a large backlog that will continue to pump cash into the business There were arguments from my last post that Oshkosh has trouble fulfilling some orders This was due to staffing challenges related to Covid However according to them they were able to ramp up production successfully even with the setbacks If they weren t doing a decent job fulfilling orders they would not get large orders like this Read Oshkosh is constantly getting orders for the military sector The military sector is related to government bids and contracts This shows that Oshkosh has the experience and capability to win contracts with the government Lobbying plays a big part and this shows they are dammed good at it USPS contract Oshkosh s Fire amp Emergency essentially creates fire trucks for municipalities They achieved new record orders in FY2020 Additionally they just released a new vehicle They claim that backlog remains near record level meaning that they have a bunch of demand for the product that needs to be filled Usually that means it is a great business with a great product Again winning over government contracts is apart of their business model This is their bread and butter If there is any doubt that they can even get a piece of the USPS contract this should crush that The Commercial sector consists of a bunch of different brands under Oshkosh The commercial sector for Oshkosh has taken a hit due to Covid However they still have a backlog of 361 million They offer a lot of great products that are required by commercial businesses and government entities Now that we are done going through each business that Oshkosh is in we are going to dive into some financials and they look good I retrieved these numbers on yahoo finance Look them up if you don t believe it Disclaimer these are approximate The Debt to Asset ratio for Oshkosh is 14 For people who are retarded and autistic like myself and don t know if that s good Workhorse has a debt to asset ratio of 102 No larger percentages don t mean it is better Workhorse is leveraged up the ass and if they don t bring in some revenue they are fucked so hard it is not even going to be funny Their high leverage gives them little room for error They aren t able to make many mistakes without sinking the ship Compared to Workhorse Oshkosh s low debt to asset ratio allows them to invest in current business growth new business ventures and new products eg EV without the fear of sinking the ship They have already been doing this by investing in Microvast and setting up a joint venture I will get more into this in the next part For the people who are going to say debt is going to R amp D and growth fuck you Workhorse s revenue is for 2020 is 570 thousand My wife s allowance from her boyfriend is more than that Workhorse s cost of revenue is 5 845 000 while Oshkosh s is 6 031 600 000 Based on just this number it doesn t look too bad but it is horrendous Basically Workhorse is investing 15 to bring 1 in revenue that is a 93 3 ROI Oshkosh s revenue is 7 268 300 000 and that gives us an ROI of 20 This is purely revenue returns of course With the current business sectors support Oshkosh has a TTM Free Cashflow of 328M This gives them room to either pay down their debts which isn t high More importantly this gives them room to grow into the EV space where they can continue to create products for their Commercial and Municipal customers They can create the products infrastructure and sales teams without worrying about running out of cash Just for a comparison Workhorse has a TTM Free Cashflow of 38 977M Oshkosh is a very old business that has great products with great numbers One of the downsides that I can think of for this business is that they somehow lose all their current business This is very unlikely because they were able to maintain strong numbers even with Covid This was due to the management and the employees being able to adapt quickly during hard times which is the reason Part 1 https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments liixp0 osk oshkosh to infinity and beyond part 1 was only about management competence They are constantly releasing new products that are in high demand with large backorders I know what you re thinking Having great historical numbers isn t going to guarantee growth in the future It s about innovation and the new type of business However the company is thinking about the future and that is why they are looking to use their excess cash to develop commercial products in the EV space What makes this an exciting play is the company is great at procuring government contracts This is an art form that they have an advantage over new players in the EV space You cannot disregard the importance of Lobby in winning contracts like the USPS I will talk more about why Oshkosh is primed for growth based on the EV hype that other companies are receiving in Part 3 The main goal of Part 2 of this DD is to illustrate why the downside for this company is extremely low compared to a play like Workhorse Workhorse will essentially need to dilute its shares for more cash which decreases the value of the shares you bought The reason is that it can t leverage any more debt because it already has more debt than assets Stay Tuned

some time now Bit unstable for the short term as Palantir still needs to endure the Lockup which will land some finishing blows against the price But afterwards once PLTR can establish a strong support eyeing 30 and stabilizes it looks ready to go The MM snuffed whatever we had of our initial Reversals They got what they wanted They brought us to a price they think we re worth Yet we re still vastly above the PT s from the autistic Analysts and even our limbo at sub 27 which should be very indicative of how strong the Longs are for this stock They ll still exist ofc The resentment from how Palantir opened will probably never fully waver especially when we start to really recover our gains But after the last Catalyst Lockup we should start finally moving like a real stock which is honestly great And to affirm this positive you got to look at our opposers When you dissect them carefully you start to see that the opposition is greatly crippled abandoned and indifferent Anyone who was in it for the blitz is gone they cashed out The late to the party WSB residue the bag holders are all gone if not from the initial plunge then the one following ER The majority of the myopic Bears Shorters who were cashing in from the manipulated plunges have been dropping off as all they got left to ride on for them to not get the debt rocket up the ass is the Lockup The former plunge we had ended recently After that Yeah let those who remain explain why PLTR is a 17 stock lmao Because the MM killed off all the long standing hype and volatility this should mean less action on their ends as we start to stabilize Palantir overtime have been wonderfully justifying why their technology is the future and that their valuation is misleading when you look at the moves they ve been making since Remember the reason why we were held down beforehand was because we were overvalued and the hate was entrenched when they looked at the rate our price skyrocketed which they thought was anything but realistic Why do you think we were in limbo for literally 2 months before the consolidation broke and we got pumped to the 40 s where preceding it we literally tripled in such little time Palantir has been left to die by the MM on many occasions We ve managed to endure the onslaught and as said they should ease up when we become normal Meaning that every minor Catalyst every miniscule Win we get should really stick from then on They should matter have oomph value In their prime phase of Palantir price fuckery look at how our s were traded when they signed a contract for example big Catalysts Wins in every regard With no euphemisms how the pricing adjusted was literal bullshit to the max How PLTR s pricing adjusted over a few days from each news report was not natural at all from just regular traders It was fucking rigged un human but certainly algorithmic controlled Most of these supposed boons had zero effect Whilst the few that had some significance like the IBM deal helped and in that context it assisted the reversal from 30 50 it turns out that it wasn t worth anything as PLTR reversed the reversal just days after it was discovered This warped control over everything was beyond rampant How about the times we hit a certain and despite the momentum had in the day suddenly it all just disappears The positive volume disappears and it just gradually plummets Not a blitz down because it was a major sell off Gradual For example look at the day after when we hit our ATH It had a super Bull run from 39 Everyone wanted to be back in promise land Just look at what it did right after we touched 42 No words really That Is what we re going to get away from And if you ask me that is the biggest positive that this stock can possibly have To me this exceeds what just about any all possible impetuses can do for it Overall the faster we can disassociate from the algorithmic manipulated drops WSB pumps the better And if we managed to shed the GME Meme Stonk label with such haste then we should be plush Palantirians Palantards enjoy the ride amp x200B P S I initially had 2 30 OTM Calls I bought on 1 15 lasting to 2 19 sold last Friday It was trading at 26 50 and that was when Cathie got 500k shares It countered the only negative to me about getting in bad Analyst consensus I ve yet to re establish a position I m waiting for the right time The Lockup is near guaranteed to deal a massive blow to the price and obviously I want to get in as cheap as possible So I m eyeing that for sure as a possible entry point best discount I see But overall I m mostly

Sprott Asset Management arranged for creation and listing of the trust It is also the Manager and oversees day to day administration of the Trust Sponsor Aberdeen Standard Investments arranged for creation and listing of the trust assumes marketing and administrative expenses Sponsor chooses the Trustee Trustee Bank of NY Mellon manages day to day administration including processing orders coordinating with custodian calculating NAV and selling trust silver to pay for expenses Trustee RBC Dexia holds title to Trust s assets and co manages with the Sponsor Manager Also it acts as Custodian for non silver bullion assets Trustee Bank of NY Mellon manages day to day administration including processing orders coordinating with custodian calculating NAV and selling trust silver to pay for expenses Custodian JPMorgan is responsible for holding the trust s physical silver in its vaults allocated silver can be held in London NY and other locations that may be authorized in the future Custodian Royal Canadian Mint is responsible for holding the trust s physical silver This is close ended fund no creation redemption of shares and silver is 100 allocated and stored ONLY at the Mint Custodian JPMorgan is responsible for holding the trust s physical silver in its vaults allocated silver is held ONLY in London unallocated can be elsewhere Inspections Custodian is responsible for conducting only limited inspections by Authorized Participants Authorized Participant registered broker dealers that enter into a contract with the Sponsor and Trustee and can only redeem in 50k blocks Inspections The physical silver bullion is subject to a physical count by a representative of the Manager periodically on a spot inspection basis as well as subject to audit procedures by the Trust s external auditors on at least an annual basis Inspections Custodian allows the Sponsor and the Trustee and their auditors access to its premises during normal business hours to examine the Trust s silver held there and such records as they may reasonably require to perform their respective duties to Shareholders Liability Custodian is responsible ONLY to the Trustee Because the holders of iShares are not parties to the custodian agreement their claims against the custodian may be limited Liability Custodian is responsible for and bears ALL risk of the loss of and damage to the Trust s physical silver bullion Liability Custodian is responsible for any loss or damage suffered by the Trust as a direct result of any negligence fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties TLDR Looking at these three side by side PSLV is the safest bet close ended backed by Mint of Canada and SLV seems to stand out like a sore open ended limited right of inspection unlimited storage locations backed by JPMorgan In SLV the inspection and liability are both severely limited while allocated storage location is unlimited Basically there is absolutely zero oversight for non Authorized Participant shareholders holding lt 50k blocks Further this is the only ETF that has this weird clause whereby Custodian is only responsible to the Trustee even SIVR with the SAME Trustee AND Custodian has more reasonable language for loss suffered I keep hearing this conspiracy theory that SLV is printed paper being false merely because JPMorgan is too big to fail and too scrutinized You mean that they can t possibly spoof trades https www cnbc com 2020 09 29 jp morgan settles spoofing lawsuit alleging fraud in metals trades html right But if they can do that with a wrist slap what s stopping them from also spoofing paper when they can just say the bullion they re keeping is on Mars and temporarily out of reach So how could they get caught short of a whistleblower And if that happens how would this work out in practice if SLV busts leading to a SLV ETF run on the bank scenario or liquidation Would this structure actually insulate the Custodian from a law suit fiduciary duty to shareholders Is Trustee the only party that can recover and shareholders thereby recover from Trustee but they would have to prove another layer of negligence Maybe an SEC lawyer or intern can answer this But I can t be the only person thinking this doesn t look right

000 000 reasons I m Bullish,TL DR No major company has ever had a lockup expiry structured like PLTR so who the fuck knows what will happen tomorrow If you don t like full blown casinos you may want to consider closing out your PLTR positions Table of contents Why I write DDs Why insiders sell HODL or dump it all Why this lockup is unprecedented 3 takeaways from 2020 Earnings Call 100 000 000 reasons I like the stock 1 Why I write DDs I took some heat hate on my last DD so I want to dive a bit deeper on my motivations for writing DDs for y all I write DDs for three reasons in order of importance I like the Redditor From r sexover30 to r Salesforce from r Formula1 to r fatFIRE from r diamonds to doggies r tippytaps Redditors make my life better with good advice great humor and uplifting stories wins Furthermore an AMA I did back in 2018 https www reddit com r IAmA comments 8pb8d5 i grow diamonds i make custom jewelry with these made the front page of Reddit and it was one of the best things to ever happened to my business So I like the Redditor and I want to give back to my fellow Redditors where I can with information that may help you understand Palantir better such as correcting wrong information about the lockup expiry and hopefully make you laugh a couple of times I own the PLTR As such I want PLTR to be a stonk that goes up Duh While I ve responsibly diversified some of my PLTR tendies over the years most of my net worth is still in shares of PLTR So of course I have self interest in other investors liking buying the stock and my DDs are clearly obviously ridiculously biased and bullish on PLTR I have read the SEC guidance on disclosures and that s why I clearly disclose my positions in my DDs to make sure you know I am not a financial advisor and that I am a former employee of PLTR and long shares of the stock But I m not shilling PLTR to try to create bagholders Like u deepfuckingvalue believed believes in the deep fucking value of GME I believe in the deep fucking value of what Papa Karp and his merry band of Hobbits are building BTW YOLOing your money on a stock with insanely high IV based on the meme filled shitposting of a kool aid drinking ex employee is about the fuckingist stupid thing you can do Seriously do your own DD if you re considering investing in PLTR I enjoy posting on the internet It sparks joy for me From automotive forums to Reddit I choose to spend some of my free time learning from helping out and laughing with strangers on the internet I like calling out De Beers for strip mining the ocean I like to check in on the Ariel Atom forum and the v8 swapped RX7 forum once in a blue moon even though I no longer own said cars I like to like photos of your doggie being a gooood boy So me writing weighty tomes on WSB is just an extension of a hobby of mine not a tin foil hat insider pump and dump I m also on vacation this week after my busiest season Christmas gt NYE gt Valentines Day so it s a coincidence that I finally carved out the free time to write a lot of words after a big week for all jewelers not a conspiracy 2 Why do insiders sell Before I get into the specifics of the PLTR lockup expiry I want to talk through the high level motivations for unlocked insiders Of course most insiders sell at least some of their position at lockup expiry They want to responsibly diversify out of a concentrated stock position They want to buy a house car watch jewelry week at the Brando They want to get married pay for IVF put their children in private school give their parents a big thank you gift Their stock options expire soon They want to have a weekend of chemical stimulation and friendly companionship in Las Vegas They need to pay their colorologist to help them choose the specs of their first lambo so that they don t get mocked at their first Silicon Valley Cars and Coffee Most importantly they the VCs need to pay out tendies to their LPs I m not an expert in VC exits but my understanding is that various VCs handle this in a variety of ways Some will just sell out and give cash to their LPs but others will give pro rata shares in the investment to their LPs Obviously the former puts more downward pressure on the stock price Anyone from the VC world have thoughts on how VCs with PLTR stock might play the lockout 3 Why do insiders not sell They have a deep understanding of the value of company and they like the stock enough to think it will outperform the market something something rocketship something something fueling up something something Pluto They can get LTCG tax rates if they hold the shares for a few more months if they exercised their options in the run up to IPO They can wheel the stock while the IV is high if an ex insider of course They have looked at the lockup dips of other stocks they consider comparable to their stock and like their stock enough to irresponsibly HODL They want a yacht and are willing to settle for a used 911 GT3 RS instead of the bespoke lambo so they let it ride They have FOMO that their stock will take off after they sell out and they ll be the cuck with a nice house and a lambo but still have to fly commercial with the poors They can finally borrow against their stock at a really really ridiculously low interest rate and use that for liquidity 4 Why do insiders dump it all They think the public market euphoria for their baby is unwarranted They are bearish on the skills of the executives at the company They don t like casinos and just want a boomer stock bond blend with a bunch of dividends They want to bootstrap their own startup rather than be a cuck to early stage VCs They hit their r fatFIRE number and simply want the peace of mind that comes with fuck you money fully diversified instead of a concentrated stock position that creates stress and requires critical thinking They want to buy their kid a pet giraffe But most importantly the VCs that invested in the stock may be overdue to send returns to their LPs so they exit their home run even if they think it could grow into a grand slam 5 Palantir s Unlock is Unprecedented Let s review what we all know 1 Stonks go up 2 Except when lockups expire Stonks go down when that happens 3 Buy the dip 4 Fuck Robinhood 5 Fuck shortsellers that crush companies and destroy jobs Now let s dig in on truism 2 Prettymuch all IPOs in the history of ever completely lock out any insiders from selling any of their shares for 180 days So good bad or ugly no one can sell anything from the S 1 filing to the lockup expiration Prettymuch all IPOs in the history of ever are about raising cash for the business and printing money for their bankers not liquidity for employees or tendies for retail traders Palantir didn t need the cash they have well over a billion dollars in the bank so they told Wall Street to fuck off and DPOed instead Palantir did something really smart in their DPO Palantir let the insiders sell some 20 but not all of their shares and instituted a partial lockup on the remaining 80 of shares till the markets had digested a couple of quarters of earnings So people like me if in a traditional IPO would have missed PLTR mooning into the 40s been salivating on our paper wealth then would be bummed about the stock sliding back into the 20s but sell a big chunk at lockup expiry anyway In a traditional IPO I would absolutely be one of the paper handers collectively driving the stock down into the 20s or teens amp x200B Stonks go down when lockups expire sure as the sun rises tomorrow except for that one day in California last year and that dip certainly may happen to PLTR tomorrow anyway with the DPO But anecdotally I believe the structure of the Palantir DPO reduces the desire to paper hands for people like me as over the last few months I have been able to ladder sale 18 5 of my 20 at 10 00 10 62 10 95 10 99 11 15 11 45 11 95 12 95 13 95 14 95 15 00 15 67 15 95 16 95 17 65 17 95 18 95 19 95 20 20 20 95 22 30 22 95 23 95 24 95 25 95 26 95 27 95 28 95 31 39 32 45 32 51 36 61 37 00 37 95 39 00 and 39 75 So like DFV I have banked enough of my profits to diamond hand through whatever dip happens tomorrow and I am not itching to sell any more until Palantir is a 100B company I plan on laddering my remaining shares up to a 250B valuation and don t really care how long as that might take to diversify my holdings What if I m wrong and Palantir retreats to a 20 or 40B company for the next few years I ll take that risk as bullish as I am on PLTR So what will happen tomorrow Who the fuck knows Karp could sell 50m shares Soros could sell 20m shares Cathie could sell her 4m shares other VCs all dump all their shares and PLTR is a falling knife all the way down to all time lows Or Cathie could continue to build her position and other institutions could panic buy if PLTR starts moving up when it turns out that us Hobbits like the stock enough to HODL as Hobbits Obviously Diamondhand Lockups So what does my crystal ball say about the stock tomorrow I think the stock will go one of two ways 1 Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start 2 Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Select Start but I am not a financial advisor Seriously though I have no fucking clue what will happen tomorrow but I don t really care given the rest of my DD below the nothingburger of the FAANG lockout expiries on the long term share prices of the tech companies and my steadfast belief that Palantir is part of the FAAPNG club BTW I ll donate 10k to a charity of Jim Cramer s choosing if he says FAAPNG on CNBC and bump it to 25k if there s a CNBC panel that debates if FAANG investors should be FAAPNG instead Also if anyone is stupid enough to make a ETF from a masturbation joke I ll buy you dinner at French Laundry But only if the ticker is FAAP 6 My Three Takeaways from the Earnings Call I am impressed by the radically improved contribution margins in the Expand phase of Palantir s business buried on slide 45 is the fact that Palnatir s 2019 Contribution Margin of the Expand phase was negative 43 but it flipped to positive 47 in 2020 To me this means that Palantir got a lot faster and cheaper at scaling deployments into the cash cows in the Scale phase Combined with the IBM announcement this substantial improvement to contribution margin in the middle phase of the Palantir pipeline bodes well as to the future scalability of Palantir Employee Stock Compensation may hold down PLTR for years Just like the Q3 earnings the financials look mediocre as best when taken at face value but they actually quite impressive when you understand what is Stock Based Compensation Related Employer Payroll Taxes It s a complete ghost expense that is largely irrelevant to evaluating a business Here s a must read on it if you re evaluating PLTR or other recently IPOed companies https www reddit com r PLTR comments ll646o stock based compensation https www reddit com r PLTR comments ll646o stock based compensation Karp hates Wall Street too gt When we went and did our DPO people thought we should IPO because that is the best and quickest way to transfer money to Wall Street But we believe we should be focused on allowing the average person to participate and therefore absorb that risk And now as we ve had a pretty sublime year based on any conventional metric and as you ve seen the results gt gt And those of you who prefer a more short term focus I hope that you choose companies that are more appropriate for you amp Why the BP contract renewal is a big f ing deal to me The bears like to say that Palantir is over hyped over priced has no moat etc The bears like to say there are equivalent solutions out there that can be quickly built on open source software or bought for way cheaper from MSFT CRM SAP Accenture or 1000 other startups If the bears are right that Palantir s products are fungible why did a massive energy company coming off a really shitty year just bigly renew their Palantir contract for nine figures If the bears are right that Palantir s products are overpriced why did an unnamed aerospace company coming off a really shitty year for aviation recently sign a 300m contract Given how badly COVID has crushed demand for oil and airplanes wouldn t those companies buy a cheaper substitute good when their Palantir contract expires The bears are wrong Palantir creates deep fucking value for it s clients and Foundry is unfuckwithable And that s why I m still in So long and thanks for all the tendies See you at the restaurant at the end of the universe

1225,lm4753,t2_952ju665,1613594706,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm4753/ctrm_army/,1,CTRM ARMY,I just read an article from Seeking Alpha discussing Castor Maritime and how the Reddit r Wallstreetbets and the CTRM Army are at it again I invested in Cyprus and CTRM but I didn t know there was an Army Here s the article content since I can t share the link due to Reddit guidelines Anyone have thoughts on this Castor Maritime CTRM a Marshall Islands company headquartered in Cyprus listed in 2018 as the proud owner of a single vessel raising approximately 7 6 million Its book value at the time was approximately 8 5 million with negligible leverage It now owns 6 relatively old average age 14 6 years bulk carrier vessels and the unaudited 9 30 20 financials show a book value of 53 million with 37 6 million in cash 31 2 million of vessel and 20 9 million of debt liabilities However its market cap on Friday 2 12 was 748 6 million Why is a relatively minor shipping company trading at well over 10 times book The answer is simple this is one of the latest target of the Reddit WallStreetBets investors Recent events involving GameStop GME and AMC Entertainment AMC have caused these investors to search for any and all stocks with substantial short interest which appear to be ripe for a short squeeze with little regard for whether the shorting is justified by fundamentals The CTRM Army on Reddit is close to 10 000 strong all joined since 1 28 and as I write it is the 24th most popular stock on RobinHood This is what has caused the radical share movements in the past few weeks Share Count and Share Issuance CTRM is a company which since listing has relied on the equity markets to raise financing This is not a typo the company has issued an amazing 75 of its share count in the last 5 weeks As of 1 25 21 CTRM had issued or was in the process of issuing 509 262 376 shares according to a filing with the SEC Some market data providers have had problems following the amazing pace of share issuance For example look at this current report by MarketBeat A 1 486 25 short interest definitely a number to make WallStreetBets salivate But it is wrong they are comparing the pre 2019 share float to the outstanding short interest reported by NASDAQ on 1 29 21 In a relatively unknown company such as this the risks of relying on automated market data from public websites are obvious Short Interest So what is the actual short interest The reader will probably have more information than I do since the NASDAQ mid month report will probably be issued between the composition and the publication of this article We know that 35 67 million shares were shorted as of 1 29 The latest data that I can find is this from the usually reliable Fintel website 57 7 million short divided by 509 3 million outstanding gives us an 11 3 short interest Hardly a number to get Redditers pulses racing when compared to the maximum GME level of 140 reportedly calculated by Goldman Sachs So there is plenty of stock out there to cover all of the shorts But wait there s more The 509 3 million shares seem large in comparison to the short interest But there is far more to the story On each of the four occasions on which CTRM has issued stock since June 2020 they have issued an identical on one occasion close to identical number of warrants While some of those warrants have been exercised and are therefore included in the 509 3 million share count most have not The company tells us that as of 1 25 21 it was obligated to issue up to 199 290 500 additional shares upon the exercise of the outstanding warrants And even more Astute readers will have noted that I have quoted extensively from CTRM s F 3 Filing of 1 26 21 which contains a wealth of information on the company s current position and should be required reading for any CTRM investor However I have not yet touched on the main purpose of that filing The filing allows the company to issue an additional 700 million of securities some or all of which may be common stock or warrants Should CTRM elect to issue all in common stock the current price of approximately 1 50 would allow issuance of another 466 67 million shares So if there are so many shares available why does there appear to be a squeeze The only data points that argue in favor of a short squeeze are the high cost of shorting and the low number of shares available to short iBorrowDesk provides this report Only 5 2 million shares are available to borrow and a borrower has to pay a 27 pa fee to borrow them Why would anyone do that The answer I believe lies not in the share count but in the warrant count above Most theories of short squeezes rely on the belief that at some point short sellers will have to go back into the market to repurchase the shares they have borrowed This drives up the market price and forces more and more short sellers to cover their positions creating a self reinforcing spiral upwards Usually the theory is true In this case it probably isn t The 199 million of outstanding warrants described above are all in the money that is their exercise prices are all substantially below the market price However they have only recently become so Look for example at the holders of the warrants issued in 6 20 Their warrants entitle them to purchase shares at a price of 0 35 each Within a week of issuance the warrants went out of the money and remained there until 1 15 21 Then the price rose to 1 73 before setting back to the current approximately 1 50 Naturally the warrant holders wish to exercise their rights and capture their gains but while most of the warrants may be exercised at any time settlement is not instantaneous It takes a number of days for the resultant shares are available for sale and given current volatility the share price may well have fallen substantially by then Furthermore there is a condition to some of the warrants which prevents a warrant holder from acquiring more than 9 99 of the company If a warrant holder holds an amount of warrants greater than this amount and at least 2 have informed the SEC that they do he would need to exercise to receive the 9 99 sell those and then exercise the remainder thus extending the delay What s a worried warrant holder to do The simplest answer is to short the stock He receives the current share price and unless the share is called in he does not have to go into the market to cover the short he can just transfer the newly issued shares which he has received Given the numbers above of 199 3 million outstanding warrants and 57 7 million shares shorted it follows that if 29 of current warrant holders have used this strategy all short shares are hedging long positions and there are no pure shorts to be squeezed Of course this is not completely true There are some pure shorts out there I am one but I suspect that a substantial majority of shorts are hedging their warrant positions Conclusion There is no real short squeeze on CTRM nor can there be with the number of shares likely to be issued in the near future although there may be temporary volatility for the next week or so as warrant settlements progress I expect all warrants to be exercised the company to move swiftly to make a large additional share offering and the share price to fall back to below December levels

fleet problems Secondly they offer a hub motor solution That means the motor is behind the rim of each wheel giving the vehicle an all wheel drive versatility and reducing the cost of maintenance Why Because if one motor goes bad you just remove it and replace it It s easy access and smaller less cost Anything else besides a truck Two other vehicles are being discussed One a commercial van https
