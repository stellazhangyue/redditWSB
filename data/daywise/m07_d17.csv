this will def be shit Looking for someone to tell me why I m retarded Micron Technology Inc is an American producer of computer memory and computer data storage including DRAM flash memory and USB flash drives It is headquartered in Boise Idaho Its consumer products are marketed under the brands Crucial and Ballistix Current share price 74 8 Market Cap 88 Billion Basically they make ram sticks and hard drives for computers They have roughly 17 7 of the market share for memory main competitors Samsung Electronics Co and SK Hynix Inc as main competitors What the three companies have in memory has been described as an oligopoly The type of memory they make is used in almost every data intensive computing environment Their memory chips are inside RTX 3080 s and 90 s data centers and a shit ton of cars The more AI is used the more dRam memory is needed These are the only companies that sell it Income and recent history Because of its commodity status Microns revenue has always been tied to pricing in memory amp x200B https preview redd it 0v8ks2legob71 png width 1023 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3b596cedf4bccf3628ba9ce00625e8f4178df5bf https preview redd it h7xdsmdggob71 png width 1024 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 806573a9a0fe808ab58cb72c6e91918a0c6cd926 From 2016 to 2018 Micron had explosive revenue growth and in 2019 this fell back down as memory prices fell While the memory business has had cyclicality over the years it is on an always upward baseline where the new lowest years equate with what used to be mid level years and the high years setting record revenues The company s products have a very high margin so profits are very sensitive to total revenue The company has improved its balance sheet substantially in the last couple years which will allow for smoother down years and better growth years When the price of memory dropped in previous years micron would have slightly negative earnings on the year In the most recent down period 2020 the company still had an EPS of 2 37 compared with last downturn where it was negative The memory cycle bottomed out in 2020 and expected sales are expected to BOOM in 2021 Average revenue estimate is 36 9 billion High estimates go up to 43 billion Look at what earnings when revenue was at 30 if it got to 40 billion their EPS would be FAT Balance Sheet Microns balance sheet is fucking clean They have 54 Billion in total assets 17 current and 13 Billion in liabilities 5 4 current In 2017 they reduced long term debt from 9 billion to 3 billion and since then has reduced interest from around 500 million a year around 2016 and 2017 to about 200 million a year now This is despite having increased assets by 27 billion in the same time frame If Micron closed up shop today and just fucking scrapped everything and sold its assets and factories it would be worth nearly half its share price This number is probably UNDERSTATED considering there is a lot of written off depreciation on their factories and there is no way in hell their newer factories are worth less than it cost to build Book value doesn t matter that much but that is an insane price to book in comparison to any other growing company in this environment Micron s products aren t nearly as flashy or interesting but they are NEEDED Future Almost all AI driving smart phones and data centers require dRam The overall demand should increase substantially for the foreseeable future Micron will use cashflow for share buybacks and they are going to have a shit ton of it this year Next two years are projected to be boom years for memory Another thing going for Micron is its U S based status With chip shortage around the world the U S has taken a strategic position that the country needs domestic chip manufacturers Both of Microns competitors are foreign entities They may be eligible for stimulus or government assistance if they build domestically but Micron is the best positioned for Biden Bucks Other shit that is promising Some big hedge fund managers have retardedly large bets on Micron Monish Pabrai 50 of portfolio Li Lu 51 7 of portfolio David Tepper 9 of portfolio It is the largest investment in all of their portfolios Last reported share price they were holding at was 88 or 16 higher than today s price I m pretty sure not all of them are retarded Short Interest You re retarded for even looking at this What is wrong with you Its not very high though you d need a very smooth brain to short this stock Positions Missionary Only adding up shares and itm leaps as I ride out the current downtrend but this shit is way undervalued Especially in this market They re being priced like a boomer stock that s slowly dying instead of a growing company with a shit ton of money with huge profits that makes a product EVERYONE needs If they hit revenue targets this year they would be trading at only 6x forward earnings Dumb Should be 110 right now and that would be cheap

local Wendy s Okay so when I bought CLNE I had strong belief that this company was going to do well and that it had a somewhat promising future given that I think that RNG has a lot of potential considering the Biden administration has their eyes on the environment Plus I saw you retards picked up on it did a quick cost benefit analysis in my head and decided to jump on the train with 400 shares Well since this ass hat has been falling and falling for days on end I decided to do some quick back of the envelope calculations to justify my investment decision Yes the true WSB way of investing buy first and then look for confirmation bias later The model I use is rather simplistic and I would say its quite inaccurate given I make a lot of assumptions that may not actually hold I m a first year Economics student so cut me some slack Even with my optimistic model the price I came to is still way below what the analysts covering this stock came to There doesn t seem to be any general consensus as to the rough direction this stock should go in Everywhere I look either someone thinks its absolute garbage or its a stellar buy at these prices There is no middle ground for this stock Hence I have decided to use a very simple model to try and find the intrinsic value of this stock based on earnings First let s outline the underlying assumptions and criteria for valuation Set of criteria used https preview redd it 89d9a6sqzpb71 png width 208 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 72e32ef73c1be50cbc636fca1e8aca1e9708fe90 amp x200B Now let me explain The EPS ttm is a forward looking one and a VERY AMBITIOUS estimate of it Now its not to say that CLNE cannot achieve this but it s quite a slim chance If they get enough funding in the coming year from the Biden administration and given that demand for RNG will start to increase due to a general rise in demand by the end of next year or perhaps first quarter of 2023 we could see this come to life This metric is available on yahoo finance Now the growth rate which I have used is 33 33 This metric is also available on yahoo finance The reason I think this growth rate is acceptable is because I think the initial growth rate perhaps in the next 3 4 years will be much higher than this and will drop off to lower rates in the next 4 10 years This will allow us to assume an average constant rate of 33 33 Link to above data https finance yahoo com quote CLNE analysis https finance yahoo com quote CLNE analysis Finally the last part which I want to explain is the P E ratio Ideally the correct way to do this would be to gather data for a significant enough time period and actually calculate the ratio for each company in the sector myself and take an average However this is WSB I m not going to do that Everywhere I looked I found a slightly different number for the average P E so I have decided to use the average of unregulated and regulated utilities from guru focus amp x200B P E ratios and others for Utilities https preview redd it l5lvl8xs0qb71 png width 1064 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 97e8cdbc874a4aabdcb7f28e7effef08fe193f2d Link to above data https www gurufocus com industry overview php sector Utilities amp region USA https www gurufocus com industry overview php sector Utilities amp region USA The rate of return measure and margin of safety is something subjective If you change these you will of course get a different valuation The numbers I used 20 and 30 are what I am happy with personally So now we can talk about the way in which the valuation is done The methodology is fairly simple amp x200B From Spreadsheet https preview redd it juitx1j62qb71 png width 1003 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 6a19eff3031501528015fad4d25738a3d55a49bc In excel we start with the 0 11 EPS ttm growing this out by the growth rate of 33 33 from year 1 to year 10 Then in the following line below the last value in year 10 we multiply the grown EPS estimate by the P E ratio Then we move back from year 10 to year 1 dividing the found stock price by 1 required rate of return in my case 20 This is why I said the valuation is subjective depending on the rate of return you think you want to can achieve If you drop the required rate of return by just 5 the fair value jumps from 9 91 to 14 53 and consecutively your prices with margin will change The reason we include the margin factor is because of error We are bound to be wrong by some amount and of course you can do the entire process again changing all the figures to give more definite boundaries but I decided to simply this I took a margin of 15 in each direction yielding the range of prices I think are possible given the metrics I have used So yeah that just about sum s it up I will also add a few more interesting points I found while doing this DD The utilities industry does relatively poorly in crisis years and then rallies Of course you can gather a bunch of data run regressions and t test the significance that market crashes have on the performance of utilities but again this is WSB Let me just a insert a neat graph to show what I mean IDU is an index ETF that tracks the utilities sector

Introduction Let me just preface this by saying this post is for those who take trading seriously who harbor real hopes of earning a steady income in the market This post is going to be long and it is going to demand work from you to both understand and attempt to emulate But that work will be worth the effort I recommend you read it several times through and keep as a reference If you are just here looking for entertainment and gambling that is fine but this is probably a thread to skip amp x200B Four weeks ago I began a challenge to turn 4k into 1M I began this to help educate others on the professional trading process and to prove several points that are often in contention 1 That it can be done 2 That good trading is actually simple 3 That technical analysis is real and effective 4 That small accounts have a huge edge amp x200B Here are my results from the FIRST WEEK of that challenge Processing img 92wrzgrcasb71 Return first week 658 16 5 The question you should be asking yourself is How did I find so many sudden big winners in a single week I will teach you exactly how below amp x200B First let s just get a bit of a rant off my chest Hard words to follow and a lot of you will disagree with these points but some of you will benefit a lot from hearing it These are some of the reasons you aren t making money in my not so humble opinion amp x200B 1 Stop chasing stupid memes and hot stocks Create your own opportunities When I read the daily chat in subs including this one it gets really depressing quick All I see are the same tickers posted over and over and over again and usually total dogshit stocks Everyone just copying what others tell them to trade so few actually thinking for themselves or finding their own trades and opportunities Like why is half this sub bagholding SOFI and mentioning it nonstop Was some recent DD posted on it and you all just hopped in blindly Why the obsession with the other same tickers like CLNE that get posted again and again Because others were posting about it Look I won t deny you can sometimes potentially make money in meme stocks or reading DDs But chasing memes or pump and dumps is not going to make you money long term Maybe you looked at the fundamentals and you thought it was a great company with long term prospects Ok sure But if you are trading on fundamentals why the hell are you buying short term options If you are a fundamental trader then you are a buy and hold investor with a year plus timeline If you are buying weeklies or looking for a quick pop fundamentals don t mean shit technicals are what matter Stop mixing long term strategy with short term trading it just doesn t make any sense Set up your own scanners Do your own research Find your own opportunities 2 Stop trading slow as fuck megacap stocks with a small account When I see people with sub million dollar accounts trading stocks like Ford or even Apple I can t help but cringe The one HUGE advantage that small accounts have is that they can trade the fast explosive hard moving small cap stocks without having to worry about issues like liquidity and wicking the price upward The reason you can beat the market hard with a small account is because you can trade the highest beta stocks that guys like Buffett can t But only if you focus on them Trade the fast stocks The stocks that really move hard Those are the stocks that will get you rich quickly not fucking BABA on a 2 move There is an acronym you need to learn and become obsessive about That acronym is ADR Average Daily Range If your account is less than a million you should not even be looking at stocks with an ADR less than 5 They are too slow When someone asks me to judge a stock or setup for them the very first thing I look at is the ADR If it is less than 4 or 5 ADR I tell them it is dog shit whether I m bullish on it or not AAPL has an ADR of 1 6 at the moment Garbage stock for small accounts Is it rallying Sure It is rallying in 1 6 increments Can you make money in that Sure even more with options But you won t double your account in a month with Apple unless you YOLO everything into short dated options It works until you go broke which let s be honest most people here have or will TSLA has an ADR of 3 5 Not terrible but you can do much better SPCE has an ADR of 12 5 THAT is what you want to see I made a 42 return on SPCE in 3 days last week with SHARES And I will show you exactly why I bought SPCE and many others before they exploded last week It wasn t simple luck 3 If you want to gamble with options then go for it But if you want to be an actual professional trader you probably shouldn t touch options until you ve shown consistency with shares first Look if you just want to gamble and hope to get lucky knowing you will probably go broke that s fine with me That s the WSB way At least you are being honest with yourself But if you want to get serious about trading to make so much money so consistently you never have to work again you should not be touching options until you ve proven you can be consistently profitable trading shares Leverage and margin is something that ought to be earned not used just because it is there Options are extremely unforgiving Let s say you buy a stock at 10 it rallies up to 12 then tanks back to 10 again and you sell With shares you ve just broken even Not good but obviously not bad either Breakeven is fine for a trade But do the same exact trade with options instead of shares and you could be down 20 on it Good luck overcoming that downward pressure as a noobie trader long term Trading is hard enough without adding theta and vega rape to the mix 4 If you want to be a professional then think and act like a professional Professional traders are process oriented They are focused on improving their trading process more than they are on chasing the hot next trade That means having a method or system to your trading Something you can repeat again and again and gradually improve It means using scanners and finding YOUR OWN stocks and trades finding tickers neither you nor most anyone else has even heard of before and making tons of money on them Browsing WSB for DD or the next hot stock is not a system and likely won t lead to any lasting success as a trader It also means you have to work fucking hard Success is rarely easy much less in something as competitive as the stock market If you are lazy or don t want it enough be honest with yourself amp x200B Now on to making money What follows is one simple setup that will make you money if traded correctly I will teach you a process you can follow and repeat and improve upon This obviously isn t the only way to trade but I can promise you it beats the market significantly if done correctly So learn it and practice it and start making money From there the rest is improvement and branching out and finding new strategies to test and perfect on your way to becoming an independent professional trader In other words the rest is gravy amp x200B Breakout Swing Trading Strategy The Setup Processing img 0nnm1qztasb71 This is a purely technical trading system A lot of people will tell you technical analysis is nonsense and doesn t work Those people do not know what they are talking about I ve made my living as a purely technical trader and I assure you I am not the only one Over my career I ve picked far too many huge short term winners using nothing but charts for it to be simple luck To put it in one sentence We are going to look for strong volatile momentum stocks that are breaking out of a consolidation pattern Sounds easy and it is but the details are what really matter So let s go in depth We will start by analyzing five of the trades I ve made as part of my 1M challenge so you can see exactly what I saw on the charts when I entered my positions I drew two red lines on each chart to show the flagging pattern I was watching The chart on the left is daily candles chart on the right is hourly candles Proof of these entries and exits can be found in both text and screenshot format in my history amp x200B Example 1 IDT Bought 37 70 on 7 1 Sold partial 47

format png amp auto webp amp s 9b2dded0bca2a31dda00d5c4f94b3550a5a5f5cc What do these charts all have in common 1 Strong momentum stocks Every one of these except CRCT which was a recent IPO had doubled or more in the past six months None of this buy low sell high stuff here We want to buy high and sell higher 2 High ADR Average Daily Range You want to trade the fast stocks the truly explosive stocks and a high ADR is one of the best ways to find them The average ADR on these five stocks was above 8 Our minimum ADR will be 5 3 Consolidation The stock made a big move upward and then began trading sideways with a tightening range Forming higher lows and lower highs The ideal flagging pattern we are looking for is technically referred to as a pennant 4 Moving Averages Every one of these stocks was either riding or bouncing off of their 20 day simple moving average There is something truly magical about that yellow line on my charts and I don t know what or why it is but it simply works This is absolutely key to remember to avoid stocks that are either too slow or over extended focus on those at or near the 20 SMA Occasionally you can find good breakouts above the 20 SMA that are riding the 10 SMA but these have a higher failure rate in my experience 5 Strong breakout from their range on high volume A breakout refers to a stock punching through the top of the consolidation flag you drew Ideally you want to see fast rising price action on large volume This is your entry point amp x200B If you want to see more charts and examples of this strategy this four hour video https www youtube com watch v xx8GvtAxilk should give you plenty If you are going to employ this strategy I highly recommend investing those four hours amp x200B The Trading Process STEP 1 Set up a scanner and run it the night before your trading day I will give you all of my scanner settings below to get you started Your welcome STEP 2 Go through every single stock in your scanner Look for the most promising stocks In other words the stocks that have the five criteria I listed above If you spot a good stock do three things 1 Draw a flag around the consolidating price action 2 Set an alert to the top of the range to notify you when a breakout from that range occurs 3 Add the stock to a breakout watchlist I don t know if you can do any of this with Robinhood but you ought to have a real broker and charting software by now I use ThinkorSwim but there s plenty of good software options out there like TC2000 Don t be afraid to pay a bit for good software if you have to STEP 3 Before market open you should now have a solid watchlist of breakout candidates Go through the list and see which setups look the closest to breaking out or which have already broken out in the premarket action Also look carefully for anything that may bounce hard off the 20 SMA These will be your primary focus but you should also have alerts to all other stocks in your watchlist to notify you of a breakout STEP 4 If a strong breakout from the range occurs meaning good rising action on good volume you want to buy quickly I would recommend a minimum of 10 of your account to a maximum of 25 but follow your own personal risk tolerance Set a stop loss order just below the low price of the day You should always be using a stop loss especially as a beginner and especially with these volatile stocks STEP 5 If the stock has stayed above your entry price by the next day you can raise your stop to the entry price if you wish to limit your loss to breakeven After 3 5 days or after very strong price gain you should take some profits Anywhere from a quarter to a half of your position The rest we will let ride STEP 6 Use the 10 day simple moving average as a trailing soft stop for the remaining shares If it looks like the price action is going to close below the 10 SMA then close out the entire position The reason I emphasize close is because intraday price action can be volatile and you don t want to get stopped out from a small dip just below the 10 SMA if possible If you don t have the time to watch the market during the day feel free to use a hard stop Scanner Settings ADR

I m going to recommend that you don t anticipate breakouts In other words don t buy a stock simply because it is trading in a good consolidation pattern Wait for the price to break upward from the range before you buy The reason for this is that consolidation flags don t only break up they can also break down I ll just mention that this can actually be used as a profitable shorting strategy but I won t go into depth on that in this guide And I don t recommend shorting for a beginner trader either Let s take a look at a few examples of recent break downs amp x200B SOFI SOFI formed a decent flag in June but then broke down from that range on 6 24 This day on 6 24 would have been a clear signal to either exit a position or to short the stock The price simply collapsed hard after this

my own rules and bought this in anticipation on 6 29 But I exited the position quickly on 7 1 when it became clear the price was breaking down from its range After that the price collapsed https

little more complicated tricky charts We need to stretch your brain a bit with less simple examples redacted small cap Here you can see three consolidation flags back to back with differing follow through Flag breakout flag breakout flag break down on the 20 SMA You will frequently see hard rising stocks following this stair stepping sort of pattern Still pretty simple so let s try something a little harder to see https preview redd it rve956djisb71 png width 1623 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 94584a68a32c9ada4cd5494af413ae41833feead PLBY https preview redd it qbkvm3m4csb71 png width 1609 amp format png amp auto webp amp s c145defa11d2a47b4097e23b8374acc32d543c2e Study this chart carefully and you can see everything discussed so far PLBY formed a nice flag in May It broke down from this flag on 5 11 But then it seemed to trade sideways for a bit and form another larger flag again Note that the breakout breakdown point for the first flag was the 20 SMA and the breakout breakdown point for the second flag was the 50 SMA This is no coincidence and will be seen often Some stocks will move based on the 50 SMA rather than the 20 SMA and these can be traded as well but they are slower moving stocks and I recommend for smaller accounts to just focus on those stocks near the 20 day The failure point for the second flag was on 6 14 After that the price has collapsed One more thing to note on this chart There are two points where the price on PLBY broke hard upward from it s range but then quickly fell back down into the range These are referred to as false breakouts and will happen to you often Note that the first false breakout occurred well above the 20 SMA which is one reason to avoid breakouts well above the 20 SMA They just haven t consolidated enough and have a higher failure rate Patience is king amp x200B Frequently Asked Questions When is the best time to employ this strategy This strategy should only be employed during a rising bull market or possibly during a sideways market Breakouts will not work well in a declining market and some other strategy must be employed The absolute best time for breakouts is shortly after a pullback in the market when stocks begin to recover quickly You can see some explosive moves during these periods How do you deal with breakouts that have gapped up in premarket Those are more difficult It all depends on the price action If something has gapped up huge in premarket I will generally just pass on it But if something is just starting to break out in premarket I will look to enter The exact percentage is difficult to say unfortunately but anything up more than 10 is usually a pass for me If I do enter premarket gappers I won t enter immediately on open I ll give it one to five minutes to watch the price action If the price is stalling or dropping at open I won t buy it But if it is showing strong volume and rising that is what I want to see for a buy Can this strategy be done with options instead of shares It is possible but I wouldn t recommend it especially to start Breakouts have a high failure rate and options are very unforgiving to failed trades If you do decide to use options I would suggest being much more aggressive with your profit taking perhaps even selling same day on a breakout Since this is a swing trading strategy you can go quite short dated on the expiration around one month dated should be fine unless you want to try for a bigger move or gamble with even shorter expiry What do you set your stop losses at Already explained above First day the lows of the day Second day cost basis After that use 10 day SMA as a trailing soft stop When do you take profits Already explained above Take quarter to half profits after first big run up usually around 3 to 5 days Then use the 10 SMA as a soft trailing stop What if the stock gaps down hard overnight My stop won t protect me from that This is true The only way to avoid overnight risk is to be a pure day trader and to never hold overnight Personally I find swing trading to be far more profitable since the big moves take days to play out Swing trading also gives you much more time and freedom to live your life since you can simply hold a winning position for days or even weeks and don t have to sit and stare at a screen all day long to make money Stocks gapping down big overnight is actually quite rare but eventually you will experience it But let s do the math Let s say you put 10 of your account into a stock and some news comes out and it tanks a whopping 30 overnight As a percentage of your account that is 10 30 or 3 of your account Definitely not good of course But you aren t going to go broke losing 3 of your account It can be overcome with time and good trading This is just part of the risk of being a trader I am curious if you handle memestocks or other very popular stocks differently I hear a lot of people say these stocks don t act rationally Do you take more less risk with stocks like this Yes meme stocks often have much more support and move stronger than most other stocks For this reason I usually have more conviction to trade them so I will put on a bit more size or even slightly anticipate the breakouts But I don t trade meme stocks just because they are meme stocks they must fit the criteria and patterns described above Meme stocks represent opportunities for massive gains and so you should take a bit more risk with them If you got in GME early which I did you can make life changing money Unfortunately today you ve got too many people trying to pump too many names and everybody ends up diluting each other It s not like a few months back when the names were much more consolidated Do you use any fundamentals in your trading None My trading horizon is too short for fundamentals to make any difference in the price action Fundamentals only make a difference for long term investors If you are a short term trader you don t need to worry about fundamentals at all imo amp x200B Additional Resources I was going to offer several links here but don t want to break any rules Educational Material Screenshots and Charts and a Live

own copy of the Wall Street Journal on his desk in his room One day I decided to sneak into his room and lay my eyes on the holy print of Wall Street Alas I will have access to the greatest source of investment knowledge on planet earth I picked it up My head began to spin into infinity Interest rates price to earnings yield curves dividends leverage payouts monetary policy What on earth does this stuff mean I tried to read through it all but none of it made sense I then stumbled across an article about the Iraq War in the World section and that was an incredibly well written article Nevertheless the mystery of it all just added to the mythology of Wall Street It was like unlocking the worlds secrets right before my eyes In my head the little kid in me always felt that if I only learned these secrets I would be able to gain my edge on everyone else Somehow I failed to acknowledge that I had no reasonable means to invest in stocks to begin with I had no trading platform to use and secondly I had no money because I was thirteen That would all change though when I turned 14 and started working my first minimum wage paying job Oh the glory of 6 an hour My financial empire was right around the corner Soon I would join the Wall Street bulls and ride on to my endless wealth Then 2008 happened I remember in the early days of the Great Recession I would hear about how a bunch of assholes made a bunch of people poor and were getting away with it but I had no idea what they meant It was something about the housing market crashing and basically everyone got screwed I also remember how people said Barrack Obama or maybe George W Bush planned the whole thing But that s really all I deciphered from all of it at the time I was 14 I cared about sports and chicken tendies I didn t know what a Recession was I was just happy I didn t lose my Wendy s job I went to College and studied economics Studied is a loose term I definitely came out dumber than I did when I started But that was okay I learned how to open a brokerage account and put all my money in the corporate Goliath PZOO A company which at the time was doing something related to lab growing weed or something I m not sure I received all these letters from them saying they were reverse splitting there stock That really pissed me off because I was losing all my shares They started to specialize in nutrition so I sold all my shares because they ditched their original business model Fast forward a few years from then I opened a Robinhood account and started buying put options on Beyond Meat a little bit after its IPO Who wants to eat fake meat What a dumb idea for a company I lost thousands on that trade though because apparently people were bullish on meatless meat Then I turned on the news last spring to find all these morons on Reddit were buying GameStop stock and somehow made money doing that I realized I wasn t alone in my endeavor of perpetually throwing money at the stock market to hopefully one day hit the jackpot Seriously good for you guys Because of this Reddit page I bought CLOV and am already down 30 I should be down more but my brokerage account won t let me buy or sell options I m still waiting for customer service to tell me why I can t throw my money at them Note I am not an investment advisor If you got this far you did not learn anything Do not make trades based on anything you read above If you decided to ignore this note that is your fault Also if you decided to ignore this note you are probably like me which means you will absolutely never make money in the market That s okay as long as you enjoy Chili s for the rest of your life

talking points taken from the investor page of the company s website is absolutely not fucking good enough The Cathie Woodisms only work with the support of the price action You can screech innovative and disruptor to the sky until you pass out and nobody is going to give a shit because they see your anus bleeding It s my hypothesis that once a ticker gets to the point where it s fallen out of favor you need actual good news to revive it Look at SPCE for a good example The launch approval was a huge catalyst This is basic ass shit I know but a lot of people are laboring under the impression

b58e8cfeb491f32bb212c01fe9e613d5edf07a47 What do these charts all have in common 1 Strong momentum stocks Every one of these except CRCT which was a recent IPO had doubled or more in the past six months None of this buy low sell high stuff here We want to buy high and sell higher 2 High ADR Average Daily Range You want to trade the fast stocks the truly explosive stocks and a high ADR is one of the best ways to find them The average ADR on these five stocks was above 8 Our minimum ADR will be 5 3 Consolidation The stock made a big move upward and then began trading sideways with a tightening range Forming higher lows and lower highs The ideal flagging pattern we are looking for is technically referred to as a pennant 4 Moving Averages Every one of these stocks was either riding or bouncing off of their 20 day simple moving average There is something truly magical about that yellow line on my charts and I don t know what or why it is but it simply works This is absolutely key to remember to avoid stocks that are either too slow or over extended focus on those at or near the 20 SMA Occasionally you can find good breakouts above the 20 SMA that are riding the 10 SMA but these have a higher failure rate in my experience 5 Strong breakout from their range on high volume A breakout refers to a stock punching through the top of the consolidation flag you drew Ideally you want to see fast rising price action on large volume This is your entry point amp x200B If you want to see more charts and examples of this strategy DM me The Trading Process STEP 1 Set up a scanner and run it the night before your trading day I will give you all of my scanner settings below to get you started Your welcome STEP 2 Go through every single stock in your scanner Look for the most promising stocks In other words the stocks that have the five criteria I listed above If you spot a good stock do three things 1 Draw a flag around the consolidating price action 2 Set an alert to the top of the range to notify you when a breakout from that range occurs 3 Add the stock to a breakout watchlist I don t know if you can do any of this with Robinhood but you ought to have a real broker and charting software by now I use ThinkorSwim but there s plenty of good software options out there like TC2000 Don t be afraid to pay a bit for good software if you have to STEP 3 Before market open you should now have a solid watchlist of breakout candidates Go through the list and see which setups look the closest to breaking out or which have already broken out in the premarket action Also look carefully for anything that may bounce hard off the 20 SMA These will be your primary focus but you should also have alerts to all other stocks in your watchlist to notify you of a breakout STEP 4 If a strong breakout from the range occurs meaning good rising action on good volume you want to buy quickly I would recommend a minimum of 10 of your account to a maximum of 25 but follow your own personal risk tolerance Set a stop loss order just below the low price of the day You should always be using a stop loss especially as a beginner and especially with these volatile stocks STEP 5 If the stock has stayed above your entry price by the next day you can raise your stop to the entry price if you wish to limit your loss to breakeven After 3 5 days or after very strong price gain you should take some profits Anywhere from a quarter to a half of your position The rest we will let ride STEP 6 Use the 10 day simple moving average as a trailing soft stop for the remaining shares If it looks like the price action is going to close below the 10 SMA then close out the entire position The reason I emphasize close is because intraday price action can be volatile and you don t want to get stopped out from a small dip just below the 10 SMA if possible If you don t have the time to watch the market during the day feel free to use a hard stop Scanner Settings ADR Average Daily Range

don t anticipate breakouts In other words don t buy a stock simply because it is trading in a good consolidation pattern Wait for the price to break upward from the range before you buy The reason for this is that consolidation flags don t only break up they can also break down I ll just mention that this can actually be used as a profitable shorting strategy but I won t go into depth on that in this guide And I don t recommend shorting for a beginner trader either Let s take a look at a few examples of recent break downs SOFI SOFI formed a decent flag in June but then broke down from that

bull market or possibly during a sideways market Breakouts will not work well in a declining market and some other strategy must be employed The absolute best time for breakouts is shortly after a pullback in the market when stocks begin to recover quickly You can see some explosive moves during these periods How do you deal with breakouts that have gapped up in premarket Those are more difficult It all depends on the price action If something has gapped up huge in premarket I will generally just pass on it But if something is just starting to break out in premarket I will look to enter The exact percentage is difficult to say unfortunately but anything up more than 10 is usually a pass for me If I do enter premarket gappers I won t enter immediately on open I ll give it one to five minutes to watch the price action If the price is stalling or dropping at open I won t buy it But if it is showing strong volume and rising that is what I want to see for a buy Can this strategy be done with options instead of shares It is possible but I wouldn t recommend it especially to start Breakouts have a high failure rate and options are very unforgiving to failed trades If you do decide to use options I would suggest being much more aggressive with your profit taking perhaps even selling same day on a breakout Since this is a swing trading strategy you can go quite short dated on the expiration around one month dated should be fine unless you want to try for a bigger move or gamble with even shorter expiry What do you set your stop losses at Already explained above First day the lows of the day Second day cost basis After that use 10 day SMA as a trailing soft stop When do you take profits Already explained above Take quarter to half profits after first big run up usually around 3 to 5 days Then use the 10 SMA as a soft trailing stop What if the stock gaps down hard overnight My stop won t protect me from that This is true The only way to avoid overnight risk is to be a pure day trader and to never hold overnight Personally I find swing trading to be far more profitable since the big moves take days to play out Swing trading also gives you much more time and freedom to live your life since you can simply hold a winning position for days or even weeks and don t have to sit and stare at a screen all day long to make money Stocks gapping down big overnight is actually quite rare but eventually you will experience it But let s do the math Let s say you put 10 of your account into a stock and some news comes out and it tanks a whopping 30 overnight As a percentage of your account that is 10 30 or 3 of your account Definitely not good of course But you aren t going to go broke losing 3 of your account It can be overcome with time and good trading This is just part of the risk of being a trader I am curious if you handle memestocks or other very popular stocks differently I hear a lot of people say these stocks don t act rationally Do you take more less risk with stocks like this Yes meme stocks often have much more support and move stronger than most other stocks For this reason I usually have more conviction to trade them so I will put on a bit more size or even slightly anticipate the breakouts But I don t trade meme stocks just because they are meme stocks they must fit the criteria and patterns described above Meme stocks represent opportunities for massive gains and so you should take a bit more risk with them If you got in GME early which I did you can make life changing money Unfortunately today you ve got too many people trying to pump too many names and everybody ends up diluting each other It s not like a few months back when the names were much more consolidated Do you use any fundamentals in your trading None My trading horizon is too short for fundamentals to make any difference in the price action Fundamentals only make a difference for long term investors If you are a short term trader you don t need to worry about fundamentals at all imo amp x200B Thanks for reading
