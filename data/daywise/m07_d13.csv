depth here https www reddit com r Superstonk comments nt8ot8 rip uleavemeanon where are the shares part 1 and that the real short interest could be much higher than reported We can look at history to see the types of short squeezes that could happen to GME from here on out A mother of all short squeeze such as when Volkswagen short squeezed in 2008 making it the most valuable company https www reuters com article us volkswagen idUSTRE49R3I920081028 at the time A dividend triggered short squeeze such as Overstock after announcing a blockchain dividend https www fool com investing 2020 05 06 why overstock continued its 500 climb with another aspx which forces short sellers to close their positions and it s also worth mentioning Rocket Companies experienced a short squeeze right after announcing a special dividend https www barrons com articles rocket companies is the latest short squeeze target its stock rose 71 today 51614727103 A drawn out short squeeze like Tesla did in 2020 which shot the price over ten times its March 2020 lows resulting in major losses to short sellers https www fool com investing 2021 01 27 short squeeze costs tesla shorts 40 billion in 202 Note that all these short squeezes occurred with much lower short interest SI than GME s current reported SI These are examples of the possible types of short squeezes for GME based on historical precedent There are multiple stocks with heavy correlation to GME and AMC is one of them AMC peaked around 20 during the January gamma squeeze on multiple heavily shorted stocks On June 2 2021 AMC spiked to an all time high of 72 nearly four times its January peak while exhibiting similar levels of reported short interest to GME This was a technical confirmation for me that GME has the potential for similar magnitudes of price action 2 Hedge Against Possible Market Crash We ve all heard by now that there is a potentially catastrophic market crash due the question is when This is impossible to answer since nobody can see the future and predict the exact date it could be tomorrow or ten years from now However there are current red flags raised such as high P E ratios elevated Shiller CAPE ratio https www multpl com shiller pe Buffett Indicator https www currentmarketvaluation com models buffett indicator php and other fundamental technical indicators suggesting an overvalued equity market

markets amidst concerns of non transitory inflation Not to mention the world has yet to fully recover from the COVID 19 pandemic and the possible lasting economic damages not yet realized as equity markets rallied to all time highs during this time And these are just the few red flags I could think of on the top of my head amongst many other unlisted signs or warnings by other experienced investors So let s break this down The Fed responds https fred stlouisfed org series WALCL to COVID 19 by injecting the capital markets with liquidity via infinite quantitative easing https www marketwatch com story fed announces unlimited qe and sets up several new lending programs 2020 03 23 and lowering interest rates to near zero in an attempt to backstop the economy albeit averting a larger crisis but also creating a possible moral hazard in the process Some say the spectacular bull run of the past decade was partly fueled by the Fed via its QE program since 2008 and declining interest rates With all that liquidity and cheap lending debt provided by the Fed an unprecedented bull run followed after the March 2020 COVID 19 market crash it was but a blip in the timeline Knowing that the Fed will backstop the markets to prevent another market crash during an economic emergency everybody levered https www bloomberg com news features 2021 04 08 how bill hwang of archegos capital lost 20 billion in two days up to enhance their returns a moral hazard indeed to take advantage of that both long and short hint hedge funds betting GameStop going bankrupt due to the pandemic Now that the economy is successfully re opening as more and more people are vaccinated the Fed has less incentive to backstop the equity markets as aggressively as before especially when inflation https www wsj com articles container ship prices skyrocket as rush to move goods picks up 11625482800 could cause the Fed to lose control and be forced to enact contractionary monetary policy We all know what happens when the Fed pulls liquidity out of the system and raises interest rates during an overleveraged asset bubble hint Japan asset crash https en wikipedia org wiki Japanese asset price bubble Dot com bubble https en wikipedia org wiki Dot com bubble Sometimes singular entities can crash the system by being overleveraged and taking on extreme risks such as Long Term Capital Management https en wikipedia org wiki Long Term Capital Management having to be bailed out by the Fed to prevent a systemic collapse Hmm I wonder if Citadel read the book When Genius Fails So we see a lot of red flags in the overall market economy and know that the next crash could be of epic proportions a deleveraging type event that could lead to an extended bear market What are the best ways to hedge against it Well it turns out that GME has a negative market beta https www investopedia com terms b beta asp and depending on the sources used it is anywhere from 2 to 27 https preview redd it ftn1fyldt1a71 png width 1914 amp format png amp auto webp amp s ea2c3bd8ab724d3920508f86745a6a95da761ea0 This means that if the market were to crash GME would theoretically rise by a factor of 2 to 27 compared to the S amp P 500 The going theory for this phenomenon is that the short sellers whether they be retail or institutional would be forced to sell their long positions to cover their short positions if they were to be margin called keep in mind the leverage in the system is at all time highs If the theory proves to be correct we could see GME as one of the bright green candles emerging from a sea of red in the overall market during a crash this would also present a perfect opportunity to sell some of your GME holdings and buy the dip on all your other favorite stocks at a huge discount 3 Improving Fundamentals GameStop has paid off its long term debt https www marketwatch com story gamestop stock rises after eliminating its long term debt 2021 05 03 and

maybe blockchain dividend Significant Goodwill as a result of a strong global brand name after the gamma squeeze in January news of GameStop was broadcasted throughout the entire world free advertisement and a large community of Apes supporting the business and simply likes the stock It is difficult to accurately price GameStop with traditional valuation metrics DCF P E etc as they are just beginning their turnaround After all traditional valuation metrics never saw Tesla becoming what it is today and fundamentalists are scratching their heads to this day Let s take the current market cap of a few companies from the retail e commerce sector Chewy founded by Ryan Cohen and Tesla since it has similar Meme potential and tends to ignore traditional fundamentals and adjust it to GME s price per share just for fun Company Market Cap On July 9 2021 GME s Share Price Equivalent Best Buy BBY 28 billion 373 Chewy CHWY 36 billion 478 Target TGT 123 billion 1 653 Walmart WMT 393 billion 5 286 Tesla TSLA 633 billion 8 509 Amazon AMZN 1 88 trillion 25 276 amp x200B Conclusions I believe GME has significant upside potential due to a possible short squeeze or even a MOASS This can be triggered in multiple ways such as a blockchain dividend spike in buying pressure from positive catalysts FTD cycles market crash regulatory enforcement etc or simply fundamentals driven I believe GME is a better stock to own in a market crash compared to any other stock I could find due to its extreme negative beta indicating a possible strong hedge It s almost like a levered short on the over valued over leveraged fragile market without paying borrowing fees or put option premiums on SPY I believe GME is a good long term value play due to complete overhaul of the board and management healthy balance sheet and innovation initiatives If GameStop reaches Chewy s market cap under Ryan Cohen s leadership it would be worth nearly 500 per share If GameStop can capture even 5 of Amazon s market share it would be worth over 1 200 per share Therefore at its current price 190 it s still a good investment worse case scenario you beat the S amp P 500 over a couple of years

dispatch com amp 7935234002 twitter impression true Now let s look at why ROOT is a high value buyout target by one of the big boys PROGRESSIVE or GEICO who have yet to aquire an insurtech company Looking at most recent PROGRESSIVE earnings call transcript from May you will notice some clues from CEO and CFO commentary along with ROOTS recent new executive hires Links below for both new hires and transcript But here s the synopsis Let s start with ROOT s recent new executive hires Anirban Kundu joins Root as Chief Technology Officer effective June 21st Kundu joins Root most recently from Postmates where he was the SVP of Engineering leading up to Uber s acquisition of the company Michele Streitmatter joins Root as Chief People and Organizational Effectiveness Officer most recently from her role as Chief Transformation Officer at Greenway Health Effective June 28th Soooo executive level hires with experience in integrating IT pre post merger and employee transformation https www globenewswire com news release 2021 06 07 2242785 0 en Root Inc Bolsters Leadership Team with New Hires html Now for Earnings call summary Both GEICO and PROGRESSIVE are and have been testing with telematics but either have a small amount of states licensed to use that as a variable in their cost models and or too small of a sample size of actual data to feed their predictive cost models ROOT is currently operating using telematics as their main cost variable in a market leading number of states along with market leading number of miles driven for use in telematics which means the more states and more miles the more accurate the predictive rate models This equates to lower rates resulting with more good customers and less risky costly customers leading to a better profit loss ratio This market transformation to telematics is already underway and gaining market share hence the urgency to acquire insurtech In the PROGRESSIVE earnings call their are a couple questions from Morgan Stanley Analyst about the use of telematics and how its gaining market share in certain states Now it s important to note that both these big boys are using telematics but it s just too little too late as the market is moving faster than anticipated and let s be honest the gecko and flo may have brand recognition but they are most definitely not tech companies In order to maintain or even protect current market share they must adapt A few quotes from CEO and CFO from PROGRESSIVE earnings call in May responding to Morgan Stanley Analyst questions about telematics I think we ve had 150 000 customers that are currently that we currently have access to claims information should they have a loss And we ll have more to come on that We ve been working on that for a while but we think it is an important next step for the use in our Telematics But you know we ve been on the UBI Usage Based Insurance bandwagon for a couple of decades we ll continue to do so we do so on both the personal auto and commercial a lot of side we are really happy with our Smart Haul results very successful And the program is very profitable on the commercial auto side because that s a big expense for truckers but I mean all of those things are on our agenda and we continue to invest a lot in this area I ve always been competitive and we liked it I think it makes us better it makes sure that you don t just rest on your laurels So we will react to whatever we need to react and continue to invest with respect to GEICO IMPORTANT ROOT IS A TECH COMPANY DISGUISED AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY They use telematics aka behavioral data from smartphone app to power their UBI technology This is exactly the area that PROGRESSIVE just said they will be investing alot in this area to compete with GEICO

been an absolute winner in the Chinese ADR Stonk market What s happened since then Why has TAL taken a massive fucking dump you ask Well Winnie the Pooh or Daddy Xi as we Chinese like to address him has led a personal vendetta against the after school tuition industry He believes that students are being forced to work too hard amidst the insanely competitive society in China While Daddy Xi isn t exactly wrong how else are we Chinese folks supposed to live up to the stereotypes I believe that the expectations of the new set of regulations yet to be confirmed are going to be much much worse than the reality that we shall be presented with There has been doomsday talks of delisting banning of weekend lessons 70 of revenues or even outright banning of privately run tuition centers Whilst I won t rule any of these possibilities out entire I believe the odds of them happening are very low if history is a guide What history you may ask Well one only has to look at China s smaller and more fashionable neighbour South Korea Tuition participation rates in S K are even higher than that of China historically and the government tried an outright ban of the industry in the late 90s Guess what happened after Tuition went UNDERGROUND The moral of the story is that there is that banning additional Education for Asians is like Prohibition for you Yankees It ain t gonna work I expect a huge share price recovery easily 100 from here once the actual policies are announced There is also huge optionality for a company like TAL to pivot its business in the long run by leveraging on its substantial brand equity in China Some additional crayon analysis The stock has fallen from 90 dollars to a low of 17 5 per share last week On the day it hit 17 5 the stock was immediately bidded back up to 20 closing the day flat after opening down 10 This sure looks to me like whales are scooping the low TAL is up another 10 the day after It was revealed a day later that UBS the smarter and less retarded cousin of CreDiT SuiSsE Bill Hwang s prime broker took a 4 stake The low is in Get in on the train now

investment advice this is an opinion of a fellow ape The Situation Mr Schumer has just announced https www marijuanamoment net schumer to unveil federal marijuana legalization bill on wednesday that he will be releasing a draft of the bill for federal legalisation of marijuana in the USA TOMORROW This is the trigger we have all been waiting for I don t think enough of us apes understand the potential of the cannabis industry the power we have to shape it and most importantly how we can all profit off of it I ve been following cannabis companies since 2017 I ve seen the market rise and fall multiple times I believe we are due for another historic rise when this bill is introduced To condense the situation onto some napkin maths Canada currently has yearly cannabis sales of 3 2bn https www reddit com r TheCannalysts comments o6drw0 canadian recreational cannabis sales april 2021 and their population is a mere 38m The market is still rapidly expanding despite growing pains including a shortage of licensing for stores and competition from the illicit market Using Canada s figures and inflating them to America s population of 330m we can assume that the yearly market will be worth around 30bn If you go off simple metrics like price sales ratio which is averaged around 12 at the moment with an overall industry market capital of around 35bn and scale that up to yearly sales of 30bn then the combined market caps for cannabis companies would be worth well over 300bn That s just with a view of 30bn sales a year which is extremely pessimistic IMO estimates of the current legal market in the US are projected the reach 42bn by 2026 with an estimated 100bn illicit market still in existence https www forbes com sites willyakowicz 2021 03 03 us cannabis sales hit record 175 billion as americans consume more marijuana than ever before sh 4563ec2b2bcf That is a HUGE market to fill and compete in a 100bn a year industry with a price sales of 10 would value the market at 1tn Companies are only worth 1 10bn at the moment Now these are loose estimates on market caps it s hard to accurately estimate specific company market capital values in the situation of an emerging industry However regardless of how you estimate it pessimistic or optimistic the reality of the situation is that these cannabis companies are extremely undervalued in the face of an American market We are talking about significant multi bagger jumps in share prices once the market is established Who to pick My personal pick is TLRY they have established themselves well in Canada and have roots in many other countries including Germany and Portugal other potential legalization candidates they haven t overextended on their production facilities like the other LPs have and have a solid grip on their cash position something I believe to be essential for a growing company I m staying well clear of Aurora that stock is a dilution dumpster fire CGC is also a bad pick IMO however they could be saved by US legalization As for the MSOs they re going to win regardless of how legalization plays out These companies are already operating and expanding in the legalized states within America federal legalisation will only accelerate their growth These are the safe plays Green Thumb Industries and Cresco are my picks partly due to restrictions in exposure to OTC markets there are certainly other good ones out there Green Thumb amp Cresco have been able to maintain profitability in FY2020 despite rapid expansion and Green Thumb has even been able to push a positive cash flow from operations which is extremely rare this early in the game They don t have a stable overall cash position like TLRY however their rapid growth in revenue and tight control on operating expenses more than makes up for it I d be all in on MSOs if it wasn t for the assets and connections that TLRY has accumulated over the years You can see further analysis that I ve conducted on cannabis companies here https docs google com spreadsheets d 11ANheV6VxrEAyc6Rge LKjSDQAXFlu3a7xr1YQr6u80 edit usp sharing Where do you come in I don t want to get into politics and break the rules of this sub but I m confident that both Republicans and Democrats are in favour of legalisation we nearly had the SAFE act pass during a Republican government they re supposed to be anti legalization The only reason the bill died was due to a change in the house Now that the Democrats are the majority it s going to be even easier to get marijuana bills through especially when the leader of the house is in full support and driving the bill So where do you come in Every voice counts in this situation you can help guarantee the success of this bill by contacting your local representative if you live in the USA To quote from the first article linked He Schumer also urged voters to reach out to their congressional representatives and tell them that this is long overdue This sub has already proven time and time again the power and effect it can have on the markets it s time to flex that power again If you are a US citizen then get in contact with your local representative and tell them you demand change FIND YOUR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE https www house gov representatives find your representative Lets show our power and take this industry to the fucking mooooooon Disclaimer This is not investment

Tesla due to perceived security concerns with surveillance 2 Speaking of China there is some perceived concern around the State being too involved in the affairs of the companies that operate there Not long ago the CCP cracked down on Tech companies citing concerns with monopolistic control that keeps other companies from competing and concerns around price fixing for consumers While this sounds bad on the surface it is the same protectionist controls that occur in North American markets as well to protect consumers and companies Just look at the recent dragging in of Tech companies before the U S Congress and you ll know what I m talking about There are additional concerns around de listing Chinese companies from U S stock exchanges This is mostly focused on companies who have ties with the Chinese Military but remains a concern for investors beyond that Even so I think the concern specifically for Xpeng Motors has been alleviated due to their recent listing on the Hong Kong exchange While I don t believe XPEV US will become a de listed stock if it were those NasDaq shares are still held and tradable on the Hong Kong exchange as fungible between the two exchanges Therefore by having another exchange holding Xpeng the fear is lessened of being de listed which remember I believe is not something that will happen Since raising an additional 1 6Billion through the Hong Kong I P O the market has been grappling with the valuation of Xpeng and seems to be stabilized at the 40 share level across exchanges While that is where we are today that is soon going to change Read on for the why 3 One must acknowledge how Tesla makes its money and how it is not from selling cars but from the regulatory credits it gets from governments around the world in their push to reduce carbon emissions Since Tesla only sells electric vehicles they get these credits for free and can sell them at a huge profit to other auto manufacturers who can t meet environmental targets It s big for Tesla but what one cannot look away from is the fact that Tesla IS NOT profitable from selling its cars At least not yet Of special note is the fact that Xpeng is getting these same regulatory credits also 4 Now on to Chinese Car manufacturers and there are quite a few The big names are Buffet loved and held BYD Li Auto which is relatively new and NIO which has some similar roots to Xpeng Motors but is not the same for reasons mentioned soon All car companies mentioned here are true EV plays Xpeng Tesla and the race to autonomous driving 5 Autonomous Vehicles is truly the next play in this market and a necessary move for vehicles to go in Removing driver error is huge for safety and will save insurance companies a TON of money And in the AV space the race is truly between Tesla and Xpeng 6 Not long ago Musk charged Xpeng for stealing proprietary tech after a senior engineer left Tesla to join the Xpeng Team Same was said about a senior Apple engineer who left Apple s Car R amp D division and joined Xpeng as well Tesla sued the engineer and the linchpin was on the AV tech housed in Xpeng s XPILOT software Tesla argued that their own proprietary tech was in Xpeng software In the end both companies agreed to allow an independent tech arbitrator to view both company s AV source code and guess what it was proven that both Tesla and Xpeng have their own proprietary source codes that were designed by their own R amp D efforts and nothing was stolen or was being shared That was BIG News 7 Xpeng in the quest toward Phase 5 self driving cars liked the safety and accuracy that LiDar tech provides Musk on the other hand scoffed at LiDar for years calling it a fool s play However years later Musk is now conceding there is something to LiDar and may even be developing with it for it s own pursuits in the AV race But here is the rub Xpeng has it is using it and their software works very very well with all the various sensors combined Their new model the P5 was showcased at the Shanghai Auto Show complete with LiDar and that show gave Xpeng 10 000 pre orders on reveal day alone I can only imagine how that number has grown since and in October deliveries begin Speaking of Tesla again they have since become a bit of a laugh in saying that they will have Phase 5 full autonomous driving in 2021 Each upgrade is apparently two weeks away Yet Musk has recently conceded that full autonomy driving isn t as easy as he first thought and has proved to be a challenging endeavor For Tesla stock owners you must realize that value in the stock today is based on promises Musk has made If it doesn t come to fruition soon which I doubt it will without incorporating LiDar this is going to have an effect on the stock it just has to 8 Xpeng on the other hand has a new manufacturing facility set to go online in December of this year which will ramp up the ability to produce more cars In 2022 they also have plans for 2 3 new models one of which will be a new SUV type Even before the new SUV though Xpeng has updated its award winning G3 and is launching the G3i this month with deliveries to begin in September The G3i is a beautiful updated design and is garnering lots of attention in China and Norway https www automotiveworld com news releases xpeng launches g3i smart suv 9 Furthermore in the race toward full autonomous vehicle capabilities Xpeng is targeting 2025 as the year for this to be fully operational safe and complete They have logged thousands upon thousands of accident free XPILOT driver assisting kilometers with their cars doing a lot of the driving without needing help from the driver No sleeping behind the wheel yet but they are charting a significant course towards getting this done Tesla Well when was the last time you heard of an accident or life lost Probably not long ago so they still have a long ways to go I think and now Musk is backpeddling on his timelines for full AV capabilities If Musk pushes the update too early watch for more accident reports as the video sensory system just doesn t provide enough clarity to discern all objects as well as is needed at least in my opinion and based on what I ve seen https electrek co 2021 07 07 hacker tesla full self drivings vision depth perception neural net can see Only time will tell SCALE 10 Like China or not with the GREEN push throughout the world and everything drivable going electric there really is only ONE country that can help to meet the demand being created China They are a manufacturing powerhouse and Xpeng is ramping up to get the world and humanity the cars they need SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE 11 A big hope for Tesla is that they can sell the software for their cars to have the capabilities they can have You want software assisted driving That s going to cost you like 4 grand as an option It s smart if it works well Xpeng has a similar hope but is really successful already in this strategy They also deploy OTA upgrades on what seems to be a weekly basis almost which is exciting like when your phone gets an Over the Air update and new features That same excitement is happening with XPeng s car owners and it is translating into more sales And while we are on the topic of sales you can t help but notice that Xpeng was the first Chinese EV Car company to start selling vehicles in Europe in Norway and now plan to expand their distribution in more parts of Europe before the year is over and with the new infusion of cash is growing at a great rate to meet the demand In Conclusion Xpeng is an impressive company with huge goals for itself and they make technologically superior vehicles from many different angles Entertainment Drivability Safety Comfort etc I remember reading a quote of a comment that He Xiaopeng Xpeng CEO and Founder said to Musk and it went something like this We will destroy you in China and we will be an absolute nuisance to you in Europe and I think it won t be long if not already that He Xiaopeng lives up to his statement Xpeng is worth a serious look and currently has price targets north of 51USD with some saying 70USD That makes Xpeng Motors a great opportunity for investors looking for a company of purchasing value today Do your own research and I think you will come to see the true Tesla competitor if not successor Next XPEV Earnings Date XPEV is estimated to announce earnings between Aug 06 2021 and Aug 17 2021 the company has not announced a date yet and the estimate is based on historical earnings dates https marketchameleon com Overview XPEV Earnings

show some ID to get inside that place https youtu be p4NvOKy7GOU t 103 How right you are However in the event you blindly DoorDash your three squares all day every day each of the aforementioned entities Costco Sam s Club and BJ s Wholesale operate on the same business model That is they each sell memberships to consumers thereby providing access to wholesale priced merchandise I m here today to advocate why putting a portion of you hard earned dumpster dollars into BJ might get you some creamy returns amp x200B OK Ginger I m interested What can you tell me about BJs ignores joke Well if you haven t already guessed BJ s Wholesale Club Holdings Inc is a leading warehouse club that operates primarily on the east coast of the United States As of May 1 2021 BJ s operated 221 warehouse clubs and 151 gas stations in 17 states The vast majority of the company s sales are food people gotta eat and gas people gotta drive But they just like all their competitors sell just about everything from consumer staples to consumer discretionary electronics Importantly on the last earnings call BJ s announced https investors bjs com press releases press release details 2021 BJs Wholesale Club Expands its Footprint with Plans to Open Six New Clubs default aspx plans to expand and open an additional 6 locations by the end of the current fiscal year Also on the call BJ s enjoyed a 9 increase in membership fees income thanks to its growing shopper base and strong demand for higher tier membership plans The company is growing and expanding and likely will continue to do so in the coming years Without delving too much into the last 10Q fundamentals the stock sold off in May following earnings beats for the quarter ending March 31 2021 BJs received approx 3 78B in net sales and 86M in recurring membership fees for total quarterly revenue of 3 868B Comparatively speaking Q over Q that revenue number was UP over the quarter ending March 31 2020 which I find rather remarkable since the March 2020 quarter was when BJ s saw the insane surge in demand for stockpiling bulk item supplies in preparation of the coming lockdowns People gotta eat and people gotta drive Unsurprisingly the post earnings selloff gap has been filled which should be expected from a company that beats earnings and generates positive cash flow In short things are trending in the right direction But the next few quarters could have EPS misses as the company spends money on expansion amp x200B OK Ginger even when I have a dictionary and investopedia open I still can t read more than

and is approaching an ATH set in late January Even better is the ascending triangle The top resistance has formed at or about 48 75 and four consecutive lower lows have been bough up Daily avg vol has been decreasing which admittedly is not what I want to see but a breakout above the Jan 2021 ATH could spark a significant volume inflow and push price action convincingly into the 50s On top of the heady looking chart is a 9 3 short interest on a 135M common share float Not the highest short percentage but with an average daily volume of approx 1 35M shares it would take about 9 days at current volume for shorts to cover I m not advancing that this is major squeeze candidate but the taken in consideration with the technical setup a big ole fat 10 15 green daily candle could be in the very near future amp x200B But Ginger why should I buy this over Sam s Club COST WMT or TGT Well dummy Sam s Club isn t publicly traded COST has a 180B Market cap and trades at 10x BJ s current share price with a 35x forward PE TGT has a 122B market cap and trades at 250 share with a 20x forward PE WMT has a 390B market cap and trades at 140 share with a 22x forward PE BJ has a 6 5B market cap and

to its peers and current forward earnings ratio Ginger you are wise and sage like What should I buy to make sure I get the gawk gawk DHT 3000 Well dummies just like u fuzzyblankeet I don t give advice for free Although I haven t finished building my BJ position right now I m long January 2022 50 calls Based on the chart I ll add shares below 47 00 with a stop at about 45 00 which would slightly more than 2 below the last supportive close of 46 08 Today s CPI numbers didn t do much to tank the sector or this particular ticker so I m not sure how many opportunities there will be to buy a dip at that level given the supporting trend lines On average it s taken 11 trading days to get back to the top or resistance line and the longest trend upwards lasted 19 days before finding resistance On average it s takes about 8 trading days for BJs to pull back to the bottom of the channel support from the top or the resistance point The longest trend down lasted 15 days before finding support August 50 calls are risky today since the stock is about 3 above the current support and is starting to trend down back towards resistance If you are looking for instant gratification from your BJ position August 50 monthlies might be a buy around July 22 regardless of price or if BJs pulls back to 46 47 any time before then Damn Ginger what s the risk We ll you ll lose your money I d consider the technical setup to be lost after two or three consecutive closes below 45 00 I m not an expert with identifying Elliott Waves but it might be possible we re already trending down a Corrective Wave C However my brokerage identified Wave 2 closing on June 18 If anyone knows more about this and wants to kick the tires I d love to hear your analysis Fundamentally BJ does have some stiff competition COST WMT amp TGT are significant competitors Each have nationwide recognition The ability for BJs to earn market share won t be easy but it certainly can be done as evidenced by the company s ability to open 6 new stores this fiscal quarter Earnings are on Aug 18 ta ta for now

the stock at the jump see screenshot above showing an insane spike in volume is FUCKING HOLDING IT FOR THE BIG TENDIES COMING UP Please note the above bolded statement is my speculation and SPECULATION ONLY based on personal experience outlined below The only reason why I say that is because that s exactly what my situation is I ve poured all my money into it I can t buy anymore and I m just waiting for the deal to commence and for the oil to be made and delivered to Exxon There is no reason for the volume of this company to be so low other than they are doing a horrible job of marketing themselves This is literally a screaming opportunity before their productions starts and I hope I have informed you enough to make a decision Thanks for reading and I d be happy to clarify anything in the comments amp x200B T L D R GCEH is a company that makes bio fuel has a done deal with Exxon Mobil for millions of barrels of biofuel and no one knows about it Similar companies with no such deal have trade volume in millions There is a huge potential for growth

retards this is kinda long so you might wanna grab a juice box and a handful of crayons to munch on in case you need a snack amp x200B amp x200B I ve written about Himax HIMX before Other folks as well have posted some DD on them and I won t repeat it all here as there s a lot of info That said a little background One of their biggest revenue sources is from ICs for flat panel screens amp x200B They also make LCoS displays famously used in Google Glass a technology which also has the added benefit of being a main component in up and coming LiDAR systems for autonomous vehicles and they also look to be poised to take off with their flat panel tech for the automotive and trucking industry amp x200B Suffice to say they make stuff that makes your tech toys more fun amp x200B Lots of things in their favor but two that stand out are their negligible debt and the fact that the brothers Jordan and Biing Seng Wu secured fab time before COVID so they can make their goodies Hence they re gonna make money amp x200B Which leads me to amp x200B Dividend Yup they pay out a dividend Now that usually doesn t indicate rockets that will take us to the moon quickly but bear with me amp x200B They paid out their dividend yesterday based on their income from 2020 It came out to around 26 USA per share which yesterday July 12 2021 said shares closed at 15 39 USA each amp x200B Here is why this is relevant amp x200B amp x200B 26 is approximately 1 7 of 15 39 This gives us numbers we can work with Maffs is hard but I ve tried to write this in Apeish so everyone can read and enjoy amp x200B Now let s talk about the divvy for next year Let s assume HIMX pays out a divvy at 100 next year as they did this year Let s also assume they re on target for their second quarter projected estimate but let s go with the figure in the lowest possible range given so that s gonna be 54 Now let s also assume they have a shitty rest of the year and make absolutely no more money So the total amount made Quarter 1 2021 plus Quarter 2 2021 is approximately 92 amp x200B This is the absolute minimum they can make for the year 2021 as of this writing and for the sake of our little exercise it s also gonna be the maximum Let s project forward to dividend payout date in 2022 If the percentage remains the same 1 7 of the share value then the price per share on the dividend payout date in 2022 which is typically in late June early July calculated from a dividend payout of 92 per share would give us a share price of around 54 12 USA amp x200B Take a moment and let your smooth brain work on that one amp x200B 15 39 USA to 54 12 USA in about one year s time amp x200B An increase of approximately 352 amp x200B Now a share price less than 54 12 would mean our percentage goes up because remember 92 dividend payout is for the sake of this exercise both the minimum and a constant So let s say the share price stays completely flat and is 15 39 USA on Divvy Payout Day 2022 That would mean the percentage on the payout of 92 would be approximately 6 To reiterate if one were to purchase HIMX at 15 39 around now and the price never moves for a year in a year s time one would earn a minimum of 6 ROI with no downside it does not go tits up amp x200B amp x200B If the share price goes up our percentage return on the divvy goes down 92 being the constant but our shares are worth more AND we get a divvy payout Again no downside no tits up amp x200B As previously mentioned the head s of this joint secured fab time before COVID so they can make their goodies That means they re gonna make money for Quarters 3 and Quarters 4 of 2021 amp x200B Just for shits and giggles let s say they clear 78 combined for both Quarters 3 and 4 average of 39 USA per share for each quarter amp x200B amp x200B That puts our total profit for the year 2021 at 1 70 per share amp x200B amp x200B Again let s assume HIMX pays out a divvy at 100 next year as they did this year amp x200B If the dividend percentage remains the same 1 7 of the share value then the price per share on the dividend payout date in 2022 again which is typically in late June early July would be 100 USA amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B We haven t even begun to look at options yet If you re interested in options when they become available I d recommend looking at June July LEAPS buying calls or possibly selling puts amp x200B amp x200B Easiest thing to do right now is simply buy shares and hodl Get your divvy next year and if you want to sell do so and pay long term capital gains instead of short term amp x200B amp x200B TL DR amp x200B Maffs is hard so let s just say HIMX is gonna go to the moon and beyond and pay you a divvy while it does so Buy and hodl and get a bucket of tendies either in the form of 6 divvy or a stock price that moons a minimum of 100 probably much much more AND gives you a divvy amp x200B Buckets of tendies for everyone on Mars at the end of the rocket ride amp x200B

89,ojsuy0,t2_a12itxc7,1626222691,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ojsuy0/oscr_opinion/,1,OSCR Opinion,This is my personal investment thesis on Oscar Health OSCR I find going through this process helps me do DD and share with those that may enjoy reading it As a disclosure I am long Oscar Health with a nominal 175 shares The current price of Oscar positions the stock in oversold territory setting up favorable conditions for entry before trend reversal This is due to the likely intersection of negative market sentiment combined with the inevitable positive base metrics The current stock has lost 45 of its value since IPO in early March After a brief and unexplained 14 jump in one day OSCR has seen a 35 decrease over the past 5 weeks There has been no major news out of the company or other reported justification for such price variations This overall downtrend could likely be attributed to the earnings released 13 May 2021 of 0 98 share versus the analyst consensus of 0 53 Current RSI sits at just under 23 This downtrend may be short lived or overdone at best During that release their 10 Q reported key internal metrics that show a company moving in the right direction One toward growth and profitability First and foremost the largest cost incurred by OSCR is their reinsurance and claims paid This reinsurance is cost sharing with other insurance companies to assume risk These companies share in paying medical costs of clients but also share in a of premiums collected OSCR has capacity to reduce the cost and they are doing so Premiums paid to reinsurers decreased 29 yoy That is an important metric given that premiums earned increased 332 and claim expenses grew by 218 over the same period This results in an improved medical loss ratio of 6 7 Simply put more members are paying premiums and less members are claiming benefits the goal of a profitable insurance company As this is great news time will tell if these metrics will continue to improve on such a pace Most notably the medical loss ration must continue to improve That being said in 2020 prior to the IPO EPS was 3 36 compared to their most recently reported 0 98 So this does not appear to be an outlier Concerning trend reversal the stock has a high institutional ownership and moderate short ratio not float The volume of this stock is relatively low 700k while sitting in oversold territory Therefore it is subject to price fluctuation if there is a surge in volume Positive reporting numbers could provide that catalyst Although OSCR has recently disappointed with earnings per share their improvements in key metrics show a different picture This coupled with the a very high institutional ownership give me confidence that this entry point is favorable Plus I like the stock
