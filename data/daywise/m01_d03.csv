didn t write this Everything below has been copied and pasted from Chris Bloomstran https twitter com ChrisBloomstran status 1345155266468306944 s Twitter feed All I ve added are a few edits for brevity If you have a Twitter account definitely give him a follow 2 OP is a gay bear Full disclaimer I neither own puts nor am short Tesla although I m definitely considering it In fact if Tesla were cheaper I would almost definitely be long I m posting this because beneath all of the memes and shitposting I know that all of us want to make money Every little bit of information analysis helps even if we disagree with the end conclusion 3 Post is too long Ban This post isn t meant for you please move along I know it s wordy and there aren t any pictures but this is meant for those in this sub who enjoy a bit of reading research If you aren t interested in a bit of reading please scroll past 4 If you YOLO TSLA puts because of this post you deserve to lose your money A single prediction for the New Year Those unfamiliar with the Federal Reserve Board s Regulation T will hear lots about it during 2021 The rule limits the percentage of an investment in equity securities that can be borrowed with a margin loan A wake up call is scheduled It was widely reported this week that total margin debt reached a new high of 722B The WSJ s 12 28 lead Business and Finance story profiled a TSLA retail investor a civil engineer who had parlayed a 23k option investment in TSLA into a 2m position Oh boy The gentleman is to surely and genuinely be commended for the investment An 87x gain in a short period is extraordinary I ve never done that nor will I That said a quick perusal of TSLA twitter commentary and recommendations is terrifying One can read the Journal article Investors Double Down on Stocks Pushing Margin Debt to Record TSLA https www wsj com articles investors double down on stocks pushing margin debt to record 11609077600 and draw two conclusions One This must be extremely dangerous or two Surely I can get rich quick too Human nature being what it is For the latter the civil engineer offers this advice on his Twitter page If you have no Tesla call options you may want to do the math and consider using LEAPS as a way to accelerate your accumulation of Tesla stock 40X in 2020 Another 50X by 2025 Whoa A series of Q amp A tweets ensues thanks for the heads up RomanRubinstein https twitter com romanrubinstein lang en on which broker dealers offer the most margin the lowest interest rate on margin debt and how to borrow the most money and obtain the maximum leverage by purchasing call options Maintain margin value of 50 in my portfolio and the margin borrowing rides forever goes the advice Please consider the danger of heeding this advice The engineer should risk off and live a happy life A whole bunch of people are going to lose a whole bunch of money Reading through a series of tweets among the Tesla and others option crowd you see little if any mention of maintenance margin requirements FINRA requires investors strike that speculators to maintain equity of at least 25 of the value of an account Leverage kills Maintenance rates can be set above the minimum threshold The concept of posting shares in stocks like TSLA TWTR or any established company trading for 20x or 30x sales amp borrowing half of the value and then buying calls on the same shares posted as collateral is insanity The only math a speculator should be doing is knowing at what price against the shares in the account will new equity be required Most brokers don t wait around for a customer to come up with new cash or securities to deposit What do they do They sell down your shares to get to equity compliance More decline More forced selling Depending on maintenance margin thresholds you can lose it all in a hurry Red flags are abundant beyond simply the new record high in total margin and credit market debt outstanding You can see the bubble in the number of single contract call options outstanding in the number of new retail accounts being opened with margin and allowed option trading and even in the tone of surety by speculators regarding prospects for wildly expensive shares like Tesla I never thought I d again see the kind of mania like we saw in the late 1990 s but here we are Memories of what can and is likely to happen are long gone Even a number of professional investors have suspended price as a key determinant of value A respected and well known retired professional investor suggested on Twitter recently that I don t understand TSLA growth math or basic investment theory that stocks look forward not backward and that P E s are a function of exponential growth rates not industry The last time an investment pro came unglued was January 2000 at a newspaper roundtable The C I O PM for one of the largest amp oldest growth amp income funds at the time took exception to the notion that MSFT shareholders would lose money for the next 15 years which they did I d written 6 pages on the prediction in my 1 1 2000 letter on the website and discussed it at the roundtable My co panelist became unhinged because he and his firm had 5 of capital in MSFT which was then a 620B market cap on 20B in sales 31x sales amp 80x earnings You can apply the same logic to TSLA or to any number of dangerously overvalued fashionable disruptive growers today The Tesla bull proffering margined purchase of TSLA LEAPS expects a 1 000 share price this year 5 000 the next and 22 000 by 2025 Now a 22 000 stock price assuming no further dilution above today s 1 1B fully diluted shares outstanding gets you to a 24 trillion market value which must be reasonable given that the entire market value of the S amp P 500 today is only 31 trillion amp global GDP is 88T When your TAM the new eyeballs is 100 global auto market share robotaxi energy grid insurance and economic population of Mars no price is too high No argument that Tesla has made great strides in manufacturing efficiency and are now producing a more reliable product I also believe disruption of the auto industry will require an enormous amount of capital to grow and the established OEM s won t play dead You can t simply separate auto margins and capital requirements from nearly infinite profitability earned by selling software upgrades Shouldn t the upgrades be considered part of total vehicle cost To what extent did the Apples and Microsofts of the world thrive on a regular upgrade cycle much of which was and is planned How often are you compelled into a new iPhone or iPad Prior to the subscription model at what point did Microsoft not support an older operating system or Office suite Will EV buyers purchase a new car every 2 3 years How much of the world can afford a more expensive vehicle than the current global average car price Regardless of one s beliefs on business quality amp growth prospects paying a too high price can destroy future investment return neversell When price becomes ridiculous to the most optimistic business case you bettersell Price matters and the current environment is nuts The current folly for price not mattering or being justifiably high reminds me of a well known sell side report on Berkshire Hathaway in 1998 which assumed as undervalued both BRK s shares and its stock portfolio against an assumed reasonable 40x market multiple Berkshire s shares expensive would fall by half over the next 18 months to a February 2000 low It s become fashionable to explain investment process by saying price is the last consideration Too often lately price isn t even a consideration especially for holy growers While I did not have a short position on MSFT in 2000 I do have a very small recent short on Tesla today so take my comments w a grain of salt I did buy MSFT in 06 after it fell by 75 and owned it for a decade trimming when dear and adding to the position when cheap Short selling is very risky and those w sizable short positions on Tesla at the outset of 2020 would have suffered real damage given the 720 advance during the year I ve read that shorts lost 38B during 20 alone on their collective positions amp short interest is way down I happen to think the valuation is now so large to protect against a continued runaway price particularly now that u elonmusk secured its entry in the S amp P 500 by engineering 4 quarters of profits by cutting R amp D SG amp A and thanks to environmental credits courtesy GM amp FCA Still I d never employ a large short position given unlimited downside and a max return of 100 Margin is required against short positions What appears to be a growing army of retail option traders many employing sizable margin debt is a recipe for disaster Price and quality conscious investors get uncomfortable at times like these I am extremely uncomfortable I hope those that have no idea what they are doing heed growing and now very high risk and fully understand downside and what margin calls and maintenance margin mean Many many speculators will lose much and even all of their money at some point as this bubble breaks Now is the time to reduce risk You could feel badly for employees that were paid in non qualified stock options and kept their shares upon exercise in the late 1990 s When shares plummeted in the wake of the tech bubble the tax liability due on gain realized as income upon exercise was still due and payable despite shares that were way below the exercise price It was bad Many lost everything but weren t in a position to understand risk Borrowing against Tesla or any shares and buying call options presents serious deliberately assumed risk For perspective a 92 decline takes the shares back to where they started 2020 With margin it will take way less than a 92 decline to introduce wipeout Responding to a PM who claims that the TSLA price target of 1 200 total EV adoption of 20 and 5 market share in global auto manufacturing is reasonable Bloomstran had this to say You have EV adoption rising from 3 to 20 in five years a 6x increase 46 CAGR and Tesla market share at 25 2019 global new vehicle sales totaled 95m units and will be way lower this year Let s call 2020 a throwaway for the industry and hats off to TSLA https twitter com search q 24TSLA amp src cashtag click for growing From the 2019 base if we assume 4 market growth then new global units in 2025 would be 115m and at your expected 20 share Tesla would sell 29 million vehicles Is this your assumption Sounds aggressive given Tesla s 500k unit run rate for 2020 and 1 2 market share Now US new vehicle prices are 38k but significantly lower worldwide let s say 30k per vehicle sold globally The average Tesla looks to range from high 30k s for the Model 3 to 55k for the Model 3 Performance to 125k for the Model X Performance fully loaded What do you expect for an average selling price for Tesla in 2025 I d presume that as market share expands ASP s will have to fall to affordable I m trying to get to a revenue number Perhaps the governments of the world will be giving 2k per person 8k per family of 4 in annual perpetuity surely making new cars more affordable If Tesla sells 29m units in 2025 34 5k per unit that gets sales to 1 trillion a CAGR of 102 for five years Reasonable Moving on you have a 2025 EPS target of 24 share On how many shares shall we apply your expected per share figure Shares outstanding at 9 30 totaled 948m up from 905m at yearend 2019 An additional 5B in shares were sold recently to the public in at the market sales The sales were done with no roadshow risk disclosure or prospectus unless Goldman s report upgrading the shares from neutral to buy amp a new price target of 780 up from 455 issued days before the announced sale and Goldman s retention as selling agent as a prospectus If the shares were sold at an average of 600 share the share count would now be 8 3m shares higher so call the total 956m You have a price target of 1 200 for the shares so let s not forget to include in the count any option and RSU shares issued but not yet exercised Recall elonmusk https twitter com elonmusk was granted 20m option shares now 100m thanks to the split in 2018 by larryellison https twitter com larryellison and Elon s associates on the board Fully diluted shares total 1 113B right now and if the stock keeps rising we can assume all options will be exercised and outstanding So how many shares should we apply to your 24 EPS target If we assume zero further dilution realistic then using the 1 113B fully diluted shares including the recent 5b sale we get to 26 7B in net income On an even 1 trillion in revenues that s a 2 67 profit margin just a bit higher than the auto industry average of 3 and approaching MSFT s 30 One last missing piece of information which I haven t seen mentioned by the Tesla bulls or in your message to me is how much capital will be required to grow sales from 500k units to 29m over the next 5 years It looks like over the history of TSLA https twitter com search q 24TSLA amp src cashtag click the company has raised 26 5B in equity capital including the recent 5B and 16 5B in debt and preferred equity so a total of 43B Tesla has a cumulative loss of 5 7B so it hasn t produced a positive return on capital For its last 4 quarters GAAP profits totaled 5 56B which yields a 2 5 return on capital equity net of retained losses plus debt minus cash all adjusted for the recent 5B sale I fully understand companies can surely lose money or earn little profit as they scale With the recent sale of 5B Tesla now has 20B in cash Is this sufficient to finance its growth over the next 5 years as the company grows units by 102 per year Since I don t lean on brevity and given my lack of understanding of basic investment theory let s summarize the missing data points necessary to get the stock to your target of 1 200 per share 50 times your 2025 EPS target of 24 per share Needed 1 Tesla unit sales in 2025 2 Average selling price per unit 3 Any non auto related sales insurance robotaxi insurance energy sales 4 Shares outstanding 5 Total capital Additional paid in capital debt preferred equity cash At your 50x 24 EPS 1 200 price target TSLA https twitter com search q 24TSLA amp src cashtag click returns 11 2 pa from Thursday s 705 67 close I happen to think shares in BRK https twitter com search q 24BRK amp src cashtag click my largest holding are likely to compound at roughly that rate assuming a 10 ROE and a terminal price at 1 3x book value up from 1 2x today

increasing brand presence the internet appears to be a vast and difficult space to make a lasting impression on from a small business perspective Small businesses may have insufficient entries in Google Yahoo and other search engines where clients are likely to discover them This is significant for these businesses because if their information is inaccurate or missing it will turn away potential customers Yext a growing New York based company under the ticker YEXT provides a solution for modifying these entries and increasing the internet presence of small businesses YEXT shows promise as a growing long term stock due to its unique product line and hopeful financials In a sense Yext is like Google but for enterprises that require more depth than Google can provide for them and they actually use Google to help companies advertise and gain traction with consumer base using their APIs that are integrated with consumer platforms The advertising industry is huge as we ve seen Google Facebook and Snapchat dominate simply off reaching consumers and collecting their data Yext bridges the gap between businesses and unstructured data of potential consumers and existing consumers setting them up in a multi billion dollar industry expected to continually increase for the future Their main product line includes Answers a search engine Listings an advertising tool to get your company s products onto multiple platforms Pages a tool that helps get your business at the top of every location search Reviews which helps you engage with customer feedback and Knowledge Graph Analytics which helps business owners see their customer interactions with their webpages and other online presence Websites used to be everything for a business but now a business requires presence across multiple platforms and integration with every search engine map or social media The more a business online presence is spread the more analytics you need too and Yext is the amalgamation of the entire business internet presence This cloud based software is easy to use and it s used by several reputable companies including huge fast food chains travel companies car manufacturers and even banks Yext solves the problem of particular consumer questions and connects the respective business with precisely what the consumer was looking for Specific questions such as wealth advisor near me who specializes in healthcare an example they used in their past annual report will become increasingly easier to answer with the newest developments in Artificial Intelligence The control of the ever changing facts of a business are what enable it to spread its sales Up to date and relevant information on every nook and cranny of the web has become a necessity as convenience has become the most necessary commodity Poor site experience is a huge detractor for the large majority of shoppers and if businesses are able to retain this potential loss in customers they d be willing to pay anything Managing an online presence using one dashboard is going to be a very desirable service for all businesses regardless of size Yext links all the chains together in the cloud for Google Assistant Alexa Siri and even the Chinese WeChat all services which are improving more and more in terms of their search capabilities and they re growing in popularity amp x200B The product or service a company provides is the most crucial aspect of a company s success and YEXT seems to deliver on its product The solution requires a subscription that can be priced according to a business specific needs YEXT does not seem to have as many recognizable competitors Its main competitors Birdeye and Chatmeter are both private companies with no real news about an IPO anytime soon while YEXT has been public on the NYSE for three years From this perspective YEXT maintains an advantage over its competitors due to it being more recognizable and financially stronger due to its valuation reaching over a billion after going public However a reported issue with the product is that listings may go back to normal after a contract with a small business terminates This is justifiable because a small business could use the service for a month and reap all benefits To improve this aspect of the solution that is controversial maybe a potential solution could be negotiating a minimum period the contract has to be active in order for listings not to revert when it is terminated Despite this drawback Yext Inc has innovated in this niche field and is emerging as a frontrunner in back end listing modification Now that we have established that YEXT will likely be a frontrunner in structuring advertising data we need to establish WHY this is a growing industry as YEXT is heavily dependent on the growth of eCommerce and other forms of online and in person business Without businesses Yext will have no source of revenue so the expansion of commerce is critical to Yext s revenue Fortunately eCommerce and small businesses are trending upwards indicating a healthy future for YEXT One way to examine if this industry is growing is to analyze advertisement spending as more online businesses directly correlates to more money spent on advertising The graph below regarding digital advertising spending clearly illustrates that online business is growing with advertisement spending nearly doubling over the six years amp x200B https preview redd it plzhvnh7w1961 png width 700 amp format png amp auto webp amp s d7bc511f13b8c4b13206acfc3015bfe9d5303176 Another way to gauge the health of the industry YEXT is heavily dependent on is to take a look at the growing amount of transactions online Transactions correlate to greater revenue generated via the internet and thus a greater need for YEXT to introduce smaller businesses to this growing market The chart below from Statista portrays the growth of Mobile POS payments and Digital commerce over seven years almost tripling in total volume amp x200B Processing img jydysim9w1961 Once again this looks promising for YEXT as their clients are primarily located in this sect of online business due to accurate data going hand in hand with more online sales Furthermore YEXT will be a solid pick for investors in the long term due to its growth along with a growing industry and its solid product If you are interested in delving deeper into why eCommerce and online payments are growing be sure to check out the Paypal Square DD as well On their last 10k Yext reported the following for their most recent compiled income statement amp x200B https preview redd it f8renwobw1961 png width 700 amp format png amp auto webp amp s d66290b3c437c25c5798b9130d55f3fdbbd25470 As you can see for the top line there are plenty of positive signs Revenue has grown by over 50M yearly from 2016 to 2019 and from 2019 to 2020 revenues grew by about 70M So the indicator when it comes to sales is overwhelmingly signaling that this company is well positioned to grow especially in the near future Gross profit margins are also great as the cost of the product itself isn t much The potential issues in the income statement show up as you go toward the bottom line Operating expenses far outweigh gross profits so net profits are 30 despite gross profit margins being 75 Breaking down Opex you can see that about of them go towards sales and marketing which isn t necessarily a bad thing as distributing your product can be a huge future investment but it can be concerning for investors who want a product that sells itself Despite this rather arbitrary requirement the sales growth justifies the spending as it s obviously working and eventually revenue should far outpace selling expenses In their 10k they state that their sales expenses primarily had to do with more wages and a higher headcount of employees As the company s operations grow they ll need more employees to run it in an aggressive growth stage Despite the constant revenue growth the stock price has been diluted due to more underwriting in 2019 It may take a while to recover from all the extra supply that was brought into the market but even if we see more financing in early stages I personally wouldn t be concerned as that s a normal course of action for younger companies A quick look at the financials indicates that YEXT is improving as a company over each year Due to their relatively high amounts of investment the EPS for the company has remained negative The EPS was also a lot worse in previous years However don t let this negative metric fool you as the EPS has been trending positive since the first quarter of 2020 This indicates significant improvement especially since the EPS hasn t been improving much prior to 2020 The increase of the EPS is also supported by the increase of change in working capital from 2M to 4M As for the rest of the cash flow statement the negative values are primarily caused by the expansion of operations This expansion of operations is indicated by the increasing total assets which means that YEXT grew their assets via larger operations Although the numbers may be negative temporarily the expansion of operations allows YEXT to generate more revenue from operations and hopefully turn the direction of cash flows around Constant reinvestment back into the company is a good sign as it indicates owner and shareholder confidence in the future prospect Finally delving into the 10Q provides reassuring prospects for the future health and growth of YEXT as a company Looking at the breakdown of individual risks YEXT looks to be relatively secure in the future The main risks of the company are internal and are not influenced by factors such as inflation and foreign currency fluctuations To some YEXT may appear risky due to its limited financial history and potential unprofitability due to it being relatively new However these risks will ultimately be insignificant as the expansion of operations will soon be recovered by profits if YEXT maintains its current scale of growth that it has achieved in 2020 In conclusion YEXT will be a good pickup for many investors because the enterprise solutions industry overall has done very well and Yext s solutions are definitely a foray into the future of artificial intelligence combined with traditional SaaS If you compare Yext to another company that has a similar premise Twilio you can see that Yext s price sales ratio is only 1 7th of Twilio s Of course Twilio is far more overvalued and has had better sales growth than Yext this past year but Yext isn t a slouch in sales growth either as we ve seen Plus they have far more potential than Twilio does as we ve seen with their relatively small market cap of 2B Both companies offer AI based enterprise solutions but Yext is just as good if not a better solution for the future as it has more applicability through a variety of businesses If you want to see similar growth to what we ve seen in company s such as Twilio but feel as if you ve missed the bus don t worry we ve got the pick for you Yext is still 25 off its 52 wk high and they are sure to surpass it with just one or two blowout positive ERs which will be in the books soon

this Company this is not investment advice its just a research dump invest carefully Overview Fluor is a Fortune 500 Engineering Procurement and Construction EPC company headquartered in Irving Texas Fluor corporation has approximately 45 000 employees worldwide The company operates in 6 segments Energy and Chemicals Mining and Industrial Infrastructure and Power Diversified Services and Other with one additional segment being reported as discontinued operations Fundamental Problems Fluor has multitude of issues that have threatened the very survival of the company These issues have caused the market cap to crater from 8 Billion in 2018 to 2 25 Billion The most critical problems are summarized below This is by no means a complete list For the sake of length I have omitted some of the less critical issues We must also note that there may also be other problems lurking as well Improper bidding cost overruns and restructuring have led Fluor to report a 1 5 Billion loss with approximately 300 Million in asset impairments There are 16 loss contracts that have been improperly negotiated and must be completed at zero margin Weakness in oil Demand has led Flours customers to reduce capex spending in the Energy amp Chemicals segment which comprises 40 of Fluor s revenue Fluor has had major accounting problems which have spawned a SEC amp DOJ investigation Liquidity Fluor has 2 Billion in cash 5 Billion in current assets and 7 2 Billion in total assets This compares to 3 5 Billion of current liabilities with total liabilities of 6 0 Billion I believe due to Fluor s strong cash position they have ample liquidity to meet all their near term obligations Furthermore while substantial I believe their debt is within reasonable ranges Fluor is selling an equipment rental business to allow them to Modestly reduce their leverage and raise more cash further improving liquidity How Fluor Is Addressing Their Problems While Fluor s issues are critical I believe that management is successfully addressing these problems Fluor s improper contract negotiation stems primarily from their Lump Sum contracts Essentially this mean that Fluor gets paid in a lump sum at the project completion This is problematic because it means Fluor must wait until completion of the project before being paid Additionally any cost overrun or delay is completely absorbed by Fluor In order to prevent anymore loss contracts from entering their backlog Fluor has stopped negotiating lump sum contracts opting for more traditional contract negotiation approach and thus protecting the future backlog from more loss contracts Despite a net loss of 1 5 Billion Fluor has generated operating cash flow of 219 Million with Free Cash Flow of 38 Million This operating cash flow will continue to give Fluor a buffer to complete their loss projects while even increasing their cash balance As Fluor finishes these projects their operating cash flow and free cash flow will continue to climb higher The weakness in revenue for Energy and Chemicals should also begin to slow as some EPC work for regular Maintenance is necessary to maintain oil and gas infrastructure Furthermore if emission standards become stricter this could spur demand as refineries increase CAPEX to upgrade their facilities Finally I expect the chemicals portion of this business to continue to drive adequate performance as we do not have any viable alternatives to Petro Chemicals yet On the accounting side Fluor has unfortunately discovered that there were problems with their Internal Financial Controls and revenue recognition These issues have been corrected but I think it is safe to assume that Fluor has significant liability with potential SEC amp DOJ lawsuits However despite this I believe the lawsuits while expensive likely will take years to resolve and considering Fluor s strong cash position they will most likely will be able to pay the fine Impact of Reasonable Adverse Development s on Fluor s business In order to establish Safety of principal we must consider a few possible adverse conditions that can arise and the impact on Fluor s business More loss contracts This would be a very poor outcome for Fluor but I believe that even with more loss contracts Fluor would still generate enough cash to meet all their obligations in a worst case scenario Management could also continue to sell more assets in order to raise more capital to fund the loss contracts Major Global Economic Recession This would be mostly bad for Fluor but its possible they could actually benefit from fiscal stimulus and projects designed to spur demand in the Economy They also have a backlog of projects so a major drop in revenue wouldn t immediately occur in a recession Rather they would have a little bit of time to figure out what to do Prolonged Depressed Oil Prices This is a pretty likely scenario thankfully Fluor has expertise in many different industries and can continue to drive growth in these areas While over exposed at the moment they are not solely dependent on Oil and Gas Major Growth Opportunities These ideas below are the most exciting and compelling reason to look at investing in Fluor Fluor s Mining amp Industrial segment constructs amp maintains mines globally As demand for precious metals increase due to a transition away from fossil fuels precious metals for batteries could take the place of Oil This includes lithium nickel and cobalt Fluor has prior experience with these materials Mining already comprises about 35 of their revenue and has been profitable and a major pillar of stability in Fluor s business Although Covid has Delayed some new contract awards in this segment Fluor s Energy amp Chemicals Business has built off shore wind farms carbon capture bio fuels and hydrogen infrastructure All infrastructure currently being looked at to mitigate or solve the climate change crisis This area will be competitive but Fluor does have its own IP it can bring to the table and compete with If there is a major jump in demand in the coming years Fluor is certainly capable of winning some construction work in these areas Some other miscellaneous things Fluor engages in is nuclear decommissioning managing the U S strategic oil reserve Building automobile amp Pharmaceutical factories and Data center construction And then there is the crown jewel NuScale a company planning on building the First small modular nuclear reactor SMR in the United States Fluor is the Majority investor in NuScale and is the exclusive EPC contractor for NuScale Recently the U S Nuclear Regulatory Commission certified NuScale s one of a kind design The U S Department of Energy has also awarded NuScale s first customer 1 3 Billion in cost sharing to build the first reactor Idaho Interestingly the United States International Development Finance Corp also lifted a ban for the financing of nuclear projects and has also signed a letter of intent to support NuScale This will likely be a 1 Billion dollar loan South Africa in order to build a NuScale SMR There are many other interested parties both inside and outside the U S including Canada Romania and the Czech Republic The applications of this technology are wide ranging Electricity production is a primary use however other uses include desalination for clean drinking water and using the excess heat produced by the reactor to create cheap carbon free hydrogen Basis for Investment In the near term I believe Fluor can successfully complete a turnaround restoring most of their business segments back to reasonable profitability In 2017 Fluor generated 318 Million in Free Cash Flow Assuming Fluor completes their restructuring and finishes the loss contracts I see no reason why Fluor cannot return to at least 250 million in annual free cash flow This FCF is 11 of Fluor s Total market cap and by itself presents a very attractive return for an investor Simultaneously Fluor s should be able to shift their construction focus away from oil and gas to new areas that are growing increasingly important The low barriers to entry are both a blessing and curse in this regard That brings me to NuScale which oddly seems as though it s being adopted by the U S government as some strange foreign policy play While it remains a longshot in my view the combination of the DOE grant and the potential DFC loan is 2 3 billion a big positive This is equivalent to the entire market cap of Fluor and shows the scale of the opportunity Furthermore Fluor currently has no competitors in this market so margins should be significantly higher I believe Fluor will complete a successful turnaround likely bringing the stock back to 4 Billion and restoring the dividend In the Long term the company could even hit new all time highs however I m not entirely confident on putting an exact figure on that just yet amp x200B TLDR Fluor is struggling construction company but I think the company can pull off a successful turnaround That coupled with expanding their existing non oil revenue and the NuScale wild card could send the stock from 16 to at least 30 and possibly beyond 80 its all time high since its a very compelling growth story amp x200B Also sorry if there s a lot of awkward phrasing or poor grammar I have a learning disability lol actually though amp x200B Sources amp

According to finviz com retail investors own 79 of PLTR s float shares available for trading suggesting that much of the price increase from 10 to over 30 in the past 3 months was driven by said class of investors It s unlikely that risk sensitive institutions would be heavily involved in such a feverish stock For example Palantir s market cap increased by more than 10 billion in a couple days after the announcement of a 44 million 3 year partnership with the FDA 44 million over 3 years is a rounding error relative to its annual revenue After hitting its 33 peak PLTR pulled back and consolidated at a 25 to 29 price range During this time people continue to be bullish for the stock with many believing that it ll soon break all time highs again Unfortunately at least in the short term everyone that wanted in was already in and the lack of new buying primed the stock for a sell off Another way to spot this is when r WallStreetBets starts being filled with bullish commentary for the stock On a few days in November and December the majority of the subreddit was talking about PLTR If you think about it users would only create a bullish post or upvote bullish posts of a stock if they already had a long position Once the buying pressure waned a small amount of selling compounded with other bearish factors discussed below were sufficient to trigger large waves of selling Options market makers selling hedged stocks for sold calls Options market makers are institutions contracted by an exchange to supply liquidity to the options market even when there s no willing external buyer or seller Market makers make money by buying or selling options to traders at slightly worse prices than the actual price and pocketing the difference As such they aren t interested in making a directional bet on a stock s price by being short or long options and whenever you sell or buy an option from them they need to hedge their position Specifically when a market maker sells a call option to a trader the market maker needs to hedge by buying the underlying stock When a market maker buys a call option from a trader the market maker shorts the underlying stock Vice versa for puts PLTR had a large number of open call positions expiring at year end As price fell most of these options expired worthless and the market makers that sold them had to unwind their hedges Because market makers buy the underlying stock to hedge against a sold call position they sell said stock when unwinding the hedge As large numbers of PLTR s call options expired worthless at year end options market makers sold the PLTR they bought as a hedge which contributed to the year end price decline Institutional funds rebalancing Even though retail investors own most of Palantir s tradeable shares institutions do own a non trivial amount 12 of the float according to finviz com that were mostly acquired during the IPO These institutions include Morgan Stanley BlackRock and Soros Fund Management Funds have a target ownership percentage for each portfolio stock and when its price increases or decreases dramatically in a short period the fund needs to rebalance by selling or buying said stock Rebalancing happens either at a fixed time period or when an imbalance threshold is crossed Because PLTR s price appreciated so rapidly in just a couple months it probably fell victim to year end institutional rebalancing Frontrunning profit taking in 2021 Because PLTR s price increased so rapidly in 2020 traders are expected to sell in 2021 to defer taxes for one year It s likely that some traders attempted to get ahead of this expectation by selling a few days before December 30th trades executed on and after this date settle in 2021 PLTR s price started to fall off a cliff on December 28th and it kept falling until the year s last trading day on December 31st As such the selling on the 28th and 29th is partially attributed to traders frontrunning new year profit taking while the selling on the 30th and 31st is new year profit taking Frontrunning the 2021 lock up period expiry Palantir s IPO was a direct listing meaning that it only made existing shares sellable on the market No new shares were created and sold This means that insiders founders employees and VCs own most of Palantir s shares During the IPO these insiders could only sell 20 of their holdings and the other 80 are locked up until after 2021 s first earnings report Unsurprisingly traders expect more selling than usual when these shares unlock since 80 is a lot of shares Long time PLTR holders will want to divest at least some of their holdings It s plausible that like new year profit taking traders are selling early to get ahead of the lock up period ending Price chart sell signals Technical analysis using price charts to determine when to buy or sell is controversial but still popularly used to predict short term price movements PLTR s chart displayed several sell signals ever since it peaked at 33 For one the chart has a giant double top with rejections at 33 and 31 on November 27th and December 8th respectively A double top is a very popular sell signal Bullish momentum and volume has also waned since the price peak with daily MACD a technical indicator becoming bearish on December 10th Falling momentum is no bueno for a stock driven by momentum You can find more of my stock market

strategy outlined within really resonated with me I spent my twenties as wandering acetic of sorts and I never imagined myself playing the stock market because it seemed like the kind of endeavor reserved for guys who snort blow off of hooker s tits in the back of lambos Value investing on the other hand seemed to really fit my persona I mean I m the kind of guy who will argue with the green grocer for hours just to get a 10 cent discount on some shriveled turnip so I figured I might actually have a knack for sniffing out bargains in the equity markets as well I became more and more eager to dip my toes into stocks so over the next few years I devoured every bit of literature I could find on the subject mostly focusing on the works of the greats like Warren Buffet and Ray Dalio etc I d already been investing in index funds for about 10 years or so but in July of 2020 I felt like I was finally ready to take the plunge so I registered for an account with Fidelity and after much consideration I loaded up what I believed to be a pretty well balanced portfolio that could potentially grow my trifling savings and supplement my paltry income as a freelance translator Fast forward to the present and I ve lost about 30 of my initial investment That s mostly on stonks mind you because my pee pee is much too small to bear the weight of leverage and options I have found that I possess an uncanny ability to buy the peaks and sell the dips I ve done it multiple times over with all manner of stocks I firmly seize the reigns when they soar to their lofty heights and then ride them down to their absolute troughs clinging in utter paralysis until queasiness overcomes me and I seek relief by clicking the sell button Truth be told I have also begun dabbling with some contracts here and there Though I always try to play it safe sticking to two months out ATM calls but somehow every time within moments of clicking the buy button the trend lines belligerently reverse as if to spite me At this point I am 0 for 10 with my options trades I have never made money Not One Single Time Allow me to recount one of my most agonizing trades My misstep involved a company by the name of Sportsman s Warehouse I noticed it was a major holding of Scion Asset Management hand picked by the OG autist himself Dr Michael Burry In mid October it was trading at about 13 share giving it a single digit P E ratio amidst peers with valuations nearly double that The company had reported impressive revenue growth the previous quarter but much of that income came from bubba wingnuts preemptively scooping up semi automatic weapons before Paw Biden got a chance to slap a ban on the AR 15 My thesis was that the share price was being punished unduly and that their diverse revenue streams would buoy the share price in due time I bought some 13 calls expiring on December 18 I watched over the next two months as the share price continued its jagged downward trajectory and my calls expired worthless Then what happened Well I m glad you asked because the very next trading day Sportsman s Warehouse announces that it will be acquired by Bass Pro and then as if to mock me the chart produced a handsome green fully engorged candlestick about 40 taller than my strike price On another occasion I followed a hot tip on WSB and bought ATM calls on Atlas Air Worldwide about a week before Congress requested that they to return 630 million dollars granted to them as part of the Payroll Support Program and the share price tanked I was also intrigued by BMC Holdings a home builder with an ingenious system of flat pack framing that saved contractors money in labor costs and disposal fees True to form I rode that one sideways for a few weeks eventually got bored and sold it to break even only to see it moon days later on news of acquisition by a larger rival Perhaps the most tragic blunder in my short stint as a trader concerns our beloved GME I first learned of the GME deep value proposition on this sub in July and I watched timidly from the sidelines until the share price was sufficiently elevated for my entry This was probably the closest thing I had ever done to a YOLO I bought 8 000 worth of shares in late September for 10 98 and held steadfast until October 8 by which time it had declined almost 20 At about 12 30 pm on that fateful day I decided to cut my losses to the sum of 1 600 cursing the name of the WSB autist who had led me into this ill conceived trade I could almost feel the sulci furrowing into my smooth brain as I made up my mind to click the sell button Henceforth I would think for myself Never again would I be led astray by stock tips from strangers on the internet be they the incoherent ravings of a WSB degenerate or the prudent advice of a WSJ sage I summoned up my reserves of discipline stood up and walked away from the trading desk Well I suppose we all know what happened about an hour and a half later GME achieved lift off propelled by news of the Microsoft partnership and I was left admiring its celestial flight from my decidedly terrestrial vantage point The other day I decided to do a little back testing thinking that it might provide some insight into what I have been doing wrong I plugged in all of the tickers from the portfolio I picked back on day 1 and I found that if I had simply diamond handed those bitches I would be up like over 100 within the past 6 months That first day of my foray into investing I had the good sense to buy stuff like NIO BILI AMD and BMCH and I had every intention of holding them forever but then I found this sub and decided to try some more advanced strategies Now I scan my watchlist and notice how every single ticker has just kept bouncing along higher and higher It seems so inconceivable that my account balance has followed the opposite trajectory How could this happen What went wrong I managed to lose money buying stocks in one of the biggest bull markets in history My timing was so impeccable I was somehow able to enter even stocks with tremendous upward momentum and exit just after a major correction I am a true prodigy at buying high and selling low It occurs to me as it must to all shitty traders that if I had simply taken a short position on all of those trades I would have actually tucked away a 30 gain Have I just been fooling myself into feigned bullishness all along Was I born to be a bear Processing img ru7m5v9hc5961 TL DR Value investing is for chumps Buy and hold actually works

who are new to investing If you think it s useless down vote it and I will delete it At the beginning of 2020 I was just like most of you was not a member of WSBs and invested on my own accord All that changed in February I opened an active trading account for fun I joined reddit and figured I should get involved with the community so that we make money together Here are the lessons that I think would help some of newer guys than me Also here is my performance in my speculative account which was opened in March 2020 amp x200B https preview redd it w762xt6805961 png width 890 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f227bc450c381543cb098dd12cfeb3f1f1a1aebd Lesson 1 Consistency Matters My goal with this speculative account was to try different strategies but get consistent returns nonetheless I aimed to not have any down months This helps alleviate the mental anguish caused by roller coaster type portfolios As my mama told me 5 years ago you are playing with hard earned money This is why I stayed away from YOLOing the whole account on few select plays I aimed to have many different bets going on at the same time Lesson 2 Helping others is harder than earning money My dad opened a speculation account at the same in March I decided that I would help him have a similar performance as mine I kept on feeding him info about my trades What did he do Most of the times he thought I was retarded and called the local hospital for me When Boeing dropped to 93 I was on the phone telling him this is free money I told him to by 30k but he just bought 10k I was buying American Airlines on the same day This story repeated many times over the last 9 month I think at the end he managed to scratch of 250 Now I have him on a conservative buy and hold strategy since he is not cut out to actively trade And by actively I mean 4 trades a week for him Lesson 3 Having a good broker is important If you haven t deleted Robinhood and gotten your self a proper broker after you hearing or experiencing bugs crashes service outages your data being sold then I don t know if I can convince you Other brokers will give you access to ADRs and allow you invest in some bigger European companies that are trading OTC here Lesson 4 Don t argue with people instead discuss ideas If you notice someone is arguing instead of discussing ideas with you then just ignore them For every seller of a stock there is a buyer There is no point in personally attacking people If you believe strongly that they are wrong then just inverse their trade Respect and thank them for sharing their trades with you even if you disagree with them Lesson 5 Media is a hype machine CNBC Bloomberg are all in the business of creating excitement and increasing their viewership They are not there to enhance your returns What gets people s attention is usually not a good investment Lesson 6 Reddit slaps you harder than a twisted tea I used to share ALL my DDs here Sharing is caring right apparently not There was no shortage of personal attacks being banned DDs being deleted My Karma even dropped to 1k in March I am permanently banned from r investing economics I got temporary banned here and two other investing subs So I post less DDs now and don t try to stop people from jumping from rooftops Lesson 7 Most popular posts users should not be blindly mimicked Most people including me already know this but I keep seeing it here I figured I should mention it since I have your attention When you see a trade that is getting a lot of attention ask yourself does this fit my strategy If not then don t do it What is strategy you ask oh boy Lesson 8 Don t let survivor bias fool you Everyday people on WSB are throwing millions of dollars on thousands of small bets The odds are some of them are gonna pay of So when you see some guy posting Gain porn of 1k turning to 100k overnight Remember that over night thousands of other people with similar bets lost it all So don t just follow people blindly Some of the most respected guys here are essentially doing the same thing by YOLOing all their money on one bet that unfolds over several month These guys last longer but essentially are playing few bets game When you roll the dice 5 times the odds of you getting 5 in a row is a lot There is a reason we don t hear from YungBillionaire anymore Please don t Yolo your whole account on GME Palantir and such Lesson 9 Moderation on reddit is skewing the information you see It s hard to be an unpaid moderator on reddit So more power to them I have to say u zjz is one of the best I ve seen When a post has to clear the personal point of view of 10 moderators on each sub you end up with what in the industry is known as committee results ie neutered and already priced in Usually 1 3 of my posts make it through the mod filter so I am posting less and less every day Sometimes I discuss a post with a mod and make it acceptable to him and then another one comes and bans me for 3 days for a DD with 90 upvote lol Lesson 10 When the tide goes out you realize who was swimming naked Popularized by WB he wasn t the one who came up with it When a correction happens and I guarantee you there will be a correction then you realize who was blindly chasing alpha without any risk management The correction may not come for a few years but there always is a correction pullback for some random reason So manage your risk Guh Lesson 11 unless you have insider info do not buy weekly or even monthly options LEAPs are risky as well but can be managed Most people here should not take the weekly or monthly option risk You need years of experience before doing so Lesson 12 Paper accounts don t count You need real money to be at risk so that you care and go through the emotions I never had a paper account and if you are using one in my opinion you are wasting your time Lesson 13 No one has a magic sauce Those who pretend to do are delusional There is no such thing as always do this and you will win Market changes and strategies that work now will not work in 2 month If a guru says buy x y and z and you will make money that s total BS Lesson 14 If you get money help yourself and your family You have the option Yoloing your money on weeklys buy coke or elevating your life Money truly brings happiness Only people who don t have it think that it does not and site a bs study Use your money to help your family at key points in their lives Help with their Mortgage down payment buy a car for the ones who really need them Use your money to work less and work out more Yolo in real life not on options Lesson 15 If you don t invest with conviction you won t get the results that matter You have to know why you are buying some stock and why you would sell it A lot of winning trades will go against you before they go green To hold those positions when deep in the red you gotta have conviction in your thesis amp x200B I am not going to edit this post because it will mess up it s format I am going to put a comment below with updates corrections Also do NOT message me personally I don t have a magic sauce

high coming in at 15 63 Compared to some of their competitors listed below the average for the industry is below 2 Said differently investors are paying a high premium for the rapid growth in revenue and the hope that the industry will explode someday The key questions are will the AI industry expand and how much of this market will be funneled into Palantir both commercially and from the government Their revenue is growing quickly Over the past year it has grown 21 27 and over the prior three years it has a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 14 83 Cash flow and net income are both negative but they are improving Their net income has increased by 20 over the past year and their free cash flow has increased by 64 41 Net profit margins are also still negative but increased 32 63 over the prior year One thing about their margins is that they definitely live a lavish life style at their workplace The food is free the equipment is expensive and the amenities are abundant having observed this they absolutely attract some of the best employees around A nice segway into the balance sheet is to talk about their accounts receivable A R Their ability to collect money consistently and accurately are impressive with only 5 million in A R for this year and only 2 million in A R last year Balance Sheet The company has a book value of 791 47 million and sells at a P B of 21 10 This is high for a traditional value or growth play but is not absurd for technology companies Their current and quick ratio are 2 78 and 2 65 respectively This is impressive for safety a rule of thumb I use is a current ratio above 1 5 and a quick ratio above 1 Anything over 2 ensures a high probability of survival during difficult times Also the company barely has any money tied up in restricted cash allowing them to allocate money to working capital more easily and preventing liquidity crises But it is not as rosy as it seems I will talk about the preferred securities shortly The company has 1 08 billion in short term cash and cash equivalents Their short term gt 1 year liabilities are 730 million and their total liabilities are 3 57 billion The D E ratio is impressive hovering around 39 The larger contractors usually have a D E ratio above 1 1 5 with the exception of Raytheon One thing that is not shown in the D E ratio is something I mentioned in a prior paragraph the preferred stock This is a problem because preferred shares act very similar to debt They currently have 2 13 billion in preferred shares outstanding and I am not sure how many of those are convertible If we add that to the debt their new D E ratio is over 2 putting it higher than most defense contractors Compensation Dilution Currently the company has 1 6 billion shares outstanding from their direct listing On top of that they have approximately 2 17 billion diluted shares Said differently if all options and convertible securities are activated that is the potential number of shares outstanding For any company this is an extreme amount of dilution and something Warren Buffet warns value investors about The engineers and executives are highly compensated through their 250 million stock option program as well as the preferred security holders Insider Selling One thing we never like to see is insider selling The CEO has sold 11 of his stake or 14 1 million shares for 135 million Cofounder Peter Thiel sold even more 365 million Nonetheless the CEO still has the majority of his holdings and will be issued more stock if the company reaches goals in the future This is something I am not too excited about but it is not a major red flag because it was a small amount and perhaps he just wanted some cash he has been working hard for 17 years awaiting this day Competitors When it comes to direct competitors contractors that specialize in AI it appears that Leidos Raytheon and FireEye stand out the most However looking at the defense contracting industry as a whole Lockheed Boeing General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman also present threats Interestingly there are arguments online that Palantir is extra risky because half of their revenue comes from US Government contracts but this is a common characteristic for many of the defense contractors that I listed above even Boeing Valuation I will base my valuation on them staying negative cash flow in the coming three years then netting X amount of cash flow for a few scenarios I can send you the excel document if you want I will summarize below My discount rate is 8 which is high but conservative and my growth rate is 7 which is also somewhat optimistic When it comes to cash flow I have estimated they will stay negative for three years then slowly work up to 100 million I will assign different values to their perpetual cash flow after 10 years below keeping the growth rate and discount rate the same Two major things can happen to mess up the calculations The growth rate could be higher or lower and the amount of cash flow could be higher or lower Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in 100 million annually 10 9 billion Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in 150 million annually 16 263 billion Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in 200 million annually 21 613 billion Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in 250 million annually 26 963 billion Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in 300 million annually 32 213 billion Slowly increasing cash flow and perpetually brining in 350 million annually 37 663 billion It s difficult to value a company that is in such an early stage based off cash flow We have no idea how much cash flow they will bring in how much the industry will grow or where interest rates will be Nonetheless doing this analysis is sobering and dampens expectations Other Topics Their recruiting and the quality of engineers and computer scientists are similar to that of Tesla People in the industry know this is a difficult company to work for Their interviewing process is unique and difficult usually encompassing a difficult task using their software i e here is a bunch of data find the terrorist using Gotham Another interesting thing to look at is a top down or macro approach to the industry Here are some interesting points 1 The US military budget is 689 6 billion and this will likely increase or stay the same in the future 2 AI accounted for 4 billion of this budget 3 Cyber security accounted for 9 85 billion 4 Palantir receives approximately half their revenue from government contracts which is 500 million Let s assume that the combined budget for AI and cybersecurity grows to 20 billion 5 billion higher than it is now in the future which I think is reasonable If Palantir is one of the leaders in this industry and accumulate 5 of that 20 billion budget that would be 1 billion from government contracts not including their fast growth in the commercial industry These numbers are conservative as I think the allocation for AI and cyber could be closer to 50 100 billion someday This is where the opportunity is and the commercial side is just icing on the cake If Palantir becomes the leader and the world trends more to cybersecurity and AI there is potential to make money Finally I would like to speak about my personal experience with the company I have used many intelligence tools but only two stand out to me Palantir is one of them and it is a cut above its peers The beauty capability and analysis tools are unmatched It is user friendly but I wouldn t say anyone on the street could stand up and use it I am not sure their plans but they could modify it and use it for so many applications in the business world This is something I hope they do Good luck you retards

gainz girls I ve had a lot of down time this week since I m cooped up in q tine with the vid Figured I d change it up and spend time to listen and read about people who actually made money in the markets instead of edging to EOY loss porn for 10 days straight I found a few different hedge fund daddies to keep me company during the alt reality of rona isolation These dudes weren t smooth brain they read books and wrote them too They made all their tendies in the pre dawn era before the internet but a lot of their concepts are the foundations of today s DD flair One of these hedge fund daddies is Peter Lynch the silver fox averaged 30 returns over 13 years as manager of Fidelity s Magellan Fund He frequently amp routinely states Stonks only go up and Buy the FKN DIP in pre internet era interviews and he s got a rager for the market advantages of individuals retail us idiots vs wall street chads citron warren buffet He actually walked away from Wall Street at relatively young age to spend more time with his family This decision can only be interpreted one way he made enough tendies to send his wife s boyfriend back to instructing PTON classes and preying on other men s wives For this the legacy of he Silver Fox must be immortalized he is legend Anyway Lynch is pretty famous for coining the characteristics traits of a ten bagger Since I ve got lots of time and there s no loss porn on the weekends I thought it would be an interesting idea to back test some of these ideas on WSB favorites amp active bag holders like RKT PLTR and TSLA 10 Traits of a Ten Bagger 1 Name is Dull or Ridiculous All tickers check Red RKT Sheesh dude calm down PLTR Fool of a took TSLA That socialist electrician 2 It does something dull All tickers check RKT Mortgage loan processing PLTR Data aggregation amp integration wut TSLA Sells cars 3 It Does something disagreeable All tickers check RKT Online loan processing is perceived as untrustworthy by institutions amp individuals PLTR Blah

24 7 PLTR 7 analysts have coverage with an avg PT of 15 TSLA Everyone talkin TSLA these days Irrelevant 5 It s depressing All 3 tickers check with some massaging of the interpretation RKT When I grew up home loan refinancing was a bad thing borne from necessity Exchanging equity for better loan terms prolongs payments and adds long term interest These improve affordability and increase in popularity with each recession PLTR Literally sells system solutions for crisis situations Think COVID Conflict Fraud TSLA The narrative sells because the climate crisis is the defining issue of our age 6 The industry isn t growing All 3 check with some massaging of the interpretation RKT Growth is not the same as appreciation The housing market continues to spike in part because of archaic housing amp city planning policies that prevent new supply from entering markets PLTR New data points amp software solutions continue to be introduced amp sold but PLTR is unique in it s integration amp aggregation capabilities Nobody else is selling this particular solution in fact PLTR views their biggest competition as a companies desire to internalize this solution TSLA EVs sales are in fact growing exponentially however the sales are pulling demand from the existing market share of the automobile industry not creating new market share Additionally modern transportation policy likely reduces the amount of new cars on the road as EVs are increasingly exposed as an edge case for addressing climate change Also ARK momma Wood has done a bunch of research re the pending used car bubble that will put further ownership equity pressure on loans dealers and individuals still buying used ICE cars The combined pressures of costs associated with personal vehicle ownership rapid asset

time better prepare buyers amp refinancers simplifies the process and reduces monthly expense Rock solid like my RKT in the mornings PLTR how many of you work at a fortune 500 not Wendy s that requires you to query data for routine reports How many logins do you have how many systems do you need to navigate Do you know how your co addresses this They pay managers who can t write sumif excel functions to piece together PowerPoints and workflow diagrams that communicate system enhancements to 100k soft devs and system architects who then Frankenstein together 10 paid SAAS solutions in 1 3 years PLTR comes in hot and ready like the domineos pizza pie delivery guy ready to feed amp seed the shmeat lovers PLTR works with what you got growers and showers to create a highly scalable 2 way data integration amp aggregation system in hours TSLA Battery amp self driving tech are the biggest niches at this point but don t sleep on those EV credits Wall street industry idiots are salty that TSLA can improve margins by selling polluter permission slips to allow polluters to pollute but co s love to pollute so those things print 8 Recurring Revenues All 3 check RKT Definition of Recurring occurring again periodically or repeatedly RKT reports a lot of money each quarter s earnings reports Don t me PLTR the business model is designed to scale billing in tandem with gains made from solution utility TSLA At this stage car sales are growing and we haven t hit an extended downturn in the cyclical environment Just wait till the FSD energy credits insurance ride hailing and grid energy revenues print infinitely and indefinitely Anticipate unrealized earnings amp receivables to pace with earnings growth 9 Insiders are buying RKT amp TSLA check RKT Daddy Dan Gilbert amp Juicy Jay Farner were loading up on shares lt 20 in August PLTR Mithril a Papa Thiel fund got clearance to buy an s ton of PLTR at some point last week Basically a buy back but we ll see more when the lock up period ends TSLA Denholym sold 43k shares at 400 per but Emperor Elon is diamond handing his market cap option tranches which counts IMO 10 Its buying back shares RKT amp PLTR check RKT Announced a completed 1B buyback on the last earnings call PLTR Momma Wood ARK has been adding 1m in shares each week but it basically just went public so too early for this TSLA Issuing new funds to improve cash

457,kptq63,t2_5exr7ic8,1609710012,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptq63/trading_reality_check/,1,Trading Reality Check,This comes to you from TheStreet 1 Predictions and Forecasts Are a Waste of Time In the many years I ve traded I ve heard an uncountable number of predictions and forecasts The vast majority have been wrong or so poorly timed as to be useless Wall Street loves predictions and forecasts because that is basically what they sell They convince customers that they can predict the future better than you can and therefore you should pay them for their guesses about the future The market situation in 2020 was one of the best examples ever of the futility of forecasting No one anticipated what happened a major pandemic the worst economy in a century a crazy political situation and the stock market flying higher despite the news Predictions and forecasts are interesting and can help us prepare for volatility ahead but it is the reaction to changing events that is the most important Moving to the sidelines as a downtrend emerges will protect you better than any prediction or forecast It is reacting decisively that works far better than predictions and forecasts Don t focus on anticipation and predictions Focus on vigilance and reaction 2 Compound Your Profits by Keeping Your Accounts as Close to Highs as Possible Nothing is more counterproductive than making up losses If you lose half of your money you must double it to just return to even If you are zealous at keeping your accounts near highs you will outperform over the longer term Long term buy and hold investing is often promoted because it allows you to compound your money and that it is what makes investors such as Warren Buffett so successful However you can also compound results when you keep your accounts at highs and continue to produce returns It is not necessary to hold a single stock and hope that it is the one that will make you rich You can engage in aggressive trading as you look for the best stocks and still benefit from the power of compounding by keeping your accounts near their highs Compounding fails to work when you suffer big drawdowns and losses This happens to both long term investors and short term traders that fail to protect their gains The key is to address it and not just sit there If you err on the side of not suffering large losses you will produce substantially better returns as you compound your capital gt Charts are often dismissed as voodoo by the same people confident in their ability to predict macroeconomic events 3 Profits Occur Sporadically The market is and always will be cyclical It goes through ups and downs of various magnitudes on an irregular basis Newer traders likely have a very unrealistic view of the bigger market picture The style of trading that is working right now will not last forever and if you do not appreciate that fact then your career in trading will be short lived Traders should be mindful of the 80 20 rule Most traders will typically produce 80 of their profits in 20 of the time The other 80 of the time they make little progress New traders that have immediate success will have a tough time dealing with this fact as the market shifts Many have been spoiled recently by a fantastic market and they will give back much of their profits and eventually give up in defeat because they are not prepared for the inevitable shifts the market will undergo The problem with the 80 20 rule is that we never know when that period of peak productivity will occur We must be constantly vigilant and ready to spring into action when favorable conditions occur When they do occur we have to ramp up our aggressiveness and profit while we can One trait effective traders share is the ability to be patient and do little for long periods and then move suddenly and decisively when the time is right Shifting from a patient state of mind to a more active one is not easy and becoming more cautious when conditions change is the key to holding onto gains 4 Use Charts Charts are often dismissed as voodoo by the same people who are confident of their ability to predict macroeconomic events but they miss the main point Charts are useful because they provide a framework for discipline There are millions of ways to use charts but at the heart of every method is cutting losses and letting profits run Don t think of charts as a way to predict the future Think of charts as a way to manage your existing trades The charts will help you when to buy and when to sell but they won t tell you what is going to happen in the future Charts are the best tool you have for developing the discipline you need to be a successful trader over the long haul 5 No Trading Approach Is Inherently Superior The best approach to the market is highly subjective Some people do very well with trend following and momentum Others do equally well with value plays and fundamentals What works best will depend on how you view the market and the methodology you use to protect capital and find new stocks to buy Work on developing a style that makes sense to you If it doesn t work as well as you d like keep modifying it The market is constantly changing which means what works best will shift all the time Just make sure you keep in mind the discussion about how profits tend to occur sporadically 6 Trade Incrementally and in Multiple Time Frames Most people think of the trading and investing process as being a single buy and then an eventual sale They decide that this is a good stock buy it and then sit there and hope that it works out well There is no strategy involved in this sort of market approach You lose your power to control the situation when you trade in this manner The better approach is to move incrementally Take an initial position and watch the action Perhaps your opinion of the stock was wrong or the market shifts You can then quickly escape the situation with little loss However if the stock continues to develop well then you can build the trade and become more aggressive As a good trade develops you can focus on navigating it in a variety of time frames Maybe keep a core position for weeks months or years while trading a portion as the inevitable ups and downs occur Some of the best long term buys also provide for great day trading If you have a good stock pick then why not trade it in multiples This strategic approach to trading and investing is key and I spend a great amount of time expanding on this topic 7 Trading Is Hard Which Is Why It Can Make You Rich If you read social media it is easy to develop the impression that thousands of people make a huge amount of money with a steady diet of great stock picks The reality is that trading is tough and that even the best traders have substantial losses along the way The very best traders are those that embrace the inevitable of poor trades and make them part of their process No matter how good you are at trading you will have losing streaks and be hit by tremendous bad luck at times It is the nature of the beast However it is because trading is so hard that it has the potential to reward you so greatly It is trite to say but it is true nothing good comes easy It may feel easy at times but long term market success is a daily slog that requires hard work and will often be disappointing Rather than be discouraged take heart because if it was easy you couldn t get rich doing it

Believe, According to Morningstar research in the middle of 2019 almost half of all US stocks were part of some passive index fund This number almost doubled since 2009 In the meantime active management is on a steady decline especially active managed funds Around the same time Dr Michael Burry compared index funds to CDOs Let s look into this case and try to draw something from it for our benefit 1 How come index funds are compared to CDOs if they only track industries or sectors of economy What we often miss is that the index fund instead of being a neutral observer is an active participant in the fundamentals of the companies that compose a particular index The fund does so by providing capital and influencing market value of a security this also opens a window of opportunities for the company behind the ticker to raise capital via bank loans or private investments What s so bad about this Well passive funds don t go through balance sheets there is no fair value assessment no analysis and no risk taking They just buy whatever company is big enough to make it into the index This company can then use provided capital to stay afloat or influence it s price by share buybacks dividends or simply pay huge bonuses to it s management Just like banks didn t care about subprime mortgages that were packed into CDOs index funds managers don t care about what exactly goes into their soup With the banks it was just greed and ignorance in case of index funds it s by design When there is a stable influx of new capital into passive funds zombie companies are dragged higher and higher WSB goddess Cathie Wood called this the greatest misallocation of funds in the history But why is so much cash flowing into index funds Is it a trend Is someone incentivized to promote them Well yes but the main reason is different boomer psychology and our friend the FED See boomers have massive capitals All those pension funds retiring firefighters trust babies capital heirs they all seek safety They don t try to get 500 returns YOY or lose it all They are very content with just beating inflation Throw few percents above inflation and they will be over the moon For a long time their favorite asset class were treasuries 2 What is happening to the bond market In 2016 US bond market was almost 40 trillion in value compared to less than 20 trillion for the domestic stock market Now I haven t seen yet the data about the size of US bond market of 2020 but everything points that it s ratio to stock market is deteriorating The US 10 year government bond yield fell from nearly 2 00 at the beginning of the year to an all time low of just 0 31 in early March That s what Rick Rule called return free risk since allocating capital into these treasuries almost guarantees you to lose money to inflation Processing img q6r2fhqfu6961 Look at what is happening in Europe The ECB which added 500 billion euros 606 billion to its pandemic bond buying program is set to own around 43 of Germany s sovereign bond market by the end of next year and around two fifths of Italian notes according to Bloomberg Intelligence That s up from around 30 and 25 respectively at the end of 2019 Trading volumes in bund futures have collapsed 62 since the ECB started buying bonds according to Axa while ranges the lifeblood of traders have nosedived across Europe In both the safest and riskiest nations this quarter s spread between the highest and lowest yields is the tightest it s been since at least the global financial crisis The FED is doing quite the same Buying bonds including corporate all over the place and lowering interest rates to the ground What s even more devastating for boomers is that there s no hope on the horizon the Fed promises to keep interest rates low for the next few years We are really heading towards Japan situation where the central bank is that fat ugly bully kid playing all by himself in the sandbox 3 Where to go if the bonds are not so hot This all causes big money to chase the next best thing What do people consider safe Real Estate And indeed it rose according to Knight Frank Global House price index US housing prices rose 7 from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020 But that s a lot of hustle for big money And that is hardly a passive income rather a career So the next best thing is index funds What can be better than tracking the whole US economy Never bet against America am I right Even if we stumble upon a market crash sending S amp P down the economy will recover it always does right The influx of cash into ETFs is basically a self fulfilling prophecy it drives prices up and those yearly returns get even more lucrative compared to sexy 0 31 provided by treasuries Processing img db73yu15u6961 Even worse is that actively managed funds and bank investments start to basically replicate index funds That is due to the risk reward factor if the funds outperform the market they get some good rep and few new customers but when they underperform the market they get absolutely obliterated Only few outsiders can risk picking deep value stocks or plays that are not common portfolio dwellers Or it takes someone with huge authority like Warren Buffett or Howard Marks 4 Bubbles everywhere Now at this point you might be on the edge of your seat banging your fist and thinking that this is nothing but a bubble and the boomers index funds and the Fed are to blame Well it is Hard truth is that fundamentals in the long run always kick in So called Buffett indicator total stocks market cap to GDP is almost at a record high And on top of that we have Dot com bubble 2 0 with crazy tech enthusiasm And a second real estate bubble too But I urge you to notice that bubbles are not all the same with the same outcome Well they all go burst but that s not the point There are bubbles that I would call General Market Heat situations when too much money goes into the market causing it to overheat Then some sort of event panic fear or rumor not necessary caused by declining fundamentals sends the market to downward spiral As an example panic of 1857 1929 1987 etc The better the fundamentals were and the least the government gets involved the faster it rebounds Those bubbles do nothing but attract more speculators and their only result is the number of bankruptcies Then there are bubbles that I would call Thematic Bubbles those are dedicated to some specific industry or a number of particular stocks that are expected to grow enormously Tulip Mania in Netherlands 1637 Railway Mania in UK 1840s Video Games Crash of 1983 Dot Com Bubble 2000 They all chased some particular novelty and all landed on their faces But doing so they provided huge capital to developing industries Dot Com Bubble gave us rapid growth of internet usage Video Games chase of the late 70s and early 80s gave us the golden age of arcade gaming and huge inventions in graphics and game tech Railway Mania left Britain with the largest system of railroads in the world And guess who is the biggest exporter of tulips and holds 49 of the global flower market Yep Netherlands to this day almost 400 years since the mania This did not in any way benefit the majority of investors who went down with the bubble But you can view this as a sacrifice of dumb and greedy people for the benefit of the progress I get a sense of pride in this noble cause as a member of WSB community Back to boomers and index funds By pouring money into index funds they provide capital both to disruptive industries and to zombie companies The good thing is that the tech gets the majority of it since it has the biggest share Just look at the SPY top 6 holdings Processing img ien160wku6961 It s genuinely good that companies like Tesla will get allocation of billions and billions which they frankly do not quite deserve at current fundamentals This will accelerate their growth The bad thing is that such allocations cement big tech monopolies damaging competition And it also provides liquidity to zombie companies big enough to make it into indexes Difference is that innovative companies use this cash to reinvest into future growth That s exactly why their P E ratios are so bad Zombies spend cash on buybacks and management bonuses Because of how all these companies are tied together in index funds and due to the nature of modern margin calls once any segment of the stock market falls there will be a massive dip Tech can drown any industry stocks with them and vice versa But the Tech will be able to cut investments R amp D and expansions and become profitable while zombies with a big debt will go bankrupt Either way it s investors who will bear the pain 5 What shall we draw from here 1 There are huge inflows into the stock market And the blame is not so much on the kids with RH as it is on the boomers and smart money chasing index funds 2 If you want to short any of the bubbles as a hedge do not short the most growing and volatile sectors and ETFs like QQQ because they benefit from the current market in a long run And also the premiums are huge due to IV Rather short slow and steady industries because they will get nuked just as much in case of a crash but the premiums you pay now will be much lower 3 Passive index funds investing makes price discovery and a search for deep value so much more challenging But not impossible Basically Peter Lynch s advise to look for companies with smaller institutional ownership still lives up today Does this mean that prices can t be good or go up under big index allocation Hell no But the chance to find a ten bagger declines As an anecdote look into our champion s GME institutional ownership on Jan 31 2020 it was 96 6 and declined to relatively low 66 7 by Sep 30 Exactly before it doubled in the next 3 months 4 Some bubbles provide needed capital to developing and hyped industries causing structural change Unfortunately it is paid by investors who rarely see any return 5 FED is to blame for everything as always 6 WSBers will lose money either way as always amp x200B TL DR The bond market is similar to boomers wives sexy in the 80s not so much today Constant intrusions by their relatives the FED into their relationships makes things even worse That sends boomers chasing young girls the stocks But their dongles aren t so active anymore so boomers prefer passive approach using a dating app index funds Unfortunately there are only so many hot girls among young ladies on the app This leads to ugly ones receiving attention and money from boomers which they otherwise wouldn t deserve Some of those ladies spend money wisely and will be good to go once the boomer dies out Others immediately waste it on shopping Now if a young man wants to find a truly beautiful lady with reasonable expectations he has a better chance searching outside of the boomer dating app Obligatory pictograph of a rocket for those of us who are not yet fully developed for an alphabet
