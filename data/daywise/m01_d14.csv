Overview Novavax Inc is an American vaccine development company headquartered in Gaithersburg Maryland US with additional facilities in Rockville Maryland and Uppsala Sweden Novavax NVAX is slightly behind Pfizer Moderna AZN JnJ in the COVID vaccine race but will likely end up with the most effective vaccine with the fewest side effects and will be the easiest to distribute as it only requires standard refrigeration 4 degrees Celsius Many people think that the 95 efficacy data from PFE MRNA means that we re in the clear but the data refers to 95 prevention of symptomatic disease and not 95 prevention of infection which is an important difference that has been largely overlooked Based on pre clinical and Phase 1 clinical data I think NVAX will be significantly better at not only preventing symptomatic disease but also better at preventing infection and transmission Importantly NVAX s COVID vaccine NVX CoV2327 is the only candidate that can be multiplexed with a flu vaccine resulting in a long term revenue stream beyond the initial wave of vaccinations providing a convenient option in the likely scenario that annual COVID boosters are recommended The mixed results of yesterday s AZN interim update create a buying opportunity for NVAX as AZN s vaccine candidate was a major competitor as the other low cost easily distributed vaccine for most of the world Another near term catalyst within the next 1 2 weeks is an interim update from the Phase 3 UK trial that began in September Buyout rumours are yet to be substantiated but NVAX is an attractive acquisition candidate with a market cap of only 6B Researchers Background Scientist for 5 years in vaccine R amp D at a major pharmaceutical company Currently a biomedical PhD candidate Bottom line I think NVAX is being overlooked due to the recent wave of vaccine news but will end up being the clear vaccine of choice for most of the world and will significantly outgrow its current 6B market cap I think short term catalysts Phase 3 interim updates potential buyout will drive the price higher in the next couple of weeks and the long term outlook global vaccine distribution annual flu COVID combo vaccine potential buyout This stock has a low float and one piece of positive news will send this back to 120 quite easily Science Behind the Vaccine One of the most important correlates of protection used to estimate vaccine efficacy is the number of antibodies the vaccine generates in the host also referred to as antibody titer high titer high levels of antibody NVAX has reported significantly higher antibody titers than any of the other candidates in phase 3 trials 6 fold higher than MRNA 10 8 fold higher than PFE and 10 5 fold higher than AZN see graph below source RA capital Small differences in antibody titers should not be overinterpreted however large differences are more likely to be meaningful and correspond with measurable differences in real world changes in immunity Based on the titer data reported to date we would expect NVAX to have the highest efficiency amp x200B https preview redd it g1477lkd97b61 png width 723 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 2494d136d99f9cc7f4a9294df336acc62b2e90ca More convincing support for NVAX comes from primate challenge studies in which rhesus macaques were given vaccine or placebo and then exposed to the virus Monkeys vaccinated with NVX CoV2327 had zero evidence of viral replication in either the upper or lower airway whereas monkeys vaccinated with MRNA s vaccine the most effective vaccine reported to date had evidence of viral replication in both the upper and lower airways see graphs below top graph is NVAX bottom graph is MRNA https preview redd it xvwbsjxl97b61 png width 1234 amp format png amp

data is significant for reasons that require a bit of explanation First it s important to understand that protection in the upper airway i e nose throat from COVID infection is more challenging to achieve than in the lower airway i e the lungs with intramuscular injected vaccines This matters because a vaccine that only protects the lungs without also protecting the upper airway will likely prevent severe disease in the lungs but may not prevent viral infection In other words it might prevent a person from getting really sick but it won t prevent them from transmitting the disease to others Based on Moderna s challenge data shown above their vaccine seems to fit the profile of mostly preventing infection in the lungs combined with a lesser degree of protection in the upper airway at least in rhesus macaques Now you might say who cares about a primate challenge study if we have real world clinical trial data in humans that says the vaccine is 94 5 effective The reason I care is because all of the interim numbers that have been reported to date refer to the efficacy of preventing symptomatic cases only and not of preventing infection This is a huge deal and is almost certainly not the way that the public has interpreted the headlines to date UPDATE this exact point was addressed by Moderna s CMO this morning 24 11 2020 If we assume that the non human primate challenge data presented above is representative of what will happen in humans then I think the efficacy numbers that are being thrown for around for Moderna and likely Pfizer AZN don t tell the full story and I suspect that the sentiment about the efficacy of these vaccines will change over time Again you might ask who cares this level of efficacy still sounds really good and I completely agree that it is impressive for first generation vaccines made in under a year These vaccines will be important for rapid immunization of high risk groups and I would gladly take one knowing everything I know now if I was high risk However I expect that this overlooked issue of disease prevention versus infection prevention for the PFE MRNA AZN vaccine candidates will start getting more airtime on major news outlets Even if it does not the infection data rather than just the symptomatic disease data will eventually be released as a secondary endpoint for these trials at some point in the next couple of months Unlike Moderna s challenge study NVAX provided complete protection in both the upper and lower airway despite using a higher viral challenge dose This fits with the superior antibody titer data and leads me to believe that there is a high probability that NVAX will not only have a higher rate of reduction in symptomatic cases but may also provide sterilizing immunity in a large subset of patients therefore not only preventing disease but also preventing transmission in a subset of patients If the challenge data ends up translating in humans and I think it will then NVAX will end up having a significantly superior vaccine to the others currently in Phase 3 trials The potential for NVX CoV2327 to also prevent infection instead of only preventing symptomatic disease is a big deal and is why I think NVAX is going to become the vaccine of choice even though they are a bit behind their competitors on the time scale Who cares if NVAX ends up with a more effective vaccine if the others will be available first NVAX will probably miss part of the first wave of vaccinations for front line workers and high risk individuals if the current timelines hold but this is a small group of people However I anticipate we ll get an interim update from NVAX s Phase 3 UK trial in the next couple of weeks and for all the reasons outlined above it will be clear that NVAX has the best vaccine well BEFORE the majority of people have been vaccinated NVAX is targeting having 100M doses ready by the end of 2020 and will be producing hundreds of millions of doses per quarter beginning 1Q 2021 reaching an annual run rate of 1 billion doses per year by the end of 2021 NVAX has an agreement in place from the UK to purchase 60M doses and an agreement with Canada to supply up to 76M doses NVAX has an exclusive licensing agreement to produce 1B doses for India and other countries in the developing world and has a partnership with Takeda to produce 250M doses per year for Japan As a result I anticipate that NVAX will also have the supply to be able to capture a significant portion of mass vaccination efforts There is a high probability that annual COVID booster shots will be recommended for most people for the foreseeable future and if so NVAX stands to benefit the most Due to the novelty and severity of COVID 19 I think it is highly likely that periodic if not annual boosters of a COVID vaccine will be recommended for most people especially those in high risk groups There are several reasons that NVAX will be the primary beneficiary in this scenario I ll begin by explaining why it s unlikely that the current crop of competitors will be suitable for this application mRNA based vaccines Pfizer Moderna are very painful and I suspect that people vaccinated with them on the first round will be hesitant to get in line and take them again once other more traditional options are available They are also more expensive per dose and have additional cold chain logistical challenges Vector based vaccines like AZN JNJ cannot be re administered due to vector based immunity Your immune system develops a response against the vector itself leading to limited efficacy in subsequent doses NVX CoV2327 on the other hand has none of these downsides and is well suited for use in this context Furthermore NVX CoV2327 has the potential to be multiplexed with a flu vaccine into a single shot which is an extremely attractive option Flu vaccinations will probably become even more important in the future with COVID circulating and getting people to take one shot instead of two increases the probability of compliance NVAX makes a flu shot Nanoflu that reached all primary endpoints in a Phase 3 trial and is being submitted for accelerated FDA approval Nanoflu uses the same adjuvant as NVX CoV2327 so the potential for being able to multiplex the two vaccines is high The bottom line is that NVAX has the potential for a significant stream of recurring revenue from COVID booster shots that PFE MRNA AZN do not have A multiplexed flu shot would be the icing on the cake Conclusion The market is underappreciating the fact that interim vaccine data has shown 95 effectiveness of preventing symptomatic disease and not 95 effectiveness of preventing infection and therefore transmission In my opinion NVAX will be significantly better in this regard and be in high demand if when this distinction is made NVAX will not only be the most effective vaccine but will be the best COVID vaccine investment due to its high total addressable market favourable cost distribution and potential for recurring revenue in conjunction with only a 6B market cap Moderna has a 39B market cap Interim update of Phase 3 UK data represents a significant near term catalyst Potential for acquisition cannot be ignored Additional Notes The phase 3 trial in the UK began in September and the first interim update will be provided once a total of 66 cases have been observed Based on the daily case load observed in the UK since September the trial should hit the 66 case threshold very soon 1 2 weeks and we ll be getting an update that I think will lead to a huge pop With the subpar data from AZN released yesterday one of the other low cost easily shipped vaccines looks like much less of a threat and I am more comfortable holding December options while I wait for the interim update to happen TLDR US are pussies and cant take a vaccine shot because it hurts too much so this company is holding your dick while you get it The Stock is about to get PUMPED by the Gov already talks about it Contracts are already expensive EOY Price Target 200

Aug 20th 2021 160p Jan 21st 2022 Buy stocks during run up to 2021 Q1 Earnings Report sell at the top Zoom is of course a video conference platform which has seen significant growth over the past 10 months as a result of COVID 19 shutting down offices schools universities etc Due to Zoom offering a professional paid service which allows for Zoom calls between more than 3 people to last for longer than 40 minutes ZM has raked in massive amounts of money However Zoom s days are numbered and for a vast number of reasons Zoom s Circumstances Firstly COVID 19 The pandemic is THE only reason why Zoom is relevant in the first place Did much of anyone know what Zoom was this time last year It s use has only gotten so vast due to the fact that businesses churches theaters schools universities and all other kinds of sectors were forced to conduct business out of the office This growth can be easily demonstrated by their Year to Year comparison in revenue up 366 from this time in 2020 according to Google Finances information on ZM Second the vaccine According to Dr Anthony Fauci we should expect for our daily lives to become normal again by the end of 2021 and for herd immunity to begin to impact the COVID numbers by the end of the summer I am actually more bullish in my valuation as I was with the vaccine where I accurately predicted that we would have vaccines rolled out prior to 2021 despite Fauci himself saying we would have them by Q1 2021 I don t think that Fauci is wrong I believe that he is tempering our expectations He did not want to say that we would have a vaccine before 2021 because if there was a hiccup in the production of them he loses credibility to the public even more than he has because of Trump s rhetoric Therefore I predict that we will begin to see the effects of the vaccine by late May or early June with herd immunity coming into effect by September and no later than October Third the financials As previously stated Zoom has had a great run with through 2020 Y Y they increased their revenue by 366 However by Q4 of 2020 they already began to slip In July of 2020 Q2 they had a total of 748 million dollars cash on hand after they added 273 million from their revenue This is a SIGNIFICANT amount of money and is a huge bull flag However by October of 2020 Q3 they actually lost 2 75 Million dollars in their cash on hand Big whoop right Who cares They lost 2 75 million dollars in their COH and still have 730 Million COH This is actually a significant bear flag because the difference in COH added to their pockets from Q3 to Q4 was 104 They went from adding literally hundreds of millions of dollars to their pockets to losing some of it There are arguments you could make that says that this is not a bear flag and that this is actually a good thing they re reinvesting money into their company but given the rest of my DD I will prove it is bearish Zoom s Future Let s be real here do you expect to be using Zoom in a year from now Imagine turning on your phone and going in an app folder seeing Zoom this time next year and thinking to yourself why do I still have this before promptly deleting the app Do you see that as a realistic future I do There s no doubt that Zoom will still have SOME relevancy in a years time Video conferences were still occurring prior to the pandemic and will continue after the pandemic just not NEARLY to the same extent Businesses and universities will still hold onto Zoom Pro subscriptions in order to conduct business classes on days with weather too harsh to come in physically and some people may end up using Zoom as the de facto video calling service like Skype once was However the use of the service will largely halt by Q1 of 2022 and Zoom will be a memory for a majority of people Zoom hemorrhaging 2 million in Q3 of 2020 is just the tip of the iceberg For Q1 of 2021 I could see Zoom actually increasing in revenue once again especially since we have been observing a nasty spike in COVID 19 which has driven the few businesses that were operating in person back to work at home This could lead to a temporary jump in price once they report earnings for Q1 of 2021 however given the situation of the world such a spike in price is merely temporary and the only way to capitalize on that is to buy Zoom stock in the run up to their earnings and sell at the top in order to mitigate some of the loss that will be reflected in your puts at the time Their financials are slipping already the end of the pandemic is in sight and everyone on the planet craves human touch now more than ever before in history Zoom is not long for this earth The play I predict that Zoom s stock will begin to crash back down to pre pandemic levels around May or June eventually meeting resistance around 150 by no later than October The price will occasionally bump up during this crash as news reports of cases spike in X area or California reimposes the mask requirement but rest assured that Zoom WILL eventually crash down to slightly above where it was pre pandemic I would also argue that it s possible that Zoom could temporarily crash all the way down to below 100 but if it did it would likely only do so for a few hours before resistance begins to push it back up My plays I m going to buy into a 220 Put for August 20th and a 170 Put for January 21st 2022 Buy Zoom stock in the run up to their Q1 2021 earnings report expecting to see an increase in revenue for that quarter then sell at the top My recommendations If you are holding Zoom Stocks or calls SELL THEM They may go up temporarily but this is likely the highest Zoom s stock will average until Pandemic 2 electric boogaloo is released in 2120 So WSB is this gonna bring us to tendie town or is this a one way trip to my mother s basement You be the judge Edit Added a TLDR

tomorrow morning While I wouldn t define myself as a necessarily intelligent or competent investor I am very familiar with the platform and the re commerce industry I ve been selling people s used shit since high school in an attempt to finance a previous weed addiction Fast forward 4 years and I have still been selling people s used shit though now the funds are going toward monthly Model 3 payments I am underwater for That said I ve been selling used clothing and have completed a bit over 300k in gross sales through various re commerce platforms such as eBay Amazon FB Marketplace Mercari Grailed and Poshmark eBay is the most well established platform for used clothing sales and thus wins for market share but Poshmark wins in nearly every other category which I have broken down below amp x200B I am one of you https preview redd it 3l6d4lpma8b61 jpg width 2902 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 7bc0ba567e2ec842fa21cf90d14cef7135e721ca Before we get started it is important to understand what the hell POSH is and why it is a buy below 50 Poshmark is essentially eBay though marketed towards Millennials Gen XYZ etc and those who value convenience Poshmark is a leading social marketplace for new and secondhand style for women men kids home and more The social media aspect is a bit of a spectacle as no one really wants to socialize and add Poshmark Stories f their shit to get a sale but this method does succeed in retaining returning customers and rewarding sellers whoa re active on the platform Because of this the average time spent on poshmark is 27 minutes a day which is less than although comparable to that of social media sites like TikTok and Instagram rather than the likes of eBay Depop or Mercari The company also turned a profit of 20 9 last year which is bullish considering the amount of money they burn and COVID Selling fees Poshmark has ridiculous selling fees although it has proven to be beneficial in respect to revenue The platform makes money by charging a fee for every sale 20 per cent for items more than 15 and a flat fee of 2 95 for items under 15 that are less than that Products worth more than 500 must be sent to Poshmark for evaluation but the average order value is 33 20 is ridiculous especially considering that this does not include shipping costs of the seller buyer All the other platforms take a standard deviation around 10 which begs the question why the fuck do they charge so much People complain but continue to use the platform because of the next point shipping Shipping For the past few years the platform and its social media YouTube influences have been aggressively marketing towards stay at home mothers and teenage girls These aren t your typical streetwear wannabe EnTrePenUeR businessmen and Poshmark certainly knows that They supply USPS Priority Mail shipping labels for every single fucking order Have a 2oz necktie that would ship for 2 62 USPS first class Fuck that Poshmark send you a 7 11 Priority Mail label that will arrive to your buyers doorstep faster than Amazons COVID shit prime delayed delivery While a cost deterrent for lower value items and cheap buyers this system simplifies the selling process of needing to calculate shipping costs and having to deal with various mail carriers Packages rarely gets lost and any lost package issues are generally covered by Poshmark or the insure USPS provides through Priority Mail amp x200B Less shipping hassle more time for sellers do shit like this https preview redd it vrclcys678b61 jpg width 1484 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s d0ff2feb1be3c5af91ecf4024ab70918e4b0ca76 7 11 is cheaper than my Ebay rate for any priority mail so I also give this one to Poshmark as they seem to have worked something out with USPS For eBay if I can shove a pair of Jeans into a Flat Rate Envelope it will cost me 7 59 to ship Any heavier or larger clothing items cost me on average about 9 14 While this last part is speculation I do believe that Poshmark does get a kickback or receive some commission from every label The cost has risen about 2 in the past couple years which is a higher percentile than the USPS shipping rate increase Convenience Buyers love convenience and poshmark certainly does well in that regard Poshmark is a large SoCiAl MeDiA MarKetPace giving them access to a fuckload of your data When you sign up you can add the city you live in university job etc You also have the ability to like and share items Both of these combined allow the app to recognize who you are what what type of items you may be interested in buying My homepage looks the same as my closet at home shoving new items markdowns etc from brands I am much too familiar with A lot of purchases tend to be of impulse on the buyer which is good for sellers since Poshmark doesn t allow returns unless fake ruined not as described I have a handful of buyers asking me to return items every week because they don t like the color fit or price I tell them to fuck off and Poshmark gets to keep the commission For reference my return rate on eBay is about 7 for no reason I just sold this https www ikea com us en p tiphede rug flatwoven

of their presence online I think Poshmark does the best job engaging with their users They are constantly reposting buyers and sellers images on instagram making it somewhat of an incentive to use the platform and engage with others in the community I ve been posted a few times on their instagram page and story As a seller I ve also been invited out to drinks with some of the staff in SF Was all

fundamentals now Price movement Up to 39 dollars within the first two hours of trading Sharp dip to 30 dollars Consolidated a bullish pennant at 32 dollars Seems to be a strong floor at 31 dollars Up 5 intraday 17 as of 1031 GMT Price movement causes 9am to 12pm Enormous volume buying the stocks Total volume on 13 01 was 140mil total orders 1 through the whole day which is 20 times greater than the average 7mil daily volume Leads to very volatile price movements Large institutional buying Blackstone and Vanguard have massive positions in GME and likely bought more yesterday to force the short squeeze retail investors can t fund that volume of shares Market Makers got gamma squeezed massively During the entire run up in the first three hours all call options with a strike price below 39 became increasingly in the money which leads to a large increase in delta At the start of yesterday a 1 15 25 call had a delta of 0 3 0 4 by the end of the day the delta would be 1 This meant that the market makers would have to buy an additional 70 shares per call option they sold to keep themselves net neutral rather than net short This created a positive feedback loop during the first hours as more calls became in the money and market makers had to hedge more leading to a subsequent increase in price Likely some shorts covering their positions there wasn t the volume to mean that they fully covered their positions if they did try to cover their shorts in 3 hours it would have led to a far greater price movement 2 12PM to 12 20PM Likely that Markets makers switched to selling shares rather than buying shares to stop the gamma squeeze To stop the positive feedback loop of the gamma squeeze market makers switched to selling shares rather than buying more to force the price down and reduce the delta on as many calls as possible This can be seen by the large selling volume at the start of the dip Additional short pressure to stop an infinity squeeze There was an additional 48 million short volume yesterday 3 which would most likely be short term short positions from Melvin capital to push the price down and stop the price movement seen in the first 3 hours Profit taking Due to the large amount of retail investors in GME there would have been a large amount of profit taking once the euphoria of the initial pop wore off 12 30PM to 1pm Shorts maybe unwinding their 1 15 25 Put positions and covering their short positions while the price was stable Additional buying after the dip decreasing volume as time goes on 1Pm to close Price consolidating in the 31 to 35 range Day traders taking advantage of volatility in the price even though the movements during this time were small compared to the first 3 hours the share price was still jumping up and down 10 making it attractive for day traders Large buy and sell walls set at 31 and 34 dollars keeping the share price in this range General balance in buy and sell orders if shorts did cover any of their positions during this time it would have been a very small volume Conclusions and outlook Institutions and GME board are heavily invested in this stock with an increased cost basis after yesterday the large amount of buy orders in the 25 to 30 range creates a strong support that the stock is not likely to go through again The price movement was mainly caused by market makers hedging the large option flow not shorts covering Shorts used more of their fire power to keep the price down by opening additional short positions Melvin still have 22915 put contracts 4 open which they need to close or let expire worthless Given the small float of available shares at open on 13 1 27mil and the large short volume 75mil as of 12 01 it is unfeasible that shorts covered a significant amount of their position There is likely at least 60mil shares short outstanding that need to be covered This could take a week to fully unwind New short data will be available on 15 01 and the exact short volume will be known Up 17 intraday as of 1100GMT 14 01 this could either be short sellers creating pre market activity to cause a sell off or it could be the beginning of a second pop time will tell It doesn t appear that shorts have a path to profitability from here no reason why the price should not go up more This is going to moon so buy more shares https preview redd it 8a0icwdr5ab61 png width

fully covered their positions if they did try to cover their shorts in 3 hours it would have led to a far greater price movement 2 12PM to 12 20PM Likely that Markets makers switched to selling shares rather than buying shares to stop the gamma squeeze To stop the positive feedback loop of the gamma squeeze market makers switched to selling shares rather than buying more to force the price down and reduce the delta on as many calls as possible This can be seen by the large selling volume at the start of the dip Additional short pressure to stop an infinity squeeze There was an additional 48 million short volume yesterday 3 which would most likely be short term short positions from Melvin capital to push the price down and stop the price movement seen in the first 3 hours Profit taking Due to the large amount of retail investors in GME there would have been a large amount of profit taking once the euphoria of the initial pop wore off 12 30PM to 1pm Shorts maybe unwinding their 1 15 25 Put positions and covering their short positions while the price was stable Additional buying after the dip decreasing volume as time goes on 1Pm to close Price consolidating in the 31 to 35 range Day traders taking advantage of volatility in the price even though the movements during this time were small compared to the first 3 hours the share price was still jumping up and down 10 making it attractive for day traders Large buy and sell walls set at 31 and 34 dollars keeping the share price in this range General balance in buy and sell orders if shorts did cover any of their positions during this time it would have been a very small volume Conclusions and outlook Institutions and GME board are heavily invested in this stock with an increased cost basis after yesterday the large amount of buy orders in the 25 to 30 range creates a strong support that the stock is not likely to go through again The price movement was mainly caused by market makers hedging the large option flow not shorts covering Shorts used more of their fire power to keep the price down by opening additional short positions Melvin still have 22915 put contracts 4 open which they need to close or let expire worthless Given the small float of available shares at open on 13 1 27mil and the large short volume 75mil as of 12 01 it is unfeasible that shorts covered a significant amount of their position There is likely at least 60mil shares short outstanding that need to be covered This could take a week to fully unwind New short data will be available on 15 01 and the exact short volume will be known Up 17 intraday as of 1100GMT 14 01 this could either be short sellers creating pre market activity to cause a sell off or it could be the beginning of a second pop time will tell It doesn t appear that shorts have a path to profitability from here no reason why the price should not go up more This is going to moon so buy more shares https preview redd it 8a0icwdr5ab61 png width

Market News 01 14 , GameStop short squeeze is ON Alibaba continues to push into the EV world Intel spikes while AMD amp TSM suffer Let s talk about this and other stock market news Hello everyone and Good Morning So let s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market finishing mixed with the Nasdaq Composite https ibb co qybhmjC gaining 43 the SP500 https ibb co YL4XS6m also gaining 23 while the Dow Jones https ibb co YTFwLcx lost just 8 points to close out the day We also saw the VIX https ibb co 0r28dsT dropping almost 5 again continuing the downtrend after that huge spike with the Georgia elections as it sits at similar levels to the ones before Christmas Despite the positive gains for the broad stock market SP500 OVERALL https ibb co PrDh7DD we saw about 57 of the companies declining yesterday with most of them trading below average volumes as the number of companies trading above the 50 day moving average still sits over 70 which is pretty high Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 SECTORS https ibb co wJH4B8C finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1 while the laggards were Energy Industrials and Materials as we saw large cap growth companies finally OUTPERFORMED https ibb co kKtRY96 for once in 2021 with small amp mid caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year though Large Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3 compared to the next factor group in 2021 Here is the HEAT MAP https ibb co Ms0qkCh from yesterday which shows pretty mixed results as expected with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple Amazon Google Netflix and the rest of the bunch with Alibaba posting a 4 gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7 and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3 We also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US DEFICIT https ibb co QXXDBrc fell by 2B to 143B in December compared to the previous month but is up 10 fold from the 13B deficit from the same period in 2019 and this doesn t even include any of the 900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December while the December consumer price INDEX https ibb co n1Jr9G2 increased by 0 4 m m and Core CPI also increase by 0 1 coming in line with expectations as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations ROSE https ibb co t2v98jw to 2 2 in January compared to December though sales and profit margins compared to normal decreased since the last month while one of the FED s Vice Chairs RESTATED https ibb co WtNxQKM that the FED won t raise rates until the average long term inflation stands at 2 for a year Today https ibb co C79879d we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as 2T In some other stock market news we saw Intel https ibb co 9bHNxrx spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM AMD amp others but I think this is more of a hype move right now Intel has still fallen behind it s competition and it will take massive Capex and R amp D investments to catch up so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point especially for AMD We also saw Target https ibb co Phk4N4s reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4 3 increase in traffic and a massive 12 3 increase in the average ticket as comparable digital sales more than doubled We also saw their same day services post an impressive growth of almost 200 as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector as 95 of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of of the US population Also guys these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks with company after company issuing shares with the latest ones being Nano https ibb co qDRKJ7Y Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20 while Lemonade https ibb co 27StT0c has also increased their stock offering by another 300 000 shares While in another kind of news we saw GameStop https ibb co pLMSXrb soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57 after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90 at one point This has happened after GameStop has PUSHED https ibb co F3S2XTT for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e commerce and online marketing world with 3 veterans from Chewy which has been an impressive performer in the online e commerce business The STOCK https ibb co y8XVnd7 Is up another 20 in pre market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears We also saw Alibaba https ibb co vjKdwKW making a couple of headlines yesterday which helped push the stocks 4 higher after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba Baidu amp Tencent while also continuing their charge into the EV https ibb co 0tVsJSS world with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China s state owned SAIC Motor This is their latest push into the EV world as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng This news might help the stock see a recovery that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light And one last piece of NEWS https ibb co Z8RSWQL is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90 more than 80 above the IPO price as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading but unfortunately retail investors do not benefit from this as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price is under 10 while also risking a severe drop in the next days Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action which will benefit most of the people not just the big players who get in at much lower prices So let s hope for a good day in the markets as the WORLD https ibb co T8wRNxc Markets are in the green while the US FUTURES https ibb co LkrrWtc are also pointing to a good open Thank you

had some recent momentum but it s about to be the bigger turnaround story of 2021 Some people were asking why and so I m sharing my compelling case why they will not only crush their upcoming Q4 earnings but also establish a record turnaround with consecutive quarter profitability hype and getting short squeezed No excessive rocket emojis no edgy lingo trying to be one of the gang just some solid DD Summary Revenue for Q3 2020 exploded to 281 million 109 QoQ from 134 million in Q2 2020 With record ecommerce industry sales in 2020 and Q4 GoPro s already successful direct to consumer pivot and new subscription income channel I expect them to hit new Q4 revenue and profit records exceeding their 565 94 million recorded from Q4 2019 Oh and add a short squeeze on top Subscribers to their paid subscription program passed 670k up 35 QoQ and 65 YoY Based on growth rate it s likely they ll hit 1 MILLION before end of Q1 I explain below why there is so much momentum and goodness that will come from this They were PROFITABLE in Q3 and CRUSHED expectations beating Non GAAP EPS of 0 20 beats by 0 14 and GAAP EPS of 0 02 beats by 0 09 GAAP gross margin for Q3 2020 was 35 4 up from 21 7 year over year Non GAAP gross margin for Q3 2020 was 36 2 up from 23 4 year over year Not only were they profitable but they reduced non GAAP operating expenses by 90m 9 YoY and reduced a whopping 25 year over year We should expect to see more efficiencies in Q4 GPRO is flush with 147 million in cash and investments that s up to 85 YoY And now they re likely about to post record breaking profitable Q4 earnings Here s why 1 Q4 Monster Earnings is Likely Successful Direct to Consumer Pivot 2020 has been a record year for all ecommerce and GoPro has already shown a successful pivot from big box retailers to growing their own direct to consumer online programs saving margin by selling directly from their own website without needing to pay commission GoPro s direct business has grown more profitable in recent years with millions of unique visitors each month and in 2019 it was already generating more than 20 of revenue in top European markets and nearly 20 in the United States The Covid pivot of 2020 has likely pumped those rookie numbers up Q4 Will Confirm a Profitable Trend GoPro hasn t had two consecutive profitable quarters in five years Typically it reaches profitability with a new camera launch Last year the company launched their H8 camera in the fourth quarter This year it launched the H9 camera in the third quarter and we know they saw record Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales I am AMPED that Q4 results will confirm the turnaround trend Covid Vaccine amp Seasonal Goodness Covid has been a blessing in disguise for GoPro due to lockdowns pushing people outdoors the perfect use case for their action camera segment In 2021 we will continue to see more goodness for 3 reasons 1 as vaccine rollout expands in store retail purchases will likely climb reviving a major revenue channel 2 coming spring outdoors season will likely increase more sales driven by pent up demand for post lockdown travel 3 You can buy like 5 cameras with Buyden s 2k stimis 2 Consumer Brand to Tech Company Profitable Cloud Storage Subscription Service Last quarter was a record quarter for GoPro s subscription program essentially a cloud storage service If you didn t know in 2020 GoPro launched a new subscription service for 5 month that includes unlimited video storage in the cloud discounts on accessories and a device warranty It s since turned into fast growing revenue and profit channel Regardless of where consumers purchase GoPro now owns the post purchase customer relationship with its subscribers and is driving repeat purchases and revenue through member only discount programs and monthly storage fees increasing the lifetime value of every purchasing customer The subscription program has only accelerated pushing past 670 000 subscribers from record Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales meaning more customers than ever that are providing greater returns than ever Based on 2020 growth rates I have a hunch they ll announce a new subscription milestone between 750k or past 1m by feb earnings announce and start seeing real bottom line impact from their cloud storage service 3 Short Squeeze Likely The current short interest ratio is near historic highs at 15 and while not GME level high there are 16m shorted shares at a volume of 147m the highest in at least 2 years The increased buy volume ahead of expected earnings what I expect will be a downright righteous Q4 beat will be a catalyst to push the price as bears buy back to cut their losses Target and Positions Earnings is likely 2 3 and I can see it confidently reaching 11 or as high as 15 from a milestone Q4 beat and turnaround I think positive momentum could push it as high as 18 20 by May if they can pull a profitable trifecta Personally I have mostly shares plus some 2 5 11c and 4 16 9c amp 15c which seem to have the best available volume and open interest though like GME shares are my long term play There are probably some good counter arguments why I m retarded but GoPro makes solid products record profits and is evolving into a true Tech company with it s cloud service amp GoPro Labs

actually examine things so I don t fuck up the next opportunity for tendies This is my penance amp x200B TLDR Retard examining why I made small gains off GME despite being in months ago I keep track of all my trades GME has been a rollercoaster of emotions and opportunities in a very short time so lots to learn amp x200B Takeaways 1 I never truly committed or believed in the position It remained a small of my portfolio and I was always hedging because being down even a couple hurt let alone 20 swings To find 20X return you have to invest in companies that have significant uncertainty and volatility That means persuasive arguments on both sides If you lack conviction you won t be able to stay in 2 Follow those charts and imagine you don t know where we end up Put yourself in that moment Holy fuck Am I buying the dip or catching a falling knife This has been bumpy and uncertain We can all pretend this was a sure thing it wasn t It still isn t 3 We ve all heard Fear and Greed

I m stunned looking back by how often I was paralyzed and couldn t take action 5 None of this was obvious There were strong cases that the business was undervalued It was a good bet But it was a bet Blasphemy you say The true prophet RoaringKitty said on yesterday s stream that as June turned into July and August and no PE firm or other investors stepped in he began to wonder if he was right The business was bleeding cash it just wasn t hemorrhaging like bears thought The management is out of touch COVID could have been worse The broader market could have sold off offsetting anything GME did and probably making sentiment even worse 6 I believe at 30 40 the core business is reasonably priced and the value thesis is proved out There are other stories short squeeze and the business transformation that remain IMO these are far less certain but in this market a good story might be worth 100 Charts comments Entering via CCPs https preview redd it kyuu2rh4rab61 png width 2769 amp

wallstreetbets It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard My private codes was used to develop it and it s very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it I rather post updates freely at no cost to anyone than give out the code I will not be posting this hourly It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future I will post during open though Discord and telegram admins don t try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people when you don t even own the codes behind it There are a lot of SPY500 boomer companies within the bot I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there There won t be any sell signals as stocks only go up so I rather just do a discount algorithm

for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits Backtesting has not been done do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all Rather use this as a side tool amp x200B Key Pharma companies are very risky Meme Hype stocks are very risky Companies that you don t know how they work are very risky Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train what NKLA is to TSLA I have a very low amount in options less than 500 and I have 100k in shares and cash When doing options have a lot of collateral so you don t hit margin call Take the Calls as very discounted and Potentially A Call as somewhat discounted Old money companies are slow While tech companies are fast paced Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential

are looking at investing in Space Lockheed I m long Lockheed and have been prior to the ARK announcement Summary LMT Lockheed Martin is one of the largest defense contractors in the US The US just signed the largest defense budget in history and Lockheed stands to benefit Here s the text https www govtrack us congress bills 116 hr6395 text of the bill for reference Let s begin About Us Page https www lockheedmartin com en us who we are html https preview redd it q8bqhm0isbb61 png width 830 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5c5b996a4732a833ab01285664d9b5c7d8d00cf3 A few things to note about Lockheed Martin 1 Lockheed historically provides conservative earnings estimates which enable them to consistently beat earnings and raise outlook for the subsequent year 2 Lockheed carries a backlog of 144b which enables them to manage production to consistently hit sales targets 3 Lockheed historically trades at a discount given their expensive low volume contracts Investors are looking for diversification of revenue and new opportunity given the limited lifecycle of existing investment e g F 35s Lockheed reports earnings on Jan 26 2021 Lockheed projects 16 9B in revenue 6 42B in profit Here s a glimpse at their most recent earnings amp x200B https preview redd it dq0py12lsbb61 png width 832 amp format png amp auto webp amp s de774e12bec9a1d34275f338b807d588970b89ad Thesis Let s break this down by vertical for LMT Aeronautics https www lockheedmartin com en us who we are business areas aeronautics html Aeronautics is a diverse field for Lockheed with classic names like F 16 and F 35 Fighter jet contracts are a huge source of revenue and backlogs for Lockheed As we can see for Q3 we saw good revenue numbers at 6 7B and 700m profits which comes out to an 11 margin Aeronautics will continue to be a strong category for Lockheed Here s a few notes from the recent procurement list in the defense budget F 35 contracts were 700M higher than expectations 4 5B expected vs 5 2 actual C 130J was 660M higher than expectations 30M expected vs 690M actual F 22 contracts were in line with expectations at 360M vs 380M expected F 16 contracts were in line with expectations at 590M vs 615M expected Laser technology was given about 200M in funding which should go to LMT as new procurement Here s a recent contract Link https news lockheedmartin com 2021 01 11 Lockheed Martin Delivers HELIOS Laser Weapon System to US Navy for Ship Testing and Integration U 2 Dragon was 16M higher 16M expected vs 32M actual Other highlights that are not highlighted in the defense budget LMT is investing in Compact Fusion https www lockheedmartin com en us products compact fusion html research which would be used for space travel Unfortunately we haven t seen much news here All in all Lockheed was in line or exceeded expectations in the recent defense bill While these won t immediately impact the bottom line they add to the growing backlog and should signal an earnings beat for this vertical Missile and Fire Control https www lockheedmartin com en us who we are business areas missiles and fire control products html Another core area for Lockheed is Missile and Fire Control This area is more difficult to pick out winners and losers in the most recent defense budget Overall missiles and fire control seems to be in line with expectations For context missiles and fire control contracts are not as publicized as aerospace Most of these are upgrades for existing airplanes helicopters and not explicitly called out in the defense budget by name Thus we have to assume that budget in line with expectations means that Lockheed should meet expectations in this category Other highlights that are not highlighted in the defense budget Did you know that Lockheed is an industry leader in battery technology https www lockheedmartin com en us capabilities energy html Most military installations with clean energy are using Lockheed battery technology Lockheed does interesting investments in exoskeleton technologies https www lockheedmartin com en us products exoskeleton technologies html for foot soldiers These contracts haven t been announced but should be https www globenewswire com news release 2018 12 19 1669201 0 en Exoskeleton Market to surpass 3 5bn by 2026 Global Market Insights Inc html Rotary and Mission Systems https www lockheedmartin com en us who we are business areas rotary and mission systems html This vertical is super interesting for Lockheed Representing nearly 25 of revenues Rotary and Mission Systems references helicopter and other electronic warfare systems e g EMPs and cyber attacks This is another area that doesn t have public information that we can readily find in the defense budget There s plenty of money being thrown at cyber security in the defense budget 31B but we don t know where it s allocated Radar systems were also well funded in the recent defense budget but again it isn t explicit in allocation As I can t speak specifically to Lockheed s performance in this area here s a few highlights Directed Energy https www lockheedmartin com en us capabilities directed energy html As part of Lockheed s laser research they are building speed of light weapons Laser research is a huge part of the defense budget north of 500M in research funding Lockheed also signed a 1 2B contract https www navalnews com naval news 2021 01 lockheed martin delivers helios laser weapon system to u s navy for laser technology for Helios lasers Hypersonic https www lockheedmartin com en us capabilities hypersonics html I will talk more about this later but very interesting tech being produced 800M in funding for research in the latest budget and 100s of millions in other ancillary hypersonic research deployment Space https www lockheedmartin com en us capabilities space html This is the most interesting vertical for Lockheed and going to be a catalyst for earnings Lockheed is already cleared for producing spacecraft for landing on the moon and is currently planning to announce new technology in June for returning people to the moon by 2024 I highly recommend reading through Lockheed s website on Space material This is a new industry for Lockheed and a new line item in the defense budget and is something investors will be looking at closely Lockheed needs to diversify their revenues and Space is an easy way for them to grow already seeing 2 8B quarterly revenues They are dominating the Space Force budget and proving to be leaders in this category A few callouts 1 Lockheed is working with Blue Origin NOC and a few other contractors on a human landing system for the moon This is planned for 2024 but we could hear new information in our upcoming earnings 2 Lockheed is focusing on data satellite technology has been a major focus for weather space imaging and missile technology 1 We ve seen major contracts in this area too Link https spacenews com lockheed martin gets 4 9 billion contract to build three missile warning satellites 5B for missile defense Differentiator The real reason for this HIGH conviction Lockheed has a few differentiators heading into earnings Here s what we should expect to hear more about 1 5G and 6G technology if you didn t know already Lockheed is a leader in 5G technology This week they also trademarked a 6G logo today Jan 11 which shows they are investing in 6G infrastructure that we will hear about in the upcoming earnings report 1 Historically Lockheed has focused on the satellite deployment contracts for 5G rather than the actual technology However recent developments for using 5G to power missiles and drones should push Lockheed to the forefront of 5G technology even for consumers 2 Hypersonic technology https www

an enormous advantage in this category and should see the bulk of hypersonic contracts moving forward 3 Aerojet Rocketdyne Lockheed recently purchased AJRD for about 5B Lockheed competes against SpaceX in the reusable rockets space particular for satellites and this purchase enables them to have a leg up over SpaceX when it comes to upcoming NASA or Space Force contracts Costs savings too should be a huge boost This needs to be approved by President Biden which we should see news on in the early weeks of his new administration Super bullish that they are focusing their 18B in M amp A dry powder towards Space investments Investors will be looking to the Space line item in the earnings report to evaluate Lockheed s earnings The 5B Helios contract should be a huge booster to their

through classified aircraft in development and hypersonic missile technology that is also in development None of these products are expected to be unclassified until 2024 2025 but we could start to hear confirmation of won contracts that would confirm Lockheed s position as leading in Space Force contracts A lot of times there is a run up into earnings on the potential announcement of deals like this if Lockheed announced they signed a contract for the next generation of F22s they d be immediately signing a 100B contract that would ensure earnings beats for the next decade Same with hypersonic missiles There s a reason why we are starting to see price action in the weeks ahead of earnings LMT also still has 14B in M amp A money that could go towards other companies like KTOS or NNDM for 3d printing of rocket parts These could be great M amp A plays moving forward for Lockheed as they further cement themselves as a leader in the space industry I m also long NOC for those that

be a three part deep dive on Smartsheet Ticker SMAR This second part walks you through the beginning of my four piece framework of trying to figure out if the stock can 10x from here 1 Leadership 2 Risks 3 Price and 4 Growth In this second part we are just going to focus on 1 Leadership As I was writing I found that Leadership is a very important part of the Smartsheet story and it needed its own article to do it justice You can read Part 1 here https onthemarkpicks com 2021 01 01 deep dive 2 part 1 of 2 smartsheet solving the productivity paradox Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice These are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion Hi everyone thanks for coming back for Part 2 I m excited to bring you more research and insights on Smartsheet NYSE SMAR Let s dive in Can we 10X from here For someone like me that is on the younger side and with a longer investment time horizon and probably you if you are reading this an important question to ask yourself is Do I think this investment could 10x from here In other words could this investment one day be 10 times what it is worth today To try to answer this question I will work through a pre determined framework that I believe gives us the best path to find out The framework includes Leadership Desire Purpose and Ownership Risk Considerations Price Considerations Explosive Business Growth 1 Leadership Desire Purpose Ownership For a company to do something as spectacular as 10x we are going to need to see really strong and talented leadership In Chris Mayer s excellent book 100 Baggers he dedicates a part of the book to talk about the importance of what he calls Owner Operators By this he means that the CEO of the company owns a substantial amount of stock in the company themselves Why is this important If the CEO has their own personal wealth at stake in the company s stock just like we do as shareholders their interests are more aligned with shareholders and maximizing returns for shareholders than they would be if that CEO had no skin in the game It s also better in my opinion if the CEO of the company was also the founder of the company For these founder CEO s that have money invested in their own company it really is like their baby Would you rather have your money invested with someone who views the company as their baby or with someone who was just hired to watch this kid the company In the case of Smartsheet we check all the boxes when it comes to leadership Mark Mader is not only an Owner Operator he is also a co founder I touched on this a little bit in part 1 but Mark co founded Smartsheet along with Brent Frei in 2005 They both played football American football for Dartmouth College an Ivy League School They met in the fall of 1988 when Mark was a freshman on the team and Brent who had graduated the prior year was serving as a Graduate Assistant for the team After that season Brent moved on to begin a career in computer engineering Mark quit the football team after 1 year In an interview with Forbes he said that after his freshman season he thought it was too much to juggle Ivy League academics and being a NCAA Division 1 athlete Mark started focusing solely on academics until a tragedy struck One of his best friends from his high school football team got into an accident and was critically injured His friend would never be able to play football again This had a profound impact on Mark He said in the interview that knowing one of his friends would never be able to play again made him realize that if he still has the ability to play football he needs to go do it He went to his old coach told him the story about his friend and asked for his spot on the team back The coach accepted and Mark went on to finish his career in the fall of 1991 as a 6 4 245lb offensive lineman Mark said that this experience with his friend and re joining the football team taught him not to take anything for granted He said ever since then he tries to do his best with everything and make the most out of every opportunity That mindset has served him well as he now sits as a CEO of a 8 5 billion company But he s really just getting started That mindset lives on today The day that he took Smartsheet public April 27 2018 he was asked if he plans on celebrating the achievement he said We have 74 000 customers that don t want us to party they want us to work on the product How did Mark get to the point where he was CEO of a tech company with 74 000 customers that raised 150 million during their IPO I ll share with you a little more history behind the company After Brent Frei left Dartmouth he started his career in computer engineering as I mentioned before His career started with Motorola in 1989 then he went to Microsoft in 1991 and then he founded his first company Onyx Software in 1994 It didn t take long before his buddy from college Mark Mader would come join him at the start up Mark joined in 1995 and eventually worked his way up to an Executive role within the firm The focus of Onyx was Customer Relationship Management CRM software Brent was the CEO and Mark became the SVP of Global Services Brent led the company through an IPO in 1999 right before the tech bubble burst It was really unfortunate timing because a lot of their customers were dotcoms that went out of business Brent was still able to lead them through stiff competition with Salesforce in the early 2000 s until he hit a plateau in 2004 He decided to step down from the company he had founded 10 years earlier On his last call with investors he was quoted as saying I believe it s the right time for me to turn over the reins to a new CEO who can take Onyx to new heights over the next decade All the while Mark was there in the background learning and observing He saw what went right they built a large publicly traded company from scratch And he saw what went wrong their growth stalled as they lost market share to Salesforce Only a year after resigning from Onyx Brent was on to his next big move and he again recruited his friend Mark to help They were going to found Smartsheet a company to help improve the way people work This time Mark was a Co Founder along with Brent and had a much bigger influence on the company His influence got even larger in 2017 12 years after the founding when Brent left to found his 3rd company TerraClear Brent left to go back to his roots in Idaho where he grew up on the family farm His new start up TerraClear seeks to solve one of the largest unsolved problems in farming today clearing rocks from farming land As crazy as that sounds apparently it s a big issue Hence the name TerraClear Brent is still on the Board of Directors of Smartsheet Going back to the IPO date April 27 2018 which was only 4 months after Brent had left Mark was asked by the press what he had learned from being at Onyx when they went public Mark was very clear in his response and said that one of the main lessons from Onyx was to not get too enamored with your product With Smartsheet he wants to make sure they re always improving the product and the user experience He also said that investors don t buy a stock based on what you ve done in the past but what you plan to do If you are always looking at the rear view mirror then you are not running the business he said This is exactly how I want the leaders of companies I invest in to be thinking He is very forward thinking customer focused and humble There is a lot of evidence to corroborate that he has followed through on the statements he made that day One of the first pieces of evidence I found that supports my thesis of Mark being very focused on the product and user experience is the incredible ratings that the product has received from its customers I use a tool called Net Promoter Score NPS which is one of the most reliable and unbiased ways to find out what a customers true experience with a business is and how likely they would be to recommend it to a friend For Smartsheet their NPS is extremely high It s on a scale of 100 to 100 so anything above 0 is considered to be good If the rating is above 0 it essentially more people would recommend the product to a friend than they would tell them not to use it Smartsheet has an NPS of 80 which is honestly one of the highest I have ever seen Further evidence to support Mark and the rest of management s commitment to product quality and user experience is the exceptional ratings the product has on the Apple App Store This is just for the mobile version of the product the app that you can download on your phone just like you would download the mobile version of Outlook The rating in the App Store is 4 8 5 That s very impressive as well Based on how customers are responding to the product I think it s fair to say that Mark was not B S ing https b s ing his way through that interview on IPO day He and his management team really have been focused on creating a stellar product and the results are showing When I say that Desire and Purpose are important traits of a leader of a company it means that I want to see a leader who has a real desire to do what he she is doing as the CEO of the company believes in their product s and services and has a real purpose for why they want to do that I can tell that Mark is committed to the mission of improving the way people work Being one of the founders and having written an E Book on the Productivity Paradox that I mentioned in Part 1 I think this mission is very near and dear to his heart and that he has a desire to see the impact and scale of his company grow well into the future As shareholders that s what we want Another way to see if the leader of the company has Desire and Purpose is to see how his her employees perceive them Do the employees look up to this person Do they feel motivated to work hard because they know what they re doing is meaningful and can make a positive difference in people s lives One way I have of gaining insight into this is to look at the company s Glassdoor ratings and specifically the rating of the CEO In the case of Smartsheet the positive story continues The company has a 4 1 5 rating on Glassdoor and Mark has a 90 approval rate from his employees which is well above average To me this shows he s communicating the company s purpose to the employees very well and is motivating them to actualize that purpose There s one other piece of evidence I stumbled upon that gives good insight into the culture that Mark and his management team are building at Smartsheet They were recently 12 17 20 awarded Best Company Culture and Best Companies for Women by Comparably Below you can see a screenshot of the headline from a Business Wire article about this It s one thing to be awarded for Best Company Culture but to also be a Best Companies for Women when you re in a heavily male dominated industry such as computer software that really says something It speaks to the culture of diversity and inclusiveness that Mark is building there which goes a long way in the year 2021 when social issues are at the forefront of people s minds more than ever The modern enterprise has to build a culture of diversity and inclusiveness if they want to retain the most talented employees and keep them motivated Smartsheet is doing a good job of this Source Smartsheet making headlines for their outstanding company culture I think we ve found a lot of evidence to support that this leadership team has a strong desire to fulfil their purpose It s evident that they want to help improve the way people work and that they ve invested heavily into making this happen while keeping employees motivated and focused on the goal The last piece I look at for leadership is ownership Does the CEO have a personal financial stake in the company This is such a key thing to look for because as I mentioned earlier in the article if leadership themselves owns a substantial amount of shares then their interests and motivations will align with us the shareholders They essentially are a shareholder too just like us On top of the desire and purpose that we ve established is present there s also a financial incentive for Mark and the team to lead the company to success and ultimately a higher share price Currently Mark holds 490 267 shares which comes out to a value of 34 million as of this writing 1 14 21 I d consider that substantial for an individual person Even more noteworthy is that Brent owns 3 2 million shares which comes out to a value of 218 million Brent owns that much of the company still and he s not even involved beyond being on the Board of Directors I think that s a testament to how much confidence he has in Mark to lead Smartsheet to new heights Also it s important to keep in mind that he left Smartsheet to help with his family business He saw his 80 year old Dad picking up rocks on the farm with his bare hands and realized he wanted to help solve this problem in the farming industry Leaving Smartsheet was not like when he left Onyx because the business was plateauing As a matter of fact Smartsheet was rapidly growing at that time and was about to go public The fact that he still has 218 million worth of shares in the company shows he still believes in the company and what Mark can do with it now and in the future This concludes Part 2 of my Smartsheet deep dive Hope you

right now Obligatory do your own research and draw your own conclusions statement POSITIVES Both Sony and Microsoft are using custom AMD APUs in their latest consoles APU CPU GPU combined into one In case you ve been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember But for the first time in 15 years AMD is winning in terms of market share https www techradar com news amd overtakes intel in desktop cpu market share for the first time in 15 years Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts Despite this AMD s CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly at MSRP AMD owns Radeon which is their brand of Graphics Cards These compete directly with Nvidia s RTX GPUs Performance wise they re up there with NVDA but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future Key word being future it s not a big deal yet And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick AMD s next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon Just like their desktop lineup you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well AMD s previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel the biggest problem was availability People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason they were found mostly in the mid range and lower end gaming laptops I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year As we can see certain manufacturer s like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their top of the line gaming laptops https www
