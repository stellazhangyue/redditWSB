now I hope most of you know why we have seen the action we have on CLF In past DD s and most recently in LG s revised guidance we know that HRC will be averaging much more than is currently baked in The Company s forecast includes the following expectations First quarter 2021 adjusted EBITDA of approximately 500 million Second quarter 2021 adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1 2 billion Full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA of approximately 3 5 billion The full year expectation is based on current contractual business and the assumption that the US HRC price averages 975 per net ton for the remainder

shorted is beyond lunacy it s pure greed and they think they can hammer a boomer stock that no one cares about Until yesterday when it made the headlines as the NEW MEME stock Well this stock is not a meme its actually a fucking stud that is run by a bigger fucking stud named LG If you were going to bet on 5 CEO s today for me they would be Jeff Bezos Tim Cook Elon Musk Lisa Su Lourenco Goncalves Why do I put LG in the pantheon of these titans Two reasons 1 They all know their business cold 2 They are all transformational leaders with vision If you don t know who LG is take some time to read

Reduced Iron DRI which can also be used in EAFs The minimal waste of resources and maximized production is key to Ternium beating much of the steel industry Every single item you use from lambos appliances home goods and even electronics need this steel We can see the effects of inflation and these rising prices as used cars are somehow appreciating in value and construction costs are going vertical Steel Goes BRRRRR As you know the steel industry is booming right now HRC futures prices Hot Rolled Coils are through the roof with nearly every month through 2022 above 1000 a 50 increase within the past 6 months Because of both Buyden s infrastructure talks and sustained global demand as China plays games with exports and imports the steel industry IS THE BEST SECTOR from an inflationary and money making machine standpoint Inflation is not transitory as JPOW keeps lying to us but will have long term consequences as the money printer continues to go brrr too TX exports across the globe and operates specifically in Mexico Guatemala Colombia Brazil Argentina and Southern U S For the degenerates who actually use their brain cells TX is currently immune to tariffs The Section 232 tariffs the U S placed on steel do not apply to the rest of North America aka Mexico and Canada This means that all the steel produced there can be sold at full premium If TX is smart and follows through with opening an actual plant in the U S to pair with its U S operations this would be in their best interest As China continues to export less steel with a potential export tax and massive infrastructure plans about to be signed in place TX has a golden opportunity to produce massive steel dildos of profits Financials TX was basically immune to coronavirus You could give this bitch the Indian triple variant and it would still pump out profits like there s no tomorrow Argentina and Brazil continued to have strong construction and home demands and as a result in Q1 of 2021 Ternium had an EPS of 3 07 a 45 increase from the previous quarter beating estimates by 36 Just like every other steel company TX is taking the fuck you pay me approach As steel prices continue to rise so does TX s offering of flat steel It s like an infinite tendie machine Analyst ANALysis TX Ternium S A has a Q2 2021 EPS estimate of 3 42 only a slight increase over their Q1 3 07 EPS number This appears absurdly low which will mean another high percentage beat by TX as analysts are surprised once again u BlueWolf1983 Using some of his mathemagical skills he determined that half of their Q2 sales should be based on previous Q1 prices That appears to be somewhere in the 1200s Assuming a Q1 2021 price of 1210 and an average Q2 2021 spot price of 1490 this would be a price of 1 350 per ton Again based on these prices he then calculated the following In the following chart I ve further added their cost per ton by taking the cost of their steel sales in Q1 of 2020 and dividing it by their total steel shipments As they mentioned input costs would marginally increase I ve given that roughly a flat 5 10 input cost increase As on their Q2 call they mentioned input price increases lag due to existing inventory reserves and as they mine their own ore that should be sufficient amp x200B Country Shipments in thousands of tons Q2 2021 Estimated Ton Price Q2 2021 Cost Per Ton Estimate Profit Per Ton Total Profit in Millions Mexico 1699 1 350 770 580 985 42 Southern Region 680 8 1 210 770 440 299 56 Other Markets 687 7 1 100 770 330 226 94 It appears they sell electricity in Mexico and Brazil as well This is way too hard to try to figure out a Q2 estimate for As this seems to range between 44M and 59M in profits for them we will just add 50M to get a new total profit of 1 566 92M Doing more math that went slightly over my head the final EPS calculated should be 4 48 This is all based on data approximately 1 month old which means the EPS would likely be higher From a conservative standpoint this is another 35 beat of the previous quarter s EPS Mega Shart Interest Stats Currently the shart interest on TX is ranging around 15 In the past month alone the number of

things get interesting with the price action HOW is it that a company that is making TRIPLE PROFITS over the past 3 months due to increasing HRC prices STILL AT THE SAME SHARE PRICE AS IT WAS IN MARCH

webp amp s deb5ae6d643514394671fb62a8bd2cb70f78b612 Citadel has been placing short positions on TX since May which is the exact same time its price began to be suppressed This isn t some conspiracy or anything just basing it on facts Case The one thing I can see affecting profits is if cartels manage to take over the national government and seize control of the manufacturing industry During the elections this past week which also contributed to Mexican company stocks taking a dive a lot of cartels were on assassination sprees The political turmoil in Mexico could causes instability in the supply chain in the short term I don t see this as a problem considering everyone needs steel and that cartels can t drive the price downv just through political shenanigans Conclusion Ternium makes more than all of Yanksteel combined currently has medium shart interest a smaller market cap AND it s at the same fucking price as it was 3 months ago due to funds like Citadel despite MASSIVE steel price increases and a fuck you pay me attitude I intend to become rich off of this company My Positions 10 contracts of 8 20 50C I will be averaging in with about 50 more contracts of the September 45Cs too Thanks to u JayArlington and u Bluewolf1983 for data and inferences made throughout this post Thanks to u Dan inKuwait for helping get this approved TL DR If you like money buy into steel or TX Otherwise all I can say is enjoy being a poor

a65cdb9bec1c0fef552bb02e4a99fb6a097b2c25 amp x200B COMPANY BACKGROUND amp x200B RKT is probably the most grossly under valued mid cap stock I have seen in years The last time I felt so strongly about a stock was 2010 when TSLA became public I told my wife that Tesla would be worth 10 times the IPO value in 10 years if they didn t go bankrupt and I figured there was about a 10 chance they d go bankrupt in the first couple years I bought Tesla around 19 and sold a year and a half later for about 24 to pay off my house There wasn t a lot of movement but it was a gain and I wanted to do the responsible thing creating a life where I was debt free I planned to replenish the position over the next 6 months Unfortunately my timing couldn t be worse A month after I sold the stock skyrocketed to 85 Later it then rose to 135 a month or two later It was no longer the deal it has once been and I never felt that it was worth chasing Biggest mistake of my investing career I point this out because you just never know when things will explode but if you know the company well enough you can determine that it s an inevitability amp x200B Rocket Companies RKT used to be known as Quicken Loans which was established in 1985 When the company decided to go digital they changed their name to Rocket Companies Rocket Companies has only been around since 2016 Quicken Loans grew at a 25 compound annualized growth rate CAGR and before the company went public Rocket Companies had a 16 CAGR between 2016 and 2020 With a 16 CAGR the company doubles in size every 5 years just for reference

9c99d8deea18a00861a434042ec3f0bb06e09188 amp x200B After reporting the 2020 year results the stock skyrocketed of course This only lasted a few days before it came back down settled right back to where the stock came from The stock was roughly 20 or so before the results and after it rose somewhere near 45 from a pump and dump situation The price then fell for about 2 3 straight months back down to where it came from The primary reason for the price dropping from something that was closer to a realistic price target back down to the low 20s was the belief that interest rates were going to rise in 2021 2023 due to inflation That was going to kill home buying and this was as good as it gets amp x200B amp x200B THE WAR WITH UWMC To add to the industry problems UWMC started a war with RKT This war was started because RKT was taking market share in every direction UWMC is a great company but it s a distant second in overall lending origination as you can see in this list below of the top lending companies for 2020 amp x200B https preview redd it iukjdhnvik471 png width 448 amp format png amp auto webp amp s de37da1ec33a9f1f36d59507836c47e99139ab87 By the end of 2020 Rocket Companies had 8 9 of the entire housing loan origination market in the US They continued to grow that market share in the latest reported quarter to somewhere in the mid 9 range In the beginning of March UWMC issued an ultimatum that all realtors who use UWMC are not allowed to use RKT anymore That means one month March in Q1 would be affected by this new ultimatum Both UWMC and RKT declared victory within the first week of March We would have to wait for Q1 earning to come out to see who really was winning the war amp x200B Q1 earnings came out and here are the results amp x200B https

width 1420 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 06a9df748d7e8133b1116ab3c9e85fbd62196b9e The loan volume for RKT increased nearly 3B from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 Below is a chart showing you the loan volume for UWMC in that same time period As you can see the loan volume DECREASED by over 5 6B A winner has been declared and it means that RKT is taking market share even quicker due to the ultimatum amp x200B Now this entire war was started to try to stop RKT from taking market share from UWMC All UWMC had to do was read a little bit of recent history and know that competitors tried to do the same thing when Amazon was starting out Many vendors refused to use Amazon because they took a fee and felt they could make more money per sale if they were independent Unfortunately those vendors eventually learned that volume can make profits go up faster than premiums with less sales Amazon of course won that warm and RKT will do the same amp x200B The primary focus for Rocket Companies is very clear when it comes to growth gain market share They are not the least bit worried about profits because their Direct to Consumer lending is the largest in the US by a long shot This plays a key roll in the war with UWMC UWMC dropped their interest rates effectively buying down the interest rate for the customer to try to keep agents with them when they issued the ultimatum Of course RKT followed suit to match them and the war is causing the entire industry to see their margins tighten Margins for wholesale are roughly 2 for both RKT and UWMC after dropping the interest rates 50bps Direct to Consumer margins are over 5 Well UWMC doesn t do direct to consumer lending so they are fighting a battle they can t win They can continue to buy down interest rates until they go negative and have no profits if they wanted to Rocket Companies will continue to always be profitable because a larger part of their business is Direct to Consumer with higher margins amp x200B https preview redd it 3klqg3xajk471 png width 750 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 79191aae6c0fd945540479c518d2dd173bcf9fad In light of this war Dan Gilbert and Jay Farner are come out stating their new goal is to be the largest wholesale lender by 2023 2 years They are already the largest overall lender and the largest direct to consumer lender They are winning the market share battle and numbers don t lie It comes at a cost of lower margins which reduce profit Keep in mind that Amazon wasn t profitable for 20 years The fact that RKT is hugely profitable is amazing as they continue to acquire market share in the industry amp x200B MORE THAN JUST MORTGAGES amp x200B Rocket Companies is a FinTech play RKT has been testing their technologies in other businesses and have determined that many of them translate to other loan industries The one with the largest prospects is automobiles Rocket Auto has been testing their products for the past year or so and are happy with the ability for the technologies to transition into the auto retail marketplace Rocket Auto recently formed a strategic partnership with AutoFi a leading software provider in the automotive retail industry with a network of more than 2 000 dealership partners This is not live yet to my knowledge but during the first quarter they sold over 360M in volume and are on track to do over 1B this year Rocket owns their own titling company called Amrock They make up the bulk of the Other income line in their quarterly yearly reports At this point the auto sales only generated 13M in profit for Q1 2021 There is no website launched for Rocket Auto yet and it ll take awhile to integrate the technologies in with AutoFi but this is a huge market which will grow at an exponential rate in the next couple years amp x200B

lots of growth for years to come amp x200B INFLATION FEARS amp x200B Has inflation increased Absolutely But it has had very little effect on interest rates Interest rates increased at the beginning of the year and were expected to increase for the next 2 years at a very fast rate The fact is that analysts guessed wrong Fed Chairman has stuck to his word and has not increased rates and doesn t expect to until after 2023 Interest rates did increase very dramatically at the start of the year and then it stopped increasing at the end of March In fact interest rates have decreased nearly 0 3 in

again slightly and investors know it RKT has been a notoriously shorted stock since it IPOed because hedge funds believed that it was as good as it gets in the middle of 2020 when they IPOed For 2 quarters in a row RKT proved every naysayer wrong growing more than anyone expected and be coming more profitable than anyone expected EBITDA in 2020 was roughly 11B and the company s market cap sits around 41bln currently They are making more money than they can possibly use so they issued a special dividend last year of 1 11 which was about 5 of the value of the stock amp x200B Below you can see the short interest dropped to roughly 8 in march when they reported blow out earnings It then increased in May to roughly 17 in May after earnings showed the gain on sales decreased to to the war with

housing market does incredibly well over the next 5 years or not RKT has made it clear that their goal is to have 25 market share of the mortgage industry by 2030 which is 3 times their market share compared to last year They will gain market share even faster in years the housing market is bad and their retention for customers can t be matched The industry average return customer is 20 and RKTs return rate is over 90 Their process is simple digital can all be done through an app or their website and has made the lending process infinitely easier than traditional loans They make billions of dollars a years have 1B set aside for share buybacks if they decide that s in the shareholders interest and has a better balance sheet than anyone else in the business You pay a slightly higher multiple than you would if you purchased another company like UWMC but their growth is nearly double UWMC and they are taking market share away from UWMC so it s worth far more than any other lending company In general all lending companies are undervalued currently RKT just happens to be the next Amazon of lending and it s hard to put a price on that amp x200B I believe the company is worth around 40 a share currently which is about 100 above where it is trading now By 2023 the company should be worth worth around 200B 300B which is roughly 5 7 times current evaluation It s not the 10 times in 10 years that I felt Tesla was worth in 2010 but there is zero chance RKT goes bankrupt and there was always a chance Tesla could in the first few years Read Elon Musk s biography and you ll see just how close he was to bankruptcy twice amp x200B I can t tell you when the stock will go up The stock price isn t reflective of the company currently Sometimes they can stay disconnected for awhile But I learned my lesson when I sold TSLA to pay off my house You never know when a stock is going to explode you just know that it s an inevitability While everyone else is running for the next pump and dump on Reddit to hopefully gain 100 in a week I admit I do this as well although I never put too much in I d rather invest with the majority of my money I know that at some point I ll see a huge return in the next few years Typically in the stock market it doubles your money every 7 years if you have your money tracking the S amp P500 I ve found a company that will give me 5 7 times that amount in near the same time frame amp x200B Sorry for all the typos this got so long and it s so late now that I m not going to go back and proof read

Electronics Market cap 1 13B https finance yahoo com quote VUZI p VUZI Vuzix is engaged in the design manufacture marketing and sale of augmented reality display devices also referred to as head mounted displays HMDs but also known as video eyewear or near eye displays in the form of Smart Glasses and Augmented Reality glasses Their Augmented Reality wearable display devices are worn like eyeglasses or attach to a head worn mount These devices typically include cameras sensors and a computer that enable the user to view record and interact with video and digital content such as computer data the Internet social media or entertainment applications Their wearable display products integrate micro display technology with advanced optics to produce compact high resolution display engines which when viewed through their smart glasses products create virtual images that appear comparable in size to that of a computer monitor or a large screen television Vuzix s offered products are M series Smart Glasses Blade Smart Glasses and other Augmented Reality Products FINANCIALS https preview redd it c3ti8rur3l471 png width 624 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

for the year ended December 31 2020 rose by 107 over the same period in 2019 primarily the result of stronger customer demand for the new M Series models which were not available for sale for the entire comparable period in 2019 Sales revenues from the M Series Smart Glasses were 8 406 623 a 112 increase of 4 432 628 over the prior year s comparable period Total M Series unit sales increased by 109 for the year ended December 31 2020 versus the same period in 2019 Revenues of Blade Smart Glasses decreased by 240 747 or 14 primarily driven by lower average sales price as compared to 2019 Sales of OEM Products and Standalone Waveguides and Display Engines were nil for the year ended December 31 2020 versus 951 570 and 152 499 respectively in the 2019 period primarily due to not receiving new orders Sales of Engineering Services for the year ended December 31 2020 were 1 500 287 as compared to 673 151 in the 2019 comparable period The revenue recognized in the year ended December 31 2020 for engineering services was primarily a result of several waveguide and display engine development projects which commenced in the first and second quarters of 2020 The majority all but two of these projects were completed and delivered in 2020 BULL ARGUMENT Augmented Reality Smart Glasses enable the wearer to see computer generated information graphics or images projected into the real world environment or upon an object that the user is observing Thus whether in the warehouse on the factory floor or in the field users wearing Augmented Reality Smart Glasses may access a manual tutorial or image that is connected to the task at hand which will assist them in completing that task while also viewing their current surroundings and nearby objects Additional possible applications of AR enabled Smart Glasses include hands free alerts messaging location and context aware information and social interaction Vuzix has developed their own intellectual property portfolio that includes patents https patents justia com assignee vuzix corporation over 22 years of manufacturing know how software proprietary processes materials and equipment to create high performance waveguides and near eye display products It can be argued their waveguides and compact display engine technologies are a key differentiator for enabling next generation Augmented Reality and Smart Glasses hardware for the enterprise and consumer segments because they will ultimately allow Vuzix to make HMDs nearly indistinguishable from regular eyeglasses Key growth areas for Vuzix are the enterprise medical consumer electronics OEM defense and security markets They are addressing most of these markets by developing and selling their own finished products and building a growing eco system of software and services internally and with their value added resellers developers and end customers Another potential channel to these markets they are developing includes supplying mass production of waveguide optics and display engines to select third parties to use in their products Vuzix recently announced they will expand their Augmented Reality surgical product presence to support shoulder knee and spinal surgeries https ir vuzix com news events press releases detail 1895 vuzix smart glasses expand ar surgical product presence to BEAR ARGUMENT Vuzix has incurred net losses since inception and may continue to incur losses They reported a net loss of 17 952 172 for the year ended December 31 2020 a net loss of 26 476 370 for the year ended December 31 2019 and a net loss of 21 875 713 for the year ended December 31 2018 Vuzix has an accumulated deficit of 162 694 983 as of December 31 2020 They operate in a highly competitive market and the size resources and brand name of some of their competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than Vuzix Some competitors include Samsung Electronics Co LG Electronics Epson Sony Corporation Microsoft Corporation Oculus Facebook HTC Corporation Snap Lenovo Google Magic Leap Many of their competitors have substantial market share diversified product lines well established supply and distribution systems strong worldwide brand recognition and greater financial marketing research and development resources Additionally many of these competitors also have substantial competitive advantages such as longer operating histories the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners access to larger established customer bases and known branding greater resources to fund research and development and to make acquisitions larger intellectual property portfolios the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services CONCLUSION I have a hard time pulling the trigger on a long term investment with Vuzix With their current financials and

tendies thy moon will come thy will be done on WKHS as it is in GME Give us this day our daily squeeze and forgive us our short selling as we forgive those who short sell against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the hedgies Amen THE KEY LOGIC BEHIND THIS TRADE WSB the self proclaimed hedge fund short squeezing golden boys Where are you Why are you removing every WKHS post They have the smallest cap and the highest short interest Are you WSB fellas bought out Are you in kahoots with the SEC I m not trying to call WSB out I m tryin to call WSB up Something smells fishyyyyyyy The CPI data that was reported today wasn t great any which way you slice it inflation is present However the wealthy elite that have 100 million in the bank with nothing to worry about they simply label it as TRANSITORY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY CAN AFFORD TO SPEND 4O ON A SALAD Have you checked your gas grocery bills Yes those are rising again And your salary well I m pretty certain most of you have stayed the same in that regard ie your purchasing power is decreasing and so is the value of your dollars This is when I offer up my idea It s pretty simple really and quite satisfying if done correctly Sell out of some of your longs you know the ones that are already hyper inflated Just a little about 20 of your portfolio Place the proceeds in WKHS and we collectively 10 15x this market cap in under two weeks Many of you sheep fail to realize that the hedge funds are in on the MEME STOCK SUCH AS AMC GME CLOV etc JUST CHECK THEIR HOLDINGS VAST MAJORITY HOLD A PLETHORA OF STOCK AND OPTIONS They have every data point and analytic you can think of firing on all cylinders 24 hours a day SOME HAVE QUANTUM COMPUTERS They are essentially mining money from the blue collar common middle class whenever they buy in Notice those huge volatility spikes THAT S WHEN THEIR ALGORITHMIC PROGRAMS ROB YOU BLIND THE COMMON MAN DOESN T UNDERSTAND DERIVATIVES AND THE VOLATILITY WITHIN THE MARKET AND THE DIFFERENCES OF COMMON STOCK VS DERIVATIVES TRUST ME I WAS ONCE A BLIND APE THINK ABOUT IT APES BE SMARTER THAN WALLSTREET THIS IS A PAY TO PLAY GAME IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN THE MARKET HAS ALWAYS BEEN MADE THAT IS HOW THE FREE MARKETS FUNCTION BUT IN ALL REALITY THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN FREE THEY ARE PAY TO PLAY THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE DOING WHEN YOU ARE BUYING INTO THE MEMES THEY ARE MAKING HAND OVER FIST ON THE COMMON MAN THE SHORT INTEREST ON GME AMC BB ETC THEY ARE ALL BELOW WKHS WITH MARKET CAPS 10X WHY DO YOU THINK WALLSTREET BETS IS CENSORING THE HORSE THEY DON T WANT TO FACE THE WRATH IT S TIME THE WORLD CHANGED IT S NO LONGER A GAME OF WHICH COMPANY IS WORTH WHAT WE VE BEEN WELL BEYOND THAT POINT IT S TIME TO MAKE A STATEMENT BEAT THE MEDIA AND WALLSTREET AT THE SAME TIME ON THEIR HOME FIELD THE TRADE So here comes the trade idea Given that the short interest on WKHS which has a market cap that is almost micro in a sense we find every ape in the jungle to swing on in and scoop up everything We rip the share price of WKHS in a TRANSITORY sense Because after all this is an American born American made company that hedge funds would rather short sell for their own personal gain then invest in helping their own country bring up a startup EV DRONE GREEN ENERGY VEHICLE COMPANY INSTEAD OUR MEDIA WOULD RATHER PUMP ELON MUSK AND TESLA WHO HAS CHILDREN MINING LITHIUM I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS BULLSHIT APES WE MUST USE OUR POWER FOR CHANGE You buy every share available Then you buy every call One week out two weeks out one month out two months out It s that simple Remember TRANSITORY The 20 Share price is so heavily shorted in derivatives that if we can rip through at once we are gone ABOVE 35 AND THEY CANNOT CATCH US I have reason to believe we have potential to be in gamma territory Potential Catalysts The SSR has once been triggered again 2nd time this week furthering the short interest SSR If a stock closes down 10 from previous close said stock has SSR rule active next trading period SSR implies you cannot short sell a stock on a down tick that following day Setting up for a beautiful pattern to allow hedgies the inability to short WKHS heavily on a down tick Our Market Capitalization Short Interest Still remains the highest out of any stock on the market today With roughly 2 Billion in market cap a 100 squeeze is do able For instance take CLOV CLOV has a larger market cap and less short interest and still managed to gain over 100 in less than two days WE CAN DO THIS APES WE CAN DEFEAT THE HEDGIES

and here is why Take note that I have no idea what I m doing and draw crayon charts in my spare time Not financial advice Looking at the current state of shares available this puppy is ready to pop off and its just a matter of time regardless if your involved or not There are many times that people predict a massive short squeeze and people just promote random things like naked short selling but this is not what is going on here Let us begin with the short interest Shares outstanding 148 28M 24 held by insiders 148 28 0 24 35 58M Shares short May 28th 41 27M shares outstanding insider shares 112 70M Normally we would look at this and say welp 112 70M 41 27M 71 43M shares floating around and this would be very difficult to force a squeeze on as GME had maybe 50 000 shares available during its last squeeze with the proper adjustments in place However things get very interesting When you look at how many shares are held by institutions the number is 106 25 This is obviously highly irregular Say you look up a regular stock like AAPL you will find owned by institutions is 58 69 AMZN is similar at 59 32 With this said this implies that 148 28m 1 0625 157 54m shares are owned by institutions We already discovered that there are only 71 43M shares available This can only mean that there are 86 11M shares that are literally duplicates in some way Investopedia explains that this could be due to a delay in updates BUT investopedia also explains that another reason can be short selling between investors They give a good explaination to follow this up with https www investopedia com ask answers 07 institutional holdings asp The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148 28m 112 70m 131 57 of the float Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140 of the shares shorted this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don t do the math on it With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80 plus spike the other day The reason is Delta As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD s to long calls they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares Why This is called delta hedging I d hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of hedge fund Example Stock xyz has a delta of 0 25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up So you end up writing 10 call options You total delta is 2 50 This translates to around 250 shares 0 25 10 100 needing to be bought to cover This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems So our hedgie buys 250 shares writes their calls and everythings great Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is If delta moves to 0 75 to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares 0 75 0 25 10 call options 500 shares What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher I know that its around 0 55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0 61 for the leaps All in all considering that supposedly 71 43M shares are available this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily 745 60M shares traded hands Even at the open at 16 60 this equates to 12 376 960 000 in dollars spend and that is being extremley extremely conservative So why is the stock down af these past 2 days Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights I m entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too You will notice that from this chart there are only 300 000 shares available Remeber the delta at 0 55 Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every contract so if anyone purchases 5 454 54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available https iborrowdesk com report CLOV On the 3rd of June there were only 15 000 shares available https iborrowdesk com report CLOV If you dont pay attention to anything else in this post this section is the crux of everything There were only 15 000 shares availbe on June 3rd and on June 2nd the day before the stock flew up from below 8 to over 9 The very next day after this the stock came down from a gap up to 10 to about 9 and then BOOM breakout happens that very Monday and Tuesday even wednesday at open really They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves You ll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117 If they do not put this fire out now this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down Just for a little sprinkle on top BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high the ol bad news to drive the stock down is going to backfire TLDR CLOV does not have any available shares every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares There are at best 300 000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15 000 shares being available and if 5 454 54 contracts which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either There is bad news about CLOV all of a sudden and this is no accident at all

pile of dirt but sure seems like it is Stop pumping this company here as all you will do is enable them to raise funds off Apes and allow executives to cash out and go bankrupt in any case No one investing in this will make money Pumping this for options to pay off is crazy as well Not every company will be squeezed or deserves to How did you like it when the insiders at AMC sold stock Here you are not committed so get out while you can As for some DD I originally posted some of this in response to a comment but figure it deserves its own Post Going Concern By now you all know they reported they may not have enough cash to last the year So forget about whether they have debt or a clean balance sheet it does not matter If they cannot generate cash they are going bankrupt On their last earnings call they said that they can only get to low levels of production with the cash they have on hand now What they did not say is whether that would allow them to avoid bankruptcy or whether that it just means they think they can produce some cars but without funding they will go bankrupt anyways ATVM Loan There has been much DD posted here about LMC ticker is RIDE LMC is short for Lordstown Motors almost certainly getting the ATVM loan On the earnings call they said that they are in middle of the due diligence but had nothing to say when it would be done or what that actually means Anyone with basic Google skills can search for info about this loan program and will see that other than about a decade ago when they lent money under this program no one has been able to get funding For example LUCID went through extensive due diligence to get this loan only in the end to not get it Seems the loan program currently looks at your ability to survive without the loan and highly doubt a company with a going concern will get this loan Collateral Some have touted that their factory is worth a lot more than they paid for it Again that runs counter to logic as why would GM give away a factory for a massive discount More likely they got the factory at the going rate or perhaps a small discount due to GM wanting to make Trump look good Tesla by comparison paid 42M for their Fremont factory Fremont did not have much inside it whereas the Lordstown factory had old equipment so there is that On the other hand I think it is safe to assume land in Fremont costs more than in Lordstown In any case in trying to figure out the collateral value of the Lordstonw factory for borrowing purposes figure between 50M 100M and that is being generous EV s are the future and old factories not designed for EV s are going to be an increasing liability as EV manufacturing improves Fleets and Government There has been much DD that fleets and government are cost conscious and will want to buy Endurances to save money somehow Some simple specs The Endurance costs 52 500 tows 7 500 lbs has 250 miles of range and sits 5 people The base cybertruck costs 39 900 tows 7 500 lbs has 250 miles of range and sits 6 people So just from that top line projections how anyone suggests fleets will want the Endurance seems wrong How about in terms of servicing the vehicles Does it make sense to suggest that a vehicle with 4 in wheel motors will have less service issues than a vehicle with a single motor that is connected to the wheels via half shafts What about the cost of replacing a motor You have four motors subjected to more abuse and less protected Seems more likely you will have a costly motor replacement what do these motors cost anyways they are Elpahe L1500 s for anyone who can figure this out A chassis mounted motor that is well protected and has better cooling and a better design will probably never need replacing Of course we have the issue with RIDE possibly going bankrupt Where will you source replacement motors from then No one else is making these for pickup trucks Tesla started with high end expensive vehicles as the owners were less sensitive to the risk of Tesla going bankrupt Hard to imagine a company buying a few trucks or more will not be concerned about RIDE s solvency and what that means for supporting their vehicles for years to come Ford by comparison is a well established company that people will trust Tesla is also around for a while and has proven themselves There is more such as whether the in wheel design will work well for a pickup truck But regardless anyone touching this company be ready to lose your money Positions I have a very small position worth about 1 500 in puts Not interested in gambling much on this type of stuff I think the company should be trading at a fraction of where it is but the market does not care what I think In any case they can announce some terrible funding deal tomorrow and the price will jump on irrational exuberance making shorting this or buying puts very risky My advice is not to short or buy puts but to simply stay away

REVENGE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS CHAPTER 1 THE HORSE WILL BE HEARD, Our Apes who art in rocket ships hallowed by thy Workhorse tendies thy moon will come thy will be done on WKHS as it is in GME Give us this day our daily rip and forgive us our short selling as we forgive those who short sell against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the hedgies Amen THE KEY LOGIC BEHIND THIS TRADE WSB the self proclaimed hedge fund short selling to the moon golden golden boys Where are you Why are you removing every WKHS post They have the smallest cap and the highest short interest Are you WSB fellas bought out Are you in kahoots with the SEC I m not trying to call WSB out I m tryin to call WSB up Something smells fishyyyyyyy The CPI data that was reported today wasn t great any which way you slice it inflation is present However the wealthy elite that have 100 million in the bank with nothing to worry about they simply label it as TRANSITORY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY CAN AFFORD TO SPEND 4O ON A SALAD Have you checked your gas grocery bills Yes those are rising again And your salary well I m pretty certain most of you have stayed the same in that regard ie your purchasing power is decreasing and so is the value of your dollars This is when I offer up my idea It s pretty simple really and quite satisfying if done correctly Sell out of some of your longs you know the ones that are already hyper inflated Just a little about 20 of your portfolio Place the proceeds in WKHS and we collectively 10 15x this market cap in under two weeks Many of you sheep fail to realize that the hedge funds are in on the MEME STOCK SUCH AS AMC GME CLOV etc JUST CHECK THEIR HOLDINGS VAST MAJORITY HOLD A PLETHORA OF STOCK AND OPTIONS They have every data point and analytic you can think of firing on all cylinders 24 hours a day SOME HAVE QUANTUM COMPUTERS They are essentially mining money from the blue collar common middle class whenever they buy in Notice those huge volatility spikes THAT S WHEN THEIR ALGORITHMIC PROGRAMS ROB YOU BLIND THE COMMON MAN DOESN T UNDERSTAND DERIVATIVES AND THE VOLATILITY WITHIN THE MARKET AND THE DIFFERENCES OF COMMON STOCK VS DERIVATIVES TRUST ME I WAS ONCE A BLIND APE THINK ABOUT IT APES BE SMARTER THAN WALLSTREET THIS IS A PAY TO PLAY GAME IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN THE MARKET HAS ALWAYS BEEN MADE THAT IS HOW THE FREE MARKETS FUNCTION BUT IN ALL REALITY THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN FREE THEY ARE PAY TO PLAY THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE DOING WHEN YOU ARE BUYING INTO THE MEMES THEY ARE MAKING HAND OVER FIST ON THE COMMON MAN THE SHORT INTEREST ON GME AMC BB ETC THEY ARE ALL BELOW WKHS WITH MARKET CAPS 10X WHY DO YOU THINK WALLSTREET BETS IS CENSORING THE HORSE THEY DON T WANT TO FACE THE WRATH IT S TIME THE WORLD CHANGED IT S NO LONGER A GAME OF WHICH COMPANY IS WORTH WHAT WE VE BEEN WELL BEYOND THAT POINT IT S TIME TO MAKE A STATEMENT BEAT THE MEDIA AND WALLSTREET AT THE SAME TIME ON THEIR HOME FIELD THE TRADE So here comes the trade idea Given that the short interest on WKHS which has a market cap that is almost micro in a sense we find every ape in the jungle to swing on in and scoop up everything We rip the share price of WKHS in a TRANSITORY sense Because after all this is an American born American made company that hedge funds would rather short sell for their own personal gain then invest in helping their own country bring up a startup EV DRONE GREEN ENERGY VEHICLE COMPANY INSTEAD OUR MEDIA WOULD RATHER PUMP ELON MUSK AND TESLA WHO HAS CHILDREN MINING LITHIUM I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS BULLSHIT APES WE MUST USE OUR POWER FOR CHANGE You buy every share available Then you buy every call One week out two weeks out one month out two months out It s that simple Remember TRANSITORY The 20 Share price is so heavily shorted in derivatives that if we can rip through at once we are gone ABOVE 35 AND THEY CANNOT CATCH US I have reason to believe we have potential to be in gamma territory Potential Catalysts The Short sale restriction rule has once been triggered again 2nd time this week furthering the short interest Short sale restriction rule If a stock closes down 10 from previous close said stock has Short sale restriction rule active next trading period Short sale restriction implies you cannot short sell a stock on a down tick that following day Setting up for a beautiful pattern to allow hedgies the inability to short WKHS heavily on a down tick Our Market Capitalization Short Interest Still remains the highest out of any stock on the market today With roughly 2 Billion in market cap a 100 squeeze is do able For instance take CLOV CLOV has a larger market cap and less short interest and still managed to gain over 100 in less than two days WE CAN DO THIS APES WE CAN DEFEAT THE HEDGIES ONCE AND FOR ALL DO NOT BELIEVE THIS MEDIA FABRICATED AMC GME BB TYPE HYPE THEY ARE SIMPLY MINING THE STIMULUS MONEY YOU THREW INTO THE MARKET BACK INTO THEIR POCKETS THE FREE WORLD ISN T FREE

hearing about it being shorted Around early Feb or at least Feb 4th I found this article https www reuters com article us clover health short seller idUSKBN2A41U7 https www reuters com article us clover health short seller idUSKBN2A41U7 Hindenburge Research published a piece on Clover and in the interest of being fair to them you can actually read that report and make up your own mind in the link below https hindenburgresearch com clover https hindenburgresearch com clover The TLDR to me was along the lines of fraud misleading advertising being under investigation by the DOJ Interestingly enough a search about the DOJ investigation does not yeild much except articles that I found going back to early Feb days prior this report being released One catalyst for the stock as its been suppressed by this report IS the DOJ investigation being ended OR concluded in a way that does not really affect CLOV s ability to make money You can do your own DD on just how aggressive the DOJ actually is when it comes to company fraud If you know you know So now that you know the situation so to speak and a little bit about the company lets look at some math on the shares Shares

27M 71 43M shares floating around and this would be very difficult to force a squeeze on as GME had maybe 50 000 shares available during its last squeeze with the proper adjustments in place However

said this implies that 148 28m 1 0625 157 54m shares are owned by institutions We already discovered that there are only 71 43M shares available This can only mean that there are 86 11M shares that

The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148 28m 112 70m 131 57 of the float To make matters worse its extremely complelling to see how the top 5 combination of ownership can even eixst You can look up the ownership on various sites like whale wisom etc An earlier version of this post was deleted for showing the top 6 holdings so I will manually list the top 3 them below Greenoaks Capital Partners LLC 95 33M shares with source date of 03 31 2021 Garipalli Vivek 83 58M shares as of 01 07 2021 Vangaurd group INC 26 18M as of 03 31 2021 To give the utmost fairness here its entirely possible that Greenoaks Capital partners and Garipalli are not accurate with the more likely scenario that Garipalli sold out This still would not change the fact however that Vangaurd and Greenoaks own 121 51M just together as of 03 31 2021 and that is more than the shares outstanding insider shares 112 70M we proved earlier hmmmmmm amp x200B Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140 of the shares shorted this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don t do the math on it With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80 plus spike the other day The reason is Delta As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD s to long calls they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares Why This is called delta hedging I d hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of hedge fund Example Stock xyz has a delta of 0 25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up So you end up writing 10 call options You total delta is 2 50 This translates to around 250 shares 0 25 10 100 needing to be bought to cover This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems So our hedgie buys 250 shares writes their calls and everythings great Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is If delta moves to 0 75 to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares 0 75 0 25 10 call options 500 shares What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher I know that its around 0 55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0 61 for the leaps All in all considering that supposedly 71 43M shares are available this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily amp x200B https preview redd it ze6wiwh0km471

is being extremley extremely conservative So why is the stock down af these past 2 days Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights I m entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too You will notice that from this chart there are only 300 000 shares available Remeber the delta at 0 55 Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every contract so if anyone purchases 5 454 54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available amp x200B https preview redd it k5grp9l1km471 png width 626 amp format png amp auto webp amp s ba33af9e821aa7eb37b6907685e26b1113563f46 https iborrowdesk com report

and Tuesday even wednesday at open really They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves You ll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117 If they do not put this fire out now this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down Just for a little sprinkle on top BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high Now I don t know if there is some simple data mismatch to explain the difference in share amounts etc This stock could 100 go tits up and anyone playing could lose it all so take all this information for what you will and always do your own DD before jumping into this opprotunity TLDR CLOV does not have any available shares every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares so if you would like to do the math on how many contracts till bust you actually can There are at best 300 000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15 000 shares being available and if 5 454 54 contracts which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either There is bad news about CLOV all of a sudden and this is no accident at all

cap that is almost micro in a sense we find every ape in the jungle to swing on in and scoop up everything We rip the share price of WKHS in a TRANSITORY sense Because after all this is an American

doing and draw crayon charts in my spare time Not financial advice Looking at the current state of shares available this puppy is ready to pop off and its just a matter of time regardless if your involved or not There are many times that people predict a massive short squeeze and people just promote random things like naked short selling but this is not what is going on here What is CLOV https finance yahoo com quote CLOV profile p CLOV https finance yahoo com quote CLOV profile p CLOV To note as well CLOV was a SPAC backed by Palihapitiya Why do you keep hearing about it being shorted Around early Feb or at least Feb 4th I found this article https www reuters com article us clover health short seller idUSKBN2A41U7 https www reuters com article us clover health short seller idUSKBN2A41U7 Hindenburge Research published a piece on Clover and in the interest of being fair to them you can actually read that report and make up your own mind in the link below https hindenburgresearch com clover https hindenburgresearch com clover The TLDR to me was along the lines of fraud misleading advertising being under investigation by the DOJ Interestingly enough a search about the DOJ investigation does not yeild much except articles that I found going back to early Feb days prior this report being released One catalyst for the stock as its been suppressed by this report IS the DOJ investigation being ended OR concluded in a way that does not really affect CLOV s ability to make money You can do your own DD on just how aggressive the DOJ actually is when it comes to company fraud If you know you know So now that you know the situation so to speak and a little bit about the company lets look at some math on the shares Shares outstanding 148 28M 24 held by insiders 148 28 0 24 35 58M Shares short May 28th 41 27M shares outstanding insider shares 112 70M Normally we would look at this and say welp 112 70M 41 27M 71 43M shares floating around and this would be very difficult to force a squeeze on as GME had maybe 50 000 shares available during its last squeeze with the proper adjustments in place However things get very interesting When you look at how many shares are held by institutions the number is 106 25 This is obviously highly irregular Say you look up a regular stock like AAPL you will find owned by institutions is 58 69 AMZN is similar at 59 32 With this said this implies that 148 28m 1 0625 157 54m shares are owned by institutions We already discovered that there are only 71 43M shares available This can only mean that there are 86 11M shares that are literally duplicates in some way Investopedia explains that this could be due to a delay in updates BUT investopedia also explains that another reason can be short selling between investors They give a good explaination to follow this up with https www investopedia com ask answers 07 institutional holdings asp https www investopedia com ask answers 07 institutional holdings asp The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148 28m 112 70m 131 57 of the float To make matters worse its extremely complelling to see how the top 5 combination of ownership can even eixst You can look up the ownership on various sites like whale wisom etc An earlier version of this post was deleted for showing the top 6 holdings so I will manually list the top 3 them below Greenoaks Capital Partners LLC 95 33M shares with source date of 03 31 2021 Garipalli Vivek 83 58M shares as of 01 07 2021 Vangaurd group INC 26 18M as of 03 31 2021 To give the utmost fairness here its entirely possible that Greenoaks Capital partners and Garipalli are not accurate with the more likely scenario that Garipalli sold out This still would not change the fact however that Vangaurd and Greenoaks own 121 51M just together as of 03 31 2021 and that is more than the shares outstanding insider shares 112 70M we proved earlier hmmmmmm Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140 of the shares shorted this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don t do the math on it With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80 plus spike the other day The reason is Delta As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD s to long calls they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares Why This is called delta hedging I d hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of hedge fund Example Stock xyz has a delta of 0 25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up So you end up writing 10 call options You total delta is 2 50 This translates to around 250 shares 0 25 10 100 needing to be bought to cover This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems So our hedgie buys 250 shares writes their calls and everythings great Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is If delta moves to 0 75 to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares 0 75 0 25 10 call options 500 shares What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher I know that its around 0 55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0 61 for the leaps All in all considering that supposedly 71 43M shares are available this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily 745 60M shares traded hands Even at the open at 16 60 this equates to 12 376 960 000 in dollars spend and that is being extremley extremely conservative So why is the stock down af these past 2 days Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights I m entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too You will notice that from this chart there are only 300 000 shares available Remeber the delta at 0 55 Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every contract so if anyone purchases 5 454 54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available https iborrowdesk com report CLOV https iborrowdesk com report CLOV On the 3rd of June there were only 15 000 shares available https iborrowdesk com report CLOV https iborrowdesk com report CLOV If you dont pay attention to anything else in this post this section is the crux of everything There were only 15 000 shares availbe on June 3rd and on June 2nd the day before the stock flew up from below 8 to over 9 The very next day after this the stock came down from a gap up to 10 to about 9 and then BOOM breakout happens that very Monday and Tuesday even wednesday at open really They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves You ll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117 If they do not put this fire out now this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down Just for a little sprinkle on top BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high Now I don t know if there is some simple data mismatch to explain the difference in share amounts etc This stock could 100 go tits up and anyone playing could lose it all so take all this information for what you will and always do your own DD before jumping into this opprotunity TLDR CLOV does not have any available shares every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares so if you would like to do the math on how many contracts till bust you actually can There are at best 300 000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15 000 shares being available and if 5 454 54 contracts which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either There is bad news about CLOV all of a sudden and this is no accident at all

MULTIPLE TIMES Billions of naked shorts is the only way it all adds up MOASS INCOMING PREPARE FOR TAKE OFF ,AA tweeted yesterday that their average share calculation is made very simple It is the shares outstanding divided by total number of shareholders This includes institutions insiders and shareholders abroad Pay special attention to shareholders abroad as I will explain this later First we will look at the numbers gt BREAK DOWN OF THE AVERAGE SHARE CALCULATION lt 501 780 240 Shares outstanding 4 100 000 Shareholders eligible to vote 122 Shares in average for all shareholders using outstanding shares This is what AA gave us and he rounded down to 120 shares in average for both institutions insiders and retail investors The number of institutions is 397 and insiders 35 and these are therefore negligible compared to the millions of retail investors and thus they do not matter in the average share calculations We know officially that there was 103 millions reported shares borrowed and sold short May 28th These shares all have new owners and could be added to the float being held 501 780 240 Shares outstanding May 27th 102 300 000 Reported shorts May 27th 604 080 240 Shares officially held Using this the average held shares can be calculated like this 604 080 240 Shares officially held 4 100 000 Shareholders eligible to vote 147 Shares in average for all shareholders using official reported shorts So this is the absolute minimum of average held shares In an ideal market with full transparency this would be the real number Spoiler It is NOT Now let s go back in time and make the same calculation for another key date the 11th of March 450 160 000 Shares outstanding March 11th 3 200 000 Shareholders eligible to vote 140 Shares in average for all shareholders using outstanding shares 450 160 000 Shares outstanding March 11th 49 310 000 Reported shorts as of March 31st 499 470 000 Shares officially held Using this the average held shares as of 11th of March becomes 499 470 000 Shares officially held 3 200 000 Shareholders eligible to vote 156 Shares in average for all shareholders using official reported shorts So using AA s official tweet an average ape held about 140 shares March 11th and 120 June 2nd Using the officially reported shorts an average ape held 156 shares in Match and now they hold an average of 147 AND THIS OF COURSE DOESN T MAKE SENSE I HAVE ONLY ADDED TO MY POSITION I M 100 CONFIDENT THAT APES HAVE ONLY ADDED TO THEIR POSITION WE HAVE BOUGHT THE DIPS AND WE HAVE BOUGHT THE RIPS So we owned the float already in March and not just once Now we own it even more I have tippled down since then I know others have too I hold for you and you hold for me SO LIKE WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE WON WE WILL MOON MOASS WILL BE SPECTACULAR If the number of shares were actually reported to AMC in the shareholder count it would have at least included all the shorts as a short creates a new share and it also has a buyer and therefore is an actual share held by a shareholder I 100 believe that AA and AMC is using the outstanding shares because they have been advised to by their lawyers and possibly SEC running an investigation AA like all of us knows that the officially reported shorts is underreported and shorts are hidden in ITM calls FTDs naked shorts synthetics etc lets called them all phantom shares gt BREAK DOWN OF THE NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDERS lt AA has said that retail now own more than 80 of the shares On May 4th AA said that retail owned 80 already on March 11th count Since then we have grown by 28 Let s break down the 4 100 000 shareholders A person living in the US and Canada count as 1 shareholder But a person living abroad like me are mainly counted through proxy we can not vote and our shares are stored all together at our broker meaning that the 15 000 shareholders at my broker Nordnet only count as 1 shareholder Also it means that the growth of 28 is only in the US 4 100 00 Shareholders June 2nd 3 200 000 Shareholders March 11th 900 000 More shareholders in the US and Canada The US is as Borat would say The Greatest Country in the World but the majority of the Worlds population lives outside the US I would not be surprised if there are 50 or 100 more shareholders living outside the US gt ESTIMATE OF ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES lt The polls made by Matt Trey and more have given us an insight in the number of shares held as of 4th of May 2012 I can t remember what they were at the time of writing this and they have likely grown as most are using every salary to buy additional shares 125 shares x 4 million HODLERS 500 million shares 500 outstanding 0 short 0 naked shorts 150 shares x 4 million HODLERS 600 million shares 500 outstanding 100 short 0 naked shorts 150 shares x 6 million HODLERS 900 million shares 500 outstanding 100 short 300 naked shorts 200 shares x 6 million HODLERS 1200 million shares 500 outstanding 100 short 600 naked shorts 200 shares x 8 million HODLERS 1600 million shares 500 outstanding 100 short 1000 naked shorts 300 shares x 8 million HODLERS 2400 million shares 500 outstanding 100 short 1800 naked shorts I think we own AMC not one time not two times not three times not four times It s more and we own AMC like a lot TLDR The 4 1 million shareholders as of June 2nd includes institutions and insiders in the US CANADA and mainly brokers abroad not individuals abroad There are easily 50 or 100 more apes owning shares in AMC That is 6 8 million shareholders The average of 120 shares held as of June 2nd would have been 140 shares as of March 11th AA confirmed yesterday that he simply used the outstanding shares Hereby he confirms that he is not counting synthetics or even legal shorts We are dumb money but we are smart enough to understand that AMC cannot legally tell us this that Shitadel is STEALING as they say in TEXAS There is an ongoing SEC investigation The numbers proves that almost nobody has sold since March We are more apes than ever We have added to their position through dips and rips We owned AMC in March and we own AMC in June AMC is owned by apes multiple times There must be billions of phantom shares for it all to add up I M MORE CONFIDENT THAN EVER SO LIKE WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE WON WE WILL MOON MOASS WILL BE SPECTACULAR MOON I LL SEE YOU SOON HODL Not financial advice I m plain dumb and only an even dumber retard would not take this with a grain of salt on a banana Do your own DD and challenge this Love y all

mind in the link below https hindenburgresearch com clover https hindenburgresearch com clover The TLDR to me was along the lines of fraud misleading advertising being under investigation by the DOJ Interestingly enough a search about the DOJ investigation does not yeild much except articles that I found going back to early Feb days prior this report being released One catalyst for the stock as its been suppressed by this report IS the DOJ investigation being ended OR concluded in a way that does not really affect CLOV s ability to make money You can do your own DD on just how aggressive the DOJ actually is when it comes to company fraud If you know you know Interestingly enough this report just so happened to come around early Feb and we all remember what was going on with GME at the

The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148 28m 112 70m 131 57 of the float To make matters worse its extremely complelling to see how the top 5 combination of ownership can even eixst You can look up the ownership on various sites like whale wisom etc An earlier version of this post was deleted for showing the top 6 holdings so I will manually list the top 3 them below Greenoaks Capital Partners LLC 95 33M shares with source date of 03 31 2021 Garipalli Vivek 83 58M shares as of 01 07 2021 Vangaurd group INC 26 18M as of 03 31 2021 To give the utmost fairness here its entirely possible that Greenoaks Capital partners and Garipalli are not accurate with the more likely scenario that Garipalli sold out This still would not change the fact however that Vangaurd and Greenoaks own 121 51M just together as of 03 31 2021 and that is more than the shares outstanding insider shares 112 70M we proved earlier hmmmmmm Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140 of the shares shorted this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don t do the math on it With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80 plus spike the other day The reason is Delta As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD s to long calls they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares Why This is called delta hedging I d hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of hedge fund Example Stock xyz has a delta of 0 25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up So you end up writing 10 call options You total delta is 2 50 This translates to around 250 shares 0 25 10 100 needing to be bought to cover This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems So our hedgie buys 250 shares writes their calls and everythings great Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is If delta moves to 0 75 to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares 0 75 0 25 10 call options 500 shares What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher I know that its around 0 55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0 61 for the leaps All in all considering that supposedly 71 43M shares are available this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily amp x200B https preview redd it r7s91znxtm471

is being extremley extremely conservative So why is the stock down af these past 2 days Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights I m entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too You will notice that from this chart there are only 300 000 shares available Remeber the delta at 0 55 Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every contract so if anyone purchases 5 454 54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available amp x200B https preview redd it s3epnniytm471 png width 626 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5838c8616bca2b18c9b773c910e9c68f7a3fa563 https iborrowdesk com report

and Tuesday even wednesday at open really They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves You ll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117 If they do not put this fire out now this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down Just for a little sprinkle on top BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high Now I don t know if there is some simple data mismatch to explain the difference in share amounts etc This stock could 100 go tits up and anyone playing could lose it all so take all this information for what you will and always do your own DD before jumping into this opprotunity TLDR CLOV does not have any available shares every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares so if you would like to do the math on how many contracts till bust you actually can There are at best 300 000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15 000 shares being available and if 5 454 54 contracts which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either There is bad news about CLOV all of a sudden and this is no accident at all

originally posted by twenty98 5 months ago I ve been following this company ever since This was before the Amazon partnership I believe but check this out What and who is Clean Energy Fuels Corp The company is THE leading provide of the cleanest fuel Natural Gas for the transportation market in the United States and Canada They primarily focus in on 1 Regional Fleets of Trucks 2 Heavy Duty Trucking 3 Airport Transit 4 Public Transit 5 Construction Vehicles 6 Waste Management Vehicles Dump trucks It s products consist of Compressed Natural Gas CNG Renewable Natural Gas RNG and Liquefied Natural Gas LNG One of its leading products is something called Redeem which is a form of renewable natural gas RNG won t bother getting into how it s composed but know that it provides up to 70 reduction in greenhouse gasses versus diesel and gasoline Redeem itself is made from organic waste from landfills and farms Natural Gas There has been a lot of stigma around what it really means to be clean or green when it comes to transportation most of us think that Electric Vehicles seem to be the most green product for transportation out there EV s are definitely the future I just want to state that before getting started spewing out more information but RNG has huge demand and can definitely lead the way for clean energy The company itself reduced 745 000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions and more than 401 000 000 gallons were sold in 2019 This may come as a surprise but how clean is natural gas Based only minimal research it looks to be cleaner than the electric truck provided by companies like HYLN Emission Comparison 1 Natural Gas Truck Produces 0 02g bhp hr of NO 2 Electric Truck Produces 0 07g bhp hr of NO 3 Diesel Truck Produces 0 2g bhp hr of NO Financials amp Valuations as of 9 30 2020 Current Market Capitalization as of 1 8 2021 2 032B Total Revenue 3 months 70 886 000 Total Revenue 9 months 216 766 000 Net Profit Loss 3 months 2 539 000 Down from 5 375 000 Net Profit Loss 9 months 8 677 000 Down from 25 964 000 Cash on Hand 91 605 000 The financials of Clean Energy are not very special yes they have a high PE ratio but in this market really anything is possible The point is the opportunity with Biden supplementing a lot of stimulus into the clean energy market Clean Energy Fuels Corp is poised to get a large piece with it being such a staple within the Natural Gas industry Partnerships amp Programs 1 Chevron Chevron partnered with CLNE on July 8th 2020 with the announcement of the Adopt a Port program This will allow fleets across North America to subsidize costs transitioning into a greener product for transportation with cost advantages Chevron will provide funding for Adopt a Port and supply RNG to Clean Energy stations near the ports Chevron s funding will allow truck operators to subsidize the cost of buying new RNG powered trucks Clean Energy meanwhile will manage the program including offering fueling services for qualified truck operators 2 Total SE Total is a very large company focusing in refining petroleum They are the largest shareholder of CLNE 26 of outstanding shares Again a large company partnering with CLNE to produce revenues in the current year and future years With Total SE they ve partnered with CLNE in a joint venture valued at around 145 million to launch the Zero Now Program The Zero Now Program allows companies to purchase a natural gas truck for the same price as they could buy a diesel truck in the combined deal they would also offer a discount for fuel up until an agreed time to help persuade the companies to go greener 3 BP The third partner is BP CLNE recently announced that it will work with BP to develop own and operate RNG facilities at dairies and other agriculture facilities that will produce Redeem The deal is quite small but could mean big things if the partnership were to be progressed through time 4 Waste Connections Waste connections is the 3rd largest waste collections company in North America based on market cap they re currently worth around 40B They ve been a partner with CLNE for years and have recently promoted one of their regional fleets of dump trucks to RNG vehicles and will begin operating with Redeem as soon as possible The fleet consists of 110 trucks in the San Jose area The deal itself isn t that great I must admit but this could mean big things as if the trial goes well in the San Jose area this could mean upgrades to their regional fleets across the United States and possibly into Canada 5 Republic Services Another large company with a long partnership history with Clean Energy Fuels Corp In February 2019 they announced that they will utilize increasing amounts of Redeem fuel across 21 states over the next 5 years and this is in process This transition to cleaner fuel will represent 250 000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emission reduction each year which translates to around 53 000 passenger vehicles to be taken off the road Summary of Partnerships amp Programs These partnerships will continue to provide Clean Energy Fuels Corp with recurring revenues to drive growth across North America Their recent and past partnerships continue to give rise to increasing demand of natural gas in one of the largest industries that demands fuel of this nature The programs in place Zero Now amp Adopt a Port program were introduced and will drive growth in the industry by providing incentives to adopting RNG vehicles instead of gasoline or diesel powered vehicles There are a lot of advantages to adopting Redeem 70 reudction in greenhouse gases Cost efficient offered at 1 00 gallon Renewable Domestic Moving North America towards energy independence Growth amp Opportunities With most of the world in lockdown and the rise of eCommerce and the need for shipping and delivery services this will drive the demand for their Redeem product Companies like UPS Kroger FedEx and Republic Services have already signed up for large deals to use the product as a substantially lower cost then Diesel or Gas The cost of Redeem is 1 00 gallon to give you perspective Volume growth for their Redeem Product in the past 3 years averaged 34 67 growth and this was before the Pandemic The Heavy Duty Truck industry is one of the largest markets for fuel consumption and so the opportunities are endless to gain more market share as governments are demanding for greener transportation The Heavy Duty trucing industry demands 35 billion gallons of fuel 30 billion over any other market in the big rig industries There are a lot of opportunities for future advancement throughout the space by making partnerships that will be mutually beneficial for both the world CLNE and the company involved Companies that currently use Natural Gas for their national fleets include Honda FritoLay FedEx Anheuser Busch Verizon Bimbo J amp J Waste Management Republic Services Home Depot Lowes AT amp TT Costco Colgate Palmolive PepsiCo UPS HP Unilever Starbucks Amazon Kraft Kroger and McDonalds These companies are large and there is huge potential for future partnerships with them Other Notes You may be asking yourself that s not really that impressive why should I invest Well the recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies Government s are transitioning to non gas related vehicles and this will continue to be progressed for years to come The company itself has recently been partnering with well known industry leaders that want to be first movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation The CEO owns 0 7 of shares outstanding Current shares outstanding are 198M and of this the CEO himself owns approximately 1 38 million shares He definitely believes in the company Price Targets Some people may be curious of my price targets for CLNE It s been on an absolute tear recently so I apologize for the late post but this is just the beginning My conservative price target is 20 by June 2021 40 by end of 2022 this is pretty much guessing lol so take it with a grain of salt Disclosure Do your own due diligence before investing this is just my personal opinion on the company and this is not financial advice of any kind I m not liable for any losses that you guys might incur But I do believe in this company

ins and outs of Virgin Galactic Company Overview Here is a Statement from SPCE s 10 K filing https sec report Document 0001706946 21 000056 that explains their mission and business We are a vertically integrated aerospace company pioneering human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers as well as a manufacturer of advanced air and space vehicles Using our proprietary and reusable technologies and supported by a distinctive Virgin branded customer experience we are developing a spaceflight system designed to offer customers whom we refer to as future astronauts a unique multi day transformative experience This culminates in a spaceflight that includes views of Earth from space and several minutes of weightlessness that will launch from Spaceport America New Mexico We believe that one of the most exciting and significant opportunities of our time lies in the commercial exploration of space and the development of technology that will change the way we travel across the globe in the future Together we are opening access to space to change the world for good Virgin Galactic is an Aerospace company that is among the first to enter into the commercial space flight industry Virgin Galactic believes in the massive potential of space exploitation and monetization of commercial space flight and is positioning themselves to be a leader in the space pun intended The market for commercial space flight is a new concept that is yet to be explored however there are a few other companies that are trying to break into this industry as well i e LMT Lockheed Martin https utradea com stocks LMT In the history of mankind there have only been 581 humans to ever explore space However all of these people have been handpicked by governmental space agencies https en wikipedia org wiki List of government space agencies and have been trained for many years Virgin Galactic is trying to change this and make space flight available to high net worth individuals at the moment so that these seemingly regular people have the chance to do something extraordinary and explore what space has to offer Thus far Virgin Galactic has 80M in deposits from over 600 people who are interested in using Virgin Galactic as a vehicle to explore space Virgin Galactic is expecting to receive their last FAA approval needed to fly their customers in their aircrafts Investment Information Commercial Space Flight Industry Over the past decade space flight has been innovated consistently through rapidly advancing technologies decreasing costs and greater access to capital for private space flight companies organizations Many governments have taken a hands off approach to space flight and funded private companies who compete for contracts and are forced to be constantly innovating in order to win these contracts This competition has resulted in technologies that greatly reduce the waste emissions and cost of space travel Virgin Galactic has been able to incorporate the best innovations in space flight into their aircrafts to create a reusable rocket that increases launch consistency number of launches and decreases the cost of space exploration Lastly Virgin Galactic is exploring certain strategic relationships in order to advance their technologies identify new applications accelerate their progress and enhance their growth as a company Financial Information Financial Performance Good Virgin Galactic increased their R amp D expenses by 19 YoY although this is considered a cost it is necessary for their business to spend on R amp D and I believe the improvements in technology derived from R amp D spending will be considered an asset in the future Financial Performance Bad In 2020 Virgin Galactic s revenues decreased by 93 7 their gross profit decreased by 96 34 their net loss increased by 199 79 and their net margin decreased from 47 to 27 This is due to the fact that the US government decreased their engineering service budget having adverse effects on Virgin Galactic s business Liquidity Position Virgin Galactic currently has a cash position of 665 9M and an additional 13M of restricted cash Having this many cash should help Virgin Galactic to weather the storm in the meantime until the eventually are able to have a positive net income Stock Based Compensation Virgin Galactic s board of directors along with the shareholders adopted the 2019 Incentive Award Plan which reserved 21 21M common shares to be awarded to employees consultants and directors If these shares were to be distributed evenly over the next 3 years there would be dilutionary effects of 2 85 year Director Compensation Table Virgin Galactic awards members on their board with stock awards in 2020 Virgin Galactic gave out awards of 124 994 to 4 board members totalling 500k of stock compensation In Virgin Galactic s 10 K report they stated that this compensation resulted in a total of 99 465 shares distributed to these members This would cause share dilution of around 0 04 which is essentially negligible Anniversary Awards Virgin galactic also gave out some anniversary awards to some of their highest ranking employees to recognize their ongoing service In 2020 they gave out 931 93 common shares to 4 of their longest standing high ranking employees this would cause share dilution of 0 4 although this dilution is not a large figure it still adds up over time Colglazier Awards In 2020 Virgin Galactic awarded their CEO Michael Colglazier with a maximum of 1 070 000 in monthly installments over 60 months This represents 214 000 shares being distributed to him every year which would have a dilutionary effect of 0 09 year Palermo Awards Furthermore in 2020 Virgin Galactic also awarded their COO Enrico Palermo with a maximum of 200 828 shares however upon retirement he only decided to take 25 50 207 shares which would cause a dilution of existing shares of 0 02 Exercisable Options Currently there are 717 603 underlying shares in options that are exercisable If all of these options are exercised there will be dilutionary effects of around 0 3 although this is not much it adds up Virgin Galactic s Strategy Virgin Galactic plans to use their proprietary and reusable flight system to seek to provide affordable safe reliable and regular transportation to space for their customers Virgin Galactic has highlighted a few ways in which they intend to achieve this Commercial program for Human Spaceflight Virgin Galactic is in their final stages of readying their commercial spaceflight program and has been vigorously testing their VSS Unity Spaceship https www virgingalactic com mission Currently they are happy with the performance and are completing the final touches like adding a cabin interior before they prepare their first future astronauts for space Expanding their Fleet of Rockets Virgin Galactic plans to build more of their VSS Unity Rockets to expand their fleet of vehicles Furthermore they are working on building two SpaceShip III vehicles By creating these vehicles Virgin Galactic is hoping to increase their annual flight rate which will help them to maximize their revenues Lowering Costs Virgin Galactic is constantly looking for ways to improve their manufacturing and operating efficiency in order to decrease their total cost per spaceship Furthermore as they continue to manufacture additional spaceships and improve their technology they believe that their costs will decrease smoothly over time Leverage their Proprietary Technology Virgin Galactic intends to continue to expand on their proprietary technologies to pursue growth opportunities and enter into agreements with other government organizations for the use of their ships Management Team It is very important to look at the credentials of the management team https www virgingalactic com who we are our team especially when looking at high growth stocks that have mainstream hype Furthermore this is increasingly important when looking at SPACs or companies who previously were listed publicly via SPAC like Virgin Galactic By looking at the management team you get an idea of their experience and expertise in the field which helps to validate the company and decrease the chances of a scam A great example of a SPAC with an awful management team is NKLA Nikola https utradea com stocks NKLA and look at what happened to them Virgin Galactic s CEO was formerly the Chief of Staff at NASA and was the Space Shuttle Launch Integration Manager at NASA as well Virgin Galactic s President of Aerospace Systems has 20 years of experience in aerospace defense and cyber security industries Virgin Galactic s VP of Engineering had 40 years of experience working under Lockheed Martin Virgin Galactic s team of pilots has 269 years of combined flight experience with organizations like NASA RCAF RAF US Air Force and the US Marine Corps Furthermore there are many distinguished members on Virgin Galactics Space Advisory board including former NASA Chief of Staff George Whitesides and former astronauts Sandy Magnus and Chris Hadfield I think that this management team is well rounded and very experienced This is very good to see in a business as technical as Virgin Galactic s and it shows me the legitimacy of their business and their future potential Furthermore there is no doubt in my mind that this is a legitimate company who is making serious efforts to change space travel for all of mankind Competitors Virgin Galactic has competition both in the private space and in the public markets Virgin Galactic s private competition provides more of a threat to their operations business so I decided to include them However Virgin Galactic s public competitors are not as big of a threat but I have to include them in this section because of the comparable analysis that is later to come Virgin Galactic s private competitors include Space X and Blue Origin both of these companies namely Space X have made tremendous strides in the space travel industry and have made several advancements that have made space travel easier to access Virgin Galactic s public competitors are companies that operate similarly to Virgin Galactic have similar goals for their business and are listed on the public markets These companies include The Boeing Company BA https utradea com stocks BA Lockheed Martin Corp LMT https utradea com stocks LMT Aerojet RocketDyne Holdings Inc AJRD https utradea com stocks AJRD and Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc SPR https utradea com stocks SPR These companies will be seen again in the comparable analysis where I will compare the financial ratios and multiples of Virgin Galactic to that of these competitors Investment Valuation The only way in which I could value Virgin Galactic is via comparable analyses Furthermore since there were only 3 multiple and or ratios that exhibited a positive number I had to choose to compare those ratios multiples The ratios multiples that I chose were P B https www fool com investing how to invest stocks price to book ratio PEG https www thebalance com fundamental analysis understanding the peg ratio 3140796 and EV Assets https www wallstreetmojo com ev to assets P B By comparing Virgin Galactic s P B ratio against their public competitors listed above in the competitors section of this report I arrived at a fair value per share of SPCE of 25 73 which implies a downside risk of 29 24 EV Assets By comparing Virgin Galactic s EV Assets multiple to that of their public competitors I arrived at an implied downside of 69 17 or a share price of 11 21 PEG The last ratio that I examined was the PEG which implied an upside of 14 99 to a share price of 41 81 Average Comparable In order to arrive at an unbiased valuation I decided to take the average of the 3 results that I arrived at through my comparable analyses By doing this I got an all encompassing fair value of 26 25 share which would imply a downside risk of 27 80 I do not think that this is the be all and end all for valuing SPCE because in this analysis I compared their ratios multiples to other companies that were already more mature and were not solely focused on commercial space flight An example of this is Boeing Boeing has plans for space travel however their business is generated through the sale of airplanes this is vastly different from Virgin Galactic so the comparable does not make the most sense So although Virgin Galactic is not an undervalued stock today they may be in the future when they make their own revenues However I do think that this valuation implies that current and potential investors should be aware of the risk and potential downside of this investment however wherever there is risk there is reward and the reward for this investment could be astronomical once again pun intended Risks Share Dilution Virgin Galactic has a lot of programs and awards that incentivize their employees and directors through stock compensation These programs awards include stock based compensation director compensation table anniversary awards Colglazier awards Palermo awards and exercisable option awards By grouping all of this dilution into one figure we arrive at a maximum dilution for the year 2020 to be 3 68 This is a large number and should be considered by new and existing shareholders alike However this is a high growth potential investment so it is not uncommon to have higher figures of dilution Financial Performance Virgin Galactic s financial performance in 2020 was very poor however it was due to the loss of contractual revenue from the US government In the grand scheme of things Virgin Galactic will not be relying on the US Government for the majority of their revenues so it should not scare away investors from the bigger picture revenues for Virgin Galactic Catalysts FAA Approval If Virgin Galactic can get their last 2 approvals from the FAA they can start to take their commercial space flight business seriously and start to generate their own revenues Once they start generating their own revenues they should be able to turn a profit and work towards overall profitability of the business Successful Flights If Virgin Galactic can continue to have successful trials and flights their reputation as a commercial space travel business will be solidified This is especially important during the early stages of their business because trust is everything TLDR Great financials strong leadership and milestone accomplishments SPCE is poised for continued growth if they can continued down this path Credit to u Lost Guarantee229 https www reddit com u Lost Guarantee229 original analysis can be found here https utradea com positions 60c212d524731e30f5a930a6

tHiS mEaN cAnoO gO mOoN , TLDR Not putting odds on it but it s absolutely possible that Apple buys or partners with GOEV and you never hear from me again because I m rich as fuck sipping incredible hulks on a tropical beach somewhere For those who want to know how I arrived at that conclusion here s a wall of text First I m going to lay out what we absolutely know to be true about the connections between Apple and Canoo then I m going to speculate A lot Please don t wyl out and YOLO your entire life savings into anything ever but especially don t do it here With that disclaimer out of the way I m gonna give you a few reasons why I YOLO d a decent chunk of my life savings into GOEV and why I m reasonably confident I won t feel like an asshole when all is said and done Okay Because I ve had this conversation too many fucking times I have a good sense of the questions people ask when walking down this path So I m gonna to try and anticipate and answer them in advance If you still think I m delusional after reading through this hit me in the comments and I ll try to fill in whatever gaps I can Here we go QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS How do we know Apple was really interested in Canoo Wasn t that just a rumor Apple was absolutely interested in Canoo There s no question about that at this point and you should slap anyone who suggest it s a debate This January 2021 article from The Verge https www theverge com 2021 1 12 22225026 apple canoo acquisition investment electric car goev lays it all out but I like you guys so here s the TLDR Apple was talking to Canoo because they wanted their patent pending skateboard Apple was talking to Canoo about investing in or buying them Canoo didn t want to sell Talks fell apart Didn t Apple ghost Canoo We don t know who ghosted who The article only says talks fell apart But we have enough information to speculate on why they didn t get a deal done According to The Verge article Apple was considering buying Canoo but Canoo was like nah we re good Wut Why the fuck would Canoo say no to Apple We don t know for sure but if we assume the execs at Canoo are logical rational business people it would have been some variation of fuck that we can make more money if we do it ourselves It s also possible the talks never advanced to the stage of Apple making or discussing the parameters of an offer but there are a few reasons I find that hard to believe 1 Apple has 204B IN CASH There s no way they would have been priced out of buying Canoo if they wanted them bad enough Canoo s market cap is 2 3B Apple could pull that out of the cushions of the lobby couches in Cupertino 2 This is when smooth brains say yeah see that proves Apple didn t want to buy them 3 Sure that s one way to read it but if that were true why did one of the most valuable companies in the history of mankind trip over their multi hundred billion dollar dick to hire the dude who co founded Canoo and created the skateboard to HELP RUN THEIR ENTIRE CAR BUSINESS within weeks of him hitting the market 4 The most logical answer is they LOVED the technology he helped to create at Canoo and wanted as much of it as they could get their hands on without getting sued into the abyss yes Apple s abyss is much shallower than ours 5 At the very least they value his expertise and want him to help them create or refine something for them that s similar to what he created at GOEV 6 But there s at least one other reason they may have been so eager to hire Canoo s former CEO 7 Because they still want the skateboard and no one would be better positioned to help them integrate GOEV s team and technology into Apple s plans than the guy who co founded and led the company But Canoo fired the former CEO right Why would he want to work with them now Well he definitely wasn t fired but among us CanooBros the working hypothesis is he was pushed out because Canoo s new CEO Tony Tequila wanted to run the show Now I m petty af and wouldn t want to work with anyone A named Tony Tequila or B who pushed me out of the company I fucking co founded and built from the ground up But Canoo s former CEO is the ultimate wringle brain seriously just look at this picture of his galaxy sized brain cavity And if he s more emotionally mature than me a five year old then he might realize he could make a metric fuck ton of money by swallowing his pride and helping Apple to get a deal done with Canoo See he still owns at least 1 257 987 shares of GOEV which is currently worth 12 3M and would assuredly multiply if a deal got done between Apple Canoo Disclaimer There could be all kinds of reasons this is a stupid hypothesis from Apple s internal corporate policy on self dealing to laws that preclude this kind of transaction occurring but I m not smart enough to figure that shit out so if someone drops legit proof that this outcome is an impossibility I ll edit for accuracy and clarity SO UR SAYIN APPLE n CANOO MAKE CAR TOGETHER AND APES GIT LAMBOS No I am absolutely not saying this is going to happen But I am saying I don t see why it couldn t

new ones as soon as they drop follow me here https utradea com member portfolio WallStreetWhale Company Overview Currently Naked Brands business is operated through their main subsidiary Frederick s of Hollywood FOH and through some of their other subsidiaries which will be mentioned later on through selling intimates products sleepwear loungewear swimwear amp swimwear accessories and costume products Since 1946 FOH has set the standard for innovative apparel and was the first to introduce the push up bra padded bra and black lingerie products into the US markets This history of innovation has led FOH to become one of the world s most recognizable apparel brands in the world Through an exclusive licensee deal Naked has garnered the rights to sell the whole range of FOH products Naked s strategy is to use the existing reputation of FOH to drive sales on a pure e commerce business strategy Naked plans to leverage their managements expertise in operations development capital markets and e commerce to build their brand They are focused on growing retaining their customer base grow their sales and increase their profitability by leveraging the FOH reputation Lastly Naked is planning to make investments into brands and technologies to strengthen their customer experience by innovating their products and platforms Part of the investments that I mentioned are acquisitions that will provide synergistic benefits which I will explain later Investment Information Seasonality Naked has stated that their business is seasonal in nature and consists of two selling periods the first half and the second half of the year Naked generates the majority of their sales during the second half of the year which can be contributed to the holiday season The second half of the year generated 57 of Naked s annual revenues in 2021 and 2019 Trademarks and Patents Naked owns the Frederick s of Hollywood trademark through their license agreement This trademark is very valuable as the name carries a lot of weight Brands Bendon Brand Sold this branch https ca finance yahoo com news naked brand group announces final 123100903 html of their business on April 30th 2021 o Bendon Man o Me o By Bendon o Davenport o Lovable o Hickory o Fayreform Naked Brands o Heidi Klum Intmates o Frederick s of Hollywood o Pleasure State Bendon Brand Sale On April 30th 2021 JADR Holdings bought Bendon Brand from Naked for 1 NZD as the brand was burning cash quickly and incurring increasing net losses Real Estate Portfolio As of FYE 2020 Naked Brand reports that they own 59 separate retail locations which are mainly located in malls strip malls and strips in Australia and New Zealand In 2020 Naked only closed one of their retail locations which is surprising due to the effects of COVID especially on retail businesses in malls It is good to see that Naked owns their own real estate domestically as it is considered an asset and in many cases is better for the financial reports than leasing renting Shift to e Commerce Naked was an international brand and sold their products in Australia New Zealand United Kingdom USA and Internationally Recently they have been scaling back on their physical presence as they are going all in on their e commerce strategy however they still sell their products internationally Naked has scaled their presence down from 5 241 physical locations in the countries previously mentioned in 2019 to now just 181 physical locations in 2021 Management Team Justin Rice CEO and Chairman Mr Rice https ir nakedbrands com management team was previously the CEO of Bendon Limited and prior to this was a co founder of Pleasure state bought by Bendon This is good because it shows that Mr Rice has experience in the business however as we know Bendon was not successful which may speak against Rice s abilities Mark Ziirsen CFO Mr Ziirsen https ir nakedbrands com management team previously has senior finance leadership roles with many large Australian companies such as Cochlear Aristocrat Coca Cola and Goodman Fielder Although he doesn t have much experience in the apparel business he is the CFO which requires less knowledge about apparel and more knowledge about finance which he has an abundance of Board of Directors Naked s board of directors https ir nakedbrands com board of directors exhibit extensive experience in apparel and related industries and the 3 main directors have 55 years experience in apparel and related industries This management team looks solid and by looking on the surface these people at least on paper look fit to run this business However my only concern is with Justin Rice and the potential that he has a repeat of Bendon hopefully he has learned from that event and can translate this new knowledge and caution to Naked Financial Information February 2021 Private Placement On February 24 2021 Naked entered into a securities purchase agreement with accredited investors This agreement allowed these accredited investors to purchase 117 65M common shares for 0 85 share and with this each share purchase they also received 1 warrant totalling 117 65M warrants sold These warrants expire in March 10 2026 and have an exercise price of 0 935 share If all of these warrants were converted into common shares at expiry and then sold and all of the original common shares were sold as well there would be 235 3M shares dumped into the markets Given todays current number of shares outstanding this would have a dilutionary effect of 30 10 however as we know the warrants expire in early 2026 so the average dilution would be 5 4 year This number is high however high amounts of dilution are common with high growth stocks like Naked ATM Offering In February of 2021 Naked entered into an agreement with Maxim Group to sell them 69 27M shares for 69 12M 0 9978 share This caused a dilutionary effect of 8 86 which once again is relatively high and something to watch out for Bendon Conversion Shares As part of the deal agreement between Naked and JADR Holdings Naked agreed to give Bendon 3 8M at the time of convertible shares Recently these convertible shares were converted into common shares resulting in an aggregate of 45 93M shares This diluted the existing shares by 6 24 and further adds to total amount of dilution this year Financial Performance Bad FOH s net sales declined by 9 6 YoY Naked s net loss increased by 39 46 net sales decreased by 11 This poor financial performance can be attributed to the sale of Bendon restructuring according to the new business model and the closure of Naked s physical locations due to COVID Financial Performance Good There is not much to celebrate financially this year due to the sale of Bendon closing stores and restructuring however this is understandable due to COVID However there was some good as their gross profits increased by 0 3 their New Zealand revenues increased by 1 02 their e Commerce sales rose by 0 4 and they reported a positive EBITDA for the first time in at least 4 years Competition Naked noted in their SEC 20 F filing https sec report Document 0001493152 21 012133 m 006 that The sale of women s intimate apparel personal care and beauty products is a very competitive business And that they have numerous competitors including individual stores chains department stores and discount retailers Majority of their competition is private however there are a couple of companies that are public that are also in the apparel space and will be used in my comparable analysis later on in this analysis These public companies include SGC Superior Group of Companies https utradea com stocks SGC OXM Oxford Industries https utradea com stocks OXM LAKE Lakeland Industries https utradea com stocks LAKE and DLA Delta Apparel https utradea com stocks DLA Investment Valuation The only valuation of Naked that I can currently undergo given their financial position is a set of comparable analyses For this valuation I will be taking the average fair value reached via comparing Naked s P B EV Revenue and EV Assets to that of their competitors P B By comparing Naked s P B to that of their competitors I arrived at a fair value of 0 40 share which represents a share price decrease of 45 2 EV Revenue By comparing the EV Revenue multiple of Naked to their competitors I arrived at an implied downside of 21 92 which implies a share price of 0 57 EV Assets I arrived at a similar result of that achieved in the EV Revenue comparable by comparing the EV Assets multiple of Naked to their competitors I arrived at an implied downside of 23 29 which implies a share price of 0 56 Average Comparable In order to avoid any possible bias in my analysis I have decided to take the average of all 3 comprable analyses that I underwent By doing this I arrived at one all encompassing fair value of 0 51 which implies a downside of 30 14 Argument Against the Valuation It is very hard to compare a high growth hype stock to public competitors because none of these companies exhibit the same share price growth or volatility that Naked does This is evident by their big fluctuation in results in my comparable between the start of 2021 and where we are currently in 2021 As a result this comparable may not be accurately portraying the value of Naked so take the valuation with a grain of salt Furthermore the companies that I am comparing Naked to do not operate in the same sub sections of apparel as Naked and they are in different stages of their business as some of them are in their maturing stages For this reason I think that the valuation could be off however it still implies that Naked is overvalued and as investors we need to consider this With Naked s high growth potential I think that the potential upside of this investment is worth the potential downside risk highlighted by the comparable Risks Dilution So far in 2021 and in some cases very late 2020 there has been a lot of share dilution Naked has diluted shares via their February 2021 Private Placement their ATM offering and their Bendon convertible shares This year alone all of these sources of dilution will account for a total dilutionary effect of approximately 20 5 using these years weighted average of the Feb 2021 Private Placement These levels of dilution are very high even for a high growth stock like NAKD Naked Brands https utradea com stocks NAKD and need to be considered by current and potential investors Financial Performance This year Naked exhibited a very poor financial performance however this is understandable as it is attributed to COVID This is understandable as one of the hardest hit industries is retail and malls which is reflected in their financial performance If this type of performance continues than the future for Naked will not be a favourable one and scare off investors Catalysts Financial Performance If Naked can have a solid rebound through a great financial performance this year than this already pent up stock has the potential to soar One of the biggest things holding investors back for this stock is their lackluster financial performances recently however a strong financial year can greatly benefit the share price Reddit We have seen it once and are ready to see it again Earlier this year amidst the reddit and GameStop pump we saw Naked s share price take off over 100 s of percentage points If reddit can get behind this stock again and build up positive sentiment Naked can once again become a social media growth stock Re Opening Any sort of further re opening of businesses and malls will help Naked to get back into their physical locations and start selling their products again However this may not help greatly due to their shift and focus of their e Commerce segment

everyone Since I first started following these stocks back in December I ve taken to doing daily write ups to add a few wrinkles to my smoothness Amid this new wave of squeezing and retracing I figured I d share my thoughts on our recent events in the hopes that some clarity can bolster some otherwise wavering spirits out there Whenever these stocks retrace there tends to be a lot of talk of manipulation short attacks and illegal naked shorting While these sorts of things have likely occurred certainly during our earlier squeeze events in Q1 this time around I m not seeing much outside of what looks like organic but perhaps partially orchestrated gamma hedging flows Now I don t actually trade on a futures platform so I can t actually see these flows in real time Nonetheless I ll share my thoughts on what appears to have been going on Yesterday I m sure you noticed that all the memestocks took a big hit some of them more than others By my assessment we had several factors contribute to this breakdown in Px levels across the board 1 A decrease in relative call volume 2 Theta decay into the Jun 11 OPEX 3 The weakening of retail focus I ll go into these one at a time 1 Decreased Call Volume Basically what keeps these gamma squeezes going is hedging flow MM Hedging flow is the single greatest force in the market and its directed by options If people buy lots of calls market makers have to buy shares to hedge their short positions sold calls in order to protect themselves Remember the house ALWAYS wins and like it or not we want it to stay that way As long as they do they ve got incentives to keep the game going and while a river flows things grow When call volume in these stocks slows down the flows lessen and counterflows start to take hold Part of what we saw yesterday was bullish flow weakening relative to bearish flows 2 OPEX Theta Decay Another thing to keep in mind is how hedging flows are affected by theta decay As OTM contracts approach OPEX their ITM probability decreases As this probability decreases the MMs who sold the contracts become free to liquidate their hedges Selling a short hedge means dumping shares As the shares dump the downward forces on the stock compound as higher calls see lower and lower ITM probabilities This continues until call and put gamma becomes balanced edited 3 Dispersed Retail Focus This plays into 1 Decreased call volume As retail and institutional focus gets distributed across a greater number of tickers ability to concentrate call volume decreases As I mentioned as call volume decreases and the call OI stops growing relative to put OI upward momentum on the stock stalls out and gets overcome by bearish flow The more tickers that get roped into the memestock group the weaker the concentration of buying power will be There are of course incentives to do this though As a single ticker builds higher and higher at a rapid rate the IV kicks up and makes the options contracts more and more expensive As the contracts themselves become more expensive buying power contract distribution gets weaker stalling the squeeze further Let s talk some specific tickers now GME Top of everybody s list GME had earnings AH Wednesday Leading up to earnings GME was able to mount the Hedge Wall at the 300 Px This put it right in the middle of a gamma dead zone not unlike SPX s 4060 level SpotGamma talks about in their daily posts With the right amount of push in one direction or the other hedging flow would build for GME and increase the momentum of its directional move the farther it went We saw a bit of this kick in on Wednesday proper as GME road it s positive momentum ramp up toward the 340 level though it was countered by some targeted short options buying to keep things from getting out of control When the IV died after earnings combined with organic loss of ITM probability on a good number of GME calls bearish flow compounded and we saw the run down to around 210 we saw yesterday It s possible as well there was a good bit of profit taking and perhaps even insider selling added to this straight arrow down Potentially promising for GME is that we did eventually reach a neutral point and reversed to around 230 in the after hours which is our current Key Gamma strike The Hedge Wall currently sits at 200 while the distribution of gamma between 200 and 230 is rather scattered rather than sloped indicating some potential slight downward momentum to build on any external downward pushes but ultimately a situation that should bind GME to the 200 230 PX range Dark Pools indicated decently heavy buying overnight 52 on the indicator with gt 45 indicating heavy buying while IV also declined into the end of the day A downward movement with declining IV is actually a bullish signal as indicates a lower likelihood of downward acceleration Overall I think GME ends the week largely consolidating barring any intervention of external heavy selling Holding the 200 level after earnings was a great sign for continued action down the road AMC Memestock 1A of the group began the week bullish off of last week s downturn with a gradually rising Key Gamma Strike heading into Wednesday Much like GME call volume dipped after Wednesday and Thursday s KGS regressed from 55 to 50 overnight Wednesday With over 40 of it s gamma expiring tonight AMC was hit hard yesterday by theta decay and MMs selling their short hedges en masse Nonetheless the massive gamma position at 40 our Hedge Wall held firm much to my delight as I had a limit buy fill Today s KGS is now down to 40 from 50 lining up with our Hedge Wall heading into next week While we can probably expect some greater volatility heading into Monday that 40 support doesn t look like it ll evaporate without large flow external selling catalysts as the gamma positions at 40 stays in place into next Friday s OPEX RKT The third wheel of the squeeze group which tends to go off on its own schedule somewhat independent of the others accordingly did not suffer nearly as harsh a drop during yesterday s trading day This was still a drop a bit harsher than I expected based on the aggressive upward move in RKT s key gamma strike I saw heading into Wednesday s close around 2pm we had some large amounts of call buying come in and push our Key Gamma Strike up from 21 5 to 22 only to be countered back down by some Bearish Whale Put buying approx 1 5 of our total put volume on the day in the last 45min of the trading day On Thursday RKT then suffered from the same ails which plagued GME and AMC lower call volume and theta decay into the Jun 11 OPEX Nevertheless despite the downward move RKT held pretty well closing at only about 5 down on what was a bloodbath across the other memestocks The KGS and Hedge Wall have moved back down to the 20 5 21 level heading into tonight s OPEX which is a bearish signal However the lower key delta strike from yesterday and the consolidation above the 20 mark are good signs for a potential set up for next week I may have entered my positions for next week a little early and next week may not be a crazy squeeze type event but I m sticking to my bullish thesis on this one based on the signals I ve seen so far Feel free to offer critique or yell incoherently They re both beneficial Probably

and it s definitely true now that MRNA s price has increased 20 in the last ten days using 224 high For an explanation of this bear thesis see the original post linked at the top While I failed to time the top you might be able to get closer because there s now even more reason to be bearish As described in the previous post when it comes to biotech fundamentals are the breaking the news Second World Trade Organization WTO talks to waive vaccine patent gains momentum What caused the last mass sell of MRNA in early May Biden simply announcing his support to circumvent the IP patents on the covid19 vaccines He declared his support for removing them and freeing up production of the vaccine 1 Why would this cause MRNA to crash Because despite what bulls say such a move would devastate the profit potential of the covid vaccine MRNA s only approved product to date In a bid launched by India and South Africa the WTO actually met this week to begin negotiations on the subject And in these talks 100 out of 164 countries are said to already be on board with the waivers 3 The WTO is meeting again over the next few weeks and an initial report is expected July 21st 3 Third MRNA vaccines appear to cause heart inflammation myocarditis in some young people CDC calls emergency meeting 226 cases have been reported in the under 30 age group in the U S which is more than double the prevalence normally expected 4 The vast majority have recovered but 41 have ongoing symptoms 15 are still hospitalized and 3 are in the intensive care unit 5 Another source is claiming 270 total reported cases 6 and yet another source is claiming 800 cases 7 Using the number of 270 considering that there have been 141 million full vaccinations in the U S this boils down to about 1 case in every 500 000 thousand people This should be seen as an upper limit however given that younger males under age 30 are said to have higher rates of affliction and we used the entire vaccinated population which is weighted towards elderly This is actually a significant risk for young people compared to their abysmal risk of actually dying from covid 8 which is maybe 1 in 15 million if there are no co morbidities present In light of all this news the CDC is convening an emergency meeting June 18th 9 This is the next big catalyst and along with the ever growing bubble it is the strongest backstop for my puts It s possible that guidance for young people is reversed or damped down at this meeting TLDR puts on MRNA 7 16 145P what I bought 10 15 165P a safer bet 1 https www nbcnews com

seem simple they are a bit complex when you look under the hood This publication is meant to graphically show how short squeezes happen as well providing the mechanics on why they occur The mechanics behind longs and shorts To understand short squeezes we have to understand the mechanics of longs and shorts Most investors usually invest using by going long on a stock This is when an investor purchases the stock and then hopefully sells it a higher price in the future A short seller is when an individual wants to bet against a stock hoping that it falls But instead of selling the stock at a higher price for a profit they want to buy the stock back at a lower price we ll get more into the short positions if this seems confusing now Short sellers have all sort of motives some short

into a position and buy to get out The technical terms for the short seller are selling short and buying to cover Price Discovery Analysis To analyze a stock s price we will use the price discovery method We ll start with a standard supply and demand curve for modeling stock prices Although this explanation works in theory and the mechanics behind this model are applicable in real life it is technically impossible to know the future movement of supply and demand curves To do so would require one to know all of current and potential investors future decisions which are hard to predict amp

6832c9ff03e755ef89c5c94028f8a31dbcd3ef2e Even though keeping supply constant is not technically accurate it provides for a better visual explanation later In general changes in supply would mean that there are less or more sellers in the market Orderbook analysis To analyze movements in the stock we will examine the orderbook which displays the type of order and the quantity of orders for a certain price It shows how prices change with incoming bids and asks The bids are the orders to buy the stock and the and the asks are the orders to sell the stock In stock trading there is usually a slight difference between bids and asks the spread we can see that the spread between the highest bid 125 82 and the lowest ask 126 80 A transaction doesn t occur until bid and ask agree upon a price which would look like an order on each side of the price So in this case if you were looking to buy the stock you would have to meet the lowest ask which is 126 80 amp x200B https preview redd it

orderbook would be filled with a number of bids and asks in each column Orderbook information can be found in your brokerage account if you have access to level II market data I like to think of orderbook dynamics as forces moving against each other For example if there are more buyers than sellers then the green vector will be bigger than the red vector which will push the price up If there are more sellers than buyers then the red vector will be bigger which will push prices down The following is a different visual representation of bids and asks that shows volume Looking at the bids green we can see that there is a preference to buy the stock at a lower price As for the asks red the majority of sellers are looking to sell the stock at higher price amp x200B https preview redd it

will look at the Gamestop short squeeze which garnered a great deal of attention recently In this example we will start with 7 short positions Each short position comes from a different short seller We can see on the aggregate that the stock is downward trending for the most part This works in the best interest of the short seller who sells the stock and hopes to buy it back at a cheaper price and they will profit from the difference We can also see that the short sell positions are represented with the green profit bar below the price they entered in at https preview redd it ojczn2t91p471

what the short seller wants and they begin to lose money then are going to want to exit their position Keep in mind that exiting a short position requires buying the stock back This is the bug in short selling its this little feature that creates a short squeeze Let s say a short seller wants out they ll buy the stock back but also going back to our price discovery method buying a stock increases the demand which increases the price This is where the squeeze occurs each short seller exits their position which pushes the price up causing the next short seller to lose money The

that a short seller who is looking to exit their position has to buy the stock which pushes the price up and that hits the next seller and so forth Some short squeezes may occur naturally although they rarely do This can happen if a stock posts good quarterly results or makes a positive announcement That increase in price could trigger a short squeeze For example when famed activist short seller Citron Research ran by Andrew Left switched his short position on Tesla Inc that created a short squeeze see here https www cnbc com 2018 10 23 short seller who is suing tesla changes his mind tesla is destroying the competition html If short sellers succeed and push the price of the stock down then there is a risk that a short squeeze may occur Contrarian investors which are investors that take go against the grain approach in investing may bet on a company who s price is falling Their purchase may cause a short squeeze and its common for contrarian investors to try and garner public support which would rally investors Value investors who constantly ask is this stock overvalued or undervalued may see a stock that has been falling because of short sellers and say that its undervalued and buy up a bunch of shares causing a short squeeze But the most famous short squeezes that are studied come from market manipulation This occurs when a trader or group of traders realize that with a large enough buy order will push the price up triggering a short squeeze Although it feels like short squeezes have been happening a lot with talks about meme stocks they actually don t occur too often I would assume that as markets calm when our lives fully revert back to normal or whatever normal is post pandemic there will be less of these events

shares of volume when this guy usually only trades like 7 mil as they tried to sell every share they had to exhaust the buyers and we saw the beginnings of some covering The price got up to almost 15 in after hours trading that day and then the next day we had the revenge of the Sith What did they do First thing they did was release a stupid media report about Total selling a bunch of shares like it was new news when Total had been selling shares to pay for their part of a new refinery for over a month and it was month old news being recycled then they shorted every stock they could get their hands on and if it s anything like AM C some they didn t Check this out amp x200B amp x200B https preview redd it 0hw3obwc9p471 jpg width 2141 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s ab9069f3c8a7cc95bccb9dd3b44870c1be336c8b There went from 9 million shares available to short to only 300 000 as Shitadel and the rest of them attacked the stock price because they re hosed We knew they were going to fight like rabid roos to keep it under 13 and that s absolutely what s happening And maybe it s a tin foil hat I m wearing or maybe it s real but I couldn t help but notice that when CLNE started flying all of a sudden a bunch of 70 karma new accounts started pumping these new meme stocks nobody had ever heard of every day in force with them coming out of nowhere and dominating the daily chatter only to fade 24 hours later amp x200B 9 days ago my DD was really talking about more of a moonshot 50 in 2 weeks Seemed impossible Then we did it in 3 days Now we only need about 10 in a week and hold it till Friday to kick them whilst they re down take their lunch money and spit in their faces Personally I want to put a loogie right in Ken Shitadel s eyehole amp x200B The best part Even if they somehow find a way to win we still win because it s still just a good long term hold company that analysts agree should double in price in the next year Barron s wrote a favourable article about it Even the CNBC guys jumped in with Dr J buying on Wednesday during a show and everybody s favourite 6 pm EST sideshow who had been talking trash about the company for weeks devoting the last few minutes of his show to talking about how he was wrong and it was a turnaround play for the ages that is going to start printing money because RNG is the future of transport Not only is it readily available right now but it s cleaner than even green hydrogen or electric That bloke almost never admits he was wrong about something The best part Even though the calls are no longer a penny like they were 9 days ago they re still only about 30 cents right now with a potential to be worth 4 or 5 dollars How many 10 baggers do you see just waiting to be grabbed right now But they ve shown they re going to fight us for it so we have to BUY SHARES AS WELL AS OPTIONS The shares are the key If you look at the last couple of days share volume plummeted but option volume spiked And the price went down Gotta keep grabbing those shares to make the shorts pay amp x200B TLDR CLNE gt 13 by 18 6 2021 Shitadel and shortys Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk

like 7 mil as they tried to sell every share they had to exhaust the buyers and we saw the beginnings of some covering The price got up to almost 15 in after hours trading that day and then the next day we had the revenge of the Sith What did they do First thing they did was release a stupid media report about Total selling a bunch of shares like it was new news when Total had been selling shares to pay for their part of a new refinery for over a month and it was month old news being recycled then they shorted every stock they could get their hands on and if it s anything like the movie biz

what s happening And maybe it s a tin foil hat I m wearing or maybe it s real but I couldn t help but notice that when CLNE started flying all of a sudden a bunch of new accounts started pumping these new stocks nobody had ever heard mentioned here before every day in force with them coming out of nowhere and dominating the daily chatter only to fade 24 hours later 9 days ago my DD was really talking about more of a moonshot 50 in 2 weeks Seemed impossible Then we did it in 3 days Now we only need about 10 in a week and hold it till Friday to kick them whilst they re down take their lunch money and spit in their faces Personally I want to put a loogie right in Ken s The best part Even if they somehow find a way to win we still win because it s still just a good long term hold company that analysts agree should double in price in the next year Barron wrote a favourable article about it Even the CNBC guys jumped in with Dr J buying on Wednesday during a show and everybody s favourite 6 pm EST sideshow who had been talking trash about the company for weeks devoting the last few minutes of his show to talking about how he was wrong and it was a turnaround play for the ages that is going to start printing money because RNG is the future of transport Not only is it readily available right now but it s cleaner than even green hydrogen or electric That bloke almost never admits he was wrong about something The best part Even though the calls are no longer a penny like they were 9 days ago they re still only about 30 cents right now with a potential to be worth 4 or 5 dollars How many 10 baggers do you see just waiting to be grabbed right now But they ve shown they re going to fight us for it so we have to BUY SHARES AS WELL AS OPTIONS The shares are the key If you look at the last couple of days share volume plummeted but option volume spiked And the price went down Gotta keep grabbing those shares to make the shorts pay TLDR CLNE gt 13 by 18 6 2021 Kenny C and
