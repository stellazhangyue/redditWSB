my Nokia idea on TradingView so when I refer to Reddit WSB I am talking to you guys as if you are looking at it from my TradingView idea amp x200B Since my original ideas on TV and social media there have been quite a few very interesting developments For once I m not going to do just chart analysis I am also adding a large amount of due diligence regarding options activity social media activity news articles and comparisons against competitors Financials are something I am still struggling to learn but hopefully will eventually get there As far as financials are concerned I do know that their revenue is down overall but their profit margins have increased As far as revenue is concerned Nokia has been acquiring a large amount of contracts lately in the 5G sector Nokia also has a very good debt to asset ratio when compared against pretty much the entire industry they re attempting to capture market share in amp x200B This will start off with some regular old chart analysis Support and resistance levels and candlestick and RSI analysis Bollinger Bands are self explanitory for the most part amp x200B Let us start with a crucial RSI trend I discovered on the 2 month time frame Spanning from 2006 there has been a consistent trend of attempted breakouts upwards and above 50 RSI Each breakout has been a lower high thus far Currently Nokia is contending with this 2 month RSI trend line for the 7th time This is a MAJOR area of confluence when combined with MA s Fib retracement levels and reactions in candlesticks Processing img xuobh6uor6c61 amp x200B On the monthly we can see that this trend line coincided with a major selloff in October of 2019 This selloff was caused by a bad earnings report on 10 24 2019 Earnings were estimated to be 0 05 but reported 0 01 which had a 69 42 surprise of 0 04 Prior to this the month of August broke down below this trend line During the month of September Nokia attempted to rally back above it on low volume The local support level it was testing at 5 18 or the 0 5 Fib retracement flipped to resistance and caused a 27 87 drop after the bad earnings report It was not until the month of June 2020 that Nokia was able to get back above this trend line 2 months later Nokia tested that same resistance level and was able to get above 50 RSI but was strongly rejected This rejection dropped Nokia back below the RSI trend line but it was able to hold support at 40 RSI The month of November 2020 however had a bullish engulfing candle to bring Nokia back above the trend line Then the month of October 2020 had low sell volume and thus held as support For this particular trend line support has not been tested successfully like this since July of 2018 Note however that the mid line of the bollinger bands is so far holding as resistance amp x200B Notice the giant bearish hammer the lower arrow is pointing to That was the market wide covid selloff of March 2020 and it closed directly at the 0 786 Fib retracement There was strong bullish support residing at the 0 886 Fib retracement which not only caused the large wick but strongly pushed Nokia back up and into the 20 year trend line zone of support Since December of 2017 Nokia s price movement has been unable to close a monthly candle below this trend line In October of 2020 Nokia once again successfully tested the 0 786 Fib retracement for support which coincided perfectly with the 20 year trend line and a diagonal trend line breakout https preview redd it giukvukpr6c61 png width 1930 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 613407c999d8e004c84d2943f562a04ef3ade19c amp x200B The 2 month trend line also translates very well to the daily where we can see that Nokia has successfully tested this trend line multiple times for support throughout 2020 Since 12 21 2020 Nokia has so far successfully tested this support on this time frame According to the trend this should produce at least some upwards movement to test local resistance levels Namely the 0 618 Fib level at 4 34 https preview redd it yad5hm4qr6c61 png width 1930 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b681b860cd1ad96f5260dcbd921187bfb59c1ba1 amp x200B According to the 3 month time frame Nokia has serious support below the tree fiddy price point and 40 RSI The October 2016 3 month candle tested 40 RSI and had a fairly strong bounce Then a year later same thing From that point forward this zone was not tested until the negative October 2019 earnings report pushed Nokia well below it Then in April 2020 Nokia had a high volume bullish engulfing candle that brought the RSI back above 40 but was rejected at the 0 618 Fib retracement After that 3 month candle closed in July Nokia spent the next 6 months testing support Bears were unable to close the next 2 candles below 40 RSI AND the 20 year trend line The October 2020 3 month candle closed as a long legged doji on high volume indicating strong buyer support This is a multitude of confluence that shows for the next 3 months at least Nokia should have strong buying support Processing img tfl8spoqr6c61 amp x200B Now is time for perhaps one of the most interesting clues as far as Nokia s price action the 6 month time frame The 6 month candle starting on January 2nd 2020 is one of the strongest indicators that Nokia is soon to have some serious volatility It closed as a bullish hammer with very long tail and short upper shadow This indicates buying support stepped in and held the line in a big way towards the end of the candle close Volumes for this candle are the highest they have been since the giant hulk dildo starting in July of 2013 The very next candle after this bullish hammer was a bearish spinning top doji but was able to close WITHIN the body of the bullish hammer This type of doji can indicate the beginning of a shift in sentiment or a pause This pause does sometimes precede a resumption of the prior trend Considering the volumes in these 2 candles Nokia is likely to experience serious volatility over the next 6 months It is a very good sign though in my opinion that this doji candle closed within the body of the bullish hammer The RSI however is pointing out a break of support and subsequent confirmation of resistance Nokia needs to break back above 45 RSI on this time frame in order to establish strong bullish bias https preview redd it mzv9hb6rr6c61 png width 1930 amp format png amp auto webp amp s a9d86440e0fba694083f58982c61ee810a8b79a7 amp x200B TLDR Support is hodling but this is arguably the most important zone to decide Nokia s short mid and long term fate Immediate support levels 3 80 3 70 3 50 Lower support levels 3 15 2 44 and ALL IN anything below that amp x200B Immediate resistance levels 4 30 4 50 5 Higher resistance levels 5 18 6 7 50 amp x200B 1 21 22 Leap options activity I happened to find a website to check historical data on options volumes and open interest The position I currently hold are 7 call contracts expiring on 1 21 2022 so I decided to take a look at the data for them I also checked the 10 call contracts with the same expiration as they currently have what seems to be the largest amount of open interest amp x200B This is a short term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the 7 call Between the end of December and January 4th there were very slight fluctuations in the open interest yet the volumes traded were above average Note that on January 5th and 6th the volumes skyrocketed while open interest decreased Strange considering the premium price of the options were on a slight upwards trend from that date After January 6th however the the volume was mostly flat average while the open interest significantly increased January 15th open interest skyrocketed Interesting to note that this increase came after a significantly high volume day in shares Processing img 7rh35wbtr6c61 amp x200B This is a longer term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the 7 call Unfortunately without paying for a subscription this website only allows you to see historical data spanning roughly 3 months Still this screenshot shows multiple significant trends in the options for this particular contract The first thing that obviously catches the eye is the enormous volume and drop in option premium price open interest that happened right before November On October 29th Nokia released an earnings report This particular report showed an expected earnings per share of 0 06 but the actual reported earnings per share were 0 04 which was a surprise of 0 02 or 36 37 As of the opening bell for trading Nokia dropped by 18 99 in 1 hour eventually bottoming out at 3 21 a few hours later after a 20 72 decline in share price After this cleanse the 7 call option mostly traded flat for another 12 days thereafter On the 13th day open interest began rising again Currently Nokia s 7 call 1 21 22 contract has an open interest of roughly 135 000 contracts https preview redd it vy82mmstr6c61 png width 720 amp format png amp auto webp amp s c37840bae667ba18c238536ad190d79240daaf38 amp x200B This is a short term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the 10 call Unlike the strange activity in the 7 call the overall trend for the open interest in the 10 call has only been upwards since the 17th of December onwards Volumes have mostly been flat up until the 14th when Nokia had a very high volume day in shares Otherwise open interest and volumes in this contract have not had anything major to really report on other than a steady increase in open interest Processing img 0mk1qbsur6c61 amp x200B This is a longer term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the 10 call This screenshot is quite interesting There have been multiple high volume days for this option but the one that specifically stands out was when the contract bottomed out at 0 08 From that point forward open interest and volumes remained relatively flat Notice that in the latter part of November the high volume days preceeded a significant decline in the option premium price From the peak option price premium of 0 16 however the open interest only increased unlike what happened with the 7 call option on October 29th for earnings The highest volume days for this contract in the timeline that I have to work with were interestingly the 14th and the 15th This could signal another significant decline in premium price or it could be a signal that Nokia s share price may be in the beginning stages of a rally Considering historical data history indicates that this should unfortunately be a signal for a drop in premium price Whales love to mess with the noobs Processing img jx75xh8vr6c61 amp x200B This is a screenshot that represents the grand total of all options traded versus share price For months the options volume and stock volume have remained relatively flat until the 14th and 15th Implied volatility as well as volumes are signaling there is likely to be a major move within the next few trading sessions amp x200B https preview redd it ua8dxbkxr6c61 png width 720 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 228aa40f5f450f8a1fb76cc0c94052c50dbdcd90

According to the news Nokia is quite literally going to the moon amp x200B Key observations from above news articles Fair warning this is strictly plagiarized aka copy pasted straight from above news sources Kevin Stine Chief of the Applied Cybersecurity Division at NIST said 5G will touch every aspect of our lives and security must be integrated up front rather than an add on element of 5G networks We re looking forward to working with our project collaborators such as Nokia to show 5G s advanced standards based security features as well an architecture that leverages foundational security capabilities available in cloud technologies amp x200B Raghav Sahgal President Cloud and Network Services at Nokia said Previous cellular technology generations have been industry led whereas 5G development must evolve in collaboration with governments to ensure availability and access of secure trusted networks The 5G Cybersecurity Project fills this role with a cross section of government and industry collaborators on board At Nokia we embed security into every solution that we ship and we are committed to enabling the secure shift to the cloud by working with government agencies and the industry to advance cybersecurity for 5G use cases that leverage both open and commercial components amp x200B About NIST NCCoE National Institue of Standards and Technology The NCCoE a part of NIST is a collaborative hub where industry organizations government agencies and academic institutions work together to address businesses most pressing cybersecurity issues This public private partnership enables creation of practical cybersecurity solutions for specific industries as well as for broad cross sector technology challenges Through consortia under CRADAs including technology partners from Fortune 50 market leaders to smaller companies specializing in information technology and operational technology security the NCCoE applies standards and recommended practices

amp x200B TLDR Show me the charts I ll tell you the news amp x200B Stock Rankings Do yourself a favor GOOGLE What is Zacks Ranking Zacks ranking rates a stock on a scale from 1 5 1 Being a strong buy while 5 is a strong sell The Zacks Rank is a short term stock recommendation of 1 3 months that is based on analyst earnings estimate revisions It is designed to weed out the companies with rising earnings estimates Remember the Zacks Rank is generated daily amp x200B People also ask Is Zacks a good rank Since 1988 Zacks 1 Rank stocks have generated an annualized return of 25 67 nearly three times better than the S amp P 500 s return of 10 79 The Zacks Rank has also been very successful in telling investors which stocks to avoid Since 1988 Zacks 5 Rank stocks have been flat amp x200B Zacks basically states that Nokia is worthwhile with solid fundamentals and ranks Nokia a 3 or Hold To comprise this ranking however Zacks evaluates a stock on 4 different areas Value Growth Momentum and an averaged score of all 3 This particular evaluation is graded like a report card in school A B C D or the big fat red F As far as the average Value Growth and Momentum score is concerned Nokia

being ranked a 3 or Hold rating Zacks 3 Rank Stocks Can Be Perfectly Acceptable I bet that title attracted your attention You most likely have heard us refer to stocks with a Zacks 1 Rank as being the cream of the crop It is understandable why These stocks represent the top 5 of all stocks that are covered by at least one analyst and are expected to experience the strongest earnings estimate revisions in the future https www zacks com stock education 54 How to Use Zacks Rank 3 Hold https www zacks com stock education 54 How to Use Zacks Rank 3 Hold amp x200B I ll admit I haven t looked into the above claim of 1 rankings hitting 25 67 annualized returns I am only adding Zacks ranking here for analytical and historical purposes amp x200B TLDR Zacks rank says to hold as it could go up or down but gives Nokia a Grade A rating for value growth and momentum potential amp x200B Social Media influence Social Media is by far my favorite trading indicator because of how funny human behavior and psychology can be It is absolutely in my opinion one of the most underutilized tools a person can have in their analysis arsenal When you were a kid and someone told you I bet you can t throw this rock farther than me what did you do Or how about as a kid your closest friend friends always told you that you d never beat their high score in video games To this day when someone or especially multiple people try to tell you that you cannot do achieve something what do you try to do Or how about today where a very large Social Media sentiment is that Nokia is a complete waste of time The float of 5 6 billion outstanding shares is too high there s absolutely no way the price can move Or what about all the people that had too strong of hands and didn t cut their losses much earlier on All those people trashing Nokia s name Saying they can t do something They won t move Flatter than a pancake amp x200B I have noticed that within the past few weeks there has been a significant uptick in posts regarding Nokia on the first and third largest investing forums Reddit has Their names r Wallstreetbets and r Stocks Currently r Wallstreetbets has the largest following of 1 9 million members r Investing comes in 2nd at 1 3 million members and the third largest investing forum on Reddit is r Stocks and it has 1 1 million members Take a look around on Wallstreetbets and you will quickly realize that forum can legitimately move the market No joke Teh stocks forum is far more conservative than the WSB one yet Nokia is still popping up quite frequently these past couple

Nice try but NOK is a flaming POS You can t pump it Held it for 6 years POS Nokia has a staggering 5 32B free float Not quite easy for this monster to move This fat boy ain t moving yet I bought some 5 and 7 calls for 2023 so i hope you re right with 5 billion float it ll probably never get there but it wasn t too expensive for some lottery tickets amp x200B What is my point here What angle am I getting at H Y P E How do you create serious hype FOMO for a stock in todays world It needs some sort of reputation A very negative one is best Why Nokia is known for having a giant outstanding share supply They re known for being in a decades long downtrend They re known for not being worth investing in plain and simple So back to human behavior If you look back at the past year ish or so of comments on social media regarding Nokia the stock has built quite the negative reputation amp x200B You NEVER hear about Nokia You never see it in the news You never hear its name anymore other than when people reminisce of the good old days where products were ackshually built to last You don t see the Nokia brand anywhere anymore Its name doesn t show up on TV or in the newspaper or on ticker news feeds nothing Nowhere Nada Zilch What would happen if say Nokia suddenly had a 50 day out of nowhere EVERYONE who ever doubted Nokia or even heard their name are quickly reminded that they are still alive These people are seemingly so brainwashed at this point that Nokia is not a worthwhile investment they don t even bother Even though it just rocketed 50 Meh just a dead cat bounce Nah they ll stay out and chase their gains in PLTR or GME or BB or whatever the current meme stocks are for the day Next day Nokia rockets again while maybe other meme blue chip stocks and or indexes are flat or negative See where I m going with this here amp x200B THE very M O M E N T Nokia rips a hulk dildo on the chart everyone and their mother is going to know about it Meh just a dead cat bounce Right guys Right Then it goes up Again While a lot of people including I you were waiting for a pullback See where I m going with this here amp x200B STRICTLY because of Nokia s reputation and the extreme negative sentiment surrounding it in Social Media this is a perfect play When it finally rips loose everyone and their brother is going to be waiting for a pullback What if it doesn t come soon enough Imagine the FOMO A multi decade long downtrend is clearly reversing You can see it in the chart trend lines and in the sentiment This was rock bottom TLDR Imagine the FOMO amp x200B Google Trends

would just like to address the echo chambered and in MY opinion incorrect opinion of how Nokia cannot move well or quickly in price because of what I will call The Float Fallacy Nokia has a grand total of 5 6 billion shares that make up the company otherwise known as The Float Nokia has a market cap currently of 22 1B That means when you multiply the total supply of tradable shares to how much money they each are trading for you get the total overall valuation of a company The majority opinion everywhere on Nokia above all else is that it cannot move due to its float size Essentially people are arguing that you d need to buy substantially more shares in order to move the price than you would a different company While this is generally true the AMOUNT OF MONEY TRADED STAYS THE SAME amp x200B To give you an idea of why the float doesn t matter we can compare Nokia s market cap to the market cap sizes and share values of other competitors First example I will use is Ericsson Ericsson has a market cap of 36 13B Their share price is currently 11 76 Now again think about the MONEY not the shares Say I wanted to invest 100 in a given stock I could buy 8 5 shares in total of Ericsson Or I could get 24 5 shares of Nokia for THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY What sounds more appealing to you Owning 8 5 shares in a company or nearly 3 times as much amp x200B So let s compare market cap sizes with a few competitors to see just how much growth potential Nokia truly has We will just use the major companies listed alongside Nokia on the U S Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project amp x200B AT amp T Market cap 207 87B Share price 29 17 Float 7 13B amp x200B Cisco Market cap 191 97B Share price 45 43 Float 4 22B amp x200B Dell Market cap 55 68B Share price 74 26 Float 0 77B amp x200B Intel Market cap 235 96B Share price 57 58 Float 4 1B amp x200B T Mobile Market cap 157 98B Share price 127 28 Float 1 24B amp x200B These figures show the valuation that Nokia can and will eventually hit The only real negative effect of having 5 6 billion outstanding shares is that it can take a while for them to become more widely dispersed rather than overconcentrated Meaning a very select few absurdly rich people can and have been suppressing the price The more they do it though the more insane opportunities it gives you That s the entire point So in a way float does matter but that is EXACTLY WHY this is such a winning proposition The more shares WE buy the less THEY have and can control anddd I m done Finally This is my very last update regarding Nokia until 0 20 is no longer a gigantic movement

questions after the whales 101 post so I m trying to be thorough If you don t want long shit skip to positions and TLDR If you want me to search a ticker you can comment it or PM me and I ll try my best to get to it and we can talk shop Some Unusual Options Activity caught my eye from Friday for this week I typically like to scan the prior Friday on the weekend so I figured I d share what I was looking at in case it gives you confirmation bias or an idea REMEMBER UOA IS AN EDUCATED GUESSING GAME WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO STAY ABOVE 50 AND HAVE A FEW AMAZING BAGGERS HERE AND THERE DO NOT YOLO WHALES The way I ll break this down is by laying out my C choices Options activity that is intriguing but seems like there is a strong possibility it could be a hedge a sell the news event isn t confirmed once I do more research or hasn t been called out by Unusual Whales No precise formula B choices Ones I am pretty down to hop on but need to see more I might be waiting for a dip a related news event to play out or this is one I feel could go against me big if it s an institutional hedge because of its Greeks A choices Shit I will likely buy right at the open fits into what my thought process on a sector generally has been and is simply a ticker I like C choices some whales bought FSLR and SPWR Somebody is betting solar UOA cluster example for both https i imgur com 5BzcmaV jpg FSLR underlying 96 85 Order 110c 1 22 IV 63 98 SPWR underlying 31 96 Orders 33 and 37c 1 22 Unusual Whales Alert FSLR no SPWR YES Earnings Reports Mid February Why I like it Solar cooled down a little bit after the Biden stonk frenzy to start off the week ICLN EV etc could just be refueling and aren t necessarily done running Why I don t like it Falling knives and could still be finding the bottom of it s channel It had a hell of a run and hopping in now feels greedy The volume on these orders is also low which can be a coinflip as to what it means Sometimes 600 1 000 volume is the sweet spot but IV and Greeks SPWR greeks shitty theta you re giving back almost 20 of premium price each day on the 1 29c and IV at or near the money is already about 100 by this point The only upside to straight buying a call is playing the IV Vega on Joe Biden s inauguration speech News confirmation and catalyst s Biden s inauguration speech could lay out a great renewable energy plan that gives the whole sector a boost Last week people played weed energy and EV in hopes that his Thursday speech would touch on these things there is a much higher likelihood his inauration speech will Also huge news about the Keystone pipeline came out this weekend https www bbc com news world us canada 55709261 and I don t know if this means uppies or downies for other oil companies since big oil is trying to appeal by saying they ll switch sources Position Waiting to see how Keystone decision fallout hits them tomorrow morning If there is a significant dip I ll probably buy it for some 1 29 SPWR calls Wednesday morning and dump with a swiftness after inauguration B choices PEP underlying 141 39 Orders 152 50 2 12c IV 20 74 143c 1 22 IV 16 https i imgur com 67bZ71V jpg Unusual Whales No alert Earnings Report February 11th Why I kinda like it Didn t see many KO calls around but saw the PEP calls that contrast made the order stand out to me as more than a sector industry bet The fact that the ER is one day before the 2 12 call expiration makes me like this play because I can pick up some IV along the way for what feels like a very oversold tech stalwart IV and the Greeks Looks good to me no major caution flags BUT the bid ask spread is a little wide This partially keeps it at C level I ll probably put in a low bid forget it and see if the price action during the day gets the order filled News confirmation and catalyst s On Friday Lebron James announced he s switching his KO sponsorship to a PEP sponsorship which probably played into this UOA Looking into this more I saw that it s an energy drink play and he s now attached to Mountain Dew s Rise energy drink Maybe PEP gets some price upgrades since people saw how much of a beast MNST has traditionally been maybe this starts some conversation around the sector as a whole on CNBC or maybe neither of those things happen BUT with a relatively safe stock making a big name play leading into earnings I m willing to lose a little theta for a week to see if anything plays out Position A relatively safe PEP 145c 2 12 while I play the waiting game for a week or so and reevaluate If it s smooth sailing likely hold for a bit into the earnings run and sell before FB Underlying 251 36 b 252 50c 257c 1 22 others IV 38 for 1 22 50 for 1 29 https i imgur com gGXVZTA jpg Unusual Whale alert No Earnings Report 1 27 Why I like it Welcome to earnings season for big tech and FB is a steal right here They ve been pummelled fairly or unfairly in the censorship aftermath and is at a great level to bounce you can t cuck the Zuck I have been seeing Fb calls with their own hedges trickle in like this since Wednesday and Thursday nonstop there was some bad What s App backlash to their new privacy policy but if anything that will be a tastier dip for Monday entry that is to be bought IV and the greeks slightly elevated IV because ER is coming but fine Still plenty of room for an upward trajectory on IV Vega The premium for 1 29 is a tad bit pricey so if you can t afford that I d look at a vertical call spread capping at 255 if you re going to play it with a close expiration News confirmation and catalyst s What s App issue is a potential albatross for tomorrow but I do believe this will be a relatively smooth upward earning trajectory Also their Oculus 2 demand numbers are going be through the roof and has great meme potential I don t usually hold through ER but I may keep a lotto for this Been hovering around MA200 ready to bounce bounce Position FB 1 29 255c FB 2 19 260c DVN underlying 19 57 Orders 19 50 20c 21 50 1 22 many others with exp from now to May IV high around 100 on ATM weeklies DVN UOA https i imgur com VL7iirc jpg Unusual Whales alert Yes Earnings Report Feb 16th Why I like it I ve been seeing it pop up so much in clusters I can t ignore it any Longer The volume has been intense in the whole sector This Barron s article confirmed the activity I ve been around energy https www barrons com articles why energy could have a tesla like 2021 51610744972 They compare it to TSLA yes TSLA IV and the greeks IV is getting a bit high because of the overall energy spike but I have confidence it s heading higher The bid ask spread is problematic though Will enter low and hope the order gets bought on a dip News confirmation and catalyst s aside from the call activity and the Barron s article pump we have the inauguration for Biden to lay out a true vision for energy Early indications are that while solar EV etc are the hot names there is a place for truly evolving big oil companies They also just completed a merger on January 7th Plus we have a nice dip tomorrow as an entry point with the Keystone news Positions This is one that you buy LEAPS or monthlies on I m looking at 2 19 121 5c and 3 19 121 5c but I fully acknowledge that the bid ask spread is a bitch at the moment A list EDIT https i imgur com hgjrLgU jpg underlying 76 14 Order 1 22 85c IV 116 Why I Like It Ever since I missed the NIO PLUG everything EV launch a couple months back I ve been looking for the next industry to go off Energy is one of my choices the other is whatever the fuck is going on with Gene Editing Genetically constructed super babies so hot right now I know ARKG exists as well I consider that a part of this play too IV and the Greeks Unideal for the short term as under 100 is a general rule of thumb but I really like this as a long term hold so much so that I m going to recommend the S word here ssssssshares Confirmation and catalyst s Barron s came out with this piece over the weekend https www barrons com articles with rare speed gene editing emerges as biotechs new cutting edge 51610655079 which is part of what I m sure that whale was chasing gt While gene editing start ups will lose money during years of clinical trials it s hard to say the stocks are overvalued If their one time interventions can cure diseases that otherwise require chronic treatment or lack any treatment at all then the stocks will fly Position Opening up two LEAPs if I can get a dip so the 1 20 22 ask is only around 2 300 Will chase on a 2 5 77 because the bid ask spread on that strike is relatively reasonable and it feels doable If this one is pricey for you consider call debit spreads Two interesting trends from Friday UOA that I m trying to connect some dots on 1 Cruiseline puts were everywhere https i imgur com AOuseNk jpg I saw this enough that it made me think My hunch was that a lot of bad COVID recovery stonk news is coming during inauguration plus global trends That contrasted a little with the second interesting trend 2 Vaccines all got Unusual call options at various times https i imgur com Z1AfJuF jpg I saw MRNA got some UK upgrade attention today maybe that was some of the reason maybe that was none of the reason but interesting nonetheless I checked Unusual Whales to see if they have any cruise alerts and they had the opposite of the orders I saw a CCL 1 29 call alerted They also had MRNA 2 5 145 calls I m going to stay away from the cruise puts and probably go with some MRNA and NVAX 2 5 calls slightly OTM depending where we open up It seems like the cruise puts were a hedge for a good week for vaccines Open Interest change notables 1 Oil saw huge OI increases for January and Feb expirations XOM PBR etc 2 Uber had huge OI increase for 2 19 both calls and puts Earning are 2 10 3 F and GM having obvious increases from their big splashes 4 SRNE had serious volume as well and lots of sporadic call buys Other options I saw I liked

Chen, So you bought BB at 11 pre market friday Smart move my fellow degens strap in cause you re in for a ride to the moons of fucking pluto TL DR Blackberry AWS IVY will be in every single vehicle produced after 2022 EV or ICE self driving or boomer driving it doesn t fucking matter It will be in every single one Oh and Blackberry QNX is fun too Before you start reading I d suggest grabbing a snack and a drink Cause I m about to drop a fucking novel You ve probably heard Blackberry QNX a few times around other DDs but you re wondering wtf is it and who the hell is even using it QNX is an Real Time Operating System more on this later meant for vehicles and it s been around for a really long time Currently there are at least 175m cars running around with QNX As for what cars those are I ll keep it short Apple Car Play was developed on QNX So why haven t we heard more about Blackberry in recent years since there s so many QNX cars around 2 reasons 1 Dumbasses like you thought it was a phone company 2 QNX is so ahead of the fucking game that boomer auto manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes were too stupid to use it effectively For the last few years it s just been used to turn on your car s radio But things have changed now Zombie cars and QNX QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS What the fuck does that even mean nerd For anyone like me who s not a software genius I ve done some research so we all know what we re getting into A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things Speed and Accuracy This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS General Purpose OS or GPOS as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn t exactly anything that s significantly more important than the others However when you re using a self driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed Your self driving program brakes too late Crash into the car ahead of you Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon Crash into a wall Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014 But car makers literally could develop autonomous vehicles fast enough So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs Fast forward to now where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS So who s OS are they using SONY https techcrunch com 2021 01 11 sony reveals more details on its secretive vision s sedan guccounter 1 amp guce referrer

s built on QNX Know who else is using DESAY autopilot Li Auto https en desaysv com index php id 4974 But what about Nio you might ask Well on NIO day it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia https www blackberry com us en company newsroom press releases 2018 nvidia announces world first functionally safe ai self driving platform DRIVE which is also built on QNX What about the Apple car There s no confirmation yet but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo https www press canoo com press release blackberry to power autonomy systems in canoos next generation electric vehicles and Hyundai https www blackberry com us en company newsroom press releases 2019 hyundai autron selects blackberry qnx to power next generation adas and autonomous driving software platform makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago But even if they did it doesn t even matter You might have noticed that I didn t mention Tesla at all That s because they have developed their own Linux based Operating system which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations QNX on the other hand already is BB to the fucking moon Linux is also an open source OS and this becomes a huge problem when we talk about zombie cars That s right Motherfucking zombie cars You know that scene in Fate of the Furious where Charlize Theron straight up just hacks all the cars in the city and starts slamming them into buildings Yea this is a legitimate fear of the U S government and Linux is not going to pass any safety regulations And you better believe after SolarWind and FireEye hacks Cybersecurity is the hottest topic right now when it comes to national security You better believe the U S Government won t just allow open source OS flowing around millions of autonomous driving cars that can be hijacked at any time of day You know who does have MULTIPLE government certifications already though Blackberry bb I won t get it but you can read u josh moworld https www reddit com u josh moworld s post right here https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kxknrl bb dd 9 reasons why bb is from former bb employee to get a better idea Blackberry s history with the U S government and security The best part about it all is Blackberry designed QNX to be 100 POSIX compliant In dumbass terms it basically means any LINUX based program can be ported over easily Come join the dark side Elon Now that you re pretty much caught up to speed on QNX let s move over to IVY and why I believe IVY will be Blackberry s return to the throne Blackberry x AWS IVY IVY is a co development between Blackberry and Amazon and it is a 50 50 partnership That s right Jeff Bezos the second richest man in the world and king of predatory business practices chose to partner with a company that has a 5 5b market cap All hail John Chen So what is IVY Basically IVY cloud based software that OEMs can install into their QNX vehicles or any OS and read sensor data from the vehicle s DCUs domain controller units These are basically sensors that give you data such as times that you unlocked and locked your car your car s wheel speed sensors wiper arm sensors tire pressure etc In a Tesla which is loaded with sensors you will also see sentry mode data when an small object hits your car while parked how hard you step on the accelerator how hard you brake etc IVY basically captures this data and in real time sends it to OEMs for them to analyze Cars are going to be fitted with more and more sensors regardless of if they have autonomous systems or not and the data that IVY provides is very helpful This allows OEMs to see their customer s car preferences or driving styles and can further develop their future vehicles to match customer s interests Also since the data is transferred in REAL TIME things like horrible weather conditions traffic updates and icy roads can be communicated to all vehicles within the OEM network so that people can be notified ahead of time But you know which industry would love this Insurance companies OEMs can gather all the safety data that IVY delivers and actually PROVE to insurance companies that their cars are safer You know how Tesla had to come up with their own auto insurance That was because Insurance companies were charging crazy high rates for Tesla s that had auto pilot They didn t know exactly how to rate the risk or who would take the blame With Blackberry IVY OEMs and insurance companies can partner together and have reliable data to work off of Best part of it all IVY is extremely scalable and is a subscription based service There isn t an exact price announced yet but you know if Jeff Bezos is involved then there will definitely be a lot of profits flowing in from IVY For me I m long term on BB with some options to take advantage of the recent hype I plan on holding shares until I see an actual competitor to QNX and IVY which I ve looked all over the internet and I can t find any And honestly Blackberry s security suite has so much to offer this isn t even the complete DD I ve just been typing for too long and figured it was a good time to stop Maybe I will write another post in the future

and autist this is accepted canon but I can sense through my overpriced Bloomberg terminal and the lack of in some posts and comments There exists a meaningful cohort of uncommitted retards for whom only a scientific explanation will make them believe Enter The Prisoner s dilemma The Prisoner s dilemma is a hypothetical scenario where two rational actors don t cooperate and by acting in their self interest don t produce the most ideal outcome The classic example put forth by economists and mathematicians is when two bank robbers placed in solitary confinement and sans communication with each other are faced with a decision The prosecutor lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the main charge but they have enough to convict both to lesser offenses In this example the prosecutors negotiate with the prisoner and make an offer Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by confessing that the other committed the crime or to cooperate with each other by remaining silent Outcome 1 When one prisoner confesses and the other remains silent the confessor goes free and his accomplice receives 20 years behind bars Outcome 2 Both prisoners confess they both receive 5 years Outcome 3 and the ideal outcome Both prisoners remain silent and only receive 1 year each amp x200B Fig 1 for illiterate retards https preview redd it h5t19j8m57c61 png width

such as John Mearsheimer the father of neorealism in international politics would state that blah blah blah shut the fuck up you know exactly where I m going with this shit In the case of the VW short

arguments First the soldiers of r wallstreetbets are not rational See General u deepfuckingvalue loaded to the tits with that were forged through immense pressure and heat Read my lips IRRATIONAL

News 01 19 , Biden unveils the 1 9T stimulus package proposal Tesla starts deliveries of the Model Y in China Lemonade drops after the latest Citron short opinion while Nikola amp GameStop shareholders jump ship Let s talk about this and other stock market news Hello everyone and Good Morning So let s start with the recap of the last few days as I haven t made a post since Wednesday as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking HERE https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kxurg0 amazon stock 150 upside amazon stock price target So on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red with the Nasdaq Composite https ibb co MPQ6PVW losing 12 the DOW https ibb co GJf3qV9 dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market SP500 https ibb co r51hS22 dropping below 3800 to finish the day as the VIX https ibb co sq1P6gm rose again by almost 5 though 70 of the companies were advancing https ibb co yhsdpZD on normal volumes with just 8 new lows as 4 of the 11 sectors https ibb co ZW0k1VD finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap while Technology was the biggest loser as Large Cap Growth companies were the underperformers https ibb co jZW53gf while small caps shined with all 3 segments gaining more than 2 for the day Here is the HEAT MAP https ibb co hsmYfRz from Thursday with Amazon Microsoft Tesla Netflix amp Facebook all losing more than 1 while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil amp Gas Industry We also received the investor sentiment survey https ibb co XZNYQHY which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1 in bullish investors and 4 in neutral ones as fear has reached almost 5 more investors in this past week which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market Meanwhile Friday was even worse for the broad stock market with the SP500 https ibb co Ms5m47G losing 72 as the DOW https ibb co dKc4ZV0 dropped 177 points while the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite https ibb co MkcyrQV was the biggest underperformer dropping below 13000 as the VIX https ibb co RSGmvvN continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning but overall finished the week https ibb co SnvsgHc down almost 3 We saw again 4 of the 11 SECTORS https ibb co 0GTqNZG finish in the green but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer losing almost 4 and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1 and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week as almost 70 of the companies were declining on Friday https ibb co grwfwwM with Large Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the week https ibb co vX2mxss down only 1 2 Here is the HEAT MAP https ibb co GdWj575 from Friday in which you can struggle to find some bright spots with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care amp Real Estate sectors while for the WEEK https ibb co 441kLYw there is some more breadth with Energy Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains On Thursday we also saw Powell https ibb co M7vznm4 reiterating the point that rates won t be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless CLAIMS https ibb co X5brzGZ which jumped almost 200K a lot worse than expected and the previous month as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5 27M a big increase over last week Moving on Friday we also received more economic data with the January Consumer https ibb co n38hy4w sentiment coming in at 79 2 lower than expected and the previous read as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations We also saw the New York business activity https ibb co 92Rydt9 coming in at 3 5 worse than the 6 expected and the 4 9 in the previous month with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments Business Inventories https ibb co TRs2SMW came in as expected at a 5 increase M M while Producer prices https ibb co py4bpTn rose less than expected and retail sales https ibb co X2v2Y0Z fell more than expected with a 7 decrease M M This WEEK https ibb co VqGMnJT we start of slow with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting earnings https ibb co B2T64dc for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers Netflix to see how the stay at home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things In some other stock market news we saw Aphria https ibb co nwxNpm0 beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks while Lemonade https ibb co vw4dXQ7 dropped more than 9 after CITRON went at them again implying a drop back to under 100 expected very soon We also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day with PETCO https ibb co KwTHrvY popping almost 50 and POSHMARK https ibb co 3cGk45W more than doubling before dropping 20 as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs with Churchill https ibb co 6JGGKHP Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn t go through Meanwhile Delta https ibb co FzGKp9C Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from 24M to 12M day in Q4 which helped most of the airlines rally Thursday was capped off my Biden s https ibb co bzh0fsV new relief package proposal that seems to be around 1 9T This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations This package includes 400B in crisis aids including 20B for vaccines 50B for testing 30B for supplies and 140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open The plan also includes 1T in aids to individuals including 1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to 400 week through September 30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to 15 hour Biden s propsal also includes the highly debated help for state amp local governments worth 350B amp 50B in small business grants and loans This will probably serve as a starting point and I don t expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep It s likely going to be less than 1 9T and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state amp local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks This will likely be a short term boost for the stock market but the impacts of this in terms of inflation debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long run And moving on Friday we saw Tesla s https ibb co Vqmf9Mm forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to 950 with a bull case of 1250 as the Tesla Model Y https ibb co 1Qws23d has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models while in contrast Nikola https ibb co r3dFQSk seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares Some similar action was seen from the director of GameStop https ibb co rvyQdvq who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock This kind of companies provide high risk high reward opportunities but you should have a tight approach to them you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don t have a good fundamental basis So let s hope for a good day in the markets as the WORLD https ibb co nr2Pw5W markets seem to be pointing to a good day as we await Biden s pick Janet Yellen s remarks https ibb co bsjzK1b on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US FUTURES https ibb co S3cfpZq are also pointing to a green open with the Nasdaq leading the way Thank you

fixes for saving your GME tendies Two important things to know about limit orders 1 They can change your limit price They can even do it multiple times But only under certain conditions specifically limit orders placed during a halt can be repriced to fit the trading bands So if you re looking at reputable charts not robinhood and trading is halted don t send in an order You ll get fucked by gay bears One suggests that they can only change it in your favor but why take the risk Don t place orders during a halt it s dumb anyways gt Q How will orders priced aggressively through a Price Band be handled by Nasdaq For example price bands are 9 00 11 00 and a bid is entered for 11 05 gt Orders that are priced aggressively outside the bands will be re priced upon entry to the limit price bands both IOC and longer time in force orders Non IOC orders that are slid due to LULD will receive a time stamp upon being booked and will be treated according to standard price time priority For limit priced orders entered via OUCH protocol Incoming limit priced orders shall reprice upon entry only once and subsequently will cancel resting limit priced interest to buy sell if Price Bands move such that the price of the resting limit priced interest to buy sell would be above below the upper lower Price Band gt For limit priced orders entered via RASH or FIX protocols Exchange systems shall reprice multiple times any limit priced interest to buy sell to the upper lower Price Band if Price Bands move such that the price of resting limit priced interest to buy sell would be above below the upper lower Price Band https www nasdaqtrader com content MarketRegulation LULD FAQ pdf and for another easier to read source gt The NBBO can be accessed if it is resting on the Price Bands However if the stock is in a Straddle State the bid or of f er outside t he price band is deemed non executable Therefore market orders or aggressively priced limit orders may be reject ed back t o t he sender or re priced by exchanges once the price bands are reached There is currently no uniform practice by the stock exchanges on how market orders will be handled in a Straddle State It is possible that bids and offers can fade fast er then the ref erence price is adjust ed However the exchanges are st ill discussing how often this may actually occur in practice NASDAQ conducted two studies last summer in a 9 day trading period N A SD A Q examined 6100 Tier 2 stocks and not ed t hat t here were 3800 instances of a Straddle St at e t hat averaged 12 5 minutes Tier 1 stocks in theory should not see too many Straddle States 2 Putting in a sell order does not guarantee anything The only way to guarantee it is to ask for a certificate for your shares which no one here is doing There is a lot of conflicting info on this but since they can t change your prices unless you placed a trade even a limit order during a halt you may as well put your big ass limit orders up ahead of time Better safe than sorry Squeeze until squoze When to sell It s easier to wait for the drop to sell most of it trailing out 5 10 every 125 starting at 150 175 or so up until then Even small balls should hold most of it until longer though Potentially 3x the profits when we diamond hands With the Volkswagen infinity squeeze you got more money selling it after the initial spike then you did selling it before And the timing was much easier gt Months leading up to MOASS stock price doubled and there was a big dip the Friday before the MOASS 65 Euro drop gt Monday At start of trading day jumps to 348 up 66 from Friday close b c of weekend press release by Porsche Closes the day up 149 gt Tuesday Starts lower than Monday close but then goes up During day it hits the high point at 1K It closed at 945 that Tuesday gt Wednesday Porsche jumps in and offers shares to help the shorts And price starts going down gt Friday Closed at 495 Thread https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kwn8mr gmewhen to sell if we moass lessons from Price Jump Research Here https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l00y1h the effect of short interest on stock performance gjr3r4a context 3 is a paper from actual college educated researchers on how much a squeeze will squoze based on short interest For the non readers it is a 6 share price buff per 1 of SI ON TOP OF THE NORMAL VALUATION That s right autists You re going to take 315 150 SI and add it to your estimated actual GME value At the same time the Infinity Squeeze means the rate of increase itself could also jump up quickly So put in your limit orders well ahead of time at astounding prices and DO NOT resend them if the market is halted the MM can change the prices during a halt Not a market order either unless you want to be matched up with some covering for 20 share Limit orders are the way TL DR Set your limits ahead of time but 420 is way too low to stick it to the shorts add 315 minimum in squeeze bonus to your GME valuation For timing it the best price was one day after the squeeze while the price 3 4 and 5 days after the squeeze we re all still better than day 1 for the Volkswagen infinity squeeze Do NOT place limit orders or any order while trading is halted or they can slide your limit price around to feed the shorts

very volatile Bulls need consistent price increases to not get clubbed by MMs until around 50 where option dealers MMs will naturally help from that point until Friday Friday will tend to significantly reverse whatever happened this week if movements were large 30 Bears should not get greedy under 27 or 26 Most price action early this morning was MM driven Gamma dead zones are seeming to trap the stock the long hang at 38 was one such dead zone Trading before dead zones in your favor buying under a ramp selling over a ramp in this environment This post is about the market maker positions in GME and the effects that will have on the market Recall that last week MMs probably accounted for as much as 2 3 of the price action acting as a lever for WSB s wipe out of a lot of short positions Right now I believe dealers are massively long I don t have great tools to calculate but my guess is long about 10 15m shares They are of course loaning these shares out to shorts and making bank doing it since the lending rate is at 30 right now with not a lot of shares available to short This also means that if you buy puts from an MM it s easy for them to hedge it they just reduce their long In terms of what dealers will do as time goes on you need to understand gamma ramps Gamma ramps are prices where there are a LOT of open interest of options As prices cross up over these dealers if they are short options which I think they are and evidence suggests they are have to buy like crazy As price declines they also sell like crazy Gamma giveth gamma taketh away At open today I believe dealers had to buy about 5 5 million shares between open and the stock hitting 44 In other words they were the majority of the price action over that range fueled by WSB bid forcing them to in turn buy more stock But this gamma also taketh away as people sold positions or sold their ITM calls dealers dumped stock back and gamma kicked in plumetting the stock back to the 38 range As I mentioned last week the heavy concentration of options at 39 and 40 mean that crossing these prices up or down is very easy while crossing other prices is harder Below is a map of current gamma structure It s written to represent puts below and calls on top but really it should be both below because I think dealers are extremely short options here sold people calls AND puts These ramps like I said represent areas where price will move very quickly and in the adjacent dollar to them really but sharpest right at the price https imgur com a nHm1eqU https imgur com a nHm1eqU Next up is the is the map of options expiring this week This is important because at the end of the week anything in the money somewhat rolls off the MM books some exercised some rolled but last friday was selling on similar effects so would expect the same dynamic which is selling if price up a lot buying if price down a lot If there are a lot of ITM calls you expect selling Friday If there are a lot of ITM puts you expect buying Friday Additionally as the week goes on ITM and OTM options sort of purify their impact An OTM call today is going to be hedged by a MM with a long stock postiion But as the week goes on they hedge less since it becomes less likely Similarly an OTM put today is hedged with a short position That ll be reduced over the week For ITM positions those go from partially hedged to fully hedged throughout the week Right now there are a lot more near term OTM call positions than puts so the natural hedging behavior of MMs will be to sell stock unless the price is climbing quickly Here is this week s chart and next week s chart You ll notice this week matters a lot more https imgur com a of2oqCX https imgur com a of2oqCX Overall trading dynamics Putting this really simply if we go from 38 to 60 MMs would have to buy something like 13 or 14m shares If we fall to 27 they will sell but less maybe 9 or 10m shares The gamma structure is slightly supportive of the bull ramp but also can facilitate bear So ultimately we can move fast but it depends on the actions of investors WSB buying vs old value holders liquidating shares new short sellers etc I don t know what value investors are doing but recall that when people were buying this at 5 10 they talked about price targets in the teens or even lower We see circumstantial evidence of value trimming and selling which is probably the main force in opposition of WSB buying Option dealers MMs will make a lot of money if the stock closes around at a not high price this week due to the massive OI they d have to hedge It s not in their interest to get to the 20s necessarily but they will make money more easily if short interest stays high and this doesn t get into the 40s They love this situation because they are loaning out shares at a crazy borrow rate since they are long the stock This does make the price vulnerable to options manipulation Were someone to go out and buy a bunch of 45 puts right now 100m of capital would in turn shoot 12m shares down triggering more selling probably causing a 24m sell to 27 Very tempting for a hedge fund The same could happen in reverse on calls though A similar strength ITM call buy would send the price to the 50s Crossing 39 40 is easy I expect lots of ping ponging around it Crossing multiples of 5 is easy while in between numbers are harder and are gamma dead zones where stock will move more slowly and languish at times For bulls and bears Buying or selling around ramps is probably sensible For a bull you d want to buy right under a ramp that can shoot up price such as 38 75 or something For a bear you d want to sell right after a ramp like at 42 or 41 5 For bulls Realistically getting to low 40s is easy Getting to low 50s is harder but entirely possible Getting to 61 62 is also possible Though harder still but it s a heavy lift past that because there isn t OI there and at that point would require huge amounts of new money or short squeeze to happen For bears I d say you are getting real greedy if you hold puts past the high 20s because there s not a lot of gamma there and there s a lot of short cover motivation Weekly Options Expiration Trading Dynamics Because there are a LOT of options expiring AGAIN this week the effect of these and next weeks options decaying is important Basically as time goes forward towards expiration the options look more and more like either a pure long or short position or a distant option and hedging follows Right now a near the money call will be heavily hedged with stock but by Friday it will hardly be hedged at all That means ITM calls that are near the money cause buying OTM calls cause selling ITM puts cause selling OTM puts cause buying Looking at the current trading expirations it would appear that at price levels before about 44 or 45 the options dealers MMs are going to be dumping shares as they de hedge all those calls you guys bought After that it starts to be the opposite of net buying So for bulls you really need to get the price up to 50 preferably 55 pretty fast for these effects to work in your favor For bears you kind of can expect that a stable price in the high 30s has a good chance of causing de hedge into the 35 ramp and then down to 30 Going into Friday I ll post an update but in general there will be some reversal of whatever is ITM If we were at 60 I d definitely be selling into Friday If we were at 25 I d definitely be buying into Friday I should mention that the effects here are LESS POWERFUL than last weeks which had a huge block of expiring options and just more OI in genera But I still think MMs will be a major maybe dominant force this week Positions still short with puts 38 strike This post s information is slightly bullish actually assuming momentum continues My reason for being bearish is not relevant to this post and I got downvoted on that elsewhere No I don t work for Melvin they have no position now as far as we know their puts expired worthless last Friday and their actions all made you bulls about 3 a share FYI by contributing to price reduction pre last week then helping fuel the massive gamma squeeze last week

STPK Stem Inc STPK is an energy storage company focusing on battery storage systems network integration and battery optimization They brand themselves as the first pure play smart energy storage company to go public a lot of buzz words I know but bear with me First let s take a moment to quickly understand how battery storage works Battery storage is a type of energy storage power station that uses a group of batteries to store electrical energy This is primarily used in the renewables space with solar and wind energy In recent years battery storage and in part renewable energy hasn t seen the exponential growth that many are expecting due to limitations in battery technology and high development costs This being said recent developments of battery tech and reduction of costs have now made battery storage much more feasible at the commercial industrial level Battery storage still has ways to go in the residential space due to risks that come with it https preview redd it xy2e3iml1yb61 png width 2230 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e8c903a5ac25ef5d70ad9993880886010df73d32 While battery storage has improved it will not be stand alone solution for many years to come because it simply isn t feasible with our global energy infrastructure Battery storage will work with our interconnected grid to reduce imbalances between energy demand and energy production Ok so now that we know how it works what does the market look like All major global markets are forecasted to double over the next decade Over the next decade the US market is expected to grow at 45 CAGR and the global market is expected to grow 31 CAGR Future tailwinds with improvements in the regulatory environment https preview redd it 7x98ssvk1yb61 png width 2236 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 94e525ba6bab348a408ec2b59297d03cbcf5b896 Great so how is STPK revolutionizing this space They are doing so by providing a one stop shop solution for utility companies Stem s solution can provide integrations with hardware batteries and the grid network while also using an AI powered software solution to optimize their energy storage https preview redd it ljxci0lu3yb61 png width 2208 amp

customers to alternate between onsite generation grid power or battery power https preview redd it gdctb7fs1yb61 png width 2230 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

value proposition and truly could be revolutionary It is a large part of their moat as they have 24 issued patents for it so no competitor can replicate it Now let s move onto their financials First it s important to understand they have a hardware and software business Increased rev from 17 mil to 33 mil YoY expected to increase to 147 mil in 2021 81 CAGR from 2020 2026 Gross margins have hovered around 12 18 since 2018 but expected to increase to 40 by 2026 90 of forecasted 2021 revs are from closed executed contracts not pipeline gt underpromising and overdelivering Software revenue

7864d71303378bbb5c43e5620b16f49047d5f1eb A majority of their revenues are from their hardware segment but it will be interesting to see how Athena contributes to their financials moving forward They need to execute yes but I m confident they can do so given it has been in development for 5 years and they have continuously improved upon due to years of data collection They might have used this time to validate Athena with their customers and now feel comfortable scaling it exponentially Lastly I was curious to see how they compare to Tesla as well all know a large part of Tesla s valuation is their energy business Interestingly enough they actually use batteries from Tesla Samsung and Panasonic Additionally they have a partnership with Tesla https preview redd it 0xxgetre2yb61 png width

they will try to do after,Obligatory disclaimer I am not an expert nor have I been doing this long I m also rather poor If you wish to award this post please also buy a GME share or something at Gamestop Obligatory emoji Obligatory position GME 266 shares 36 54 avg Before I get into this I need to say two things first One shorters will keep shorting they re in too deep Second they will also do their absolute best to make ANYONE ELSE sell or short too and they ve had years of practice on how to manipulate people Reason 1 GME is a mall store blockbuster no future will cite earnings reports Please see this very extensive Due Diligence DD https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kz7ygv gme dd one dd to rule them one dd to find them along with this fascinating new development https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kypuyb gme dd buildapc kiosks coming GME is on a trajectory to do some pretty cool things even without the short squeeze that has everyone excited Long buyers are in amp x200B Most likely things they will cite are 1 Total sales declined 3 1 in the holiday sales report 2 Large 3rd quarter sales declines pre covid vs post covid the most likely cause 3 Closed 11 of stores which they did to cut underperforming stores and because their stores are FAR too dense especially given an increased focus on E commerce amp x200B Most likely things they will intentionally leave out 1 Comparable store sales increased 4 8 in holiday report so decrease likely because of store closures 2 E commerce is at 34 of company sales equivalent to Best Buy percentage and growing rapidly and more rapidly than Best Buy 3 Regional sales in Australia New Zealand no covid went UP 31 amp x200B Reason 2 Insiders are selling This is true But here are the facts that they will leave out 1 12 21 1 13 21 Hestia Capital whose managing member is Wolf Kurt James sold 945 550 shares of GME for this reason in order to better align with the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital The fund still owns 91 000 shares and Wolf Kurt James PERSONALLY AND DIRECTLY still owns 50 689 including 20 000 of his wife s shares Also 1 13 21 Dunn Lizabeth sold 5 000 shares of GME She still owns 57 258 1 13 21 1 14 21 Raul J Fernandez sold 34 619 shares of GME He still owns 32 789 1 13 21 Kathy P Vrabeck sold 50 000 shares of GME She still owns 79 537 The forms regarding the previous 3 people s sales were all filed by Dunn Lizabeth suggesting that they sold as a coordinated choice Also all three of those people are NOT on the Board of Directors as proposed by RC Ventures and conditionally agreed to by Gamestop an agreement they ll almost definitely keep given the huge increases in share price upon RC Ventures buy in and policy changes that RC Ventures has strongly suggested recommended Source SEC Filings https sec report Ticker GME amp x200B Reason 3 This is a pump and dump sneaky nonsense by WSB First lol The people on this sub don t have anything like that sort of buying power especially not if we take out the people that actually believe in GameStop More importantly see reason 1 especially the part about outstanding short interest amp x200B Reason 4 The short squeeze has already happened Now here I expect them to throw up some really shady data analysis looking at shares shorted or available to short or short interest of daily trading and try and pretend like that number really means that the shorts have already covered Here s the important data there s some in the DD in 1 as well First Short interest was higher than float as of EOD Friday https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kzwo2z gme short interest declined to 71m and some other meaning it would take DAYS of trading to cover We ll see updated numbers for Tuesday soon Short interest actually INCREASED during the Wed Thurs time that Citron will likely try to say was the short squeeze Now these are Ortex estimates based on the self reported shares short at a large aggregate of brokerages but have been very reliable when compared to the official SEC data that comes out every half a month The point being that it is extremely extremely likely that shorts HAVE NOT covered and have in fact DOUBLED DOWN ON SHORTING TO DRIVE DOWN THE PRICE Meanwhile it is further likely that long buyers have locked in MORE shares so the real short float is higher than we would expect on the assumption that every float share is really not locked down amp x200B Reason 5 I expect this to be a meme reason cuz they had 4 and needed 5 to make it sound good But otherwise it ll be an extension of reason 1 or something to do with SEC regulations or something nonsensical Will update to respond if necessary So what will happen THIS IS A GUESS But based on the sudden vanishing of shares available to short at IKBR at approximately the same time as the Citron announcement I suspect tomfoolery In addition Citron just started doing these twitter Live things two days ago Yes GME wasn t the first one but it s still a very recent new thing At the same time GME has had some barefaced manipulation these past few days on this sub and elsewhere in the media not to mention the likely months of naked shorting https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments ky9mu0 gme comrades 115 update 27 consecutive days on Option 1 we have a repeat of Friday where shorters will try to immediately and early smash down GME price in hopes that it will keep going down after starting that trajectory They can do this because SEC Rule 201 expires after today so they can short on a downtick again Option 2 Shorters will first allow stocks to rise as they did today Then at around 11 30 1 hour GME will start to tank If it was me I would time it and hit it very hard so it hits 10 for the day the furthest they can push it by shorting on downticks as close to the Citron announcement as possible with the hopes that that livestream will then push retail shorters to short more or paper handers to sell This is all assuming no input from Ryan Cohen or GME so any kind of announcement or tweet would throw a wrench in my predictions Especially if Option 2 is right and they timed it for a mid morning peak before the Citron livestream

everyone today most of you not paper handed bitches That shitron play was literally the raid boss round 1 if we can bring the price back up from that fall then the future is already foretold They cant possibly having anything stronger than the biggest shorting name in the business known for massive price manipulations using their research I will imagine they will try the same shit with unlimited shorts alongside their stream and biden inauguration tomorrow so HOLD THE FUCKING LINE DIAMOND HANDS and we shall we rewarded Obligatory I love deep fucking value in both sense of the words I have this year exploited a massive value gap in RPS Group in the UK buying in around 30p now 80p a cheeky 250 in 9 months GME Position 292 shares 17 Now I want dig dip below the surface of your little smoothbrains and tap into that imagination Here I will take you through some examples and imagine the future GME Lets be Aunt Cathie like how she imagines branch future outcomes based on existing states Ie Tesla has good full self driving software way ahead of competitors therefore it can be the first mover in the autonomous taxi network At the end of the day our only limit is Lord Cohens imagination I want you to consider the whole world of gaming PC console handheld peripherals and chairs board games VR experiences merch performance enhancement esports I m sure there are others I haven t thought of The name is GAMESTOP its strong and well known and is well distributed in the hearts of cities and towns Its time people stop thinking about its as just a place that will only sell discs like a record store As an ecommerce opportunity GME can be one stop store for all of these As far as I understand there is not one decent site that offers all of this under one roof I have an example in another industry later Amazon do all this retard but who honestly enjoys shopping at Amazon literally its only good for fast free delivery Its full of shitty Chinese knockoffs searching is awful doesn t have half the stuff you want full of fake reviews and jeff is a wanker and amazon treat their workers like shit There is a gap in the market for a all in one game store with fast free delivery that treats its customers like saints Any physical stores should reflect this and be like nerd nirvana Latest cool products meet ups board game events esports tourneys repairs community hub for nerds spreading the sweet brand of GME This year I have spent over 1k on gaming stuff headset new pc chair ps5 to come rip stock This was a fucking mission having to go all over the internet to find good value and the bits I wanted with all the items ending up arriving at different times New PC from like 5 different places Scan amazon ebay Box Headset from Scan Chair direct from Secret Lab monitor from fuck knows where Would have been so much easier if I good buy it all from one place and get a bulk discount for buying so much shit All these products bring me on to esports which ties into the game industry story Esports is literally being eaten up by venture capitalists and smart brands Guess who sponsors ESL yes fucking Mercedes Benz amp DHL not who you think would advertise GrowUp lel to supposably greasy fat pale skinned skint young esport neckbeards What boomers don t seem to get is that gamers aren t like this and that they are the incoming middle class who will create families whose children will be brought up with brands their parents are exposed to They have well paid jobs like software engineers doctors teachers engineers This is literally WSB and is why boomers aren t getting us and GME I mean look at our god DFV he s quirky but a normal guy and plenty of cash Both of these companies have not only got PR gold as infamous memes We did it reddit Mercedes embraced the meme DotA2 https www reddit com r DotA2 comments 79hb3t we did it reddit mercedes embraced the meme have spread and DHL chants in stadiums have been sung but are gaining love for sponsoring events people are really passionate about Gamers love things that support their passion and are very brand loyal and are the right age 18 32 to sow deep brand loyalty Now imagine GME starts getting involved in these events sowing its brand in the same way as Mercedes to the same people that will then guaranteed buy stuff at its store Its literally unbelievable this synergy hasn t been exploited yet I would love to see someone address all this stuff that actually knows advertising and marketing well compared to me just reading things over the years Next I want to give you an example of some all in one stores that already outcompete Amazon in a certain similar industry For this I will use bicycles yes you did hear me right As some of you will no doubt know the world of bicycles has so much symmetry with gaming Bicycles owners love having the latest tech and coolest toys they love upgrading and are super passionate and proud about their hobby and are within an ecosystem both tech wise and like esports e g Copying the gear of pro cyclists like esports watchers do of pro gamers watching big youtube channels with further advertised products this is all gamers in a nutshell Again I use myself as an example I use a Sennheiser headset SteelSeries peripherals Funnily I have bought these subconsciously via the sponsored products used by the team EG Amazon and other mega stores whilst selling some stuff just don t compete with the specialised all in one ecommerce stores like Wiggle Chain Reaction Cycles amp Sigma Sports 95 of the bike stuff I have ever bought is from these They sell everything to do with bikes clothing merch health and nutrition components upgrades the list goes on Sound familiar The products and ecosystem are just too technical and complex for some mega store like Amazon to do it properly Likewise Amazon cannot focus on customer experience like these stores can which is important for technical products if there is a tech issue or a breakdown Amazon is too big and spread out for its own good If you mention Wiggle to someone oh yeah that s the place that sends out Haribo with every order Basically GME needs to integrate itself amongst the wider gaming world and community with strategic partnerships marketing and combine this with excellent customer service I m sure big daddy Cohen as already cottoned on to this Lastly I want to bring your attention to Games Workshop in the UK its worth checking this out as to how GME may improve itself Its literally the darling of the London Stock Exchange The company is the best performing FTSE250 retailer of the past decade More importantly it shows how well a business with significant strategic brick and mortar and ecommerce presence can perform We should note lastly that although we don t have any proof any of this will occur sometimes you have to believe in the vision laid out by a man to extract ultimate value out of of a play Cohen is our Elon in this play Hopefully this has opened your imagination to some extra pathways in the GME value thesis Yours sincerely a tea drinker AND FUCKING HOLD YOUR SHARES LIKE WE HELD THE LINE TOGETHER IN D DAY
