strike for end of year 2023 and 18 strike for end of this year 1 BCRX Short float BCRX has a short float of 11 39 a total of 20 010 000 shares are shorted you may think 11 39 is a lot but considering the stock is on track to the moon we could possibly bankrupt some more hedge funds 2 BCRX upcoming drugs Peramivir Rapivab is a Government bio defense antiviral drug for the treatment of Influenza Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor acting as a transition state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about 180 million to support the program In 2013 BARDA HHS released new funding under the current 234 8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous IV peramivir amp x200B Galidesivir BCX4430 is a broad spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security including SARS CoV 2 the cause of COVID 19 Ebola Marburg Yellow Fever and Zika Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid RNA viruses in nine different families including coronaviruses filoviruses togaviruses bunyaviruses arenaviruses paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses Hepatitis C West Nile Dengue Jap Encephalitis Yellow Fever TBEV OHFV and Zika orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses Galidesivir trials are fully funded by the NIAID It s a Government funded bio defense drug Galidesivir was safe and well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects FOP is an ultra rare severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton also known as heterotopic ossification HO HO can occur in muscles tendons and soft tissue Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time with restricted movement and fused joints resulting in deformities and premature mortality There are currently no approved treatments for FOP There are an estimated 3 500 to 9 000 patients worldwide with 900 diagnosed so far Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M 900M in 2025 growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed With a price ranging from 900K 1M year In PH1 study BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase selectivity safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models safe and well tolerated BCX9930 is a novel oral potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of Factor D which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement mediated diseases Treatment that is able to control both Intravascular and Extravascular hemolysis FDA granted Fast Track Orphan drug designation for BCX9930 s PNH study BCX9930 is an oral inhibitor of the Factor D enzyme that activates Factor B to form the C3 alternative pathway Developing this kind of inhibitors ain t easy at all Most of this inhibitors in the development process fail or obtain poor results At the moment BCX9930 is the best in class inhibitor in the game Reasons will be explained below 3 CEO has commented on being able to handily beat earnings next quarter Last quarter they were expected to only get 0 26 EPS they crushed that expectation by getting 0 36 EPS this is due to their newest drug being approved and marketed the ceo seems to think next quarter will be even bigger than the last 4 The newest drug BCRX has approved makes the life of the consumer much easier Orladeyo is the first Oral approved treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with hereditary angioedema HAE disease which is estimated to affect 1 in 50 000 people Orladeyo received USA approval December the 3rd 2020 Q4 Orladeyo received Japan approval April the 14th 2021 Q2 Orladeyo received Europe approval April the 30th 2021 Q2 Orladeyo received UK approval May the 12th 2021 Q2 Orladeyo is ranked https www beckershospitalreview com pharmacy 20 most expensive prescription drugs in 2021 html the 13 most expensive drug in the USA market 37 308 is approximately what patients insurances must monthly pay to access the drug Despiste it being an expensive drug it s the Cheapest and only Orally taken option in the HAE field It is very important to note here the only other treatment for HAE is injection based only This makes it very likely the person with said disease will switch to this oral pill over an injection for improved life quality netting more revenue for the company 5 Soaring stock price BCRX is already up 318 78 from the end of 2020 Considering the stock price was only 4 40 nov 23 2020 it is safe to assume the shorts placed on this stock are already being squeezed to death so it won t take much more to force the hedge funds to cover their losses If you want more hedge fund

on Monday I was evaluating my positions and analyzing the results of market movement and something dawned on me about squeezes First of all I m coming to conclusion based on my perspective and life experience The reason for a short squeeze isn t always based on the widespread and common belief that hedges are shorting stocks to manipulate the market and take your money I believe that not to be entirely true Take a look back at the bigger picture Think about all the squeezes that you may have had a position in they all have a different story I m not sure why GameStop was so heavy shorted I m not sure why AMC was shorted the way it was either But I do know this They both have a following of millions of consumers who want to be loyal to these companies as well as the thousand other companies that are publicly traded Loyalty established a bond between one party and another With loyalty creating emotional bonds it establishes strength with support The more support you have the stronger the idea agenda or campaign is when those who oppress and are in an unfavorable position of thus The bears are against and bulls are for Conflict will eventually take hold How are we going to hash this out Verbal debates No there are too many people Physical violence Eh both sides would rather do without So they will hash this debate through publicly traded securities What more of a better way is there to reign an assault on an entity is there than by the means of using a publically available system that has high risk at taking your money legally Hands clean nobody physically hurt It s brilliant really Oh you lost your money rooting for a cause in the stock market Well that s too bad because both sides will agree that investing in general especially in a potentially volatile market is an absolute risk Who gets the reward will be decided through the underlying share price aww you lost your coinz that s the market for you buy the ticket and take the ride You might not get there though So what is the parallel between CLOV and this potential short squeeze The answer to that is simple It s a fight against a political family party which holds somewhat of what you would call a dynasty of power in this country their business partners associates and friends Common people who are not filthy rich mostly just talk shiit to each other with Twitter or Facebook If not that their our your they them us we sometimes duke it out and actually physically fight and cause harm to each other On the other hand rich people and those with heavy political interest or involvement fight each other through policy business ventures and yup you got it the stock market OK so what about CLOV Chelsea Clinton is a director of Clover Health Investments She is the daughter of Hillary and Bill Clinton If you didn t know who Chelsea Clinton is you probably should just stop trading and go catch up on shit and get smart By proxy obviously she plays on team democrat and his heavily involved in democratic shenanigans Republicans have shenanigans too so don t get your panties all twisted like I m pushing some political narrative Hedges have political interest very much so Many people don t like the Clintons for various reasons that I really don t give two shits to talk about But CLOV being shorted the way it has and is most likely has to do something with people being against the Clintons or Democratic backed and supported ventures That s just my speculation but hey whatever Personally I don t really give two shits if you are a democrat or republican and the reason for my market plays has nothing to do with my political views and or interest I do play on a few rules standards or guidelines If you are shorting an American company that seeks interest in bettering the quality of or citizens go fuck yourself You should be ashamed of yourself for trying to chop down American progress at any level or just because you want to take stance on fighting against the other political party just because of the idea that well they are the enemy our foe anything they must be fought against which is arrogant as hell If you are going to establish short interest in a security it better be a damn good reason other than because they are the left or because they are the right I think it s safe to say that we are all here for the most part win hopes of seeking solidity comfort and security in the path to being financially free to a degree Just know what you are fighting for and take good thought before you throw your money around because each and everyone of us who invests whether it s temporary or long term will absolutely be part of changing someone s live somewhere and somehow I m kinda joking about that last part but also somewhat serious On that note IDGAF I m trying to get my dollar count on the up and up Let this dankStonk squeeze like Mama June makin some damn fresh lemonade amp x200B BULLISH AF HODL moretendies ah commmme onnn financial advice go fuck yourself you are an adult don t play that i didn t know the coffee was hot bullshit good luck though

to time the market Here are the results ,We have all heard it Time in the market beats timing the market At the same time we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market The market always seems to break some new all time high records so we wait for the inevitable crash pullback to invest It s high time we put both strategies to test Basically what I wanted to analyze was Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested Analysis For this let s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back 1993 to be exact I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you a Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year b Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year c Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year d Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest 1 For analysis simplicity let s assume that you were on a conservative side never picked individual stocks and always made your investments to S amp P500 2 For investment amount consider that you started with investing 10K in 1993 and increased your investments by 5 for every subsequent year So you made a total investment of 623K over the last 29 years Results https preview redd it ztcgzxk6k5771 png width 861 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 898ee9f2905abbb849b6a3197dfaf7e96c7e1ff4 The analysis did throw up some interesting results There s a lot to unpack here and let s break it down by each segment The most important insight is that it s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market 3 Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year you will still end up having a 263 return on your invested amount At the opposite end of the spectrum if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year you would have made a cool 100 more than someone who invested only at the top Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases let s consider some more realistic scenarios If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month year you would still make a shade over 300 on your investments Out of all the above scenarios you would have made the most amount of money a whopping 391 return if you invested only during major crashes In this type of investing you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash While this seems like a good idea in theory it s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are a The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes It s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up it can end up wiping out your portfolio b Identifying a crash itself is very hard https preview redd it ocz775l9k5771 png width 624 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 171f31da53107b2847e9fe1229492c903313c62b As we can see from the above chart the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year So even when the market is down 10 it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it s going into a deeper crash or whether it s going to bounce back up Conclusion While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns wise practically it s very difficult to execute it For e g even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly where would be your entry point The market was down 15 by Mar 6th another 10 by Mar 13th and then another 10 by March 20th for a total of 35 If you did not get in at the absolute bottom you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run up It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns Adding to this in the last 20 years 70 of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones 4 If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom you will make an absolute killing in the market For the rest of us continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice Data used in the analysis here https docs google com spreadsheets d 1LT3qazGZXHT3qnnBS7oWAZU8n8DH1gv JsCixN2mdPM edit usp sharing Footnotes 1 I have

It Means for the Stock Coupang is one of the largest IPOs of the last few years raising 4 6 billion in its market debut this spring The South Korean e commerce giant is growing rapidly within its home country but due to the relatively small size of South Korea versus other economies around the world many investors are worried its financials have a low ceiling However the company might be on the road to unlocking new growth opportunities with plans to move into Singapore Japan and possibly Malaysia sometime soon Here s what we know about Coupang s expansion plans and what it could mean for the stock going forward The plans In April the Korean Economic Daily reported that Coupang was hiring team members to launch into Singapore sometime shortly More recently rumors have come out that the company wants to move into Japan and Malaysia as well These three countries look like good fits for Coupang to replicate its business model Singapore is a small but densely populated area similar to Seoul South Korea It is a lot smaller than Coupang s home country with a population of only 5 7 million people versus South Korea s 51 7 million Japan has a much larger population than South Korea with 126 million citizens and Tokyo is the largest urban area in the world with a total population of around 38 million people This could be a huge opportunity for Coupang if it can make inroads within the Japanese market Malaysia isn t as rich of a country as Singapore or Japan but it has a fast growing urban center in Kuala Lumpur with a population of 8 2 million I mention these population numbers because Coupang s value proposition relies on it operating in large densely populated urban centers like Seoul The company has built an end to end logistics network with its own warehouses delivery drivers and technology systems that allows it to offer one and same day delivery to most of its members on its e commerce marketplace This owned network within these urban centers also allows Coupang to add services on top of its core e commerce offering like food and grocery delivery Expect it to try to replicate this model if when it launches in these new markets It will face stiff competition Coupang has come to dominate South Korean e commerce and a big reason for that is the minimal competition it has from large well capitalized players That will change once it moves outside of its home country In Singapore and Malaysia the platform will face competition from Shopee which is owned by Sea Limited and Lazada which is owned by Alibaba These two companies have large market caps and a lot of money to invest Coupang s main competitor in Japan will be Amazon the well known e commerce giant Amazon only has a 25 market share in the country so there s a lot of opportunity for other platforms like Coupang to emerge and grow One thing investors should note is that Amazon runs a similar playbook to Coupang which is to invest a ton in delivery infrastructure to help offer as much efficiency low prices and convenience to its customers as it can It might be tough for Coupang to compete against the incumbent by running a similar strategy especially one with as much money as Amazon This doesn t mean Coupang can t succeed in Japan just that it likely will be a more difficult operating environment than South Korea What does it mean for the stock For Coupang stock to perform well over the coming years it will likely need to succeed with these international expansion plans This business is growing rapidly within its home market but at a market cap of 68 billion the valuation is still expensive relative to its trailing financials In Q1 revenue grew 74 year over year to 4 2 billion with trailing 12 month revenue coming in at 18 5 billion While these revenue numbers are looking strong Coupang has low gross margins at 17 4 last quarter which puts a low ceiling on its profit margin potential It will also need to make billions in capital investments over the next few years to build out its end to end logistics network in these new markets At the end of Q1 Coupang had 4 billion in cash so it has plenty of dry powder to make these investments but they will be a drag on cash generation for at least the next few years if not longer Coupang has a strong strategy and is looking to replicate some of Amazon s success by using a similar model in different Asian countries If the company is successful with these planned expansions into Japan Singapore and Malaysia Coupang could be on its way to 100 billion in annual revenue and the stock could do just fine over the next decade But if not investors could end up in trouble due to the stock s high current valuation John Mackey CEO of Whole Foods Market an Amazon subsidiary is a member of The Motley

have legislation either currently slated to be proposed dead or none started more later on As you can see above unless you re really retarded a majority of the US population will soon have access to sports betting The reason for the blue yellow red pie chart is to highlight how much of the remaining population lives in Texas and California Texas has legislation that should be proposed in the 2022

DraftKings as shown above is very aggressive in their effort to thrust themselves in and penetrate every market available to them They have active gaming presence in more states than any of the other apps companies being available to over 90 of the eligible market As more states legalize sports betting more online betting markets will open up Thanks to DKNG s exposure they will grow right along

implementation and penetration Have more market share than any competitor Have a load of partnerships with sports leagues teams and media for exposure The most recognizable name in the category We

Due Diligence and I m starting a weekly series where I am looking at the top shorted biotech stocks in the world to try and find value I have worked in the clinic academia and for biotech startups before switching to investing full time My investment style and opinion is based on equal parts experience research and stalking C suite Coming in at the 15th most shorted stock in the world is Clovis Oncology CLVS with 30 24 stock shorted https www highshortinterest com as of the time of this writing Clovis Oncology is a classic example of what could have been if there was better leadership One of their main competitors with a similar drug Tesaro was bought by GSK for 5 1 Billion dollars As of this writing Clovis Oncology is worth about 620MM This is a company that was one of the first entrants to PARP inhibition poly adp ribose polymerase This company is cash flow negative has a low number of job postings and seems like it is contracting but not fast enough to have any meaningful difference They are trying to find value overseas mainly the EU which is a desperation play Quick Ape Translation Cancer is not one disease it is many diseases and there is usually a driver of disease All cancer is basically cells that won t die and won t stop growing If a cancer has only 1 or 2 pathways that drive it then we can cure this cancer by blocking those pathways li ke CML went from 95 dead to 5 dead after 5 years https ashpublications org blood article 124 4 511 33326 Prognosis for patients with CML and gt 10 BCR ABL1 once we discovered how to block BCR ABL pathway Pretty cool stuff So PARP inhibitors work by blocking PARP PARP is a DNA Handyman You are destroying your DNA like the dumb ape you are all the time Being in the sun genetics BRCA chemicals intentional like chemotherapy and unintentional like environmental exposure all cause damage to DNA Damage to DNA can result in cancer or cell death If your body had to replace the entire cell this happened then it would be a waste of resources so it is more efficient just to repair the DNA single strand or double strand breaks AKA use PARP If DNA is not repaired then the cell dies So PARP Inhibitors cause cell death indirectly to both cancer cells and normal healthy cells If your cancer is more likely to have DNA breaks especially double strand breaks then PARP inhibitors are more efficacious These are typically inherited germline cancers like BRCA1 BRCA2 ATM CHEK2 etc These can be found with simple tests but usually these tests are not done unless you have family history https www medicinenet com angelina jolie mastectomy views htm or have progressed through several lines of therapy where there is a higher likelihood of finding it These tests are not done frontline first diagnosed with cancer unless part of a trial or the above reasons so there is a limited patient population that is eligible for this type of therapy PARP inhibitors while taken orally act more like chemotherapy with their side effect profiles and patients don t typically tolerate them well C suite Honestly I hate their leadership because there is zero accountability to their shareholders and they re complacent For example the founder President CEO Member of the Board of Directors is Patrick J Mahaffy https clovisoncology com about leadership management team patrick j mahaffy You see that big smile He s smiling because he lucked into another drug before a great product called Vidaza that he sold to Celgene for Billions https www reuters com article us pharmion celgene celgene to buy pharmion for 2 9 billion idUSWEN265020071119 This is his second company He doesn t need the money he s set He s not hungry but after he crashed this stock CLVS from 93 not once but twice he s still milking the company for 6 2MM to 8 7MM https www salary com tools executive compensation calculator patrick j mahaffy salary bonus stock options for clovis oncology inc year 2017 compensation per year Oh and did I mention how even though they are issuing Senior Convertible Notes https clovisoncology com about leadership management team patrick j mahaffy read get paid out before shareholders if this crashes and burns he s still collecting such a ridiculous compensation Compare that to true leaders who opt to not take compensation to make sure their company grows like Robert Duggan for 7 years of PCYC https web archive

for the company TL DR This company has an uphill battle to become cash flow positive and has to face much larger Pharma Companies with greater resources AstraZeneca https www lynparza com Pfizer https www pfizerpro com product talzenna hcp GSK https zejula com Janssen https www jnj com janssen announces u s fda breakthrough therapy designation granted for niraparib for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer without a superior product This company wasn t cash flow positive before https www nasdaq com market activity stocks clvs financials the space became crowded and has since become very very crowded with better competition Is a buyout possible Yes but by who and for how much Leadership doesn t know what they re doing the board is asleep at the wheel PARP inhibitors rupacarib their only approved product are inherently non selective so they are toxic and therefore patients won t be on them for long and Medical Oncologists are more likely to select other

go easy on me Please make sure you double check my claims I have only recently learned to read Do your own DD to supplement this GDNP Key Facts Market cap 132M Outstanding shares 150M Stock Price 1 02 ATH 1 98 February What is a GDNP Good Natured Products Inc Formerly Solegear is a Canadian plant based product packaging company headquartered in Vancouver The company has operated since 2006 with the purpose of creating Better everyday products by creating bioplastic based food storage solutions All About Plastics According to their website a material becomes a Bioplastic when it contains a minimum of 25 plant based material GDNP however goes much beyond this They like to refer to their products as plant based as many of their products fall much above this threshold for example their cupcake holders are made from 99 plant based material So what do they make their products from you may ask I don t know I dropped out of chemistry Corn or something Read this if you re a nerd and you actually care https goodnaturedproducts ca pages bioplastics https goodnaturedproducts ca pages bioplastics Each product on their website also shows the of plant based material that it contains Why Should I Care About Sustainability Sustainable investing is certainly a hot topic and one I think many people can get behind There is an increasing demand for ethical companies who practice CSR There are numerous green energy ETF s that have far outperformed SPY Take ICLN for example returning 110 YTD as compared to SPY s 13 The demand for this will only grow as time goes on especially as oil prices continue to fall and renewable energies take over By investing green you are helping to future proof your investment The Business You buy the products straight from their website They have numerous offerings including coffee cups lids takeout containers cutlery etc Surprisingly the products seem to be very competitively priced You may expect these products to come at a high premium however many are very fairly priced This table shows other comparisons of some products vs Uline s ProductsGood Natured ProductsUline12 oz Coffee Cups x1000 131 128Small Carry Out Box x500 118 7912 oz Soup Containers x1000 184 152 people may not see the value in paying more for a green product however I would make the argument this could easily benefit a business Should people recognize you are using plant based containers they are more likely to want to support you over a company using harsh products Especially during the pandemic when everything is take out only people are becoming increasingly aware of the amount of garbage that comes along with an order The company operates on a more for more basis offering superior products at an increased price Environmental sustainability is not the only advantage of GDNP s products they also boast well thought out designs that combat takeout container issues The product descriptions are detailed and transparent also displaying the that an item is plant based As stated on their website the performance of many of their products is actually superior to their non bioplastic counterparts Additionally these prices INCLUDE shipping across North America Overall the company presents an extremely appealing value proposition that easily beats out rivals such as Uline Company Financials These come from FactSet as well as their Q3 Financial Statements on their website Ok I am absolutely terrible at accounting and therefore this isn t a deep dive into the company s financial standing In general it would seem that GDNP has seen rapid growth especially from 2019 2020 however they are still not profitable The company has negative EPS The company has negative net income Liabilities are growing fast Essentially as the company attempts to grow and scale their debt is steadily rising At the same time their profits and revenues are increasing as fast as their debts The company will have to turn a profit at some point however Potential Threats All from Appendix 1 of the 2020 Q3 MD amp A Funding The company needs money As stated the company cannot sustain growth if they do not raise enough capital Profitability 5 years was spent on R amp D developing their products They worry that the revenues they are producing will not be enough to sustain the company Competition If another similar company is able to achieve widespread recognition before them their market share could quickly diminish Other A lot of other boring stuff that all companies face Feel free to go and read through Conclusion This is a company showing great promise They are aggressively pouring their money into growth and scaling but presenting losses along the way The company needs to find some profitability eventually or they risk going broke Regardless they hold a competitive advantage as they are a transparent company boasting impressive products Green investments are going to become increasingly important over the next years so may as well add some to your portfolio TL DR GDNP shows a lot of potential and makes a great ethical investment Buy now Or don t But please do your own research first you autists Lets get rich

Szulczewski is an ex google engineer who grew up in Soviet Block poland in the 1980s Seemingly motivated only by gains Szulczewski was known to pump out code by day and pump out iron at night in his 20s creating the keyword algorithms that allowed advertisers to expand the number of search items they could show their ads against This feature added 100 million to Google s revenue After quitting in 2009 Szulczewski spent his time writing software that predicts user interests software used to make Wish the best software for personalized products Szulczewski has had offers from multiple large firms offering mergers all of which he rejected demonstrating confidence in himself and his company Risk Risks fraudulent products and purchase of illegal goods through Wish However Wish is determined to root out shoddy sellers giving discounts and rewards to users who report them and uses algorithms to climate bad products Competition and why Wish will beat it The competition from amazon ebay aliexrpess etsy and others cannot be ignored However these companies fail to take into account one of the most economically important factors price Most individuals are more responsive to price than anything else and in a competitive market the lowest price wins 93 of the world isn t high income and saving money is important to these people Wish markets to around 1B middle income individuals with less than 75k per household This market is largely ignored by e commerce firms The most important factor to take into consideration is the trickle down access to technology and transitively e commerce meaning that in the future if lower income individuals and households have access to e commerce their purchases will be more price reactive As global access to technology continues lower prices are the future Three growth catalysts E commerce is poised for trillions of dollars of growth in the next few years Wish poses the most competitive pricing in e commerce Amazon has a markup so extreme that people can go into a Walmart and resell an item on Amazon for profit Wish can sell a smartphone for under 50 In a world where price matters Wish will win especially in international markets with

income markets 12 month price targets are around 21 per share but there is no reason why Wish couldn t beat that mark especially considering its consistent revenue growth and the growth of the e commerce industry Amazon is too expensive eBay is old and boring Etsy isn t utilitarian but Wish is fun and has predictive software that provides consumers with whatever they wish and is the easiest

report transaction on 10 sec tape Here s the references from FINRA https www finra org filing reporting market transparency reporting trade reporting faq https www finra org filing reporting market transparency reporting trade reporting faq Q102 2 Does the 10 second reporting requirement apply to the submission of non tape reports to FINRA A102 2 No Members are not required to submit non tape reports to FINRA within 10 seconds of trade execution however regulatory reports generally are required to be submitted within specified time frames For example members must submit the non tape report for the offsetting riskless leg of a riskless principal transaction as soon as practicable after the offsetting leg is executed but no later than the time the FINRA Facility closes for the trading day See NTM 00 79 https www finra org industry notices 00 79 November 2000 However to qualify for the exemption from the requirements of Rule 5320 Prohibition Against Trading Ahead of Customer Orders for riskless principal transactions a member must submit contemporaneously with the execution of the facilitated order a non tape report reflecting the offsetting riskless leg of the transaction See Rule 5320 03 For purposes of this exception contemporaneously has been interpreted to require execution as soon as possible but absent reasonable and documented justification within one minute See NTMs 95 67 http www finra org ntm 95 67 August 1995 and 98 78 https www finra org industry notices 98 78 September 1998 Non tape reports that are submitted for regulatory transaction fee purposes under Section 3 of Schedule A to the By Laws must be submitted by the end of the reporting session for the FINRA Facility See Rules 7130 c 7230A g 7230B f and 7330 g Clearing reports must be submitted to the FINRA Facilities in conformance with the trade reporting rules as well as all applicable rules of other self regulatory organizations including the rules of the National Securities Clearing Corporation NSCC requiring that locked in trade data be submitted in real time and prohibiting pre netting and other practices that prevent real time trade submission See DTCC NSCC Important Notice A 7663 P amp S 7333 dated January 7 2014 Q100 7 What is a non tape report also referred to as a non media report A100 7 A non tape report can be either a regulatory report or a clearing report neither of which is publicly disseminated A regulatory report sometimes referred to in the trade reporting rules as a non tape non clearing report is submitted to FINRA solely to fulfill a regulatory requirement e g to report certain transactions subject to a regulatory transaction fee or where applicable to report the offsetting riskless leg of a riskless principal transaction A clearing report sometimes referred to in the trade reporting rules as a clearing only report is used by members to clear and settle transactions information reported to FINRA in a clearing report is transmitted by FINRA to the National Securities Clearing Corporation NSCC Clearing reports also can be used to satisfy a member s obligation to provide regulatory information to FINRA if applicable https www finra org rules guidance notices 00 79 Alternative Approach To Riskless Principal Trade Reporting After reviewing concerns raised by the firms and consultation with the SEC and NASD Regulation Nasdaq has adopted a different method for reporting riskless principal trades that can be used as an alternative to the original approach set forth in the Notices 3 This new approach can be utilized by both market makers which for the first time must adhere to Riskless Principal Trade Reporting Rules and by non market makers which have been subject to the Rules for some time Under the alternative approach member firms may report a riskless principal transaction by submitting either one or two reports to ACT The first report would be required only if the member is the party with a reporting obligation under the relevant Nasdaq trade reporting rule The second report representing the offsetting riskless portion of the transaction with the customer must be submitted by all members electing to use the alternative method for riskless principal trade reporting regardless of whether the firm has a reporting obligation when the firm effects the offsetting trade with its customer This report will be either a non tape non clearing report if there is no need to submit clearing information to ACT or a clearingonly report 4 In either case the report must be marked with a capacity indicator of riskless principal Because this is not a last sale report it does not have to be submitted within 90 seconds after the transaction is executed but should be submitted as soon as practicable after the trade is executed but no later than by the time ACT closes for the trading day currently 6 30 p m Eastern Time The effect of the new rule can be illustrated by the following examples Example 1 A market maker MM1 holds a customer limit order to sell 1 000 shares of ABCD at 10 that is displayed in its quote MM1 sells 1 000 shares to a second market maker MM2 at 10 MM2 s bid represents proprietary interest not a customer order When there is a trade between two market makers the Nasdaq trade reporting rules require the member representing the sell side to report the transaction 5 MM1 the seller in this transaction reports the sale of 1 000 shares by submitting a last sale report to ACT marked principal MM1 then fills its customer order for 1 000 shares Under the new alternativeapproach MM1 would submit either one of the two following reports marked riskless principal to ACT for the offsetting riskless portion of the transaction a clearing only report if necessary to clear the transaction with the customer or a non tape non clearing report if a clearing entry is not necessary because for example the trade is internalized This submission is not entered for reporting purposes and thus there will be no public trade report for this leg of the transaction Because MM2 did not enter into a riskless principal transaction MM2 does not have an obligation to submit the second report Example 2 Both MM1 and MM2 hold customer limit orders MM1 holds a marketable customer limit order to sell 1 000 shares of ABCD and MM2 holds a customer limit order to buy 1

42e4b7190e016965cc8efccf0ac0099b88c83393 amp x200B If company is so good why did it fall 23 in the last 6 months As all of you may know the SPAC s were hot and trending back in early 2021 and most of the companies were overpriced If you look at the price history of all the SPAC s post merger then you ll notice that most of them fell quite significantly Paysafe was one of the top companies that went public through SPAC amp x200B Why paysafe is a good stock to invests in amp x200B Paysafe has been delivering what many SPAC s have failed to deliver i e Revenues amp Profits Despite the numbers being good after Q1 the stock still fell by 21 Paysafe got hit by Post merger SPAC effect The drop in price due to Post Merger SPAC effect is a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock and hold it for long term Paysafe has an amazing opportunity to establish it s monopoly in the iGaming space Their biggest competitors PayPal amp Square are staying out of iGaming space and focusing more on Fintech space Paysafe currently has agreements with few big companies such as DraftKings Roblox Twitch Caesar s entertainment and many more When it comes to iGaming space the risks are relatively small because the disputes are very unlikely People depositing money into their roblox accounts or draft kings are not entitled to refunds and same applies to twitch donations As per nasdaq com the company is expected to exceed 103 billion in transactions this year and the company forecasts that iGaming in the United States will grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 52 through 2025 The company s products are currently not as widely accepted as PayPal or Square however they plan on expanding in the coming years As per nasdaq com The U S online gambling industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15 4 between last year and fiscal year 2025 and Paysafe has relationship with almost all top online gambling operators in the U S The company has expanded partnership with Coinbase and the company s payment solution is in about 27 sites and exchanges As investing and trading activity grows in the near future Paysafe is well positioned to benefit If you look at the Q1 the fundamentals were quite strong company reported revenue of 377 4 million which was higher by 5 on a year on year basis The company s adjusted EBITDA was 113 2 million which implies an EBITDA margin of 30 The company absolutely destroyed the expectations when it comes to e cash solutions segment adjusted EBITDA for that segment was 110 higher and reported 48 1 million The company reported revenue growth of 63 112 9 million As per nasdaq com the e cash segment has an EBITDA margin of 42 6 as compared to the company level EBITDA margin of 30 With strong growth in the e cash segment it s likely that EBITDA margin will expand in the coming quarters As a matter of fact Paysafe has guided for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32 for FY2021 Between FY2020 and FY2023 the company is targeting annual growth revenue of about 10 Ecash segment is the margin driver for this company and the guidance seems realistic because of potential growth in the U S online gambling sector If there is a synergy Paysafe could also merge with other online payment companies in order to grow The company is currently sitting at 274 million in cash and 225 million in un drawn credit facility According to nasdaq com https www nasdaq com articles paysafe stock has significant upside from current levels 2021 05 25 Paysafe reported operating cash flow of 48 7 million in Q1 This would imply an annualized OCF of 195 million With likely EBITDA margin expansion in the coming years the company is positioned for healthy cash flow growth amp x200B What is the future of iGaming and online transactions There is no brainer in this question The iGaming space and etransactions will keep exceeding in the near future Many countries currently use cash for transactions but as technology advances third world countries are expected to go cashless and follow digital payments As per the article from Juniper Research Ltd https www spglobal com marketintelligence en news insights latest news headlines digital wallet spend to exceed 10 trillion in 2025 study says 62265421 the digital world is projected to exceed 10 Trillion in 2025 This is an 83 increase from 2020 The research also found that contactless and e commerce payments will increase to 50 of total wallet spend in 2025 from less than 36 in 2020 More than 34 of mobile handsets are also seen to use contactless payments in 2025 up from 11 in 2020 Even a 2 year old baby would know that Paysafe is expected to benefit from this growth amp x200B Stock price during after the merger As you can see from the graph below the Paysafe stock rocketed right after the merger announcement and shot up to as high as 20 piece What happened next should not shock the world because most of the SPAC s fell off post merger BUT what makes this SPAC unique is the fact that they ve been able to pull off revenues and profits and were able to provide better guidance for the future amp x200B https preview redd it nwi7nepq39771 png width 1246 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

low compared to 2020 Net loss for the first quarter was 49 1 million compared to 51 1 million in the prior year The company mentioned in the presentation that Net loss included interest expense of 58 5 million an increase of 53 compared to the prior year reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31 2021 Net loss also included share based compensation of 72 4 million compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was 113 2 million compared to 112 8 million in the prior year Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased approximately 140 basis points to 30 0 but they expect this basis point to go up in the near future amp x200B Now let s have a look at the segment growth Like I

decrease of 5 compared to 186 2 million in the prior year Digital Wallet Revenue for the first quarter was 94 9 million a decrease of 13 compared to 108 5 million in the prior year eCash Solutions

TLDR The company is expected to achieve their 2021 guidance No competition for Paysafe in iGaming space The stock fell down in the past few months due to Post Merger SPAC fatigue One of the few SPAC s who actually brings in Revenue amp Profits Currently close to 52 week low and a nice opportunity to grab at this current price amp x200B Positions 180 share at 11 14 each 45x calls with strike price

good why did it fall 23 in the last 6 months As all of you may know the special purpose companies were hot and trending back in early 2021 and most of the companies were overpriced If you look at the price history of all the special purpose post merger price then you ll notice that most of them fell quite significantly amp x200B Why paysafe is a good stock to invests in amp x200B Paysafe has been delivering what other mergers have failed to deliver i e Revenues amp Profits Despite the numbers being good after Q1 the stock still fell by 21 Paysafe got hit by Post merger effect The drop in price due to Post Merger effect is a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock and hold it for long term Paysafe has an amazing opportunity to establish it s monopoly in the iGaming space Their biggest competitors PayPal amp Square are staying out of iGaming space and focusing more on Fintech space Paysafe currently has agreements with few big companies such as DraftKings Roblox Twitch Caesar s entertainment and many more When it comes to iGaming space the risks are relatively small because the disputes are very unlikely People depositing money into their roblox accounts or draft kings are not entitled to refunds and same applies to twitch donations As per nasdaq com the company is expected to exceed 103 billion in transactions this year and the company forecasts that iGaming in the United States will grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 52 through 2025 The company s products are currently not as widely accepted as PayPal or Square however they plan on expanding in the coming years As per nasdaq com The U S online gambling industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15 4 between last year and fiscal year 2025 and Paysafe has relationship with almost all top online gambling operators in the U S The company has expanded partnership with Coinbase and the company s payment solution is in about 27 sites and exchanges As investing and trading activity grows in the near future Paysafe is well positioned to benefit If you look at the Q1 the fundamentals were quite strong company reported revenue of 377 4 million which was higher by 5 on a year on year basis The company s adjusted EBITDA was 113 2 million which implies an EBITDA margin of 30 The company absolutely destroyed the expectations when it comes to e cash solutions segment adjusted EBITDA for that segment was 110 higher and reported 48 1 million The company reported revenue growth of 63 112 9 million As per nasdaq com the e cash segment has an EBITDA margin of 42 6 as compared to the company level EBITDA margin of 30 With strong growth in the e cash segment it s likely that EBITDA margin will expand in the coming quarters As a matter of fact Paysafe has guided for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32 for FY2021 Between FY2020 and FY2023 the company is targeting annual growth revenue of about 10 Ecash segment is the margin driver for this company and the guidance seems realistic because of potential growth in the U S online gambling sector If there is a synergy Paysafe could also merge with other online payment companies in order to grow The company is currently sitting at 274 million in cash and 225 million in un drawn credit facility According to nasdaq com https www nasdaq com articles paysafe stock has significant upside from current levels 2021 05 25 Paysafe reported operating cash flow of 48 7 million in Q1 This would imply an annualized OCF of 195 million With likely EBITDA margin expansion in the coming years the company is positioned for healthy cash flow growth amp x200B What is the future of iGaming and online transactions There is no brainer in this question The iGaming space and etransactions will keep exceeding in the near future Many countries currently use cash for transactions but as technology advances third world countries are expected to go cashless and follow digital payments As per the article from Juniper Research Ltd https www spglobal com marketintelligence en news insights latest news headlines digital wallet spend to exceed 10 trillion in 2025 study says 62265421 the digital world is projected to exceed 10 Trillion in 2025 This is an 83 increase from 2020 The research also found that contactless and e commerce payments will increase to 50 of total wallet spend in 2025 from less than 36 in 2020 More than 34 of mobile handsets are also seen to use contactless payments in 2025 up from 11 in 2020 Even a 2 year old baby would know that Paysafe is expected to benefit from this growth amp x200B Stock price during after the merger As you can see from the graph below the Paysafe stock rocketed right after the merger announcement and shot up to as high as 20 piece What happened next should not shock the world because most of the stocks fell off post merger BUT what makes this stock unique is the fact that they ve been able to pull off revenues and profits and were able to provide better guidance for

million compared to 51 1 million in the prior year The company mentioned in the presentation that Net loss included interest expense of 58 5 million an increase of 53 compared to the prior year reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31 2021 Net loss also included share based compensation of 72 4 million compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was 113 2 million compared to 112 8 million in the prior year Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased approximately 140 basis points to 30 0 but they expect this basis point to go up in the near future amp x200B Now let s have a look at the segment growth Like I mentioned earlier the company absolutely destroyed their

aggressive in their effort to thrust themselves in and penetrate every market available to them They have active gaming presence in more states than any of the other apps companies being available to

SPAC effect The drop in price due to Post Merger SPAC effect is a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock and hold it for long term Paysafe has an amazing opportunity to establish it s monopoly in the iGaming space Their biggest competitors PayPal amp Square are staying out of iGaming space and focusing more on Fintech space Paysafe currently has agreements with few big companies such as DraftKings Roblox Twitch Caesar s entertainment and many more When it comes to iGaming space the risks are relatively small because the disputes are very unlikely People depositing money into their roblox accounts or draft kings are not entitled to refunds and same applies to twitch donations As per nasdaq com the company is expected to exceed 103 billion in transactions this year and the company forecasts that iGaming in the United States will grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 52 through 2025 The company s products are currently not as widely accepted as PayPal or Square however they plan on expanding in the coming years As per nasdaq com The U S online gambling industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15 4 between last year and fiscal year 2025 and Paysafe has relationship with almost all top online gambling operators in the U S The company has expanded partnership with Coinbase and the company s payment solution is in about 27 sites and exchanges As investing and trading activity grows in the near future Paysafe is well positioned to benefit If you look at the Q1 the fundamentals were quite strong company reported revenue of 377 4 million which was higher by 5 on a year on year basis The company s adjusted EBITDA was 113 2 million which implies an EBITDA margin of 30 The company absolutely destroyed the expectations when it comes to e cash solutions segment adjusted EBITDA for that segment was 110 higher and reported 48 1 million The company reported revenue growth of 63 112 9 million As per nasdaq com the e cash segment has an EBITDA margin of 42 6 as compared to the company level EBITDA margin of 30 With strong growth in the e cash segment it s likely that EBITDA margin will expand in the coming quarters As a matter of fact Paysafe has guided for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32 for FY2021 Between FY2020 and FY2023 the company is targeting annual growth revenue of about 10 Ecash segment is the margin driver for this company and the guidance seems realistic because of potential growth in the U S online gambling sector If there is a synergy Paysafe could also merge with other online payment companies in order to

company is so good why did it fall 23 in the last 6 months As all of you may know the SPAC s were hot and trending back in early 2021 and most of the companies were overpriced If you look at the price history of all the SPAC s post merger then you ll notice that most of them fell quite significantly Paysafe was one of the top companies that went public through SPAC amp x200B Why paysafe is a good stock to invests in amp x200B Paysafe has been delivering what many SPAC s have failed to deliver i e Revenues amp Profits Despite the numbers being good after Q1 the stock still fell by 21 Paysafe got hit by Post merger SPAC effect The drop in price due to Post Merger SPAC effect is a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock and hold it for long term Paysafe has an amazing opportunity to establish it s monopoly in the iGaming space Their biggest competitors PayPal amp Square are staying out of iGaming space and focusing more on Fintech space Paysafe currently has agreements with few big companies such as DraftKings Roblox Twitch Caesar s entertainment and many more When it comes to iGaming space the risks are relatively small because the disputes are very unlikely People depositing money into their roblox accounts or draft kings are not entitled to refunds and same applies to twitch donations As per nasdaq com the company is expected to exceed 103 billion in transactions this year and the company forecasts that iGaming in the United States will grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 52 through 2025 The company s products are currently not as widely accepted as PayPal or Square however they plan on expanding in the coming years As per nasdaq com The U S online gambling industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15 4 between last year and fiscal year 2025 and Paysafe has relationship with almost all top online gambling operators in the U S The company has expanded partnership with Coinbase and the company s payment solution is in about 27 sites and exchanges As investing and trading activity grows in the near future Paysafe is well positioned to benefit If you look at the Q1 the fundamentals were quite strong company reported revenue of 377 4 million which was higher by 5 on a year on year basis The company s adjusted EBITDA was 113 2 million which implies an EBITDA margin of 30 The company absolutely destroyed the expectations when it comes to e cash solutions segment adjusted EBITDA for that segment was 110 higher and reported 48 1 million The company reported revenue growth of 63 112 9 million As per nasdaq com the e cash segment has an EBITDA margin of 42 6 as compared to the company level EBITDA margin of 30 With strong growth in the e cash segment it s likely that EBITDA margin will expand in the coming quarters As a matter of fact Paysafe has guided for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32 for FY2021 Between FY2020 and FY2023 the company is targeting annual growth revenue of about 10 Ecash segment is the margin driver for this company and the guidance seems realistic because of potential growth in the U S online gambling sector If there is a synergy Paysafe could also merge with other online payment companies in order to grow The company is currently sitting at 274 million in cash and 225 million in un drawn credit facility According to nasdaq com Paysafe reported operating cash flow of 48 7 million in Q1 This would imply an annualized OCF of 195 million With likely EBITDA margin expansion in the coming years the company is positioned for healthy cash flow growth amp x200B What is the

why did it fall 23 in the last 6 months As all of you may know the SPAC s were hot and trending back in early 2021 and most of the companies were overpriced If you look at the price history of all the SPAC s post merger then you ll notice that most of them fell quite significantly Paysafe was one of the top companies that went public through SPAC amp x200B Why paysafe is a good stock to invests in amp x200B Paysafe has been delivering what many SPAC s have failed to deliver i e Revenues amp Profits Despite the numbers being good after Q1 the stock still fell by 21 Paysafe got hit by Post merger SPAC effect The drop in price due to Post Merger SPAC effect is a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock and hold it for long term Paysafe has an amazing opportunity to establish it s monopoly in the iGaming space Their biggest competitors PayPal amp Square are staying out of iGaming space and focusing more on Fintech space Paysafe currently has agreements with few big companies such as DraftKings Roblox Twitch Caesar s entertainment and many more When it comes to iGaming space the risks are relatively small because the disputes are very unlikely People depositing money into their roblox accounts or draft kings are not entitled to refunds and same applies to twitch donations As per nasdaq com the company is expected to exceed 103 billion in transactions this year and the company forecasts that iGaming in the United States will grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 52 through 2025 The company s products are currently not as widely accepted as PayPal or Square however they plan on expanding in the coming years As per nasdaq com The U S online gambling industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15 4 between last year and fiscal year 2025 and Paysafe has relationship with almost all top online gambling operators in the U S The company has expanded partnership with Coinbase and the company s payment solution is in about 27 sites and exchanges As investing and trading activity grows in the near future Paysafe is well positioned to benefit If you look at the Q1 the fundamentals were quite strong company reported revenue of 377 4 million which was higher by 5 on a year on year basis The company s adjusted EBITDA was 113 2 million which implies an EBITDA margin of 30 The company absolutely destroyed the expectations when it comes to e cash solutions segment adjusted EBITDA for that segment was 110 higher and reported 48 1 million The company reported revenue growth of 63 112 9 million As per nasdaq com the e cash segment has an EBITDA margin of 42 6 as compared to the company level EBITDA margin of 30 With strong growth in the e cash segment it s likely that EBITDA margin will expand in the coming quarters As a matter of fact Paysafe has guided for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32 for FY2021 Between FY2020 and FY2023 the company is targeting annual growth revenue of about 10 Ecash segment is the margin driver for this company and the guidance seems realistic because of potential growth in the U S online gambling sector If there is a synergy Paysafe could also merge with other online payment companies in order to grow The company is currently sitting at 274 million in cash and 225 million in un drawn credit facility According to nasdaq com Paysafe reported operating cash flow of 48 7 million in Q1 This would imply an annualized OCF of 195 million With likely EBITDA margin expansion in the coming years the company is positioned for healthy cash flow growth amp x200B What is the future of iGaming and online transactions There is no brainer in this question The iGaming space and etransactions will keep exceeding in the near future Many countries currently use cash for transactions but as technology advances third world countries are expected to go cashless and follow digital payments As per the article from Juniper Research Ltd the digital world is projected to exceed 10 Trillion in 2025 This is an 83 increase from 2020 The research also found that contactless and e commerce payments will increase to 50 of total wallet spend in 2025 from less than 36 in 2020 More than 34 of mobile handsets are also seen to use contactless payments in 2025 up from 11 in 2020 Even a 2 year old baby would know that Paysafe is expected to benefit from this growth amp x200B Stock price during after the merger As you can see from the graph below the Paysafe stock rocketed right after the merger announcement and shot up to as high as 20 piece What happened next should not shock the world because most of the SPAC s fell off post merger BUT what makes this SPAC unique is the fact that they ve been able to pull off revenues and profits and were able to provide better guidance for the future amp x200B

51 1 million in the prior year The company mentioned in the presentation that Net loss included interest expense of 58 5 million an increase of 53 compared to the prior year reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31 2021 Net loss also included share based compensation of 72 4 million compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was 113 2 million compared to 112 8 million in the prior year Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased approximately 140 basis points to 30

by year end Goldex CEO Kitco News The risk with Basel III is a major shift towards allocated gold which could trigger a liquidity squeeze in the physical metal and lead to higher prices by the end of the year according to Goldex CEO Sylvia Carrasco The impact of the Basel III agreement which will come into force on June 28 2021 for European banks and on January 1 2022 for British banks is being debated by many gold industry experts with opinions ranging from everything will change to no impact at all Carrasco is in the camp that sees many people underestimate the impact of Basel III on the gold market Basel III will affect the gold price more than many people believe The spot price will definitely go up Carrasco told Kitco News Basel III is an internationally agreed upon set of measures developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in response to the financial crisis of 2007 09 Many of the measures deal with bank capital adequacy stress testing and market liquidity One of the biggest changes for gold is that the precious metal is being reclassified from a Tier 3 asset which is the riskiest asset class to a Tier 1 asset which is currently designated for cash and currencies The change could make it more expensive to buy and sell unallocated gold This is because Basel III includes the new Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR requirement which specifies that an 85 Required Stable Funding RSF needs to be held by banks against the financing and clearing of precious metals transactions This is a big change from the pre Basel III level of 0 and it makes holding unallocated gold more expensive by equating it to the same level of risk as holding equities Basel III requires banks or dealers to collateralize 85 of the value of their unallocated gold with a Tier 1 asset which is cash Carrasco said For example if a bank has 1 billion in gold positions with 300 million in allocated gold and the other 700 million in unallocated gold Before Basel III the bank didn t have to put any collaterals for those positions But with Basel III the 300 million positions in allocated gold are fine But the 700 million positions in unallocated gold are now considered risky as equities and are put in the same risk category Under Basel III the bank would have to show that 85 of this 700 million is actually sitting on their balance sheet and the bank is not touching it Carrasco explained That has a tremendous cost of finance The bullion banks need to find 85 of the nominal value of their unallocated gold position and fund it The risk here is that trading unallocated gold would become a money losing business Banks cannot continue charging practically no fees on unallocated gold Could they have to increase their price by 100 times Will clients be interested in trading at those prices Carrasco asked The risk is going to be a lot of banks shutting down because suddenly it is a money losing business That is Basel III in a nutshell Allocated vs unallocated gold Understanding the difference between allocated and unallocated gold is critical here Allocated gold is when a customer buys physical gold that has already been minted and it is physically sitting in a vault And that gold belongs directly to the customer It is the only gold that truly belongs to the buyer with proof of ownership Carrasco said Unallocated gold is like a form of credit she described Unallocated gold doesn t have to be in a vault and it is like the client trading against the balance sheets of a bullion dealer In this case the bullion dealer does not have to have the gold They are saying to the buyer I promise you that I owe you gold I refer to it as balance sheet gold Carrasco said If anything happens to the bank that gold doesn t belong to the buyer and the buyer loses the position Also unallocated gold can be sold 20 times to 20 people whereas allocated gold can only be sold once That is the systemic risk that Basel III is worried about she noted Liquidity squeeze to trigger 2 100 gold price by year end What these changes mean for the gold space is that the demand for physical gold will likely increase putting the squeeze on liquidity which in response is likely to trigger a rise in prices Carrasco pointed out Basel III sees a systemic risk If for whatever reason these banks go into financial trouble all these clients will lose their money she said If unallocated gold becomes more expensive that means that the only thing left to buy and sell is allocated And if suddenly the eyes turn to the allocated gold there should be an increase in demand in physical allocated gold If there is an increase in demand there will be a liquidity squeeze And potentially there will be an increase in allocated gold prices because there is less liquidity and there is more demand Just in London alone the amount of unallocated gold traded on a daily basis is around 200 billion a day Carrasco added It is so enormous that an issue could create a massive systemic risk to the financial industry she said LBMA is worried about this because the majority of trading that goes through LBMA is unallocated gold They are asking their UK regulator to reconsider This is why Carrasco expects to see the biggest impact from Basel III towards the end of the year right before the UK is impacted Basel III has been postponed until January 1 2022 in Britain Carrasco s minimum gold target for the end of this year is 2 100 an ounce The biggest impact might be visible at the end of the year before January 1 if Basel III kicks in in the UK In the last quarter of the year we ll see an impact At the very minimum I can see gold go over 2 100 by the end of the year she pointed out The highest amount of unallocated gold is traded in London On June 28 only a third of European banks will have to abide by the new rules The rest will only be affected from January 1 2022 if this goes through in the UK Allocated gold is finite and the unallocated gold is infinite Carrasco added If people turn to allocated gold liquidity will be squeezed and prices should go up There are X amount of bars around until more is produced she specified Bullion banks hedge themselves with COMEX futures They have tremendous short positions in COMEX and they are getting rid of them If from the end of June they need to start selling their short positions that automatically creates an increase in the price of gold Goldex response In light of all of these changes Goldex has launched a new trading infrastructure that can service other companies and institutions Carrasco described Goldex as the first multi dealer marketplace for allocated physical gold said Carrasco With us liquidity becomes less of an issue she stated Goldex has launched the world s first plug and play marketplace solution enabling companies to offer allocated physical gold FinTechs and other financial companies can piggy back on Goldex s technology Such companies can buy sell and store gold via the first multi dealer marketplace that not only solves liquidity issues but also acts as a price discovery tool Carrasco highlighted that fin tech companies no longer specialize in just a single product There s a massive shift to offer more products including physical gold as well she said We are a hub with multiple liquidity providers and selecting the best price amongst them Within 6 8 weeks a company can integrate into our platform and they can be up and running selling gold to their own clients within 6 8 weeks We sit behind the scenes

Thesis, Mitigating Risks and Maximizing Returns using Collateral Plays In Depth Trade Thesis amp nbsp What s poppin fellas hope you re all doing well Today I m gonna teach you all about Collateral Trades Collateral trades provide us with an interesting way to dynamically adjust our risk profiles while placing trades and generate an edge while doing so This strategy is most effective around earnings when IV is high or if you want to safely play meme stocks That being said it can still find it s application during regular trading conditions as well Let s get into it amp nbsp What is a Collateral Trade In its simplest terms a collateral trade is a trade where you play a different ticker in the same sector as the one you initially planned on playing ideally around a big event such as earnings Since stocks within a sector generally tend to put up similar numbers and move together around earnings we can abuse this to give us a more favourable risk to reward profile on our trades amp nbsp For example let s say that I m bullish on JPM and they report earnings this week Instead of playing options on JPM I d look to make a play on WFC BAC or any other bank who reports earnings after JPM instead This allows us to reap most if not all of the rewards if our trade goes in the direction we were anticipating while severely mitigating our downside risk in the event that we were wrong amp nbsp How does it work What are the benefits Let s walk through both situations I ll continue to use the financial sector in my first couple of examples amp nbsp If I were to play standard options on JPM I d be paying a pretty hefty premium because IV is high and I would instantly get IV crushed right out the gate regardless of how JPM performs Furthermore if JPM moves in the opposite direction that I was anticipating the value of my options would quickly approach 0 and I wouldn t be able to recoup much if any of my losses If JPM moves in the right direction it would need to move enough to offset the IV crush of earnings while also bringing in enough money to make the coinflip we call trading earnings worthwhile Realistically you ve got a 50 50 shot at winning but very rarely do you actually double your money off of a play like this You re essentially playing a coin flip game where if it s heads you lose 200 but if it s tails you win 50 It s not a good look overall but you still have the opportunity to make money nonetheless amp nbsp What if we were to employ some form of collateral play instead Instead of playing JPM directly let s play a ticker within the same sector as it who reports earnings afterwards I ll use WFC as an example Generally speaking stocks within a sector tend to move in tandem with one another price wise while also putting up similar numbers to each other It s very rare to see some stocks rally while others tank generally they all rally or all tank depending on various market conditions This also means that if certain stocks within a sector report earnings before the others the market will price the other stocks differently following reported earnings from the first batch If JPM reports stellar earnings and rallies 4 as a result WFC and the other non reporting banks will almost always follow suit and rally as the market prices in a good earnings beforehand from them as well If we were holding WFC calls we would reap the rewards of a 4 rally without the IV crush which means more gains in our pocket Hypothetically our JPM calls may have only netted us 40 gain after the IV crush but our WFC calls would ve netted us an upwards of 100 if not more amp nbsp The same is true but on the flipside Let s say JPM tanks on earnings Our JPM calls would swiftly approach 0 The other banks would also follow suit but to a lesser degree If we had WFC calls instead the IV on our contracts would actually go up by a decent amount This would help offset our losses and we wouldn t have gotten IV crushed in the process This in turn means that if we do want to bail out of the trade we can recoup most if not all of our losses which is extremely beneficial from a capital preservation standpoint amp nbsp By utilizing a collateral play like this we can increase the return of our winners while simultaneously minimizing the losses of our losers amp nbsp How can I incorporate them into my own Trades I found that there s three ways you can consistently incorporate collateral trades into your own plays amp nbsp The first method is the one I went over above Find a set of tickers within the same sector who report earnings during the same week but on different days Instead of playing the ticker you have strong conviction on play any of the adjacent tickers to avoid IV crush and reap any rewards you would ve gotten otherwise amp nbsp The second method is a little different If you have a strong conviction on a certain sector as a whole you can actually look to make a play an an ETF which holds all of the reporting tickers instead ETFs are less susceptible to IV crush generally have cheaper options and always have a much lower IV than the individual tickers that they hold I ve been using the financial sector for my examples so I ll continue to roll with that A few weeks ago to kick off earnings season 7 of the largest American banks were set to report earnings the same week as each other Coincidentally XLF consists of 7 of the largest American banks Every single bank usually sits at an IV of around 20 but around earnings season this gets jacked up to around 65 ish resulting in options becoming 300 more expensive At the same time XLF went from around 12 to 20 meaning that options only got 66 more expensive Since we know that tickers within the same sector move in tandem with each other if we wanted to place a bet on an individual bank we d actually be better off playing XLF since the options are cheaper the IV is lower and we can almost be certain that it will move as much as all the other banks will If I was bullish on JPM I could play XLF instead to reap the rewards amp nbsp The third and final way to utilize collateral plays involves meme stocks This method is a little less consistent so I use a tool like Hungry Bot https www hungrybotalerts com to aid me in this Oftentimes when one of the major meme tickers starts to run GME AMC etc other meme tickers follow suit The issue with this is that the instant one of the major memes starts to run MMs jack the fuck out of the option prices so us retail traders cant make any money In order to circumvent this we can look to make a collateral play on some of the minor meme stocks instead My personal favourite for this is BB Last time when AMC started running the IV on most contracts got jacked up so fast that it wasn t worth playing however the IV on BB stayed low for a while Instead of playing AMC I ended up playing BB BB ended up following AMCs price action for a while on a percentage point basis though you had a much greater window of opportunity to enter a position and reap the rewards Not to mention since BB had a lower starting IV to begin with you actually would have ended up with better returns playing BB than you would have if you were playing AMC Although BB was very profitable you could ve made this play with any other minor meme ticker so long as the IV was low upon entry and they moved along with the other meme stocks CLOV is another great example which actually ended up being a 40 bagger https cdn discordapp com attachments 794766298373423136 857753911855546399 clov png since we caught it well before it started running Again this method is a lot trickier to time and play manually so I use my bot to alert me whenever a play like this is possible It often catches the meme tickers before they run and usually spits out the most profitable collateral play while doing so amp nbsp Example Plays Most of the explanations found in this post were directly taken from real trades that I ve conducted but I ll post them here again regardless amp nbsp Week one of earnings I was extremely bullish on the financial sector as a whole I ended up playing XLF on April 12th and ended up catching nearly a 2 move in just two days This may not seem like much but on an ETF with an IV of 11 I ended up getting a really solid return on my FDs amp nbsp Week two of earnings I was bearish on solar as a whole due to the semiconductor shortage Since Enphase was reporting alongside First Solar I decided to play puts on Canadian Solar instead since they are in the same sector but don t report earnings until weeks after Luckily for me my bet paid off with Enphase tanking 15 and First solar closely behind with a 13 drop My play Canadian Solar withered away 11 during that time meaning I also secured a huge bag while walking away unscathed due to there being cheap options and no IV crush If this play would have gone against me I would have had plenty of time to exit this play with minimal losses amp nbsp Lastly I played BB while AMC was mooning The 10C was priced at 0 3 https cdn discordapp com attachments 794766298373423136 857753919539118120 bb png One week later Blackberry touched 18 and I I walked away with a clean 20 bagger Not much to say here I had a huge window of opportunity and the writing was more or less on the wall after I watched AMC run nearly 20 on the day amp nbsp Summary and Conclusion At the end of the day trading is a difficult game Often you gotta think outside of the box and fight tooth and nail for any edge you can get I hope you all learned something new today and

off my wife is back home cheating my daughter calls another man dad cracks knuckles lets do this Overview AMD is a global semiconductor company offering x86 microprocessors as standalone or integrated CPU s GPU s server systems Etc and intellectual property services Products AMD s primary products consist of CPU s and GPU s which are on par or out performing NVIDIA GPU s and Intel s CPU s While these other two giants have dominated the market for sometime AMD s recent move has evolved from a slow creep to a brisk jog Competition AMD s largest competitors are Intel CPU s and NVIDIA GPU s With the release of AMD s Ryzen processors in 2017 AMD has been steadily over taking Intel s dominance over market share AMD s current market share over all CPU s currently sits at 44 levels it has not seen since 2005 AMD took 20 of the market share in past 2 years with a significant jump in 2019 Since the release of Ryzen AMD is now on par or out performing Intel chips and has gained a significant amount of sentiment over the soy boys at intel AMD is on track to overtake the majority of CPU market share within the next year based on current projections Now NVIDIA is a whole other beast who currently has a significant advantage over the dGPU market Nvidia at the end of Q4 2020 held roughly 82 of the market share which was a increase of 9 from the previous year AMD s high end GPU s do not come close to Nvidia s high end models UNTIL AMD s Radeon 6000 series which are now on par with Nvidia s cards either outperforming or underperforming in various tests AMD catching up to Nvidia is the same move that AMD made against Intel in 2017 4 years later they are on the verge of overtaking market share While Nvidia is a monster of a company I believe that AMD will begin taking more market share from Nvidia and establish a decent foothold over the next few years AMD has already taken the game console market console plebs AMD has already proved they are able to take back significant market share with there current and future products Lisa Su is a genius and I believe she ll lead the company to Valhalla What does AMD have that Nvidia does not Aside from many differences I think the fact that AMD has an ecosystem will play a significant role in catching up Now that AMD can evenly compete with both of their rivals AMD plans on leveraging the fact that they produce CPU s and GPU s There are already incentives to using AMD s CPU with their GPU rather than an AMD CPU with a Nvidia GPU With AMD taking the CPU market retail users will be more likely to stick with the ecosystem and I m a big fan of companies producing an ecosystem laughs in apple A new player enters the battle Intel has been working on their own dGPU and will surely be releasing in the next few years but I believe this will be comparable to Sony vs Microsoft with Nintendo enjoying their best life staring at butterfly s covered in drool in the corner lol The Merger Nvidia set to acquire ARM AMD set to acquire Xilinx What are they and how are they expected to impact the company ARM Create and dominate the mobile processor market covering TV s phones tablets and other similar products as well as some software applications I will not be covering much more of ARM in this DD Xilinx Designs and develops programmable logic products As far as I can tell this is some big brain shit that I m sure some booger nosed mothers basement living neck beard having nerd will easily explain in the comments cuz Wikipedia ain t cutting it If AMD completes the purchase which is likely and expected to happen by the end of 2021 Xilinx shares will become worth 1 723 shares of AMD AMD is currently trading at 86 10 meaning that shares of Xilinx will be worth 148 35 if the deal were to go through right now Xilinx is currently worth 133 71 I m betting heavily that AMD will continue to pump prior to this deal as well ARM will be huge for Nvidia but this is running into some major road blocks and is likely some ways off or will fall through Financials and projections I had pictures but I m reddit dumb Net Revenue 9 8B 2020 6 7B 2019 6 5B 2018 5 2B 2017 Net Incum 2 5B 2020 341M 2019 337M 2018 33 M 2017 I like your growth G AMD decreased their debt to 338 million from 568 million 1 6 billion in cash 9 billion in total assets I find cash on hand more important GPU CPU sales accounted for 6 5 billion while enterprise accounted for 3 3 billion GPU CPU sales saw a 37 increase over 2019 while enterprise saw a 65 increase in 2020 2021 is set to continue this trend of growth AMD has a high price target of 169 70 median 107 00 and an average of 103 92 I just read 100 s of pages of 8k s and 10 ks plus I m super attracted to the ole doc Su Bae so I m betting that it will get a target price upgrade regardless 103 will make me rich There is a lot more we could dive into on financials but idk what the fuck I m doing so nah Risks I like to plan for more than 1 risk occurring at a time so keep that in mind Ive highlighted the risks that I find most impactful probable Also keep in mind of global shortages for damn near every company especially with chips Intel Nvidia s market share dominance mostly Nvidia Seasonal sales can make for shit earnings in Q1 Q2 Reliance on third parties for manufacturing distributors Xilinx deal falls through Jim Cramer also likes this stock That s enough risks what am I a gay bear TLDR AMD will moon Lisa Su is my mommy and is cooking up some tendies AMD GPU s are now in Teslas obligatory rockets insert rocket emojis here lots of words just buy

Thesis, Mitigating Risks and Maximizing Returns using Collateral Plays In Depth Trade Thesis amp nbsp What s poppin fellas hope you re all doing well Today I m gonna teach you all about Collateral Trades Collateral trades provide us with an interesting way to dynamically adjust our risk profiles while placing trades and generate an edge while doing so This strategy is most effective around earnings when IV is high or if you want to safely play meme stocks That being said it can still find it s application during regular trading conditions as well Let s get into it amp nbsp What is a Collateral Trade In its simplest terms a collateral trade is a trade where you play a different ticker in the same sector as the one you initially planned on playing ideally around a big event such as earnings Since stocks within a sector generally tend to put up similar numbers and move together around earnings we can abuse this to give us a more favourable risk to reward profile on our trades amp nbsp For example let s say that I m bullish on JPM and they report earnings this week Instead of playing options on JPM I d look to make a play on WFC BAC or any other bank who reports earnings after JPM instead This allows us to reap most if not all of the rewards if our trade goes in the direction we were anticipating while severely mitigating our downside risk in the event that we were wrong amp nbsp How does it work What are the benefits Let s walk through both situations I ll continue to use the financial sector in my first couple of examples amp nbsp If I were to play standard options on JPM I d be paying a pretty hefty premium because IV is high and I would instantly get IV crushed right out the gate regardless of how JPM performs Furthermore if JPM moves in the opposite direction that I was anticipating the value of my options would quickly approach 0 and I wouldn t be able to recoup much if any of my losses If JPM moves in the right direction it would need to move enough to offset the IV crush of earnings while also bringing in enough money to make the coinflip we call trading earnings worthwhile Realistically you ve got a 50 50 shot at winning but very rarely do you actually double your money off of a play like this You re essentially playing a coin flip game where if it s heads you lose 200 but if it s tails you win 50 It s not a good look overall but you still have the opportunity to make money nonetheless amp nbsp What if we were to employ some form of collateral play instead Instead of playing JPM directly let s play a ticker within the same sector as it who reports earnings afterwards I ll use WFC as an example Generally speaking stocks within a sector tend to move in tandem with one another price wise while also putting up similar numbers to each other It s very rare to see some stocks rally while others tank generally they all rally or all tank depending on various market conditions This also means that if certain stocks within a sector report earnings before the others the market will price the other stocks differently following reported earnings from the first batch If JPM reports stellar earnings and rallies 4 as a result WFC and the other non reporting banks will almost always follow suit and rally as the market prices in a good earnings beforehand from them as well If we were holding WFC calls we would reap the rewards of a 4 rally without the IV crush which means more gains in our pocket Hypothetically our JPM calls may have only netted us 40 gain after the IV crush but our WFC calls would ve netted us an upwards of 100 if not more amp nbsp The same is true but on the flipside Let s say JPM tanks on earnings Our JPM calls would swiftly approach 0 The other banks would also follow suit but to a lesser degree If we had WFC calls instead the IV on our contracts would actually go up by a decent amount This would help offset our losses and we wouldn t have gotten IV crushed in the process This in turn means that if we do want to bail out of the trade we can recoup most if not all of our losses which is extremely beneficial from a capital preservation standpoint amp nbsp By utilizing a collateral play like this we can increase the return of our winners while simultaneously minimizing the losses of our losers amp nbsp How can I incorporate them into my own Trades I found that there s three ways you can consistently incorporate collateral trades into your own plays amp nbsp The first method is the one I went over above Find a set of tickers within the same sector who report earnings during the same week but on different days Instead of playing the ticker you have strong conviction on play any of the adjacent tickers to avoid IV crush and reap any rewards you would ve gotten otherwise amp nbsp The second method is a little different If you have a strong conviction on a certain sector as a whole you can actually look to make a play an an ETF which holds all of the reporting tickers instead ETFs are less susceptible to IV crush generally have cheaper options and always have a much lower IV than the individual tickers that they hold I ve been using the financial sector for my examples so I ll continue to roll with that A few weeks ago to kick off earnings season 7 of the largest American banks were set to report earnings the same week as each other Coincidentally XLF consists of 7 of the largest American banks Every single bank usually sits at an IV of around 20 but around earnings season this gets jacked up to around 65 ish resulting in options becoming 300 more expensive At the same time XLF went from around 12 to 20 meaning that options only got 66 more expensive Since we know that tickers within the same sector move in tandem with each other if we wanted to place a bet on an individual bank we d actually be better off playing XLF since the options are cheaper the IV is lower and we can almost be certain that it will move as much as all the other banks will If I was bullish on JPM I could play XLF instead to reap the rewards amp nbsp The third and final way to utilize collateral plays involves meme stocks This method is a little less consistent so I use a tool like Hungry Bot https www hungrybotalerts com to aid me in this Oftentimes when one of the major meme tickers starts to run GME AMC etc other meme tickers follow suit The issue with this is that the instant one of the major memes starts to run MMs jack the fuck out of the option prices so us retail traders cant make any money In order to circumvent this we can look to make a collateral play on some of the minor meme stocks instead My personal favourite for this is BB Last time when AMC started running the IV on most contracts got jacked up so fast that it wasn t worth playing however the IV on BB stayed low for a while Instead of playing AMC I ended up playing BB BB ended up following AMCs price action for a while on a percentage point basis though you had a much greater window of opportunity to enter a position and reap the rewards Not to mention since BB had a lower starting IV to begin with you actually would have ended up with better returns playing BB than you would have if you were playing AMC Although BB was very profitable you could ve made this play with any other minor meme ticker so long as the IV was low upon entry and they moved along with the other meme stocks CLOV is another great example which actually ended up being a 40 bagger https cdn discordapp com attachments 794766298373423136 857753911855546399 clov png since we caught it well before it started running Again this method is a lot trickier to time and play manually so I use my bot to alert me whenever a play like this is possible It often catches the meme tickers before they run and usually spits out the most profitable collateral play while doing so amp nbsp Example Plays Most of the explanations found in this post were directly taken from real trades that I ve conducted but I ll post them here again regardless amp nbsp Week one of earnings I was extremely bullish on the financial sector as a whole I ended up playing XLF on April 12th and ended up catching nearly a 2 move in just two days This may not seem like much but on an ETF with an IV of 11 I ended up getting a really solid return on my FDs amp nbsp Week two of earnings I was bearish on solar as a whole due to the semiconductor shortage Since Enphase was reporting alongside First Solar I decided to play puts on Canadian Solar instead since they are in the same sector but don t report earnings until weeks after Luckily for me my bet paid off with Enphase tanking 15 and First solar closely behind with a 13 drop My play Canadian Solar withered away 11 during that time meaning I also secured a huge bag while walking away unscathed due to there being cheap options and no IV crush If this play would have gone against me I would have had plenty of time to exit this play with minimal losses amp nbsp Lastly I played BB while AMC was mooning The 10C was priced at 0 3 https cdn discordapp com attachments 794766298373423136 857753919539118120 bb png One week later Blackberry touched 18 and I I walked away with a clean 20 bagger Not much to say here I had a huge window of opportunity and the writing was more or less on the wall after I watched AMC run nearly 20 on the day amp nbsp Summary and Conclusion At the end of the day trading is a difficult game Often you gotta think outside of the box and fight tooth and nail for any edge you can get I hope you all learned something new today and
