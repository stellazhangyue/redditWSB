is my first attempt at DD in this god forsaken sub Unfortunately I left my TA crayons at home so I ll try to indent and tab over my walls of text as much as possible so that you Zoomers can pay attention to at least 1 4 of it amp x200B I do want to clarify that some of the timing of iOS 14 changes could get changed and Facebook could push back against certain parts of the change I did my best to explain the basics of what I think is going on but it is possible that I miscommunicated or misunderstood some parts of the iOS 14 update so digital marketers feel free to let me know in the comments and I ll edit accordingly TL DR Apple s iOS 14 Get Zucked Zuckerberg Said Tim Cook For reasons that will be explained below it is possible that Google and Facebook will begin seeing their duopoly slowly diminish over the next several years probably gt 7 years based on how fast Turtle Mitch is able to get anything done I do believe that Google and Facebook will continue to be the top two players in the game for the foreseeable future SO I AM NOT RECOMMENDING SHORTING THESE AT ALL YOU NOOBS The core problems that these companies will soon face especially Facebook is anti trust law suits from the FTC https www ftc gov news events press releases 2020 12 ftc sues facebook illegal monopolization more distrust of their platform due to the most recent election censorship across both platforms a complete failure of Facebook to properly address the negative side effects of social media on the youth and actually do something about it and most importantly Apple upgrading to iOS 14 explained more later The Anti Trust Law Suit from the FTC https www ftc gov news events press releases 2020 12 ftc sues facebook illegal monopolization talks about Facebook becoming a monopoly and buying all the competition such as Instagram and WhatsApp instead of competing against them iOS 14 https www forbes com sites kateoflahertyuk 2020 08 30 ios 14 facebooks apple nightmare keeps getting worse sh 3029be574cfe update will roll out early 2021 This will hinder the collection of iPhone identifiers for advertisers IDFA https www appsflyer com mobile attribution glossary idfa one of the primary things used to track users online Primary Issues For Facebook From The iOS 14 Update 1 gt Bidding Issues lt As I stated above Facebook is going to lose more and more data points as time goes on making it so that they aren t able to bid appropriately on someone like Johnny Bravo when he is scrolling through his insta feed What does this mean Insta may look at Johnny Bravo as a Joe Schmo and decide that he s not worth bidding up on so Johnny Bravo will never see those ads of Playboy and Whey Protein that he would have bought if he got an ad for it Example for this with the iOS14 update Facebook loses its data points to Johnny Bravo s workout apps so they had no way of knowing he would have been more likely to convert 2 gt Creating Audiences lt Facebook is going to lose thousands of data points on its users effectively making it harder to match these audiences into their appropriate buckets Before if someone had several golf apps on their phone you could assume they were a golf lover more easily Without being able to use that app data sharing it will be much harder to know they like golf unless they follow several golfing pros shows in Facebook With the expectation that Facebook will become less efficient as time goes on and that certain lawsuits could negatively affect the company many advertisers are looking for other viable options to put their ad dollars There have been several social media competitors working to monetize their app and become the third wheel of digital marketing Some of these companies include PINS Pinterest SNAP Snapchat TWTR Twitter Twitch Owned by Amazon aka AMZN LNKD LinkedIn Owned by Microsoft aka MSFT Hulu Ads Owned by Disney aka DIS TikTok Not sure if correct but you may be able to get shares here https www ig com en shares ipos bytedance tiktok ipo ticker tbd but pretty sure it will be ZOOMR The name of the game is trying figuring out which of these new channels will be the next to gain 5 10 more market share of ad spend from clients and which will be nothing more than moneyless pits since they do a terrible job at monetizing their app and creating engaging ads that lead to conversions for clients looking at you SNAP and TikTok MY RECENT BACKGROUND aka why should you even bother listening to this autist Worked in digital marketing and finance for the last 5 years also took on several side jobs doing digital marketing for companies I managed gt 10 million in ad spend across various digital marketing channels Google Bing Facebook Shopping over the last 30 days and over gt 40 million in ad spend over the last year I work with a team of Managers and Directors at my agency to help talk about new opportunities and keep up with digital marketing trends across all channels Using our gt 300 clients data our company is able to look at macro trends at a faster rate so we can quickly identify which new channels to focus our efforts in Pinterest TikTok Snap Twitch etc This was highlighted over the last year or year and a half when we noticed a huge spike in companies using Pinterest as a primary channel for digital marketing Only more and more companies are going to join into the race this is just the beginning Any of these stocks or multiple could improve throughout the following years but my money is on PINS Even with PINS recent run up in stock price I think there is still plenty of time to buy this stock now Our clients are continuing to spend more and more on the Pinterest ad platform and it is returning better performance metrics ROAS ROI than most of the other mentioned channels Pinterest also relies on on targeting people based on boards they visit follow create combined with using a search query method for ads somewhat similar to Google s This means they don t have to rely as much on pixel data like Facebook does to create their audience targeting amp x200B I think the safest way to make money on PINS is to buy stocks for the long term but I know that doesn t get some of your little schlongs hard enough Their next earnings are on 2 4 21 after hours and I fully expect them to smash expectations just like McConnell s dad smashed that turtle to give birth to Mitch Look at PINS options that make sense to you for a little after earnings preferably not 2 5 literally the day after earnings But you do you boo Love Kitties N Titties

going to blow it out of the water by enough to overcome IV crush based on more than just a hunch and when they occur once or twice per year you should swing big When I play earnings releases I m almost always just a seller of spreads so that I can profit off of theta IV crush surrounding the ER theta gang always wins This time however I ve bought outright calls Here is what I m seeing with Apple The iPhone 12 delay could mean huge YoY comparisons What kicked all this off was that two months ago I realized we could be heading for huge numbers this quarter do to an atypical delay in the launch of the newest iPhone Typically new iPhones are announced in mid September with preorders beginning immediately and shipments beginning before the end of the month However this year because of COIVD delays the launch date got pushed into October The iPhone 12 preorders began mid October with shipments a week later and the iPhone 12 mini and Max began preorders November 6 And that means no sales of the new models counted in the quarter ended Sept 30 Apple s fiscal fourth quarter as they usually do This year all of those opening day sales have fallen into the upcoming fiscal Q1 setting up a potentially huge quarter in sales and making for easy YoY comparisons right out of the gate Here s a Fortune article on the delay of the launch https fortune com 2020 10 29 apple q4 2020 earnings delayed iphone 12 sales The super cycle rumors appear to be true As a lover of new tech I always have to remind myself that the average person doesn t care about incremental new features as much as I do So when I heard rumors earlier this year that Apple could be facing a super cycle of upgrades due to 5G I was skeptical How much does the average person really care about spotty 5G service enough to jump on a new iPhone But based on reports starting to come out those rumors appear to be correct I ve seen a few articles suggesting a super cycle not seen since the iPhone 6 Here s a Yahoo Finance article on Wedbush s analysis https finance yahoo com news wedbush apple aapl iphone 12 141113883 html guccounter 1 amp guce referrer aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8 amp guce referrer sig

quotes from that article since I know we don t read around here gt Based on our recent Asia checks we believe the supply chain is anticipating low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds a roughly 35 increase from our original and Street forecasts says Ives who covers AAPL stock for Wedbush gt Compare that to the firm s expectations for iPhone 12 unit sales over time Three months ago Wedbush expected 65 million to 70 million unit builds for the December quarter it raised its outlook to 75 million units in late October and in mid December it set a stretch goal in the mid 80 million range gt Wall Street broadly sees AAPL selling 217 million iPhones in the company s fiscal 2021 but Wedbush s bull case is north of 240 million units 250 million could be in the cards an eye popping figure that would easily surpass the 231 million units the company sold in its fiscal 2015 gt We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis Here is an AppleInsider article although it quotes the same research at Wedbush https appleinsider com articles 20 12 15 apple iphone production reports corroborate supercycle thesis analyst says Notable quote gt That bump in production would represent a 30 year over year increase in smartphone models produced and is also well ahead of current Wall Street expectations Ives wrote It s anecdotal but I personally skipped the iPhone 11 upgrade because I was perfectly content with my XS Max however I did buy the 12 Pro Max The iPhone 12 sales mix It s not just that phone sales will be up on the iphone 12 launch it s the mix within those sales Typically when Apple launches phones they sell more of the of the entry level new phones than they do the premium because the total addressable market is bigger That doesn t appear to be the case this time As early as September people were reporting that Apple was making more higher end iPhone 12 models than entry level handsets https www investors com news technology click apple stock gets price target hike iphone 12 sales mix anticipating a shift in demand and they appear to have been correct Last year the entry level iPhone 11s outsold the premium iPhone 11s by a three to one margin This year almost immediately after launch people were reporting that the premium iPhone 12s were selling as much as the entry models https investorplace com 2020 10 greater than expected iphone 12 demand apple aapl stock buy Since then there have been reports trickling out that the premium iPhone 12s appear to actually be outselling the entry level versions Apple sold out of nearly everything they make for Christmas See further below for one of the reasons this may have happened in both my macro and risks sections Apple introduced a slough of new products from iMacs to watches this year and they sold out of all of them The list of sold out products at Christmas included the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max iPad iPad Pro iPad Air and iPad Mini MacBook Air and Pro iMac and iMac Pro HomePod mini and AirPods Max Here s a Barron s article mentioning the sell outs https www barrons com articles barrons 10 best stocks for 2021 51608337138 Apple wearables I would argue are now what economists call Veblen goods These are unique products where the demand curve actually increases as the price increases This can happen in goods such as wine where the consumer lacks the knowledge in how to evaluate the product so they take pricing as a signal of quality But another reason you can get that skewed demand curve is if the product conveys status One example of this is sports cars You can buy cars with 90 of the performance of the ultra top end cars for 30 of the price but that s not the point of owning them is it How often are you really out at the track Lambo isn t in competition with 50k sports cars They could raise the price 50k per car and people who can afford them would just want them more Louis Vuitton bags and 50 000 Birkin purses are more examples In fact with Birkin they not only constantly raise prices they forbid people from buying them You have to spend a lot of money on other lower tier products before you re allowed to even buy a Birkin bag This just makes new money women want them even more Those are dramatic examples of course and Apple isn t behaving that way but Apple just introduced very overpriced new over the ear headphones which cost almost twice as much as the leading competitor and yet Apple sold out of every single color in the first two weeks and hit a three month waiting list by Christmas on a product that I would assume due to its high pricing has very fat margins Apple charging twice as much makes them more appealing not less because wearables are worn and thus seen by your peers and the opposite sex The Twitter rumor mill is reporting parts moving at a brisk pace I can t track down the things I ve read here and there on Twitter and I m starting to run out of steam here so you may have to do some searching on your own but people who usually track movement of parts through the companies forming Apple s supply chain and normally have a good track record with their reports have reported that parts are moving through the chain at a very brisk pace This is addressed some in the reports on the iPhone supply chain in my earlier links App sales are crushing it Thanks probably in part to quarantine app sales have been crushing it and grew 35 this December compared to 17 https www thestreet com investing apple alphabet strong christmas sales the prior year meaning sales have grown at twice the pace Reoccurring revenue bundle numbers will be announced The biggest thing I ve learned from 2020 is that nothing matters more to the market than the narrative surrounding the reoccurring revenue bundle aka subscriptions A company announces its cutting its dividend but then tells you that s because its going to pour all that money into boosting its subscriptions The stock skyrockets Look at Disney AT amp T may be able to pull this off as well if it can convince people of that narrative with Warner HBO max and cut its dividend to pour it into content but that s a big if for them Apple launched their new reoccurring revenue bundle this year I personally signed up for the premium tier and now owe Apple 30 per month for the rest of my life I was already paying them to backup my phone to the cloud and now their bundle has thrown me into Apple Music Apple TV etc I am firmly entrenched in the Apple universe whether I like it or not It is these reoccurring revenue numbers that offer the possibility of earnings multiple expansion RISKS Are sellouts due to high demand or due to COVID related production problems I don t know Based on the reports I ve read some of which have been linked earlier in my post it sounds like everything is running full speed in China and the supply chain is running at near or above a record clip One possible risk is that this was not the case earlier this year and thus Apple sold out of things because they hadn t produced enough heading into Christmas I personally believe that production may have taken a huge hit early in the calendar year but by mid to late 2020 this was no longer a significant issue I also believe that even if sales have taken a slight hit due to production the market wouldn t really care Markets are forward looking They know COVID has impacted things globally and even if Apple reports sales difficulties they will be paired with significantly increased guidance for Q2 New reports have suggested that Apple has had to increase its iPhone production plans for 2021 by 20 30 because of strong demand https 9to5mac com 2020 12 15 strong iphone 12 demand An announcement like that is not a recipe for a stock crash Macro factors causing a crash A lot of people around here appear to be scared of an impending crash This seems to be based on the simple idea that stocks have run up a lot and therefore must crash A reversion to the mean is imminent I don t see it that way and I think the economy is more complex than that Just because something has gone up a lot does not mean it s going to crash People have been warning of a California real estate crash for 70 years I m a little bit older than you guys by probably about 10 15 years and I can remember the market frenzy of the dot com boom A lot of people were saying the same thing then and while they were ultimately proven right they were very early I remember seeing another year to year and a half of enormous gains after hearing all those warnings Of course the problem with musical chairs is that we never know when the music will stop but I would argue if anything stocks are roughly fairly valued not dangerously overvalued As we go into 2021 we face the following conditions a vaccine roll out that sometime between now and late 21 will lead us into a v shaped recovery The Krugman argument for this vision https www nytimes com 2020 11 19 opinion joe biden economy html and The Bloomberg argument for this vision https www bloomberg com amp opinion articles 2020 12 01 get ready for a supercharged economy We also just had the Fed reaffirm 0 interest rates and the continuation of QE Add to all of that very easy YoY earnings comps for the first two quarters of this year and this is not a recipe for a crash it s a recipe for a steady market melt up Where are the rich supposed to put all their money in a 0 interest rate environment 0 pushes up the value of all asset classes and this is especially true of real estate and stonks Generally speaking predicting macro economic movements is a losing game but all of those things combined with the easy YoY comps means I don t feel the need to be concerned of an impending correction for at least the next two quarters A much smaller factor but still a factor I have seen it suggested that Apple will be among the larger beneficiaries of the stimulus checks going out although those have not started rolling out until just now so that may have an impact on Q2 if any Bad subscription numbers If subscriptions to Apple One flopped this could significantly overshadow sales and earnings numbers I personally feel Apple isn t likely to seriously miscalculate predictions on a subscription bundle because they have their market dialed in but I don t know that for sure Sales could have cratered in October Sales often drop a little in the weeks preceding a phone launch What if phone sales tanked during the delays waiting for an iPhone 12 That could be bad I m encouraged by the fact that iPhone 11 models appeared to still be having good sales numbers when the iPhone 12 was launched see links earlier in this post but I don t really know what October sales look like COVID could have tanked all phone sales This report says all phone activations generally tanked 23 on Christmas Day https www thestreet com investing apple iphones dominate christmas day activations Two thoughts I have on that that number is for all phone activations not just iPhones And two that s just for Christmas Day itself There could be a wide array of reasons activations were down on that one day To counter that this report says the iPhone was the best selling 5G phone https 9to5mac com 2020 12 21 best selling 5g phone even in October despite the phone not launching until the second half of that month Additionally that article mentions pent up demand for 5G apple phones that sales are likely to be strong going forward Technical Analysis I don t believe in technical analysis Charts don t know any of the things I just explained and are therefore in my opinion useless to me Maybe somebody has figured out a system for charts to predict the future but I am not that person Fun rumors I m not big on speculative rumors and momentum type plays but if that s your thing there are certainly rumors in the air The most famous of which is the rumor that Apple is back to working seriously on an EV Car Another is reports are just coming out in the last day or two that Apple is seeing new successes in developing foldable tech https www macrumors com 2020 12 31 two foldable iphones reportedly pass tests Whether these things will impact the stock price isn t really my cup of tea but if it s yours those are two things to consider Is my post an attempt at a WSB pump and dump I m under no allusions that my own WSB post is going to alter the trajectory of a 2 25 trillion company in any meaningful way That sort of thing may work on a post IPO company that hasn t had its lockup expiration yet and thus has a tiny float aka PLTR or numerous other recent to the moon meme stocks with limited float That s not to say those aren t great companies or great trades I m just sayin My positions I m more conservative than most of WSB While I love this place with all my heart and love you guys for it I believe risking it all to chase screenshot worthy gains is moronic and not the path to building real long term wealth Thus my positions are probably more conservative than you d expect I have 20 of my net worth tied up in Apple via LEAPs 9 16 2022 APPL 87 50 calls I consider this to be essentially stock I hold for the long term Delta is approaching 1 anyway so they practically are stock Sometime in the depths of March I loaded up on FAANG LEAPs with the intention of actually holding them for years and then converting to shares Those LEAPs were a little OTM at the time I bought them I have no interest in day trading my significant LEAP positions so that s going to sit there for the next two years But I also have put an additional 15 of my net worth into short term calls on Apple to play the ER I have Feb 19 130 calls which were about 10 15 OTM at the time I bought them They are currently ITM I also have 1 29 135s and 1 29 141s This puts 35 of my net worth into Apple How to get rich I intend to cash out my short term calls after the ER and I don t intend to reinvest or roll them out because I suspect Apple will be fully valued by then and there are better plays out there I intend to keep my LEAPS because I bought those for the very long term and because at the very least I should hold them until March to hit the long term capital gains tax rate I intend to take my profits from the calls and push them into shorting NNOX and XPEV both of which have significant lockup expirations coming in mid to late February which I believe will significantly impact the stock prices in the short term I have no interest in shorting XPEV right now because you guys are crazy as fuck and for all I know EV stonks could all run up another 50 in the next month Right about the time the Apple ER hits should be perfect Criticism If you think I m wrong I would strongly encourage you to comment I don t give a fuck about looking correct or saving face but I give many fucks about not losing money If I m wrong I want to know it The Most Important Factor This ain t my first day around here and I know that DD is absolutely useless without rocketships therefore APPLE TO THE Godspeed fellow autists

SpaceX speculation I wrote it off as being as likely as Subway or Pornhub But when I looked into the timeline of the various threads there were some stars that seemed to align for Starlink Bill Ackman was offering the right amount to help complete Starlink s constellation The 5 7 billion could fit the 10 20 minority share he intended to acquire with the SPAC depending on how much of SpaceX s valuation is derived from Starlink Ackman would take the largest SPAC to date and bring internet connection to the entire world cementing his legacy as an investor and an activist Musk would be able to stop funneling money from his true passion with SpaceX the Mars mission And most importantly even small retail investors would see astronomical returns The main argument against Starlink in my

are missing some of the acquisition criteria as well I don t think that Starlink is the most likely candidate for PSTH but I no longer think that it is entirely impossible This is purely speculation

Gather round im bringing you this chad bull play from a throwaway account so nobody knows im a degenerate on my grown up account PLTR is going to the moon you can click off now if thats all you needed to know but if you re curious why this technology is the future keep reading ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS MORE ARTIFICAL THAN INTELLIGENT As has been dutifully noted by many fellow autists Palantir is an artificial intelligence algorithim data mangement software company However you don t quite have to worry about your wife going off and getting a robot boyfriend anytime soon While this may come to a surprise to Jeffery Epstein s pal Steve Hawking who believed robots will soon take over the world https www google com amp s www newsweek com stephen hawking named epstein unsealed files virginia giuffre ghislaine maxwell 1521920 3famp 1 smart people in the field have been dealing with solving the problems of making artificial intelligence work for decades This is good news for all those that have diamond hands on their Palantir shares in the coming years because one of the founders solved one of the major problems over a decade ago and I ll tell you how The problem with Artificial Intelligence and the Palantir Solution If you aren t yet familiar with Stephen Cohen https en m wikipedia org wiki Stephen Cohen entrepreneur you should be This is the ultimate autist chad that coded the first prototype of Palantir in 8 weeks At his time at Stanford he studied machine learning and artifical intelligence this was way back in 2005 these beasts of nature are always 20 years ahead of the normie media and their trends However as Cohen himself mentions in his talk at Stanford The Path to Palantir https m youtube com watch v g 6 kGDdjwI he became dissapointed studying AI due to the many limitations of the field he quickly realized Firstly the AI is only ever as smart as the algorithms that the humans were able to develop thus more artificial than intelligent Secondly while computers are able to store and calculate numbers even faster than an autist doing his math homework before his mom will let him have his tendies and their superior skill at storing this information computers cannot grasp numerous concepts that human s are skilled at Most fundamentally this is creativity and anything that is subjective The example Cohen uses in his speech is hunger Try explaining the feeling of hunger to someone and while you may be able to quantify it as a number between 1 10 this quantification leaves a lot out that someone that has never experienced hunger would understand To put it simply there are numerous factors in life that are impossible for a computer to qualify Computers are good at factors they can quantify numbers but are as retarded as your average WSB bottom feeder when it comes to the qualitative subjective This is where Palantir comes in Effectively Palantir solves the quantitative issues for the human and lays it out for humans to interact with and add in qualitative analysis Palantir is a marriage between a computer s impeccable ability to process and store numbers and data and humans impeccable ability to use creativity and view context as well as the subjective Software amp Business The Dinosaur Superstructure Heres where our other founder bellwether Peter Thiel https en m wikipedia org wiki Peter Thiel comes in If you haven t heard of him yet your girlfriend probably doesn t you stay out past 8 PM even when she s not home Member of the paypal mafia when hes not busy making billions with his buddies musk and bezos he s taking down Gawker with Hulk Hogan https www forbes com sites mattdrange 2016 06 21 peter thiels war on gawker a timeline sh 78387f3251c5 for outing his private sex life Like how Cohenknows how computer s work Thiel knows how businesses work How many people here have been in an actual office building Probably not the right crowd I know most of you still live in your parent s basement but that won t matter when PLTR moons Anyway one of the first things youll notice is that the majority of technology used by businesses and governments are older than the average r teenagers poster According to research conducted by Kaspersky four in ten of very small businesses VSB and roughly half of small and medium sized businesses SMB still rely on operating systems such as Windows XP or Windows 7 which are nearing their end of life https www itproportal com amp news businesses still dependent on outdated software For some reason I cannot find similar statistics for even larger companies that would be more likely for Palantir to be working with but i d wager from experience and knowing the scaleability issues that come with updating to technology especially when dealing with a bunch of boomers that it would be even higher for large companies However this is great news because our good friend Thiel has the perfect formula to grab the biggest 6000 businesses by the balls Essentially Palantir fronts the costs of installing and getting the software embedded into an operation in it s acquisition contract stage Im not a finance frog but from what I understand they don t actually make money from these contracts Hence why they haven t been profitable However the model is like a snowball After the acquisition contract has expired the boomers running the operation Palantir is contracting to have finally figured out how to use the software without training wheels and it is entrenched in their companies business A larger contract with higher margins is signed Further companies of that companies competition look at what Palantir has done for that company such as when in Q3 Palantir found 315m in unnecessary spending for an oil and gas company slotting to save the company 1b in the coming 12 months https investors palantir com news details 2020 Palantir Reports Revenue Growth of 52 in the Third Quarter Raises Full Year 2020 Guidance default aspx and they are forced to sign an acquisition contract further pushing the snowball along and acting as a case study of success for Palantir Remember to diamond hands and buy that dip The markets are an unmedicated bipolar teenaged girl on her period and currently Palantir is in a downswing but that is only a buying opportunity for the wise of us Short term I could see Palantir dipping as low as 20 This negative feedback loop will be broken either by a new contract Karp interview day another media announcement or demo day Eventually I ll lose a lot of you here if I already havent but hold strong and don t stress the short term as long as you agree with my thesis and have done seen enough due diligence of your own to understand the fundamentals of this company are as solid as Karp s skiing legs Longer term I can see this company being at 100b market cap being conservative Best of luck and fuck andrew never right left of Citron research morgan stanley and credit suisse PLTR TO THE MOON Disclamers 100 shares 25 my

Fool puts out an article about why this stock or that stock is a sure thing is not recommended is a dumpster fire I have the urge to do the opposite of their recommendations out of sheer spite And indeed those guys put out an article https www fool com investing 2020 12 22 why moderna stock plunged today wondering why MRNA took a dive about a week ago No firm conclusions from them other than the fact that Moderna isn t on their list of the top ten best stocks which might have been drawn up by a haruspex for all I know Anyways I m serious when I say that I think Moderna is undervalued And I don t have any financial interests in this post either Mostly I m trying to psych myself up because hey maybe I m not talking nonsense Their stock price just looks absolutely bonkers Everyone who bought Moderna at its peak a month ago has been keeping up with the news No doubt most of you have been watching red numbers in horror I m sure there s at least one bear who s sitting nicely on some puts but I don t know how many people put their money down on what would ve been a very risky wager It can t be zero Moderna got its emergency use authorization from the FDA awhile back they re not the only company with a COVID vaccine though and the headlines for Moderna since then have been pretty bad in comparison with say Pfizer Many vaccines have side effects but then you hear about the fact that side effects with the Moderna vaccine are super common for people with dermal implants https www health com condition infectious diseases coronavirus moderna vaccine facial filler and every now and then you ll see an article about some frontline worker getting hospitalized after their Moderna powered vaccination https www oregonlive com coronavirus 2020 12 moderna coronavirus vaccine triggers severe allergic reaction in wallowa county health care worker officials say html there s more than one example that s just the most recent And the investors are panicking Investors of course are stupid sheep because this stuff is nothing new Remember back in 1976 when an outbreak of the swine flu caused the Ford administration to push through a vaccine https en wikipedia org wiki 1976 swine flu outbreak then some people who got the vaccine ended up with Guillain Barr syndrome ironically causing people to freak out even more You know how many people actually suffered serious side effects A few hundred Out of literally millions about 25 of the US population including President Ford himself received the vaccine What happened was basically the worst case scenario and the chances of any single person getting their nervous system mangled was still infinitesimal You d literally have a better chance of being struck by lightning Lightning for what it s worth doesn t usually kill either Yeah maybe people who have had cosmetic surgery recently should be careful with the Moderna vaccine That s nothing Most people will need to wait their turn anyways as healthcare workers will largely continue to get the first doses I don t know if the majority of Americans will have a chance at vaccination before the end of the coming year For every scaremongering news article reporting on relatively uncommon side effects you get a bunch of other articles about how say Moderna s vaccine was just used to vaccinate a senior living facility https katv com news local moderna vaccine administered at little rock senior living facility I have no idea about the ratio can t be bothered to do the math but you should also keep in the mind the old adage of if it bleeds it leads Hell the biggest risk associated with Moderna s vaccine is probably wastage from negligence or malice like what happened with that pharmacist in Wisconsin https www npr org 2020 12 31 952536531 pharmacist arrested accused of destroying more than 500 moderna vaccine doses Dude straight up destroyed 550 doses Big yikes as the kids say I feel like if I don t watch myself I ll veer off into a tangent about vaccine safety in general and other fun topics that re suited for a good ramble The main point is this Moderna s still putting out vaccines They finished Phase 3 trials very very recently The verdict It works https finance yahoo com news moderna announces publication results pivotal 142200437 html If you get COVID you could get seriously fucked up as the poor souls in the placebo group cofirmed and the people in the vaccine group all lived Oh yeah and the Department of Defense is buying up doses under some cushy government contract That probably means something Maybe it s just my gut that says a company which has put out a viable COVID vaccine shouldn t have its stock continue to tank indefinitely The trend line of MRNA prices has been steadily down since early December https i imgur com xSLwIJM png In the last few days though I think I see the barest hint of an inflection point https i imgur com 8tb2XQp png In the past day even https i imgur com z2fIQT1 png Or maybe I m seeing things and it ll continue to slide If you think that I m wrong go ahead and take out a whole bunch of puts see if you re not too late to pull in a profit I don t care I just hope fewer people will be

about what the trajectory of the Georgia Senate Runoffs will be you can make money Scroll to the bottom for the plays for each outcome Introduction Almost everyone on this sub knows QQQ Now recall the price action around Nov 3 or if you can t because you re that guy from the movie Memento pull out your Robinhood app and follow along with me kid On the eve of the general election when the so called pollsters said it would be a Democratic sweep QQQ sat at 269 The next day with the election contested QQQ rocketed to 294 It remained steady on Friday before declining the next week Why did the election affect the price the way that it did Well it s because Biden s legislative agenda depends on Democratic control of Congress In particular he can raise corporate taxes with just a simple majority in the Senate The institutional whales the folks who actually move markets believe that Companies that benefitted bigly from Trump s tax cuts tech companies especially will be hurt by Biden raising taxes Companies that would benefit from fiscal stimulus green new deal infrastructure will be helped by by Biden s plans and even more if Biden controls Congress Regardless of who controls the Senate the divided nature means some companies are guaranteed to benefit Don t take my word for it Read this report from Goldman Sachs p 15 16 https www goldmansachs com insights pages beyond 2020 post election policies f report pdf Originally tech companies facing more regulation and tax increases under the Democratic Trifecta was trending down But then when it became clear the Republicans would hold the Senate and taxes weren t going up tech stocks soared Yet suddenly there was a small blip downward the next week Why Because David Perdue R was headed to a runoff injecting the possibility that Democrats still had a chance to control Congress Which stocks are impacted and why If Democrats gain control of the U S Senate that means Biden can pass his legislation Some companies will be helped bigly e g Renewables Some companies may be hurt more taxes but also helped more fiscal spending Some companies may be hurt bigly more taxes regs and less gov t subsidies To make this a pure election related play we want to trade companies that benefit bigly from Democratic legislation and don t have short term non political risk companies that are hurt bigly from Democratic legislation and don t have short term non political risk So what companies benefitted the most from Trump s tax cuts Source Goldman Sachs Client note Tech companies like Netflix which saw its effective tax rate go from 23 to 7 Railroad companies like CSX which saw its effective tax rate go from 37 to 23 Healthcare companies like HCA which saw its effective tax rate go from 32 to 20 Pure financial companies like CME saw its effective tax rate go from 36 to 23 Obviously pandemic related questions muddle price action on healthcare At the same time there is still some policy uncertainty to what will happen to railroads regardless of the outcome of the runoffs they will have higher taxes but that may be offset by stimulus infrastructure spending That leaves two sectors as our pure election plays Tech companies will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate Financials will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate Out of those sectors specific companies may be overvalued or undervalued and other concerns may matter more than legislative impact by the U S Congress For example BABA is a tech company in QQQ but as a Chinese company it sure isn t going to impacted much by U S tax legislation We can just ignore it However a U S company like NFLX which is a bit overpriced and very exposed to a tax cut rollback is an excellent bear trade for a Democratic Senate scenario especially if corporate tax increases start being mentioned While MSFT which is slightly under valued and also exposed to tax increases may be a good trade against a Democratic Senate Information about the races to consider In the November General election Perdue R won 49 7 percent of the vote while Ossoff D won 47 9 percent In other words Ossoff substantially underperformed Biden The Republican candidates Loeffer Collins won a combined 49 4 percent while the Democratic candidates Warnock et al won a combined 48 4 percent These are both substantial leads for the Republicans The reputable polls Republican leaning Trafalgar Group most accurate pollster of 2016 which had Trump up 3 4 in its November poll i e 3 4 wrong has now pegged both the Democratic candidates leading slightly in its late December poll Democratic leaning Survey USA which has pretty accurate polling had Biden up 1 2 in its last general election poll is now predicting a Democratic sweep in its late December poll Poll to Watch AJC UGA with polling by UGA Professor Trey Hood the most accurate major poll this year for Georgia This will be released soon The Rev Raphael Warnock is

DISCALIMER If you want to learn about this in more depth and want to verify my claims this is a link of a TED conference from a seasoned enviromentalist who explains these issues in details https www youtube com watch v N yALPEpV4w https www youtube com watch v N yALPEpV4w but for the purpose of wsb I will keep this post nice and short and focus on what really matters money Also english is not my native language so forgive any errors In the last few years there s been a lot of speculation around the shift to renewables A lot of people are bullish on solar wind an EVs and are very bearish on big oil companies I m going to explain to you why the government s shift to clean energy and the recent oil crisis is actually very bullish for big oil in the medium to long term Renewables cannot exist without oil Basically as it turns out current tech for solar and wind sucks big time and it probably will for decades to come Not only they are nowhere near as enviromentally sustainable as nuclear power because they need lots of terrain use 20x more resources than nuclear fission power plants and there are recycling issues but most importantly these green plants depend on the sun shining and the wind blowing so they can only run and produce energy about 30 of the time The key here is that there is no real efficient way no pumping and dumping water is not efficient to have these plants running without coupling them with fossil fuel burning regular plants beacuse otherwise the electric power grid would be a mess So the real reason that all these oil companies are fine with the government shifting to green energy is that to run this utopia of solar panels wind turbines and EVs you ll still need their oil In fact these companies are the ones that are lobbying politicians in particular democrats in the US case persuading it to pursue this green bullshit instead of going with real less harmful choice which is regular old nuclear energy The 2020 oil price shock benefits BIG oil companies in the long run The oil price disaster in march might cause a short term problem with oil companies but BIG oil companies rubbed their hands Maybe the small oil companies or the ones with lots of debt can face problems and go out of business but the GIANT with a healthy balance sheet can survive the crisis and have even more market share You have to think about this as if oil companies were coffee shops During corona many closed and never opened again becaus eof bankrupcty so the ones that had lots of cash available before the big hit the big players like Starbucks will benefit when there is full or partail reopening of the economy Oil demand will not shrink that much If people knew that oil is not just used for powering engines they probably wouldn t have such a negative outlook on oil demand Guys oil is fucking used to build anything that is made out of plastic Even to make some medications you need stuff that comes from oil To get all the useless shit that the west buys from India and China you ll still need oil to power container ships that sail the ocean Once this corona shit is over people will still buy plane tickets to go on vacation Sure maybe business trips will take a permanent hit and there be slightly less demand due to the transition to green BUT as we said earlier green still needs it and we are still not adressing the elephant in the room there are massive emerging markets economies growing in the worild today a lot of second and third world countries that will still rely on oil for their initial growth for decades These countries will offset the loss of demand from developed nations Shit general commodities prices have been skyrocketing recently You wanna jump on steel gang and not on oil gang The only way oil prices fall from here is if OPEC shits the bed The play As long as this obsession for and complete ignorance and denial on how to solve climate change continues and as long as the goverments of the west are corrupt and cannot see that they need to boost nuclear power and public transportation instead of solar wind and EVs big oil companies with a heathy balance sheet will be fine in the next decade Many oil companies are trading at or below book value with massive dividend yields it won t stay like this forever Do yourself a favour and be long on RDS XOM BP TOT CVX and maybe even the italian E Saw a lot of hedge funds buying OXY in the past few months for some reason Either buy shares and if you are a brave man use leverage I wouldn t advise options on this one since we don t know when the catalyst for the rally will come and one of the main points of the play is to get that juicy dividend If you just need to use options use LEAPS for the love of god I expect a return of AT LEAST 20 on teh shares alone maybe even a lot more TLDR shift to solar and wind will actually benefit supermassive oil companies with healthy balance sheets that can weather the current crisis

wallstreetbets ,Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r wallstreetbets Happy New Year I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and is ready for the new trading week month and year ahead Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th 2021 Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year Source https www cnbc com 2020 12 31 politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year html gt Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind but already in the dawn of the new year the market could face its first big challenge gt The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U S Senate gt With President elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic controlled House of Representatives Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate gt The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win each party would have 50 seats with Vice President elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker gt Georgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years said Ed Mills Washington policy analyst at Raymond James It s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate gt Sen David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff while GOP Sen Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock None of the candidates had more than 50 of the vote in the Nov 3 election so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat gt It s a binary event said Mills adding it s of growing interest to markets The general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent the 2018 election has humbled us The Senate outcomes in particular seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections gt Mills said the results may take several days to determine adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets According to an RBC investor survey 88 expect Republicans to maintain control and most say that is a positive for the stock market gt The market tends to shoot first and ask questions later There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats said Peter Boockvar chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory gt That totally dominates trading because it s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes Boockvar said I think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending by Democrats gt By the numbers gt A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks as the pandemic steered the course for markets The S amp P 500 was up 16 3 for the year ending at 3 756 That gain comes after a 34 decline early in the year followed by a powerful more than 65 rebound Technology was the big winner for the year and the Nasdaq was up 43 6 at 12 888 gt Besides the runoff vote the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week including the important December jobs report Friday That could show fewer than 100 000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs There were 245 000 jobs created in November gt There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday and a number of Fed speakers including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday gt The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks gt Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up But the initial distribution has been slow and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump s task force gt In that recent RBC survey three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80 expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021 We suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met RBC strategists wrote gt They also noted that nearly 60 of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic gt This suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit taking On this point it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No 1 issue keeping investors up at night closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery the strategists noted gt Chris Rupkey chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden s presidency gt However Missouri Sen Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state s slate of electors the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection gt Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome but there could be fireworks Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims gt Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties gt I think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus and infrastructure spending in 2021 I don t know that that is such a slam dunk because of the issue of political instability he said This past week saw the following moves in the S amp P CLICK HERE FOR

gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months with the S amp P 500 Index up more than 14 in November and December so far the best end to a year since WWII gt A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021 Turns out a 10 or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S amp P 500 the following year every single time since World War II explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick In fact January was also higher every single time as well so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year gt As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day the S amp P 500 gained an average of more than 18 the year following a 10 or more surge during the final two months of the year Meanwhile January was up 5 for 5 as well rising an impressive 3 on average gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https i0 wp com lplresearch com wp content uploads 2020 12 12 31 20 Blog Chart 1 png ssl 1 gt Here s what the average year looks like after the

the one below is right up there with some of the best After all the markets have been through this year bot the S amp P 500 and Long Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis That s right with just a few hours left in the trading year the S amp P 500 s total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17 6 while Long Term US Treasuries as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long Term Treasury Index has rallied 17 3 What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2020 12 123120 Stocks Bonds png gt The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn t typical The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S amp P 500 and long term US Treasuries going back to 1978 During that time the S amp P 500 has historically outperformed long term US Treasuries by an average of 3 9 percentage points per year but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points In the 43 years since 1978 there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years 1985 and 1992 where the performance spread was less than a percentage point gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2020 12 123120 Stocks Bonds Annual Spreads png gt Back to Back Big Years for Technology gt With just two trading days including today left in 2020 the S amp P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40 Going back to 1990 the only time the Technology sector experienced back to back returns of more than 40 was in 1998 and 1999 Back then not only was the Technology sector up 40 in back to back years but it was also up over 75 in both of those years If you think markets are pretty crazy these days they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s gt In terms of cumulative returns the Technology sector is up 210 since the last trading day of 2018 whereas in 1999 it was up 317 in a two year span What s also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years while the S amp P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span Furthermore since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1 6 Not a bad 12 year run gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2020 12 123020 Technology Sector Performance png gt Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years there have been some big individual winners Topping the list with a gain of just under 400 is Advanced Micro Devices AMD On the last day of 2018 AMD traded hands for under 20 per share Today s it s over 90 AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock NVIDIA NVDA which is up 288 Interestingly there aren t a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector s 210 gain but that s because Apple AAPL the sector s largest stock has paced the sector s gains by rallying more than 240 gt On the downside just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years The worst of these has been DXC Technology DXC which has lost more than half of its value while Juniper JNPR and HP Enterprise HPE are down between 10 and 20 Lastly FLIR Systems FLIR has declined less than 2 so depending on how it acts in the next two days it could move into positive territory just as Intel INTC did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2020 12 123020 Technology Sector Stocks png gt Growth Dragging on Small Caps gt In the past couple of weeks we have frequently been keeping tabs on small cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations More specifically taking a look at growth oriented small caps with only a couple days left in the year small cap growth stocks proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF IWO are on pace to have outperformed large cap equivalents in 2020 On December 10th IWO surpassed the S amp P 500 Growth ETF IVW in terms of YTD performance and even after pulling back in the past week IWO is still in the lead gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2020 12 123020 Small Large1 png gt As a result of recent moves there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week In the chart below we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF IWO versus the S amp P 500 Growth ETF IVW This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small cap growth drastically outperformed large cap growth But the former s weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2020 12 123020 Small Large2 png gt As to just how sharp of a reversal this was in the five days through yesterday s close the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June Before that April and March saw declines that were even larger Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small cap growth to large cap growth in the past few months but that also stands in the bottom 0 5 of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading Outside of this past spring the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small cap growth relative to large cap growth was at various points in 2011 2008 and a handful of times in the early 2000s gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2020 12 123020 Small Large3 png gt Small cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though For value stocks small caps IWN have generally outperformed large caps IVE for the entirety of the new bull market While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2020 12 123020 Small

omnichannel and more,I ve been noticing some GME bears coming out of the woods so here s a DD up your butthole don t worry I ll use lube and I ll ease into it slowly GME GONNA BE BANKRUPT HUUR DURR GME bears If GME was going bankrupt it would ve done so already during the lockdown not in the beginning of a console cycle Here s a brief look at the credit markets backdrop and I ll explain why GME won t go bankrupt anytime soon and is in fact very bullish for GME I m not gonna go into how GME improved their balance sheets and got FCF lots of people did that already but I ll say something in WSB terms Printers go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR yo When the IG and HYG credit market went to shit back in March and April JPOW pulled out his magnificent printers and set it to BRR mode the end result is well functioning credit markets with spreads that are tight af With yields in treasuries and IG being low people are forced to look for yield in junk bonds This is why you hear about how CCL was able to raise debt without using ships as collateral and airlines using their flyer points as collateral to raise debt Creditors are willing to lend at laughable rates just to get yield Now GME doesn t need to raise more debt it is meeting it obligations early but if it ever needs to raise capital for future growth operations they can easily raise capital in the credit market for as long as JPOW sets the printer in BRR mode Which we know won t change until at least 2023 I honestly think it ll be longer than that but it doesn t matter anyways since wsb doesn t even look 6 months out ahead Notice how we haven t had as much bankruptcies as people thought we would small businesses don t count Well that s because of our great lord and savior JPOW So there you have it betting on GME bankruptcy is essentially betting against JPOW losing control of the credit market JPOW is in effect GME gang s daddy 1 iloveyoujpow BUT GME HAD NEGATIVE EPS FOR SO MANY YEARS more gay GME bears You see the problem with bears is that they are always backwards looking no vision for the future no hopes for anything always depressing For some reason they can t understand that a lot of the market participants are writing off 2020 because of the pandemic they also can t understand GME is cyclical and moves along with the console cycle meaning we are now in the early days of a gme pump Their inability to look forward is in fact the number 1 reason why their wives have chad forward looking boyfriends Our forward looking chad is of course Ryan Cohen Daddy 2 I don t even need to explain more but GME GANG daddy 2 obviously has a vision and he is more than ready to double down on his bet buying GME at 16 just two weeks ago He had a few mysterious tweets recently and people are speculating that he is ready to make another move I m not going to join the speculation but the fact that he bought at 16 means that is probably the floor price and I would go all in with calls if it ever dips below that THEY HAVE NO VIABLE BUSINESS MODEL IN THE AGE OF ECOMMERCE Gay bear and Melvin capital We have to give credit where it s due Melvin capital likely had significant alpha with their investment thesis If you look at their holdings you ll see that they are long ecommerce and short specialty retail They saw the demise of various brick and mortar stores back around 2015 and executed on that thesis I d argue that the covid pandemic essentially pulled forward all the earnings growth and priced in a lot of that growth with high PE multiples The problem with that thesis is that it is now old ecommerce is a crowded trade and this will not be an alpha generating thesis The best way to generate alpha is now to invest in a new counter thesis that can outperform the crowded ecommerce thesis Omnichannel is one of such counter thesis it s starting to get hyped everywhere This is why Sherman repeats that word like he s autistic this guy probably mutters it while banging his wife but judging by his conference call she s probably never been excited by him Likely he doesn t know how to execute on that thesis thank god for GME GANG DADDY RC That s not to say he is useless despite all the shit we gave him Sherman managed to close down unprofitable stores reduced inventory and got cashflow positive during a pandemic This is textbook shit but still very important and despite the letters RC put out he could be very receptive of his ideas for all we know He has shown to be somewhat shareholder friendly through previous buybacks and he did not rule out further share buybacks Sherman himself holds over 1million shares and has not yet sold them as far as I know The shelf offering concerns seems to have faded for now and it will become smaller as the stock price increases I really just think GME management wants to use that to capitalize on any potential pumps in the stock This will probably be re invested anyways So what did GME do so far to improve its business model So far I ve seen the following 1 Pivot to ecommerce and improving ecommerce sales which has seen decent growth 2 Diversifying sales to include more high margin items like PC accessories PC monitors etc If I speculate there may be partnerships with certain brands 3 Focusing on loyalty programs like power ups I ll never understand loyalty programs but some people are retardedly loyal to stores that offer rewards If they can offer good incentives they can achieve high conversion rates as far as I know GameStop is the only specialty video game retailer in north America that offers such reward programs 4 Store rebranding this might be good for their goodwill which got hammered over the years Daddy RC has more plans for GME and we can only speculate what they might be right now but with 12 stake he has what he needs to go full on activist on the BoD I expect to see some departures and replacements in the reasonably near future If that s not enough for you here s a few more possible catalysts for the stock that I don t see a lot of people mentioning 1 A possible new Nintendo console release in 1 2 years 2 Currently distressed commercial REITs ability to negotiate lower rent more 3 Likely return of inflation debatable but money supply ballooned and we are seeing velocity pick up a bit with JPOW promising to keep rates at 0 even when inflation comes back bullish for all stocks bears will get slaughtered 4 OG printer Yellen manning the treasury in a month possible dem senate more stimmy checks more money going into GME 5 If sales improve and balance sheets continue improve we might see more credit upgrades 6 Better sales possible dividend re instatement I couldn t care less about dividends but guess who s going to be paying The shorts lol If Sherman had balls he would pull an OSTK and announce a special dividend which will actually lead to a short squeeze while wsb laughs collectively as we get meme returns from this boomer move I m sure the OG GME bulls can think of more reasons I ve been in and out of GME since it was at 9 my CC s kept on getting assigned Current positions 500x GME shares ready to buy more at the dip Monday and Tuesday going to sell a few puts 15x Apr 20c Leaps 10x Jan 15 20c YOLOs So does this mean I think GME will squeeze to 69 by next friday No GME short interest has been high for years Melvin capital isn t going to be that worried since their GME position is likely hedged and not a big part of their holdings they re probably laughing at wsb for all the memes we put out We will likely have a few more dips next week which I will buy Depending on how much WSB pumps GME before ICR or console sale release which I expect to be lackluster due to shortages I ll either take profit or sell some ITM calls if IV s are high Then buy the dip TLDR GME bankruptcy is out of the question for the next 3 5 years because of the macro and credit market RC is putting a floor of 16 on the price debatable but you re welcome to buy puts or short below 16 bears need to stop looking backwards and be anticipatory GME short squeeze likely not going to happen overnight but a bit slowly as more people realize GME isn t going bankrupt and either buy in or cover their short positions
