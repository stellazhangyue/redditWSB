5,nkedem,t2_cvt03ae,1621908002,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nkedem/should_you_bet_on_penn/,1,Should you bet on PENN ,I want to preface this by saying that I m primarily a value investor although many of my clients do own growth stocks so my area of expertise isn t necessarily on growth stocks like PENN With that being said I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of well growth And while a companies growth in the past can t necessarily predict that companies growth in the future it can be a good indicator for what s to come So let s take a look at PENN s growth In 2015 Penn s revenue was 3 03 Billion dollars In 2016 their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million to 3 15 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth going up to 3 59 Billion dollars in revenue In 2019 PENN s revenue grew to 5 3 Billion about 65 growth It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino gambling companies in general but this is impressive nonetheless A respectable argument could be made based on revenue to justify the 12 5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth but other quantitative data tells a different story This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years PENN s debt to asset ratio of 80 isn t terrible when compared to other gambling stocks but contextually generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year a very liberal estimate in my opinion with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock It was one of the five stocks in its sector out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated with a positive ROE which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors which is very important for companies with low revenue With that being said I still think the stock is overvalued PENN s partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12 5 Billion but the price point is just that unjustified In my estimation PENN will generate roughly 7 8 5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350 450 Million in profit by then I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion a P E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing is fair for PENN Fair value for these guys is around 65 and my price target to buy is around 55 Thanks for reading this If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company s value feel free to let me know

company The stock however is nearly 50 off its lows after a shroud of uncertainty https www marketwatch com story plug power stock soars as restatement removes overhang of uncertainty 11620996549 has been removed around the restatement But what did we really learn from the restatement and is PLUG still under a shroud The nitty gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics and you can check this by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for Increase decrease in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash hasn t changed But while you re looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed in 2019 and 2018 PLUG used about an extra 2 5M in cash which it got from banks essentially Not a huge deal on the scale of the 155M it used in 2020 but certainly not a great look So let s look at those reconciliations and here you want to start with the income statement the biggest thing here is booking almost 40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R amp D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019 Still that 40M is nearly 10 of revenue over those two years hardly a trivial mistake and they don t say much about how it happened The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right of use assets related to sale leaseback transactions PLUG entered into This doesn t affect much other than accounting but it s illuminating A leaseback works like this Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you re low on cash You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan You ve still got the right to use the same iPhone but now you ve got cash The downside is if your puts don t pay off Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill but that s a problem for future you PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money losing business and when issuing stock isn t an option as it wasn t for most of 2018 and 2019 with the price around 2 a share they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones Just some updates from my last post by the way I calculate about negative 200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG financed and then some by a spectacular 1 2B in stock sales at an average price some 40 below the current market price It issued at an even more blistering pace albeit at considerably better prices in Q1 Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants despite being in the money for all of Q42020 I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can t pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products Finally let s talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting but this is related to the restatement and not news Nevertheless you don t really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future If I bought in the offering at 65 I would be considering a lawsuit and many people have gone ahead and filed The 10 K has one other big red flag in Unresolved Staff Comments gt On December 16 2020 the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended December 31 2019 and Form 8 K filed with the SEC on November 9 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR so I don t know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts And it has incentives to play games PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year It might be wise to follow their lead

not an economist I just like trying to sound like I m smart That s S mart baby Let s start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market First lets understand the repo market But I m going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs There is the Fed and there is the Fed The Fed is the Federal Reserve the Fed is what I m referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements A repurchase agreement repo is one in which government securities T bills bonds bills and notes are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement reverse repo just that the buyer sellers are reversed In a repo the Fed is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash In a reverse repo the Fed is selling securities for cash The effect is that in a repo agreement cash is being injected into the market While in a reverse repo agreement cash is being drained from the market Does this matter since it s all overnight Good question I don t know yet Another question is does it matter whether it s the Fed or the Fed that enter into these agreements Another good question I don t know that either How s it work The Fed sets the maximum rate it s willing to purchase sell securities at and since it s at auction other qualified firms the in the Fed can bid to take the securities at different possibly lower higher rates depending on whether they need additional reserves securities or cash based on their required holdings In this case the Fed is the buyer of last resort They set the max rate they ll buy at and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they ve set This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve Very interested how they set the rate for the 10 30 year but that s going to wait til a later show Why does this matter On April 30 the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed was responsible for 173B in reverse repo agreements And despite reducing the eligibility requirements that amount has gone to 394B as of today Does it matter I don t know but here s a scary graph So we should probably figure it out https preview redd it luy9t2zqn7171 png width 620 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993 While graphs like the one above can be scary just because they are oddities we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets Lots of odd things don t seem to have an effect on anything even if we think it would have an effect on the markets Some of the effects I really think I ve overused effect at this point of this is that at auction the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate Not significantly After all the current rate is 0 06 rate and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase So from 06 to 11 on the overnight funds rate and an increase from 1 to 15 on the interest on excess reserve rate Doesn t seem like much But does it affect long term yields Does it affect Long Term Yields I don t know I went down another rabbit hole 1 Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2 Which predicts which The giant bond market reacting before the stock market or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices I wish I had Goldman s supercomputer right now Pretty sure they ve got all of the iterations of it programmed Fuckers Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops and recover quicker than the stock market does if you want to buy the dip in the bond market options baby It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market After all it s been dropping for more than 20 years And yes the opposite seems to be true but to a lesser extent When bond yields rise there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop about 2 weeks So in the short term is a 05 5 basis point increase in bond yields significant A doubling almost in the short term rate probably But there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market Action Items Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs Short the S amp P there Or you could just go to the source nevermind retail traders can t get any accurate up to date actionable market data You can go to the fed but it s 3 days late https www newyorkfed org markets reference rates effr https www newyorkfed org markets reference rates effr amp x200B This week s things to watch for Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence Last week the Empire Index was up barely though the prices paid were higher higher inflation The Philly index was down and prices paid were at 40 year highs Tomorrow is Richmond Where the fuck is Richmond Thursday is unemployment claims and Friday is another print of CPI But it s on a holiday weekend So responses should be muted If bad look for a bloody Tuesday If good fuck it why not All time highs again On Next week s The Late Late Stage Capitalism Show with RUatrollorRUserious let s talk about inflation deflation
