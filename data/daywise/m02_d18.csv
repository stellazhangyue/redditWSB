billion market in 2015 Tomorrow a young man who legally invested his money in 2019 has to appear before Congress giving testimony and is also getting sued by corporations ,Go to Youtube search for Deception Lies and CSGO watch one of the early videos that exposed it and come back and read Back already huh One of the many videos about it but this was one of the original ones publicising what happened Want to know what happened to all the guilty parties read until the end gt gt The CS GO gambling scandal Everything you need to know gt Over the course of a month Counter Strike Global Offensive has been hit with arguably the biggest scandal in the game s history and one which threatens to change the complexion of the professional scene forever gt Over the course of a month Counter Strike Global Offensive has been hit with arguably the biggest scandal in the game s history and one which threatens to change the complexion of the professional scene forever gt Dozens of sites that allow Counter Strike players to gamble with virtual in game items have exploded in popularity in recent years They sponsor some of the biggest streamers players and even some teams The market has been largely unregulated because the sites largely exist in a legal gray area gt In just a matter of weeks a number of these sites have been exposed for what appear to be underhanded and dishonest business practices Two class action lawsuits have been filed In the wake of intense public scrutiny Valve Counter Strike s developer and Twitch the most popular game streaming platform have both responded to try and curb what has been a huge part of the growth of Counter Strike gt gt With so many stories and a myriad of characters it can be hard to keep track of the story and how it started So here s a breakdown gt What is skin betting and why is it controversial gt In Counter Strike players can obtain purely cosmetic gun skins These skins come in cases which can either be bought for a few cents or through random drops in the game The case can be opened for the low low price of 2 49 to reveal what skin you actually got and some skins are much rarer than others gt These skins can then be sold on Steam Valve s game marketplace for Steam credit or sold on third party sites for real cash Skins can also be gambled with on a myriad of sites from casino style chance games to sportsbook sites that take action on just about every level of competitive Counter Strike Many argue that this gambling culture around matches has served to boost viewership particularly at those lower levels gt It s controversial because these sites operate without regulation They re not considered gambling sites under most current laws That means minors and players in countries like the U S where traditional online gambling is illegal can use these sites freely It has long been considered a grey area gt Earlier this year the U K became one of the first countries to take a firm stance that skin betting should be equivalent to traditional cash gambling leading to the shutdown of U K based sites like EZSkins gt gt How did this scandal start gt Before the big name personalities that attracted mainstream attention were dragged in there was m0E Mohamad m0E Assad a streamer and former pro player who had just recently completed a much acclaimed stint as an analyst on ELEAGUE gt A popular streamer M0E was sponsored by gambling site CSGO Diamonds and streamed himself on Twitch gambling on the site After a falling out m0E threatened to expose the site for failing to pay him money he felt he was owed M0E also claimed that CSGODiamonds had without him asking told him outcomes of games in advance so he could fix the results and create entertainment on his stream gt CSGO Diamonds swiftly responded however showing that M0E had indeed asked for results M0E was also playing with skins provided to him by the site or house money This was never disclosed to viewers and we now know this is common practice in the industry Most streamers who broadcast themselves gambling were never winning or losing their own money they were simply playing with chips that they were not able to cash out gt gt Who else has been implicated gt The story really exploded when YouTuber HonortheCall revealed that Trevor TmarTn Martin and Thomas ProSyndicate Cassell had promoted gambling site CSGO Lotto to their combined audience of 10 million without disclosing that they were the owners of the site gt TmarTn is also a co owner of major esports franchise EnVyUs who have leading teams in League of Legends Call of Duty and Counter Strike The team attempted to both distance itself from TmarTn while also supporting him and vouching for his character gt ProSyndicate managed to fade into the background thanks in part to TmarTn s PR implosion as he issued a series of apologies and half apologies in video and on Twitter only to delete them gt Another big name streamer James PhantomL0rd Varga was then dragged into the scandal According to logs revealed by veteran journalist Richard Lewis Phantoml0rd failed to disclose his ownership of the site CSGO Shuffle He also appeared to ask for outcomes of rolls before they happened gt The scandal has also ensared the owners of top esports team FaZe Clan Nordan Rain Shat and Richard Banks Bengtson who ve been accused of having an undisclosed ownership stake in CSGO Wild gt gt What are the consequences gt For TmarTn and ProSyndicate in particular the attention their case created could cause them significant trouble going forward gt The pair have been named in one of two class action lawsuits along with CSGO Lotto itself and Counter Strike developer Valve The suit was filed by an anonymous Florida mother on behalf of her son who is a minor She alleges that her son has gambled and lost significant amounts of money on these sites gt Both lawsuits make allegations about the legality and practices of these gambling sites and accuse Valve of allowing this illegal gambling market to exist and grow rapidly The second suit is being led by Jones Ward LLC a firm that specializes in class action suits and is involved in action against FanDuel and Draft Kings gt gt How have the companies reacted gt After the two lawsuits were filed Valve attempted to distance itself It released a statement claiming that any site using Steam for commercial purposes was breaking its terms and conditions and that it would take action to stop them gt Last week Valve put its money where its mouth was and sent out a cease and desist letter to 23 gambling sites That included CSGO Wild CSGO Diamonds and CSGO Lotto but not CSGO Shuffle Also included in the letter was CSGO Lounge who take bets on competitive Counter Strike rather than offering games of chance gt So far CSGO Double CSGO Casino CSGO 2X SocietyLogin CSGO Battle and CSGO Wild have either shut down or indicated that they will do so soon gt After Valve s initial statement Twitch issued a clarification of its own rules gambling on CS GO skins isn t permitted on stream because it breaks Valve s terms of service It is impossible to ascertain what impact this has had sitewide but Phantoml0rd s Twitch channel was suspended in the days following the expose about his involvement with CSGO Shuffle gt gt What does this mean for the future of Counter Strike gt The overall impact will not be apparent for a while to come but some claim that it will affect Counter Strike viewership across the board gt CSGO Lounge has not yet given any indication of shutting down and is still operating as normal with the Steam log in If the site were to be shut down it may well affect viewership of particularly low level or online Counter Strike matches As of this moment if there are viewers who only watch competitive matches because they can bet on them those viewers will still be tuning in gt Viewership numbers of streamers on Twitch does appear to have dropped anecdotally but the game is still generally in the top five and tens of thousands of viewers gt With all the attention these scandals have attracted it seems probable that some kind of government regulation will be implemented unless Valve succeeds in killing off the market entirely gt For now there are still plenty of places you can bet your skins But that could change dramatically over the next few of months gt Nothing Screw ye for flicking over everything and just scrolling to see this Much like 2016 17 18 19 everyone moved on Nothing happened to them They posted apology videos with cute dogs in their mansions and got back to making more content

Shutdown of Gee Em Eee Read Ahead of 2 18 GameStop Congress Hearing Repost for Visibility , Note that the below text is a re post of a previous post for visibility If you ve already read this would appreciate an upvote for visibility TLDR GameStop s Congress hearing is on Feb 18th they need to investigate the Prime Brokers and DTCC for their complicity in enabling naked shorting within GME and by extension potential collusion to shut down trading on Jan 28th the day the short squeeze was going to kick off stick to the end for an analysis of some illegal tactics short side hedge funds have been using Thesis On the day the retail market for GME shut down on 1 28 the day the short squeeze would ve happened had there been no market intervention DTCC clearing house monopoly shut down retail buying in order to protect itself and Prime Brokers which privately own the DTCC from being exposed to the consequences of being party to illegal activity I believe Prime Brokers and DTCC need to be called to the GameStop hearing on February 18th to be questioned for their complicity in enabling illegal naked shorting of the GME stock as well as potential collusion to shut out retail buyers on 1 28 In my previous post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lglrg5 naked shorting in gme and how the pieces suddenly which I recommend reading for some context I explored the subject of rampant illegal naked shorting in GME and how Prime Brokers consisting of banks like Goldman Morgan etc and DTCC would be complicit in the naked shorting This in turn raises the thought experiment that they would be incentivized to do anything possible to prevent the short squeeze from happening on 1 28 because had the short squeeze happened the shorts would go bankrupt and their Prime Brokers who lent them their naked shorted shares would need to cover the shares This would not only represent a humongous capital expense for Prime Brokers the culpability of Prime Brokers and that of the DTCC in this situation would also have likely been exposed as well A quick primer on what a Prime Broker is Prime Brokers are essentially the service side of the short selling business They lend out securities and cash you can think of them as the house in a casino They provide a gambler with markers to play and to manage his winnings According to Matt Taibi Under the original concept if a hedge fund that wanted to short a stock they would first need to locate the stock with his Prime Broker but as time passed Prime Brokers increasingly allowed their hedge fund customers to use automated systems and locate the stock themselves and what this does is enable short sellers to sell stock without delivering and thereby perform naked shorts with counterfeit shares source https web archive

one swoop of the pen the DTCC shut down buy side momentum but strangely allowed selling Retail investors were shut out of the market and as any student of microeconomics would know by shutting buy but only allowing sell the price is bound to fall Meanwhile while hedge funds were able to keep trading not only in the market but also crosstrade in the dark pools https www reddit com r stocks comments lghhkv gamestop institutional broker trades off the private stock markets that retail is shut out of more on this later and use this crucial lifeline given to them by the DTCC to prevent the squeeze from happening that day With retail abruptly being shut out from buy even cash accounts were shut out which didn t make sense and only allowed to sell almost everyone could smell manipulation was afoot which triggered the Congress hearing and the most of the blame was pointed at Robinhood Personally and in hindsight I believe Robinhood was just a willing scapegoat When we think about who had the most to lose if a short squeeze occurred I ll narrow it down to three entities Shorts and their stakeholders ie Citadel Prime Brokers and the DTCC It s important to remember that the actual impetus that triggered the shutdown of the market for retail investors came from the DTCC Working backwards if you consider that GME was rampantly naked shorted and DTCC and Prime Brokers would have to be complicit in it I believe the DTCC Primer Brokers and possibly Citadel who provides 40 of Robinhood s revenue brazenly manipulated the market on 1 28 by shutting down purchasing for retail buyers to prevent the squeeze from being squoze on that day as doing so would be catastrophic for all aforementioned parties involved I believe that on the upcoming Gamestop Congress hearings the Financial Services Committee needs to call on decision makers of DTCC and Prime Brokers explore their role and complicity in the shut out of retail buyers that day as well as being enablers of naked shorting in GME An interesting thought experiment On 1 28 when the price was 450 and shorts were likely under 100 if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME then when the squeeze was about to happen or happening if Prime Brokers had margin had called the shorts they would presumably also also gone down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag By that logic they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call and instead the most logical option would probably would have been to make a backroom deal which is what I personally think most likely happened If you ve read up to this point you might be thinking what can I do about this I am aware that there a lot of cynicism that we can t do anything that there will be no justice for retail investors who were harmed this situation and that institutions and people in power will prevent anything from being done I feel this sometimes too but remember A single voice can be drowned out but if we all speak together then we will make our voice heard Ape Strong Together With the hearing coming up on February 18th I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing as well as your own district representatives and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing l They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares failed to deliver their complicity in naked shorting and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1 28 Below are 4

Financial Services Committee here to reach out to https financialservices house gov about committee membership htm https financialservices house gov about committee membership htm What follows should probably be a separate post but I will take the opportunity to summarize some of the illegal tactics that shorts have been identified to be using in their war with retail investors Note that this may not be an exhaustive list and there may be newer tactics deployed in the future Retail investors might not have the same tricks resources and willingness to break the law for profit as hedgies do but my hope and belief is that if we pool our knowledge and analysis we will figure out their game and effectively adapt Feel free to forward the list below to any representatives and lawmakers if you concur that these tactics were used Rampant Naked Shorting With the extremely high number of Fail to Delivers FTID http www wherearetheshares com short interest being as high as 226 recently https imgur com fN4fVQl and institutions alone holding a staggering 177 of the total float https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments le235t gme institutions hold 177 of float why the likely due in large part to counterfeit shares signs strongly point to GME being rampant with naked shorts and counterfeit shares I believe the original goal of shorts was to drive GME to bankruptcy with these naked shorts using the laddering of naked shorts https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lf4vn3 yes laddering is real short ladder attack is just aka short ladder attack executed with the help of counterfeit stock which is a classic and reliable method of driving down the stock price I believe the GME stock has seen relentlessly aggressive short attacks especially on the week of Monday February 1st which drove the stock price down and triggered panic selling Masking Shorts with by Shorting ETFs that hold GME Can t link due to WSB will put in comments Ladder Attacks with the help of Dark Pools Another identified method of ladder attacks was identified to come from crosstrading with darkpools the stock market has its own private stock exchange where institutions can trade https www reddit com r stocks comments lghhkv gamestop institutional broker trades off the Essentially darkpools are private stock markets retail investors do not have access to where short side funds can purchase securities off market and then sell on market with the effect of creating a lot more downward pressure on the market without the upward pressure from buying Illegally masking shorts with synthetic longs Another tactic shorts are suspected of using in GME is the use of illegally using options to evade short positions in violation of Reg SHO which SEC describes in this risk alert https www sec gov news press release 2013 151 and which I elaborate in this post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments leorks evidence points to gme shorts not having covered Essentially it s the use of using options to create synthetic longs to illegally and artificially cover and prolong short positions and at same time obscuring the true short interest If you consider that it would be far more profitable for shorts to not cover at high prices but instead ladder attack the price and wait for retail investors to lose interest and close their shorts at as low of a price as possible then you can see why this strategy would be very effective Using way out of money call options to obscure true short interest You may have heard about the 43 million worth of 800 dollar calls purchased when the price was 100 and found it odd Later it was identified as a tactic to cheaply purchase synthetic call options since at 800 its way out of money to obscure their short positions with the added benefit of hedging at 800 if a squeeze does happen One thing I want to note particularly to legislators at the GameStop hearing Retail investors were not incited to pump GME Retail investors spotted a unique Short Squeeze opportunity created by the greed of short side hedge funds whereby GameStop was being abusively naked shorted with the goal of bringing it to bankruptcy and hedge funds were so greedy about it that they shorted the company with a short interest of 226 of float meaning A LOT of counterfeit shares were being used to short the company Retail investors saw this as an opportunity to short squeeze the hedge fund shorters which is a legal and legitimate investment strategy The short squeeze would have happened had everyone played fair but instead financial institutions who were culpable to the naked shorting intervened and shut down retail buying hurting the retail investors and successfully manipulating the market The investment itself was in my opinion a sound decision based on the short squeeze but in hindsight retail investors did not seriously consider the risk of the market would be blatantly and publicly manipulated and that the market would be rigged against them If this post was useful and I hope it was Gave up my Friday night to write this for you Apes please upvote for visibility and share it far and wide The GameStop hearings could be a first step and hope towards legislative change and it s extremely important that the right story is told at those hearings and by the right story I mean the real truth of what happened I hope the truly culpable parties are investigated and brought to justice Again I know many of us feel cynical that anything meaning will be done towards finding justice against the lawbreakers in this case but if you feel even an ounce of injustice or empathy at how retail investors were unfairly harmed in the course of investing in GME I strongly urge you to contact a legislator associated with the GameStop hearings and bring this to their attention so they can review this case with more complete information In addition I recommend you to contact the SEC and any journalist you know or via journalist tip lines It s not going to be easy but the more awareness we raise the higher the likelihood our voices will be heard and positive change will be made Ps If you ve read to the end I ll leave you with a few more thoughts and reminders If I were to distill life into one thing it would be to never lose hope Remember that if you ve lost money in any way shape or form don t be depressed money can always be made back and the important thing is to maintain a good attitude Only invest what you can afford to lose Perhaps the most important factor in good investing is patience If you d like to read more about

real life ongoing story about a man gourds and redemption His conviction may have completely emptied his bank account and replaced his life savings with a living room adorned with ornamental gourds but its his resilience and perseverance that will tell the final chapter of this tale A Redditor I ve come to deeply respect we ll call him Jenks confided in me He told me he recently bought a breakfast sandwich for 4 and that purchase constituted roughly 5 of his net worth It s well known here that following his ambitious foray into botanical futures he almost lost it all What s not well known is that with the few thousand dollars Jenks had left he bet it all on black baby And when I say black I mean rhodium Jenks purchased what he believed would be his comeback story during the recent rhodium surge After having spent his final 4 000 he received his newly procured piece of metal in the mail via DHL He began immediately shopping for a 10 x 10 water bed He knew this rhodium play was going to catapult him into exponential wealth building mode But just like Jenks didn t know gourds he didn t know rocks either As it turns out after having his newly acquired metal examined by a local expert it was quickly confirmed that Jenks rocket ship to the stars was actually just a worthless cube of pyrite First he d been gourded and now he d been rocked Between bites of his 4 bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel breakfast sandwich Jenks told me the details of his recent misfortunes Astounded and still uncertain whether this man was simply just a world class troll or a true visionary experiencing a streak of bad luck I was determined to find out So I went to the source to find proof Jenks hometown was gourdgeous Jenks insisted that the gourds lining every interior wall of his apartment were just the beginning and that I d find thousands of additional ornamental gourds at a specific section of the Arkansas River ones he placed there himself I followed his directions and when I got there I couldn t believe my eyes It was true There were probably 2 000 3 000 of them It was an El Dorado of gourds An El Gourdado Jenks pyrite rock now sits at the bottom of the Arkansas River below even his gourds that lay alongside it Each day Jenks tries to carve and dry out a single gourd in order to tap into the Brazilian flute market When he posed this business idea on r gourds he was laughed out of the room One user exclaimed Oh my gourd What a fantastic idea And if the flute idea doesn t work out you can always recoup your money blowing other things Jenks was now being ridiculed by even the gourd community His punishment for believing in gourds has been unrelenting You could go so far as to say this man has been abused by gourds His least favorite fruit vegetable more on that on Earth lines every wall of his apartment serving as a constant reminder of his failures I reached out to Jenks because I respected the guts it took to go all in on gourds and truthfully I also know a guy who works at pool store who could make his 10 x 10 waterbed a reality using high quality above ground pool liner But I was fascinated by Jenks thinking All of it All the thoughts From the gourd YOLO to the rhodium physical asset play to even his yearning to read books about bees during his next flight I empathize with Jenks You see I know what it s like to lose it all I did some time in prison for armed robbery during a feud with an adversarial party I also did some additional time for two violent crimes while incarcerated Anyhow I got released this past summer Upon getting released I got a temporary job working alongside seasonal migrant workers It was on a large farm growing and harvesting you guessed it ornamental gourds This is where my story intertwines with Jenks After receiving almost no income for several years while in jail for obvious reasons I began my deep dive into personal investing and like any recently released inmate I went first to Reddit I feverishly scoured its investing subreddits particularly WSB Deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole I went until I found Jenks and his bullish gourd stance As someone who extracted these wonders from the earth for multiple months I considered myself somewhat of an expert on the topic As they say invest in what you know So I too briefly considered gourd futures I know gourds but I was aware of something Jenks sadly was not I was too late to help Jenks avoid financial ruin as he had already achieved that but nevertheless I tried to elucidate the real conundrum surrounding gourds Gourds are culinarily speaking considered vegetables but botanically are actually classified as fruits These contrasting views have created two very polarized groups the botanical bears and the culinary bulls To top it off in recent years the South American flute market has recently begun embracing synthetic plastic flutes over the traditional cured gourd flutes I explained to Jenks that all of this clearly should have spelt significant trouble for him and his 17 500 lifetime savings YOLO investment into the extremely fragile gourd market He completely overlooked the the botanical bears Too little too late the damage had been done As a gourd man myself this was crushing Here was a man who bet on gourds only to suffer utter financial catastrophe or did he In my reasoning with Jenks I discovered that gourds nor rhodium would be his final hurrah Jenks currently has 80 left to his name but he has something far more valuable his resiliency Like the gourd Jenks is a fighter If you think about it in many ways gourds are not unlike the folks here on WSB They haven t even a sliver of intelligence they re not particularly attractive rarely useful and they don t seem to die The offer absolutely nothing but they steadfastly continue to exist In fact gourds typically outlast all other botanical species because of their sheer uselessness and utter inutility Gourds can sustain themselves for many months after less resilient fruits and vegetables have long since perished Families don t need them per se but during the Fall holidays gourds are present and they improve the ambience with their odd unique appearance if only for a moment before the guests move on to more important things But the gourd is present nonetheless Sure the gourd may remain outside in the cold on the front step of his residence Some years he ll get a seat at the table just to watch if he s lucky Everyone knows he s not a particularly satisfying vegetable but if the gourd is lucky enough to get a seat at the table he sits there approvingly knowing his wife and each and every one of her guests are fully satiated by his wife s boyfriend s delicious eggplant parmesan I asked Jenks outright do you have any other investment strategies or do you own any other stocks that still have the potential to moon He answered Yes I do have 500 shares of this stock SGAMY that my Grandma purchased for me in 2004 It was at about 6 a share back then I think it s about 4 a share now Do you remember SEGA They were supposed to revolutionize gaming I was floored Do I remember SEGA Genesis does what Nintendon t baby I logged thousands of hours playing all the Sonics Streets of Rage Street Fighter II Shinobi Contra Earthworm Jim NHL 94 etc on the Genesis The Saturn wasn t awesome but the Dreamcast was WAY ahead of its time It was the first console to offer online gaming back when PlayStation One was only messing around with polygonal graphics and Microsoft was still blowing its loads into the toilet and hadn t even conceived the thought of the XBOX yet The Dreamcast was HUGE when I went into prison the first time and I was shocked to see how far Sega had fallen from grace upon being released years later Sega has managed to survive but its a remnant of what it once was Sega deserved better Sega deserves better Jenks grandma has long been put in the ground but she s given him an opportunity to make himself whole from the grave All SGAMY needs to do is go 50X and Jenks will be an instant hundred thousandaire If and when SGAMY moons Jenks is getting that custom waterbed I guarantee it All it would take for this to happen is a group of retarded useless gourds to rise up There are 3 000 of them sitting by the river near Jenks place but there are 9 1 MILLION of them right here on WSB I contend that in order to get two or even three birds stoned at once there is only one logical conclusion YOLO everything you have into SGAMY and buy a homemade gourd flute from Jenks with the tendies Gourds everywhere persevere Jenks becomes a hundred thousandaire and Sega is inspired to come out with a new console for 2022 Edit Can you imagine a current Super Star like Jim Carrey playing Dr Robotnik in a new Sonic movie It would be an instant classic la The Mask

from tomorrow s planned congressional hearing from Gabe Plotkin aka Melvin that captured how screwed he really is 1 I want to make clear at the outset that Melvin Capital played absolutely no role in those trading platforms decisions In fact Melvin closed out all of its positions in GameStop days before platforms put those limitations in place Like you we learned about those limits from news reports This first quote is worrisome Why do you ask The timeline doesnt make sense We woke up on January 27 around 6AM to see reports solely from CNBC that Melvin closed supposedly closed its short position You re telling me Melvin closed shorts either after hours on January 26 or early hours January 27 and the first thing he did was telephone reporters from a known shill network to tell them about it at 6AM If he did close why would he care to report it to the world Why didnt he appear in an interview to make it official if he cares so much that would air it across America Oh right cause he didn t close and has a lot less to lose by lying I suppose It s also a lot easier to lie later on and deny a phone call instead of a video as we discover now SI is actually being occulted by ETFs Gotchya were already beginning to see how credible source of truth slimeball Lyin Gabe is amp x200B 2 I also want to make clear at the outset that contrary to many reports Melvin Capital was not bailed out in the midst of these events Citadel proactively reached out to become a new investor similar to the investments others make in our fund Right Why would his mentor Steve Cohen from Citadel give him a cash infusion otherwise when Melvin was bleeding We were losing money but we had more money to burn They wanted to be active investors when we were getting railed Im a retard but even I cant buy that Usually investors are attracted when a firm is making money not losing it to a bunch of retards spamming amp x200B 3 I am here testifying today far removed from my background I grew up in a middle class family in Portland Maine I went to a public high school I studied hard and got into a good college Upon graduation I did not have a job Today I am married with four children and my time is spent with my family and on Melvin Capital which I founded six years ago I named Melvin after my grandfather who ran a convenience store I wanted the firm to represent his values integrity hard work Classic an attempt to win compassion If Melvin actually represents integrity hard work why would you short an All American company to put 40K employees out of work buster This seems fishy and I dont buy that Lyin Gabe is a good guy who symbolizes integrity Also it was reported on Twitter https twitter com emerald62676529 status 1355906783462662147 https twitter com emerald62676529 status 1355906783462662147 that Plotkin s wife filed for divorce Why say he s still married More lying I suppose nothing new amp x200B 4 Specific to GameStop we had a research supported view well before the recent events In fact we had been short GameStop since Melvin s inception six years earlier In other words Lyin Gabe was sitting on an infinite money glitch since 2015 and was so far up his own ass in greed he shorted a company to 140 Well time to pay the piper Infinite money glitched dont last forever amp x200B 5 In January 2021 a group on Reddit began to make posts about Melvin s specific investments Many of these posts were laced with antisemitic slurs directed at me and others The posts said things like it s very clear we need a second holocaust the jews can t keep getting away with this Others sent similarly profane and racist text messages to me The above quote is completely false and quite frankly I m disgusted he d stoop that low in a lie I ve been in on GME since December and cant recall a single post that contained an antisemetic slur directed at Plotkin Hell we didnt even know what ethnicity he was Were also too retarded to know his family name is Jewish ANY post that is racist in nature here would get down voted to oblivion Were retards sure but definitely not racists or anti semites Sorry Lyin Gabe try again amp x200B 6 The unfortunate part of this episode is that ordinary investors who were convinced by a misleading frenzy to buy GameStop at 100 200 or even 483 have now lost significant amounts Awww reading this gave me a fuzzy feeling inside He really cares about us retards losing our money guys Thats so nice of him Except the fact that nobody loses until they sell and I m personally not selling so I didnt lose amp x200B 7 I am personally humbled by what happened in January Investors in Melvin suffered significant losses It is now our job to earn it back As much as I d like to believe Gabe will earn back what he lost with honest hard work we cant believe it after all this lying It seems Lyin Gabe just took a sneaky approach to try and earn it back using shady ETF techniques that can be read about elsewhere amp x200B TLDR Dont trust Gabe He s not a good guy and lies too much Lyin Gabe lies to try and get monkeys to throw away bananas Monkeys like and keep bananas To Alpha Centauri amp x200B Source https docs house gov

the leading technology provider to the global travel industry Sabre s software data mobile and distribution solutions are used by hundreds of airlines and thousands of hotel properties to manage critical operations including passenger and guest reservations revenue management flight network and crew management Sabre also operates a leading global travel marketplace which processes more than 120 billion of global travel spend annually by connecting travel buyers and suppliers Historically Sabre s airline operations booking management and hospitality solutions platforms have been stalwart producers of revenue and profits However with the airline industry crushed by pandemic related travel restrictions Sabre saw its own business prospects sink dramatically Sales plunged 92 in the second quarter of 2020 with losses in the first nine months of the year adding up to more than 965 million Yet Sabre is positioning itself for a bounce in airline and travel activity Late last year the company partnered with Google to launch the artificial intelligence driven Sabre Travel AI platform https www fool com investing 2020 10 22 why shares of sabre are soaring today Sabre and Google intend for the platform to offer customers personalized content to boost margins As investors see that Sabre can put the past behind it and return toward a more sustainable growth trajectory the stock

when travel recovers While everyone in the industry has been getting their teeth kicked in Sabre has been expanding their network and modernizing their business They have been upgrading their infrastructure forming thousands of new partnership deals streamlining their workforce and cutting costs Pre Covid SABR was trading for around 23 share it is currently at 12 share with a 4 billion market cap and I believe is positioned to bounce back higher than its pre covid numbers SABR has been able to make strategic partnerships and is better positioned to withstand and recover than its competitors Vaccinations are rolling out around the globe and I believe there is pent up demand for people wanting to get out and travel There is significant short interest and I believe that SABR is positioned to recover BEFORE the rest of the travel industry as they are actively growing their network and client base and have added 2 100 new clients this quarter Short interest is at 21 39 as of

article that came out recently is calls for more regulations over clearings houses and blaming them for the restrictions but in trades recently THIS IS FALSE Please read and share This is our one chance to force congress to fix the rigged markets The agencies that regulate the markets Brokers the SEC Market makers the NASB Cleaning houses doesn t matter Hedge Funds FINRA What I learned from Google A Market makers role in the markets has changed over the years But their main purpose is to provide liquify to the market So they are there to buy what wants to be sold and sell what wants to be bought They set the bit and ask prices and control the spread between them This is how they make money and is justified by the amount of risk they take on Therefore they have ZERO fiduciary responsibility and not required to operate with the investor s best interest like brokers are So they can definitely manipulate the price of a stock Two other things MM do blew my fucking mind and set sirens and alarms off in head This was the first what the fucking fuck moment MM also provide some liquify to the options market And they are allowed to manage their inventory I honestly don t know which one is worse If this isn t perfect storm situation to guarantee fraud I don t know what is I almost forgot and this part They are allowed to buy and sell from their own inventory to make a profit also Lol Smfh so they can easily tank a stocks price or make people think there is more activity than there really is Probably no manipulation here though more likely to find people manipulating markets on Reddit Clearing houses take on no risks They will only accept trades that offset due to the time it takes settle This would support the argument that market makers do have a purpose in our markets They take on the risk to provide liquidity and why they are allowed to make money from the spread in the buy and the ask price When I googled hedge funds I had another what the fucking fuck moment Hedge funds invest in riskier investments shorting stocks and derivatives What blew my mind is they have no reporting obligation to anyone on how they make money It could be a madoff Ponzi scheme and no disclosure Remember vladfag making multiple comments when he wasn t even asked saying no relationship between citadel and robinhood Of course one doesn t own the other That would be illegal They def had relationship maybe it s not the hedge fund citadel but the market maker citadel is routed a majority of robinhood s trade I heard him mention multiple times and was never asked once so it seemed sketch So meeting with congress tomorrow DFV Reddit CEO Robinhood douche Citadel HF Melvin Capital HF Who s not required to go talk to congress to answer questions Market makers Cleaning houses 1 unless it s to defend DFV wtf information is Reddit ceo going to provide to congress to help them understand what happened in markets 2 if clearing houses are to blame or and need more regulations why the fuck are they attending or asked to explain any details Bc vlad explained it so clearly 3 DID EVERYONE FORGET ABOUT THE MARKET MAKER If MM take on the risk and are there to sell what wants to be sold and buy what wants to be purchase where the fuck were they for GameStop Yes a clearing house has a reserve requirement but robinhood also restricted instant deposit limits that week and max instant deposit you could use to trade was 1000 So the restrictions were should have nothing to do with trading activity bc MM take on the risk You can t have margin on a 1k account I know this bc I had two diff clients mention it They weren t trying to get in on the action after trades were restricted It doesn t make sense reserve reserve req being raised That s what MM are for So they can just abandon their position in making markets operate smoothly and no recourse They don t even take the blame for any of it And no one mentions them once Seems like they are trying to protect or shield the MMs I learned the broker that dicked me last week td do not use see recent lawsuit same thing happened last week but they got sloppy as fuck and what started me looking into this bc I wanted to know who exactly was fuckingg me works with a single MM so I decided to Google who what MM robinhood uses Apparently this is how they offer free trading They route trades to whoever pays more But the majority of them go through citadel market maker Another what the fucking fuck moment So there is a citadel hedge fund and a citadel market maker They might be legally two separate entities but they def comMunicate One invests in only derivatives and short stocks And the other one makes the market and is allowed to accumulate inventory of stock That doesn t seem right or just doesn t sit well Who could make a killing off on options if you had a connection with someone who is legally allowed to manipulate stock price So to circle back to the beginning and who regulates each Brokers the SEC Market makers the NASB Cleaning houses doesn t matter Hedge Funds FINRA SEC is a government organization and has oversight on brokers FINRA is a for profit corporation And NASB who has oversight on the real market manipulators is a self regulated oversight board Who trusts this oversight My last what the fuxking fuck moment Who the fuck would think this is an effective way to regulate free markets How has this been allowed still and it s 2021 The reason retail investors will always be fucked It s like the institutions at the forefront shield the people behind the scenes and manipulate the markets and tied to the hedge funds who don t have to report how they make money to anyone The reason nothing has ever been done about it money influences politics One side more than the other The SEC investigated this almost 30 years ago and issued a report on their finding which market makers sucks dick pretty much The self reg oversight promised to do better this was before computer system like we have now And why trades are directed to or should be directed to best available price on market Lol td actually didn t this recently and it threw me off so bad because price was a lot less than what I entered to pay I was so confused Market makers serve no purpose in markets except otc They provide no benefit not even 30 years ago They can t be relied on to do their job and provide liquify They clearly work with both the hedge funds and brokers in abusive transactions to fuckk retail investors They actually don t even take on the risk bc they operate with almost no money Their sole purpose is to rigged the markets Blank restricted fm wsb has liquidity without the need MM The SEC is there to protect investors But doesn t have authority over who creates the unfair advantage in the markets Make congress act

business mediatek taps tsmc 6 nanometer tech for new flagship 5g phone chips 14001724 I had been living in Taiwan for the past 3 years one thing i noticed is Taiwanese people are very heavily influenced by the US I also believe the relationship between Taiwan and China have put Taiwan into a position where it semi depends on the US With China s economy booming the US did not want to give up their baby TSM They banned TSM from making HiSilicon chips for Huawei I wonder why TSM also announced they are spending 28 billion in capex to hopefully expand and meet the demand A plant in Arizona should also help the American companies who rely on TSM heavily Being my first post any feedback would be much appreciated Also thanks to u jamseh https www reddit com u jamseh for sharing his

Discussion amp x200B ASSUMING that there are still roughly 1 77 shareholders for every share of GME IF the correct game theory solution could be distributed to the vast majority of the retards and IF the retards believed in this solution and IF the retards trusted their fellow retards to not initiate a scorpion frog scenario all big ifs THEN the correct game theory solution for the GME shareholders in my opinion is for the shareholders to simply retain ownership of their GME shares in the event of a short squeeze In the event of a mass market selloff during or after a squeeze share price collapses to roughly current value and there are bagholders who didn t sell in time to benefit In the event that enough shareholders believe that the best plan for both themselves and their fellow retards is to simply retain ownership THE RETARDS CAN HAVE THEIR TENDIES AND EAT THEM TOO Hypothetically let s say there is a squeeze Say the owners of 70 000 000 shares decide to diamond hand ie not sell Not at any price Not even for a million billion dollars a share they just like the stock Furthermore say that the owners of these 70 000 000 shares systematically remove permission to lend these shares ie no shares held in margin accounts Eventually after failing to deliver for a couple weeks the regulations require the shorts to purchase the next shares which come on the market no matter the price Under these conditions a few shares can make the price skyrocket using limit sales even with brokers like Fidelity who restrict limit sales to 50 more than current trading price Typing 50 x 1 5 18 into my calculator reveals the following if no one else was selling and the shorts were buying because they legally had no other option just 18 shares sold one at a time each for 50 more than the last would raise the price from 50 per share to 73 894 59 per share Selling an additional 18 shares each at 50 more than the last would further raise the price to 109 208 220 45 per share amp x200B Which brings me to my point At that price level knowing that a mass market selloff will eventually lead to a collapse in share value why would the shareholders sell Because it is in our nature to be retarded Why not simply stop trading but continue to value the shares at the price at which they have been traded Why not pay the 100 fee to have a share put into your own name then walk into any bank and put the share which is your property down as collateral and open up a line of credit against that collateral Boom Haven t sold shit except the 36 shares it took to get the price up to ludicrous speed and now every single diamond handed shareholder can open up a line of credit for 100 000 000 00 amp x200B Of course this would mean that Gamestop shareholders would essentially own the world Personally I d rather have a bunch of retards I use that term in the best possible way whose main qualification is that they have proven that they love each other more than they love money owning the world than our current situation which is a bunch of idiots seriously the wealthy people who borrowed more shares than even exist and sold those shares into the market with the promise that they would buy them back in the future at market price should have known that their promise in and of itself could affect future market price regardless of how it turns out they re actual idiots or worse and ditto for the people who allowed the idiots to do it on their watch knowing that they too could be left holding the bag owning the world who evidently love money and hate their fellow man amp x200B If the events described above were to happen the board of Gamestop would suddenly become how do I say this important The board would be as financially important as the short hedge funds and their insurance companies and the DTCC because these are the entities we are robbing through entirely legal means ie via simple recognition of the true value of ownership of GME stock after rich idiots sold shares they didn t own in exchange for a promise to repay the value of those shares at a later date presumably as long as the shorts haven t covered owning GME can potentially be as valuable as the idiots are rich plus the value of the idiots who insured the idiots plus the value of the DTCC who are on the hook after the OG idiots go broke plus I think there s a chance that the GME share price won t collapse after the squeeze because the squeeze will not end that instead the squeeze will cause the stock to undergo the equivalent of a phase shift from liquid to solid a diamond hand configuration if you will resulting in long term stable value even for shareholders who decide not to sell Equally important that the members of this newly important Gamestop board be worthy of their position As in they should be the sort of people who would feed the hungry and clothe the poor and give them work and generally follow the golden rule For this reason I would recommend that the shareholders vote that the members of the board be required to become desciples of the kingdom of heaven in order to maintain their position on the board meaning that they audio record the entirety of their lives and after a delay of no more than one year for security purposes release these audio recordings to the public That way to the extent that we actually care we can know who our leaders are and we the shareholders can vote them off the board if we deem it necessary See Matthew 13 52 and Matthew 5 13 15 for more information amp x200B Also for what it s worth I recognize that in order for the owners of 70 000 000 shares to actually decide upon this course of action the retards would first need to know that choosing to retain ownership of their GME share s in the event of a short squeeze is in fact one of their available choices The retards would then be equipped to weigh the risks and benefits of all possible decisions regarding the disposition of their GME share s according to their own understanding namely sell scorpion or hold frog arrive at a decision independently and act accordingly To that end I hereby give permission for anyone to reproduce this post for any purpose whatsoever so long as the content remains unaltered and credit is attributed to u FleetAdmiralPicardo amp x200B Edit Please pardon my french Additionally if anyone is not familiar with a scorpion frog scenario here is the synopsis from wikipedia amp x200B A scorpion wants to cross a river but cannot swim so it asks a frog to carry it across The frog hesitates afraid that the scorpion might sting but the scorpion argues that if it did that they would both drown The frog considers this argument sensible and agrees to transport the scorpion The frog lets the scorpion climb on its back and then begins to swim Midway across the river the scorpion stings the frog anyway dooming them both The dying frog asks the scorpion why it stung despite knowing the consequence to which the scorpion replies I couldn t help it It s in my nature

1747,lmn4zd,t2_79edk,1613656022,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmn4zd/prom_a_sleeping_giant/,1, PROM A Sleeping Giant ,Strap in WSB my first DD TLDR at the bottom I ve been studying value investing for a while now and I recently found a stock screener that allows me to screen based on earnings history and other value metrics This is opposed to most stock screeners which are concerned only with the historical price of the stock and trends Propel Media came up on my stock screener as it met a few of the value metrics I had selected I checked out the fundamentals and they had a lukewarm revenue trend that had some recent quarterly increases and decent margins They are in the advertising business trying to market DSP demand side platforms to companies that want to advertise their brands These pieces of software allow advertisers to bid for ad space on websites and streaming services that the DSP company is affiliated with This is a busy industry with a number of competitors so Propel Media by itself looks decent but doesn t particularly stand out as having a competitive advantage economic moat This is far from the type of company that you would jump to buy I then realized that all of the data I had been looking through stopped in 2018 The stock screener didn t notice the missing data and simply reported the most recent data You would think that shouldn t happen and usually it would not except that this stock was still available to purchase shares I checked the chart and noticed that something happened in June 2018 to cause a selloff I looked through the SEC filings and noticed the company filed to de register their stock and looked deeper and eventually found a footnote stating that the business was unsure of the future of its core business model as Google had come out with news that it was changing the way Chrome browser extensions worked Its old model was to have a popup on the website and if the user clicked yes it would install the Chrome extension automatically The new change would force the user to go to the Chrome Web Store to download all extensions If this was a heavily leveraged mechanic then it would not bode well for the company as users have little incentive to go install an extension that shows them ads You can find all of the relevant info here on EDGAR https www sec gov cgi bin viewer action view amp cik 1622822 amp accession

stock because it would make no sense to continue research at that point until I noticed something in the SEC filings In 2017 Propel Media purchased a 100 equity stake in another company called DeepIntent Just for completion sake I googled DeepIntent and what I found was actually quite interesting Here are a series of articles about DeepIntent https www prnewswire com news releases

advertising spending is increasingly shifting towards CTV Streaming services and digital budgets rather than traditional on the ground operations To clarify what CTV is connected TV it basically refers to streaming services like Hulu Netflix Disney etc So basically if the cord cutting trend continues as it has during the pandemic CTV is taking off right now with an 81 increase since March

tv usage remains above pre covid 19 levels as traditional tv viewing normalizes If you re wondering how much pharmaceutical companies spend on advertising its a lot I m a physician and I have seen firsthand what regulation has done to pharmaceutical and device manufacturer s ability to reach and influence clinicians and advertise their product It is no surprise to me that they are embracing the digital market DeepIntent s CEO is educated in the technology itself and seems to be keeping his company at the frontier of innovation in the industry He even writes a column for Forbes https profiles

43f0 490d b044 084a54107d49 Given the large number of partnerships with pharmaceutical companies Novartis GlaxoSmithKline Bayer AstraZeneca among others articles suggesting 300 multi year over year growth and a very involved educated and likeable CEO the company looks like it actually has a future If you look through the DeepIntent website there is no mention of Propel Media There is no investor relations page or any hint that they are looking to attract shareholders This could represent a strategy rather than an oversight When a company s stock falls on its face it has some new options available One of the strategies is for the company to go dark Certainly not a bad idea if you regret an IPO or regret the timing of the IPO Going dark involves terminating the requirement to file reports to the SEC You can allow the stock to trade on the OTC markets in the pink sheets where it will forever remain in a state of thinly traded limbo until something bad happens bankruptcy or something good happens that incentivizes the company to graduate back to its former glory Propel filed to terminate their filing obligations under Rule 12g4 a 1 https www law cornell edu cfr text 17 240 12g 4 https www law cornell edu cfr text 17 240 12g 4 The benefit of going dark is that the company is no longer required to pay the very high 1 3 million cost of maintaining SEC filings and other documentation required of a publicly traded company For a stock that has tanked but has potential for recovery saving that extra cash is a no brainer We don t have any earnings reports for DeepIntent or Propel Media from beyond mid 2018 so it is difficult to extrapolate the financial position of the company The last signs we have are that they were making excellent headway into paying down their long term debt 80 million down to 44 million within a couple of years and that the subsidiary DeepIntent has experienced year over year revenue increases according to news reports We can also see that DeepIntent is a serious new player boasting disruptive tech in a niche market that other advertisers are afraid to touch because of HIPAA of course Propel Media itself seems to be maintaining and even growing its operations if you check out their social media pages TLDR The last information that served to establish the current price of the PROM Propel Media stock is almost 3 years old There is recent public information buried as it seems to be that suggests that it s 100 owned subsidiary DeepIntent is emerging as a big and potentially the dominant player in the growing pharmaceutical advertising industry

kerfuffle,By now I m assuming everyone has seen this post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lmagzp today interactive brokers ceo admits that without where the CEO of Interactive Brokers admits that without stopping people from buying GME stock the price of shares would have skyrocketed because those shares were practically impossible to find To call back those shares that had been loaned out would have skyrocketed the share price to somewhere past Andromeda thousand s of dollars and the additional buying pressure from brokers being forced to purchase shares that they had sold and could not get back would have increased the pressure So how did we get to this point read this to know what happened 1 GME short interest was obscene There were far far more shares shorted than were in the float In fact it would not be entirely inappropriate to say that there were practically INFINITELY MORE shares shorted than in the float assuming the numbers were accurate at the time because Institutional ownership was OVER 100 amp x200B Source for 2 https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments ll68pc the sec just posted the new numbers for failure 2 From Jan 19th to Jan 21st each day had over 1M fails to deliver on the record If we take Jan 19th as our example it means that two trading days previously Jan 14th over 1M shares were sold but not actually located delivered This however is a cumulative number So it doesn t mean that each day had 1M shares that could not be located but that the total number on that day was 1M Somehow those fails to deliver were resolved by Jan 22nd without significant increases in closing price likely because enough shares were sold that the people who needed those shares to deliver could buy them slowly and not drive up price or there was a back channel deal made amp x200B 3 On Jan 26th and 27th each day had over 2M fails to deliver on the record In other words on January 26th over 2M shares sold two trading days earlier COULD NOT BE LOCATED DELIVERED The closing price on January 26th was 150 share so at that time 300M in shares would ve needed to be bought to cover On January 27th GME opened at 250 share and rapidly rose to peak at over 420 share until it closed at 350 share At the EOD on January 27th over 1 95M shares were in a failed to deliver status That means that over 680M in shares would ve needed to be bought to cover sales THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE And those fails were from at least two trading days previous the volume on the 25th and 26th was enormous would have made it likely worse amp x200B 4 In the wee hours of January 28th the clearing houses which can see this data live because they re the ones working to find these shares realized that this was a HUGE PROBLEM They could not find these shares and as buying pressure increased it would drive price up while simultaneously making shares harder and harder to find They knew that in order to deliver these shares brokers would have to call in their shares from shorters price would go through the roof and many of those shorters and possibly the brokers that were irresponsible enough to assume the burden of the potential infinite losses of their clients would go bankrupt To prevent this bankruptcy chain from reaching the clearinghouses which DID NOT act irresponsibly those clearinghouses required that brokers MASSIVELY INCREASE THE CASH PAID TO THE CLEARINGHOUSES in order to hedge against this potential problem They only need to give this cash if they continue to allow BUYING because it s only BUYING that forces a cash deposit with the clearinghouse until the transaction is cleared hence the word For some brokers ex likely Robinhood it s possible that they literally couldn t afford the necessary cash to hedge For other larger brokers ex likely Merrill etc their risk management told them that it wasn t worth the money that any fallout or fine would be less than the potential loss if these brokers were actually forced to cover for shorters amp x200B So now what the rest is my opinion on the future Now that brokers have shown that they will allow irresponsible and ridiculous levels of shorting but will NOT assume the inherent infinite risk of shorting and will shut down the free market to prevent the losses of their clients from affecting them this is why shorting has fees because there IS RISK TO THE BROKER if you default what should have happened should happen next time What follows is entirely my opinion What preceded was heavily predicated in facts with a touch of opinionated states 1 What I think should have happened Much as I hate to say it in this kind of runaway train scenario the SEC should have stepped in and halted trading of the stock for 30 days I know we all hate halts but infinite losses cause infinite problems more on that later If the runaway train was clear to the brokers and the clearinghouses the SEC should have also been aware I think they should have chosen a price ceiling at some point during this fiasco probably before the addition of 800 strike options say maximum strike price 50 a relatively low price compared to what could have been They should have then forced every short to cover at that higher price or perhaps at a sliding scale price based on the actual number of shorts bought all shares that were held by investors for a slightly lower price say maximum strike price 20 then paid out the call options for any strike prices added to the board in January or after Jan 15th or some other date when the squeeze started with the remainder based on the maximum strike price 20 or more if the premiums were higher Essentially I believe they should have done their damnedest to make the shorts pay a high but not exorbitant price to allow them to reset the board The options portion of that would have been a complicated mess but someone could have found a way to do it reasonably during a 30 day halt amp x200B 2 What I think should happen now I won t spend this time wishing those who were cheated out of their potential earnings by others greed could get their money back If someone can make it happen that d be great But at this point it would be a hot complicated mess I personally think they should pick a price above the max price hit on Jan 27th and after forcing shorts that existed before Jan 27th to cover at that price should pay out everyone who owned shares on Jan 27th that amount at least but lol yeah right However there clearly needs to be regulation regarding stock shorting While theoretically good for the market in a limited set of circumstances shorting has been abused to hell and back and it s time for predatory shorting to end Two ways I would consider doing this 1 Make institutions publicly publish short positions the same way they publish long positions If regulators believe I should be able to know that Hedge One owns 10M shares of Gamestop then I should also be able to know that Hedge Two owes 10M shares of Gamestop to somebody 2 Regulate the level of shorting that can occur Make it so that if a share of stock is shorted it cannot be shorted again At this point the market is saturated with repeat shorts A loans to B who sells to C who loans to D Just look at those high shorted stocks and then realize that the short of float does not take into account institutional aka slow moving not daily traded ownership That means that all of those percentages aren t 30 or 40 or 50 of the shares that are actually available for public trading every day they re actually insanely higher s of the shares that are publicly traded every day In the most egregious of examples GME institutional ownership was over 100 of float while short of float was also over 100 That means that every single traded share was an IOU so every single existing share was owed at least twice And because institutions hold on to their shares for extended periods of time it actually means that some percent of shares were actual original shares some percent were owed once some percent were owed twice and some percent of shares the actively traded ones that were never locked up anywhere were likely owed MANY MANY times over I don t think a share should be possible to short more than once though I understand this would be difficult to track amp x200B TL DR Part 1 Brokers assumed risk in shorting but chose to prevent buying because they saw that they would likely have to cover for the shares they allowed others to short to obscene levels TL DR Part 2 SEC should have acted if this was as near catastrophic as it seems if it was not they should have acted to prevent market manipulation like this In the future I think they should force institutions to publicly declare shorts and track this data to prevent obscene shorting as well as preventing shares from being re shorted multiple times

Summary tl dr The uranium play is simple To keep nuclear reactors going uranium prices must go up The world is using far more uranium than it is presently mining causing the available stockpiles of uranium to run dry Spot uranium now is around 30 lb and mining is not profitable until spot uranium is 50 60 lb An increase to 50 60 lb should cause miners to go up 400 to over 1 000 If spot goes higher than 50 60 lb miner returns can be even more remarkable Though we cannot be certain exactly when the stockpiles will run dry many factors are suggesting that we have entered the beginning of a new uranium bull cycle Short term catalysts The unveiling of China s new five year plan the US stimulus the postponement or delay of scheduled US nuclear reactor closures Bill Gates on 60 minutes pumping it oh wait Summary Uranium is a unique sector to invest in and not for the faint of heart Well known investor Hugh Hendry said Uranium is the rockstar of commodities It doesn t mess around bull and bear markets are of epic proportions And historically this has been true There was an epic bull market in 2007 that found spot uranium up 10x and miners up much more some as much as 240x 24 000 In 2011 the Fukushima nuclear reactor melted down and we have been in a bear market ever since with a seemingly inexhaustible stockpile of uranium that has forced uranium prices to be well below the cost needed to make opening uranium mines profitable But times are changing We have been using more uranium than we have produced for many years causing the stockpiles to dwindle Demand is rocketing We have more nuclear reactors in operation than ever India and China are going all in on nuclear energy and very shortly we will see China s new five year plan We have had a political blue wave in the US and nuclear is possibly the only green energy with sufficient bipartisan support to allow a green focused 1 9T stimulus to become a reality Improvements in technology allow nuclear to play a larger role in electrical generation while making the reactors much safer than previously At its heart uranium is a play on basic economics Supply is down demand is up Stockpiles are drying dried up and in order to replenish them spot uranium must go from 30 to 50 60 at least This change alone will create huge gains in miners and if it goes beyond that the gains will be incredible amp

sharp decline in demand and a glut of uranium which pushed the price down to current levels 2 For a decade or more utilities have not entered into long term contracts with miners rather they fulfilled their needs buying spot uranium soaking up the excess supply 2 Increasing Demand 1 More nuclear reactors being built 1 13 Scheduled to start operating in 2021 2 50 reactors currently under

1 Nuclear is a very good green energy 1 It is arguably more effective than wind or solar One nuclear power plant produces as much energy as 3 000 000 solar panels or 2 000 to 5 000 wind turbines 2 Likewise it is arguably the cleanest form of energy granted this is hotly debated 3 It has become incredibly safe with gen 4 reactors which are largely built underground failure is almost impossible and they are very insulated It is even safe to live near them 2 The United States 1 Political Tailwinds 1 Nuclear energy is one of the few green energies that both Democrats and Republicans agree on which is a relatively recent phenomenon 2 President Trump had plans to spend 150M year to acquire a strategic stockpile of uranium We are not certain if Biden will carry this forward but he was very pro nuclear on the campaign trail 2 Stimulus It is expected to have a 1 9T stimulus package with an emphasis on green energy 1 If the Senate needs 60 votes to pass a stimulus with an emphasis on green energy a nuclear focus may be the only way to politically accomplish it 3 US uranium conversion plant scheduled to re open in 2023 1 2 9 21 announcement 2 These are necessary to convert the mined uranium U308 to fissile U2325 to be used in nuclear reactors 3 There are not many of these in the world and only one in the US 4 This facility re opening means the US expects the spot price of uranium to increase 3 China 1 Have been increasing nuclear usage lately 1 4 of the 13 nuclear reactors to come online in 2021 will be in China with three more scheduled in 2022 2 Nuclear generation is up 18 in 2020 as compared to 2018 3 Their five year plan will be revealed in March which may be very pro nuclear 1 IMO this alone could be a catalyst for a very strong movement in Uranium miners 4 The last five year plan was very pro nuclear wanting to double nuclear usage over five years 4 Decreasing Supply 5 Because of the low spot price of Uranium there are few no new mines opening and little exploration for new mines It is simply not profitable to explore or open mines at the current spot prices 6 Supply shortages Currently uranium use gt uranium production 1 And it is anticipated that it will get worse in time amp x200B https preview redd it j4gp8gti99i61 png width 495 amp format png amp auto webp amp s dc5a8142710329bdae8af443349804233d58506c See the bottom line for the estimated

and may continue to be while Canada gets the vaccine out could be through the Summer of 2021 3 This accelerated the soaking up the glut of excess uranium 2 Mines are drying up and closing 1 Australia s Ranger mine closed after 40 years 3 Technological Advancements 1 SMRs 1 These are smaller nuclear reactors Built largely underground they are more resistant to Fukushima like disasters and can be built more quickly and in remote locations 2 Their versatility and lower cost increase the ability of nuclear to satisfy global energy demand 3 If populations sprawl post pandemic SMRs will be very helpful as they need not have a large centralized population to be valuable Things to look for 1 Sustained spot price in excess of long term contract prices 2 Signing of new long term contracts between miners and utilities 3 Nuclear element of China s five year 4 Nuclear details in US stimulus 5 US canceling or delaying the closure of the 21 reactors slated to close Trades 1 Canada Canadian mines are uniquely poised to benefit 1 China is a nuclear leader in terms of usage but is resource poor in terms of uranium Therefore China needs to import much but won t import from the US but they will import from Canada Even in a glacial market the entire sector is booming amp x200B https preview redd it 0oxahxfl99i61 png width 185 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5d48061e25c27cb3a566662974c8eff766de6fa3 Risks 1 Nuclear meltdown incident that sours the public against nuclear 2 Change in political narrative such that nuclear no longer enjoys bipartisan support nuclear energy is greatly affected by favorable or unfavorable government regulation 3 Timing This is the biggest risk factor I see in the space Uranium moves at glacial speeds Even if the fundamentals look great and a bull market is inevitable which it appears it is it may not take off immediately 4 There is still excess uranium which we know because the usage is still greater than the production how much excess exists we simply do not know Because it is tied to national security nations do not publish the amount of reserves they have 5 An indicator that excess supply has dried up may be that spot prices exceed long term contract prices This has not happened which may suggest the market correction is still a ways off 6 The current run up is a speculative bubble like GME and will pop 7 Though possible I believe this is unlikely volume spiked in November well before the WSB madness and after the US presidential election 8 The deals happening between miners and utilities are opaque spot market is largely driven by investors and we do not always have details of deals made by miners and utilities 9 Because of Uranium s loooong cycles and the mechanics of mining and converting uranium it is natural for miners to front run spot changes I do not want this to get too technical but basically mining uranium is a much longer and more complicated process than just pulling it out of the ground and plugging it into a nuclear reactor and this affects how quickly things can move Investors understand the cycle can see the writing on the wall and front run the spot price change 10 Mine nationalization Uranium is related to national security Some mines that are strategically closer to Russia or China may be nationalized which may result in 100 loss of investment For this reason I do not invest in the biggest player in the field CCJ and stay closer to miners in the US Canada and sometimes Africa Africa being a higher risk play 11 Nuclear war

uranium up gt miners up amp x200B Short Summary tl dr The uranium play is simple To keep nuclear reactors going uranium prices must go up The world is using far more uranium than it is presently mining causing the available stockpiles of uranium to run dry Spot uranium now is around 30 lb and mining is not profitable until spot uranium is 50 60 lb An increase to 50 60 lb should cause miners to go up 400 to over 1 000 If spot goes higher than 50 60 lb miner returns can be even more remarkable Though we cannot be certain exactly when the stockpiles will run dry many factors are suggesting that we have entered the beginning of a new uranium bull cycle Short term catalysts The unveiling of China s new five year plan the US stimulus the postponement or delay of scheduled US nuclear reactor closures Bill Gates on 60 minutes pumping it oh wait Summary Uranium is a unique sector to invest in and not for the faint of heart Well known investor Hugh Hendry said Uranium is the rockstar of commodities It doesn t mess around bull and bear markets are of epic proportions And historically this has been true There was an epic bull market in 2007 that found spot uranium up 10x and miners up much more some as much as 240x 24 000 In 2011 the Fukushima nuclear reactor melted down and we have been in a bear market ever since with a seemingly inexhaustible stockpile of uranium that has forced uranium prices to be well below the cost needed to make opening uranium mines profitable But times are changing We have been using more uranium than we have produced for many years causing the stockpiles to dwindle Demand is rocketing We have more nuclear reactors in operation than ever India and China are going all in on nuclear energy and very shortly we will see China s new five year plan We have had a political blue wave in the US and nuclear is possibly the only green energy with sufficient bipartisan support to allow a green focused 1 9T stimulus to become a reality Improvements in technology allow nuclear to play a larger role in electrical generation while making the reactors much safer than previously At its heart uranium is a play on basic economics Supply is down demand is up Stockpiles are drying dried up and in order to replenish them spot uranium must go from 30 to 50 60 at least This change alone will create huge gains in miners and if it goes beyond that the gains will be incredible amp x200B Processing img pccr9ub5b9i61 1 Context 1 2011 Fukishima Japan nuclear plant meltdown resulted in sharp decline in demand and a glut of uranium which pushed the price down to current levels 2 For a decade or more utilities have not entered into long term contracts with miners rather they fulfilled their needs buying spot uranium soaking up the excess supply 2 Increasing Demand 1 More nuclear reactors being built 1 13 Scheduled to start operating in 2021 2 50 reactors currently under construction 3 Plant upgrades are increasing capacity of others amp x200B Processing img gbpgm6rqa9i61 amp x200B 1 Nuclear is a very good green energy 1 It is arguably more effective than wind or solar One nuclear power plant produces as much energy as 3 000 000 solar panels or 2 000 to 5 000 wind turbines 2 Likewise it is arguably the cleanest form of energy granted this is hotly debated 3 It has become incredibly safe with gen 4 reactors which are largely built underground failure is almost impossible and they are very insulated It is even safe to live near them 2 The United States 1 Political Tailwinds 1 Nuclear energy is one of the few green energies that both Democrats and Republicans agree on which is a relatively recent phenomenon 2 President Trump had plans to spend 150M year to acquire a strategic stockpile of uranium We are not certain if Biden will carry this forward but he was very pro nuclear on the campaign trail 2 Stimulus It is expected to have a 1 9T stimulus package with an emphasis on green energy 1 If the Senate needs 60 votes to pass a stimulus with an emphasis on green energy a nuclear focus may be the only way to politically accomplish it 3 US uranium conversion plant scheduled to re open in 2023 1 2 9 21 announcement 2 These are necessary to convert the mined uranium U308 to fissile U2325 to be used in nuclear reactors 3 There are not many of these in the world and only one in the US 4 This facility re opening means the US expects the spot price of uranium to increase 3 China 1 Have been increasing nuclear usage lately 1 4 of the 13 nuclear reactors to come online in 2021 will be in China with three more scheduled in 2022 2 Nuclear generation is up 18 in 2020 as compared to 2018 3 Their five year plan will be revealed in March which may be very pro nuclear 1 IMO this alone could be a catalyst for a very strong movement in Uranium miners 4 The last five year plan was very pro nuclear wanting to double nuclear usage over five years 4 Decreasing Supply 5 Because of the low spot price of Uranium there are few no new mines opening and little exploration for new mines It is simply not profitable to explore or open mines at the current spot prices 6 Supply shortages Currently uranium use gt uranium production 1 And it is anticipated that it will get worse in time amp x200B https preview redd it 775mgi6va9i61 png width 552 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5bbdbf91e556eb9b7707e05893c623b588386363 amp x200B See the bottom line for the estimated supply demand balance in millions of pounds 1 COVID mine closures 1 Kazakhstan and Cameco world s biggest mines 60 of world s production closed or limited production 2 Cigar Lake Canadian mine closed and may continue to be while Canada gets the vaccine out could be through the Summer of 2021 3 This accelerated the soaking up the glut of excess uranium 2 Mines are drying up and closing 1 Australia s Ranger mine closed after 40 years 3 Technological Advancements 1 SMRs 1 These are smaller nuclear reactors Built largely underground they are more resistant to Fukushima like disasters and can be built more quickly and in remote locations 2 Their versatility and lower cost increase the ability of nuclear to satisfy global energy demand 3 If populations sprawl post pandemic SMRs will be very helpful as they need not have a large centralized population to be valuable Things to look for 1 Sustained spot price in excess of long term contract prices 2 Signing of new long term contracts between miners and utilities 3 Nuclear element of China s five year 4 Nuclear details in US stimulus 5 US canceling or delaying the closure of the 21 reactors slated to close Trades 1 Canada Canadian mines are uniquely poised to benefit 1 China is a nuclear leader in terms of usage but is resource poor in terms of uranium Therefore China needs to import much but won t import from the US but they will import from Canada Even in a glacial market the entire sector is booming amp x200B Risks 1 Nuclear meltdown incident that sours the public against nuclear 2 Change in political narrative such that nuclear no longer enjoys bipartisan support nuclear energy is greatly affected by favorable or unfavorable government regulation 3 Timing This is the biggest risk factor I see in the space Uranium moves at glacial speeds Even if the fundamentals look great and a bull market is inevitable which it appears it is it may not take off immediately 4 There is still excess uranium which we know because the usage is still greater than the production how much excess exists we simply do not know Because it is tied to national security nations do not publish the amount of reserves they have 5 An indicator that excess supply has dried up may be that spot prices exceed long term contract prices This has not happened which may suggest the market correction is still a ways off 6 The current run up is a speculative bubble like GME and will pop 7 Though possible I believe this is unlikely volume spiked in November well before the WSB madness and after the US presidential election 8 The deals happening between miners and utilities are opaque spot market is largely driven by investors and we do not always have details of deals made by miners and utilities 9 Because of Uranium s loooong cycles and the mechanics of mining and converting uranium it is natural for miners to front run spot changes I do not want this to get too technical but basically mining uranium is a much longer and more complicated process than just pulling it out of the ground and plugging it into a nuclear reactor and this affects how quickly things can move Investors understand the cycle can see the writing on the wall and front run the spot price change 10 Mine nationalization Uranium is related to national security Some mines that are strategically closer to Russia or China may be nationalized which may result in 100 loss of investment For this reason I do not invest in the biggest player in the field CCJ and stay closer to miners in the US Canada and sometimes Africa Africa being a higher risk play 11 Nuclear war

seller in our Data and Analytics space The McDash Flash taking the daily views of what s going on in the market unlike ever before has been really powerful And maybe lastly our RAP application where we re taking our data our clients data in the cloud co collaborating with them has been really powerful And probably the last one I d highlight would be our next generation customer service is really getting some great traction Yeah No the momentum we have with our LOS system power is really exciting We re probably going to sign two times to three times as many Empower clients in 21 as we did in 2020 So again when I talk about momentum we ve got great confidence in that area as well I don t have an exact number on market share for eClosing What I d say is it s lower than the 13 that we talked about though for LOS And so lots of room for us to run Like I said the technology and the messaging and the integration is all resonating Optimal Blue Contribution it was about 32 million in the fourth quarter And we talked about a strong growth It grew over 30 in 2020 which we it came in right where we expected it to be Servicing Software revenue increased by 2 Origination Software enpower revenue increased by 56 Data and Analytics increased by 16 We continue to sell AIVA to originators of all sizes In fact we signed another top 50 lender in the fourth quarter for this solution and now have six of the top 50 lenders signed up for this innovative AI solution that is seamlessly integrated with Empower Most recently we introduced Seller Digital which leverages AI and decisioning to

and personal beliefs none of the following is a recommendation of any kind This is that good ole fashioned WallStreetBets due diligence Microsoft has a habit of adding easter eggs https www theverge com 2021 2 17 22287007 microsoft xbox wireless headset hidden easter egg commercial launch trailer new products or clues to announcements yet to be released in its videos whether it s the new Xbox Wireless headset or the Xbox Series S Sonos introduced a new color for their Sonos Move speaker they call it lunar white and it was launched in June of 2020 right before the Series S was announced It s marketed by Sonos as a lighter color to complement your home and the rest of your system https blog sonos com en move lunar white https blog sonos com en move lunar white The lunar white official color Move should compliment your robot white official color Xbox Series S and your new robot white Xbox Series Controller who doesn t love lunar robots You can see them together on Xbox s official video channel October 30 2020 I can t link to Youtube in this post or the automoderator will kill this post Screenshots https imgur com fDPuK4e https imgur com fDPuK4e https imgur com GGbQlQo https imgur com GGbQlQo Notice that the Sonos speakers move around too In one frame the speakers are sitting on a sofa table and in another frame the speakers are positioned on another Sonos product Sonos stands There s an effort to get them into the shot even though headphones are on for several frames Here s a very carefully and purposefully framed shot pairing the white controller and sub https imgur com XdiX7H8 https imgur com XdiX7H8 Keep in mind the focus of this video is generic You re the future of gaming yet several frames focus on the white Series S and not the X all the while white Sonos speakers appear in the background of several shots Last note on colors it might be worth stating the obvious that the two available colors for all of Sonos products match perfectly with the Series S robot white and Series X carbon black Put up an Arc next to a Series X and you ll see they re an exact match With everything above in mind let s switch over to the Series X there s a recent 6 second video of Panos Panoy Microsoft Chief Product Officer on twitter holding up his Series X controller black in front of the camera with a Series X and a black Sonos Arc visible https imgur com xlOW6wI https imgur com xlOW6wI While we re on the topic of Panos Panoy here s a screenshot of an web interview he was doing with another Sonos product in the background sitting right next to a box of headphones https imgur com fng1ITj https imgur com fng1ITj Last little nugget if you visit sonos xbox com https sonos xbox com you ll see that the subdomain exists and it s not that old according to a tool used it shows as registered late in 2019 As of or for now I should say it redirects to a generic support page that discusses Groove Music shutting down The subdomain hasn t been used for anything yet https web archive org web sonos xbox com https web archive org web sonos xbox com PREDICTION 1 Sonos has its first investor s day coming up early next month and I think Sonos will announce a partnership with Microsoft I think Sonos Radio will become the official ie integrated music service of Xbox Use your headphones or Sonos speakers Great for both companies PREDICTION 2 Sonos Radio HD Sonos premium monthly service will become a perk available in an upper tier of Game Pass PREDICTION 3 I also think that Sonos will announce its new headphones which look like a carbon copy ie they shared a lot of the same production process of Microsoft s new wireless headset The only difference is that the Sonos headphones will presumably be a bit more stylish and something you would wear out of the house it also appears they ll have an integrated mic https www theverge com 2021 2 16 22286147 sonos headphones new design german patent office https www theverge com 2021 2 16 22286147 sonos headphones new design german patent office https www xbox com en US accessories headsets xbox wireless headset https www xbox com en US accessories headsets xbox wireless headset I think the Sonos headphones will act as the premium set of headphones and cost 250 350 and Microsoft will retain the entry level at 99 Sonos products are already sold through the Xbox and in Microsoft s Store so they ll just join the rest of the products PREDICTION 4 Sonos will eventually be acquired by Microsoft Lots of the board of Sonos is comprised of existing former folks from Microsoft countless execs and other employees have moved from Microsoft to Sonos over the past 2 3 years as well I won t dox anyone but a quick Google search and Linkedin will show you the large amount of people that have gone from Microsoft to Sonos recently PREDICTION 5 BONUS Sonos already has a partnership with Disney Disney announced a few months ago that they will be ending Radio Disney I don t listen to the station you don t listen to the station but according to the most recent numbers I found 30 million a week listen to it It may not be worth it for Disney to keep it going but that would be HUGE for Sonos ecosystem Radio Disney is already alive and well in Sonos today you have to buy a Sonos product to listen to it of course Coincidentally Sonos also just announced last month that they are committed to creating new exclusive content for their radio HD service In fact they have a new recording studio built just for broadcasting new music I love Sonos as a company I also like the stock I don t think Sonos is going to underwhelm with their first investor s day and announce a product and that ll be it I think we ll see some of the predictions I outlined above come to fruition What do I know though

retards Last week I made a post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments liaxu1 600m in inflows to uvxy in the past 4 days is regarding a Bloomberg article indicating that there was a large inflow into the UVXY ETF to discuss what it means for the market The general gist of the discussion was that either a lot of traders were buying UVXY to hedge an expected correction or that hedge funds were borrowing shares to short indicating an expectation of calm waters on the horizon Bloomberg assumed that latter last week but has since changed its mind https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 02 17 reddit is chief suspect as volatility etf swells to 2 6 billion postulating that it was WSB While I still don t know what the volume means I did see a lot of comments on the post that indicated that a shocking number of you people know absolutely nothing about the VIX or the VIX ETFs many of you are YOLOing Some of the misconceptions I saw included lol okay gay bear and I just bought 3000 shares looks like this is the bottom Both of these comments imply that you people have no idea what UVXY is and are going to lose a bunch of money if it is in fact the retail investor driving its inflows First of all the large inflows into UVXY as I have said multiple times do not mean people are betting on the market to fall It could mean the opposite as it could mean hedge funds are borrowing shares to sell short and are therefore betting on the ETF to drop due to further volatility decrease Another thing is that the price of UVXY and VXX is not inherently bearish for a number of reasons The first being that UVXY doesn t literally track the VIX and follow the price up or down like SPY or QQQ UVXY is not comprised of stocks like an index fund It is comprised of futures positions with an average maturity of 1 month and is 1 5x leveraged Futures positions are similar to options in that they are a degrading asset If the futures contracts bought by this fund expire below the price they were bought at the fund realizes those losses and is then buying futures positions with a smaller money pool Exposure in these funds is reset daily which means that it is on autopilot buying and selling futures contracts with undeployed funds each day to maintain an average 30 day maturity leveraged 1 5x This means that trying to apply any type of technical analysis chart pattern analysis etc to UVXY is fucking worthless The fund does not have support or resistance levels and this is not a long term hold Funds like this constantly do reverse splits to bring share price and options price back to more tradeable levels For those of you who are newer to the market there was once a 2x leveraged VIX fund called TVIX that shut down because it ran out of money I also want to make something very clear since there s speculation that hedge funds are buying UVXY to short THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS GME and AMC You cannot short squeeze UVXY ETFs are different from stocks in that market makers can issue new shares to meet demand The feedback loop that caused the gamma squeeze in GME would not be possible unless the issuer of the ETF halted creation of new shares The fund also doesn t necessarily rise and fall with the VIX Over the summer VXX and UVXY fell as the VIX went up on a pretty consistent basis This was when Softbank was buying a bunch of calls and driving up options premiums Even though the VIX was going up VIX futures did not do so because there was not a strong expectation that the VIX was going to spike over the course of the following months The fund makes money due to sharp volatility increases such as during a correction when the underlying VIX increases 10 on a single day The fund does not make money when there is sustained relatively high volatility You can go here https www proshares com funds uvxy daily holdings html to look at what contracts UVXY is currently holding Currently it has March and April contracts in a proportion that exposes it to an average 1 month maturity If you do want to buy this fund based on historic VIX support and resistance levels and a bet that a correction is coming soon you need to look at the actual VIX which cannot itself be traded Currently the real VIX is at 23 76 at around the area it was at the end of February 2020 before the market crash At that time UVXY was at about 15 00 per share Right now UVXY is near all time lows but the VIX itself is still elevated relative to historical standards In October 2017 the VIX went as low as 9 less than half of current levels and the price of UVXY was still around 15 00 per share If you think the VIX is irrationally at a historical bottom you re wrong It is near the bottom of a range it has been fluctuating between for the last 6 9 months which is roughly 20 40 In order to understand the supports and resistances of the VIX you need to understand what comprises the VIX The VIX measures fear and uncertainty by aggregating the premium people are paying for OTM options on S amp P500 stocks The idea is that demand and therefore price for OTM options contracts goes up if people are hedging more in either direction This is how the VIX went up during a bull run over the summer The market especially retail investors were willing to pay more for options premiums and demand was especially high due in part to SoftBank s aggressive call buying The VIX also spikes during corrections because the demand for puts goes up People don t know how deeply they have to hedge during a correction and will pay up for puts way OTM That s why VIX spikes are generally but not necessarily considered bearish So the best way you can use the VIX isn t necessarily by buying into VIX ETFs like UVXY Instead one might want to use it as an indicator for buying or selling SPY For example since the VIX is near a support level right now one might bet on it bouncing off that support in a broad selloff or breaking through that support as the economy continues to recover You can also look at the VVIX the derivative of the VIX to get an idea of how fast options premiums are changing at a given time VVIX will rally as options premiums go up or down and generally indicates that people are repositioning A peak in VVIX indicates that repositioning is done and can usually precedes the last leg of a trend VVIX will go down as people hold their positions and wait for things to play out

longer term investment portfolio I would use the ISA section of the Trading 212 platform if you are from the UK This is because an ISA is a tax free wrapper that you can pay 20k a year into All earnings inside an ISA are yours tax free including growth dividends and avoids the capital gains tax from USA stocks You can withdraw any amount in the future even if its a million pounds absolutely tax free to your bank account and you don t even have to declare it to the UK government There is no penny stocks in the ISA side so its important to buy undervalued companies that you believe will bounce back this is a wonderful time to get involved in long term investing Its important to recognise companies that are overvalued at the moment and hyped up Follow a guy called LWT TRADING on YouTube he is great for this style of investing and really knows his stuff and picks some great stocks Mosh Money is also well informed With any long term investing regular deposits and cash flow for buying dips is of great importance As is regular research of your companies to see how they re progressing such as earnings reports dividend dates and knowing why they affect a certain stock Many people just deposit on a certain day like pay day and top up any stock that is in the red This is an affective lazy way to do things for the very long A better way is to monitor your stocks constantly technical analysis is key to this as you ll understand if your stock is oversold or over bought and you ll be able to buy the dips at the right time I always have cash in my account for this A great way to generate cash from companies you re already invested in is to sell some profits in a company you own that you think is heading for a correction over performing Again this is why a solid understanding of technical analysis coupled with knowledge of your company is key When I first started learning technical analysis it was probably the most difficult learning process of my life but if you stick with it it will be the best investment you will ever make in your life trust me The same goes for learning how to do due diligence research on companies The technical analysis side was like learning mandarin at first but I persisted with videos and reading books and its paying off big time for me Its taken me 2 months to become competent everyone is different Could take you a month or a year depending on your academic qualities Write down anything you learn that is a light bulb moment for you keep a diary of all your investments like earning report dates and dividend dates Twitter is great for stocks and shares use a dollar sign instead of a hashtag to search for what the chatter is about your investments Finviz website is a good way to search for undervalued stocks Look for videos on YouTube about how to use it However in the current climate that shouldn t be too difficult to find regardless a bit of common sense will do the trick to be honest Learn how to recognise if we are in a bear or bull market enviroment Day Swing trading This bit is easy a couple of months ago I was an anxious newbie like most people on here I then found a genuine discord channel ran by some very competent and savvy people who are crushing the game They are giving people the tools to do it too and charging nothing for it Many discord channels would charge hundreds or thousands a month for the same It s why I recently decided to become a permanent swing trader now I have the knowledge of technical analysis and doing my own due diligence Knowing exactly when to buy low and sell high is absolutely essential Learn about risk to reward before you enter any trade is important Never buy anything using a market order do a stop limit buy and set your buy limit at the price you are happy with on the chart amp stop limit at a point youre comfortable to lose money The power of social media is so important to gauge interest and activity in your trades follow me on Twitter Dan0v0 and follow who I m following I ll be posting my future swing trades on there My last one was BP where my account value increased 30 with one trade I m up 41 since January 9th applying the techniques I ve been picking up along the way That figure would be in the region of 200 if I knew then what I know now This is trading big blue chip companies not gambling on pennystocks I am not a day trader I am a swing trader Andrew Aziz has books on each subject that you must read Adam khoo on YouTube is great for beginners watch his stuff When I swing trade the biggest lesson I ve learned recently is raising my stop loss as the trade progresses I use my understanding of technical chart analysis for this Again technical analysis is like learning a new language at first but you must persist with it Cut losers quick and hold onto winners as long as possible or until you find a better opportunity As your trade progresses take some profits so you can buy the next dip Plan every trade before you enter one I m sure there s more I could add here but I get bored of writing very quickly and I m shit at it as you can see The discord is legit try and ignore the new people and start where the discord says the education part where hundreds of ebooks etc are available to download for free too The discord is https atlas trading net It has changed my life it will change yours too if you dedicate yourself to learn and avoid hyped stocks You can become financially free if you put in the effort I hope this helps you As for penny stocks I won t touch anything with a super low market cap Its just gambling to me Give this a thumbs up and comment so new people can see it please Cheers

advise CRSR is one of the few stocks that is actually fundamentally undervalued in this FED fueled printer market Let s take a look at the P S Ratio of some of your favorite stocks and Corsairs P S Ratio List https imgur com a kTvFTZ1 Price to Sale Ration Market Cap to Revenue Ratio I ve listed the P S Ratio and y y growth from AMZN AAPL AMD PLTR LOGI and CRSR You can see that CRSR is trading at a P S Ratio of just 2 1 and that while having the highest y y revenue growth of all listed stocks Not only that but their last quarter had a y y growth revenue growth of over 70 https ir corsair com news releases news release details corsair gaming reports fourth quarter and full year 2020 and earnings 152 growth 2020 Revenue even already beating analysts prediction for 2021 sales of 1 72 billion Basically any tech stock is trading at P S Ratios of 5 or higher giving Corsair a 200 upside Andy Paul CEO of Corsair in the Q4 ER It is clear that a new wave of gamers and streamers has entered the market as well as consumers building gaming PCs for the first time Our expectation is that all these people that are new to the market will continue to buy gaming and streaming products from us for many years into the future Growth problem What is stopping Corsair from further growth It isn t demand Corsairs sales could have been even greater if not for the semiconductor and general shortage Many of Corsair products are sold out and production is being ramped up as fast as possible Stopping their growth is the rate at which they can ramp up production Good news on that end https www theverge com 2021 2 11 22278431 biden administration global semiconductor chip shortage executive order At the moment the company is more worried about the shortage of semiconductor components It persisted throughout the fourth quarter the company could have raised even more funds if not for such restrictions Streaming peripherals are also in high demand Corsair said YouTube offered at least 40 million game channels in December This makes the company s management believe that streaming activity will soon be as widespread as gaming Analyst Rod Hall continues to see Corsair as a high quality participant in secular video gaming and eSports growth with a strong brand position and diversified product lineup Other that some of the newly IPOed hype and meme stocks Corsair is actually operating at a profit barely They are basically growing the company as fast as possible without going billions into debt They managed over 70 y y growth for their 4th quarter while not opertaing at a loss This is some good management So where is the catch Why is the stock down Well there are three bad news I could find First the acquisition of Visuals by Impulse https www theverge com 2021 2 16 22285508 corsair elgato visuals by impulse acquisition streaming twitch for an undisclosed amount There is always some uncertainty with acquisitions especially when the paid amount is not stated leading to concerns that it might have been a bad deal but this is a short term fear and the acquisition will help to reinforce the Elgato ecosystem With the addition of Visuals by Impulse to the Elgato family we re excited to extend our core mission of empowering content creators Design is a crucial element shaping a creator s identity and VBI has been at the forefront of making beautiful and interactive design accessible to anyone wrote Julian Fest SVP and general manager at Elgato in a press release Together with the talented team at VBI we plan to push the boundaries of what design can mean for creators Second the Wallstreet analysts fear that people will stop gaming when the pandemic ends Decide for youself how you feel about this I don t see how demand will substantially lessen in the next 12 15 months for current gen consoles graphics cards and cpus and at that point next generation products will be ready If you look at the current steam hardware survey https store steampowered com hwsurvey Steam Hardware Software Survey Welcome to Steam barely 1 2 of people are using 3000 series graphics cards with only 11 of people using 2000 series gpus Over 80 of active steam users are running systems with 2 or more generations old hardware and are potentially looking to upgrade their systems Addtionally the entry age for gaming is getting lower and lower More kids want to play video games and need the hardware to do so Corsair provides All In One Systems System Cases full range Power supplies full range cooling solutions full range of peripherals market leading streaming equipment SSDs and RAM Basically anything you will need with a pc but the CPU GPU and motherboard The tech demand is not a Corsair only problem though it is a problem for most tech stocks yet their P S Ratios are still much higher These out of tech rotations were already happening in summer last year because all the so smart Wallstreet analysts thought that nobody would buy tech anymore since a vaccine was near 8 months later there is no sign of any demand decline These analyst try to be smart and predict the demand rotations truth is TECH IS THE FUTURE TECH WILL PREVAIL if old smelly men on Wallstreet acknowledge it or not it doesn t change the inevitable Third the end of the lock up period was Feb 17th 2021 I can t really determine the extent of this event There was no high selling volume today or yesterday which means that inital investors are for the most part atleast keeping their positions Why would they not keep an undervalued stock So the downwards trend of the last days might have been the fear of other investors that thought a selloff would happen with the ending of the lock up combined with low volume Demand growth will decrease eventually but demand will very likely stay at these high levels and lead Corsair to constant further growth Their prediction for 2021 revenue growth is at a conservative 20 which will very likely be exceeded Even with these conservative predictions the current P S Ratio is a joke and the stock massively undervalued Amateur TA https imgur com a bD14NJn just drew some lines look somewhere else for a propper one Opinion Maybe the stock will follow its upwards trend in the triangle but I think the stock is basically just waiting for any catalyst to break out This is probably the last chance to get this under 40 With a personal predictions of gt 20 revenue growth for 2021 and the rise of the P S Ration to a conservative level of 4 the market cap should come to about 8B or an undiluted upside of 220 or 85 a share The stock is experiencing relatively high volatility right now Stocks or LEAPS are the safer option TLDR RGB

Q4 Release,AMC Entertainment AMC is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2020 This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations On the other hand if they miss the stock may move lower While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise Zacks Consensus Estimate This movie theater operator is expected to post quarterly loss of 3 39 per share in its upcoming report which represents a year over year change of 1068 6 Revenues are expected to be 181 47 million down 87 5 from the year ago quarter Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 37 79 higher over the last 30 days to the current level This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts Price Consensus and EPS Surprise Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out Our proprietary surprise prediction model the Zacks Earnings ESP Expected Surprise Prediction has this insight at its core The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier Thus a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate However the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank 1 Strong Buy 2 Buy or 3 Hold Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70 of the time and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4 Sell or 5 Strong Sell How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AMC Entertainment For AMC Entertainment the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 14 69 On the other hand the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 So this combination indicates that AMC Entertainment will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings So it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number For the last reported quarter it was expected that AMC Entertainment would post a loss of 4 66 per share when it actually produced a loss of 5 70 delivering a surprise of 22 32 Over the last four quarters the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors Similarly unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss That said betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported AMC Entertainment appears a compelling earnings beat candidate However investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release

outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations On the other hand if they miss the stock may move lower While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise Zacks Consensus Estimate This movie theater operator is expected to post quarterly loss of 3 39 per share in its upcoming report which represents a year over year change of 1068 6 Revenues are expected to be 181 47 million down 87 5 from the year ago quarter Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 37 79 higher over the last 30 days to the current level This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts Price Consensus and EPS Surprise Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out Our proprietary surprise prediction model the Zacks Earnings ESP Expected Surprise Prediction has this insight at its core The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier Thus a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate However the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank 1 Strong Buy 2 Buy or 3 Hold Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70 of the time and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4 Sell or 5 Strong Sell How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AMC Entertainment For AMC Entertainment the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 14 69 On the other hand the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 So this combination indicates that AMC Entertainment will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings So it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number For the last reported quarter it was expected that AMC Entertainment would post a loss of 4 66 per share when it actually produced a loss of 5 70 delivering a surprise of 22 32 Over the last four quarters the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors Similarly unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss That said betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported AMC Entertainment appears a compelling earnings beat candidate However investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release https www zacks com stock news 1265725 amc entertainment amc expected to beat

please read its very important ,Before I begin I have no intention of promoting myself or anything I have no affiliations at all There is a free discord channel mentioned further down which is already hugely popular and doesn t need any traffic sending their way It is and always will be a free resource Same goes for anything else you read here I ve posted this elsewhere and been given awards please don t bother if they cost you money I d rather you invested into yourself I gave this advice to someone from the UK on the subreddit of my broker platform the same stuff will apply no matter what broker you use I wrote this off the cuff I m no writer and not good at it But try and read it all OK then The beginning of the post is for long term investing and further down is about day swing trading Id also like to add im not affiliated with any of the youtube channels mentioned or any book authors Where you get your education from is up to you First of all I d like to say I m the kind of person who mostly listens and only speaks when I have knowledge I like sharing This post was directed at a new user asking questions in the subreddit of my broker I thought it was deserving of a wider audience and my sole reason for sharing is to help people Please understand this Long term investors For your longer term investment portfolio I would use an ISA wrapper if you are from the UK This is because an ISA is a tax free wrapper that you can pay 20k a year into All earnings inside an ISA are yours tax free including growth dividends and avoids the capital gains tax from USA stocks You can withdraw any amount in the future even if its a million pounds absolutely tax free to your bank account and you don t even have to declare it to the UK government I m not sure if theres anything similar in other countries Look into it I follow a guy called LWT TRADING on YouTube he is great for this style of investing and really knows his stuff and picks some great stocks Mosh Money is also well informed There is hundreds of channels on YouTube where you can get decent advice be responsible for who you follow or listen to With any long term investing regular deposits and cash flow for buying dips is of great importance As is regular research of your companies to see how they re progressing such as earnings reports dividend dates and knowing why they affect a certain stock Many people just deposit on a certain day like pay day and top up any stock that is in the red This is an affective lazy way to do things for the very long A better way is to monitor your stocks constantly technical analysis is key to this as you ll understand if your stock is oversold or over bought and you ll be able to buy the dips at the right time I always have cash in my account for this A great way to generate cash from companies you re already invested in is to sell some profits in a company you own that you think is heading for a correction over performing Again this is why a solid understanding of technical analysis coupled with knowledge of your company is key When I first started learning technical analysis it was probably the most difficult learning process of my life but if you stick with it it will be the best investment you will ever make in your life trust me The same goes for learning how to do due diligence research on companies The technical analysis side was like learning mandarin at first but I persisted with videos and reading books and its paying off big time for me Its taken me 2 months to become competent everyone is different Could take you a month or a year depending on your academic qualities Write down anything you learn that is a light bulb moment for you keep a diary of all your investments like earning report dates and dividend dates Twitter is great for stocks and shares use a dollar sign instead of a hashtag to search for what the chatter is about your investments Finviz website is a good way to search for undervalued stocks Look for videos on YouTube about how to use it However in the current climate that shouldn t be too difficult to find regardless a bit of common sense will do the trick to be honest Learn how to recognise if we are in a bear or bull market enviroment Day Swing trading This bit is easy a couple of months ago I was an anxious newbie like most people on here I then found a genuine discord channel ran by some very competent and savvy people who are crushing the game They are giving people the tools to do it too and charging nothing for it Many discord channels would charge hundreds or thousands a month for the same It s why I recently decided to become a permanent swing trader now I have the knowledge of technical analysis and doing my own due diligence Knowing exactly when to buy low and sell high is absolutely essential Learn about risk to reward before you enter any trade is important Never buy anything using a market order do a stop limit buy and set your buy limit at the price you are happy with on the chart amp stop limit at a point youre comfortable to lose money The power of social media is so important to gauge interest and activity in your trades I am not a day trader I am a swing trader Andrew Aziz has books on each subject that you must read Adam khoo on YouTube is great for beginners watch his stuff When I swing trade the biggest lesson I ve learned recently is raising my stop loss as the trade progresses I use my understanding of technical chart analysis for this Again technical analysis is like learning a new language at first but you must persist with it Cut losers quick and hold onto winners as long as possible or until you find a better opportunity As your trade progresses take some profits so you can buy the next dip Plan every trade before you enter one I m sure there s more I could add here but I get bored of writing very quickly and I m shit at it as you can see The discord is legit try and ignore the new people and start where the discord says the education part where hundreds of ebooks etc are available to download for free too The discord is https atlas trading net It has changed my life it will change yours too if you dedicate yourself to learn and avoid hyped stocks You can become financially free if you put in the effort I hope this helps you As for penny stocks I won t touch anything with a super low market cap Its just gambling to me Give this a thumbs up and comment so new people can see it please Cheers

a roughly live transcription for a guy and figured I d share with anyone who wants to more quickly read the general gist of the first day of the hearing with some added comedic factor Present are a bunch of congresspersons Plotkin from Melvin P Griffin from Citadel G or C Gill DFV Spez from Reddit Jennifer Schulp as a SME Schulp or S amp x200B Plotkin couldn t unmute his mic during swearing in cause he s dumb Citadel RH and Melvin owners convince congress they have hearts with poor immigrant sob stories Plotkin accuses WSB of anti semetic comments Huffman Reddit co founder enters into record that no such comments were ever discovered by Reddit s administrators Some regular jo schmo who goes by DeepFuckingValue is on He states he s not a HF not a paid advisor and in fact is not a cat This is contrasted by a hang in there cat poster supporting a seemingly out of place red head band hanging behind him Interestingly enough both Reddit CEO and Keith Gill career youtuber are the only individuals who have quality audio recording on this remote only hearing Gill goes on to counter Plotkin s accusations of Gamestops struggles against digital only sales It s alarming how little we know about the inner workings of the market I like the stock Cheers everyone Jennifer Schulp Dir of Financial Regulation Studies at Cato Institute Retail participation in equities market is important It s particularly valuable in times of economic stress and likely played a roll stabilizing markets in the March 2020 crisis 2020 showed a shift in more equitable investing with a more diverse participation with lower account values The temporary volatility did not present a risk to market infrastructure The core was resilient against the huge trading volume Only a small part of the market was affect and those affects were short lived I cannot opine on added regulation In no means should these events lead to restrictions on retail investors Maxine Waters Mr Tenev Robinhood restricted trades to meet clearinghouse demands Yet on Jan 28th you state there were no liquidity problems Yes or No Tenev Doesn t answer yes or no Waters then trashes RH Maxine Waters continues to target Melvin Citadel and RH relationships Tenev continues to GUH Citadel GUHs over accusation of dark pool trade quantity 50 of traded volume in relation to fielding bulk of retail trades look into this part it was fast and hard to follow but they did not like this line of questioning Ranking Chairman McHenry Vlad why you kneecap retail by stop purchasing but not selling Vlad Well that would be a bad experience so we didn t want to do that Is payment for order flow legal Is it disclosed V Yes Yes You restricted buying but not selling Was it pressured by anyone on the witness panel here today V No Do RH users get to invest in RH V No Schulp why can t they Schulp You have to be an accredited investor and you need lots of tendies to do that McHenry enters letter from DTCC Idk what is on it NY 12 Rep Carolyn Maloney equates retail traded this January as a crazy more dangerous game of monopoly Rules need to maintain consistent and predictable Retail investors woke up on Jan 28th from their drunken drug fueled binge to a complete change in rules when they were locked out Your initial blog post on Jan 28th did not mention clearinghouse margin increase only a reference to market volatility with vague language saying RH can restrict trading at any time Do you believe that this shit show is why you re being accused of sucking Citadel s dick Vlad Look I m sorry I ll make sure it doesn t happen again without admitting fault What changes are you making to better handle volatility and to prevent you from being the FD of brokerages for retail Vlad Here are some business words Inverse backwards overflow to achieve synergy Rep Ann Wagner Congress needs to reduce barriers to market access Additional pro main street platitudes Tenev you say you didn t have enough money Was DTCC a bad hombre with their ask or did you fuck up having enough capital V Some bullshit statistics citing sigma behavior Five no SIX sigmas But no I don t have an answer for you Ms Schulp We both have vaginas and are here today which is pretty click nice Did we see any broad market failures during this event S Talks about collateral clearing times and purpose of clearinghouses DTCC requirement was large but understandable A boomer reminds others to mute their mics It s probably Plotkin cause we ve already seen him screw this up once Rep Sherman describes the spread advantage Citadel has with pay for order flow He asks Mr Griffin if a RH gets the same best execution as a Fidelity investors G Well let s create a structured scenario where I can Don t change the question G Well imagine if you would a different question My god you ignoramous Answer the specific question G I m going to continue to waste you time Sherman is really pissed OK Sherman seems like not a complete shill A Rep Lucas from OK with an obvious OK accent reiterates not dicking over retail notably no one has made inquiries against Reddit or DFV at this point Previous remarks were just introductions Why does Citadel get the priority of your Pay for Order Flow POF Vlad Cause they process it the best How does POF provide best price for retail Mr Griffin G Exchanges are regulated by public where we aren t someone has a hot mic and shouts something probably at their kid also we don t charge them for transactions Rep Meeks Mr Tenev I has some loss porn in the past How do you manage your customers risk when they are on margin V Very few are on margin Meeks calls out the discrepency saying Vlad said he raised the 3 billion for future liquidity issues not current liquidity issues surrounding Gamestop by Jan 28th Vlad admits this Some Huizenga Rep gives time to Citadel s Griffin to give his non answer when Sherman got sick of his shit G Look we followed the rules If the rules change we ll change Huizenga calls this whole thing political theater Is retail investing a casino for you Mr Gill DFV doesn t answer Huffman no Griffin For the vast majority no Vlad Starts a big show but is shut down and ultimately answers no DFV Answers no Huizinga Asks if he would buy GME at this point DFV Me personally yes It s an attractive price point Rep Velazquez in the accent of a saucy latino woman Short selling has a purpose but historically has seen abuse Plotkin Well gee ma am I uh I think it s guh if the rules change I ll follow them gosh Maxine Shits on Huizenga for calling it political theater Rep Leukemia Mr Gill is more legislation needed in your opinion Was the market self correcting in this specific example This is actually a pretty good question Gill My expertise is in analyzing the business not the inner workings of the market I wouldn t want more legislation but more transparency for retail investors would be beneficial GME was shorted 140 Plotkin you say you weren t trying to manipulate a stock How can you short something to that degree and not manipulate a stock P We follow the rules G The short interest was exceptional typing this it s funny cause he sounds like Tom Hanks I m not it s worth us delving into legislation into extreme short positions We comply with borrowing shares to short Naked shorting was largely curtailed years ago Rep Scott Social media contributed to the meteoric rise Do you monitor social media to head off this kind of volatility V No We follow existing rules do you do anything to ensure retail investors make trades based on fundamentals and not memes V Check out our Robinhood R Learn TM portal brought to you by KY Jelly What about you Mr Reddit Do you make sure memes don t become financial dreams R Authenticity is important and we saw no manipulation Rep Stivers from the fightin Ohio fifteenth America is great Let s talk about T 2 clearing rules and their role SEC NSCC or DTCC isn t here cause the majority is attempting to drive a message about the economy being rigged Tenev deposit requirements caused you to shut down buys T Yes If there s more sellers than buyers do stonks go up T My pause indicates no and I m just going to say we stopped buying and they could only sell cause actually answering would implicate me Plotkin are you a frequent short sellers P Yes no but yes Did you ever short Tesla P Yes Did you see Elongated Muskrat tweet Gamestonk Do you think it was a motivatd tweet P I don t want to speculate Maxine Waters DTCC is not here cause they are transitioning chair people Rep Green brings to light the whole cost of doing business with fines referencing Citadel s previous fines Rep Barr POF has been around for a while It s set by brokerages right Citadel It s negotiated You are required to meet best execution C Correct How can you do that as a MM offer better pricing to not be worse than the exchanges C Well exchanges have to trade no less than a penny increment Exchanges should be permitted to have a smaller tick size perhaps half a cent Mr Robinhood is your clearinghouse monitored by federal regulators Vlad Yes Was the value of risk charged to you approved by federal regulators Vlad It arose from approved processes Seems like anyone who is mad should be mad at federal regulators Mr Plotkin did your short position exceed float Plotkin No Shorts and price discovery blah blah Naked shorting time expires

that this will bring a lot of potential customers to take interest in their products as this can not only help make clinical decisions but can improve the efficiency of the entire process just how it s meant to be in the Butterfly workflow How do they make money Butterfly Network currently offers 3 products which are the iQ Ultrasound which is their main product Butterfly Enterprise which offers the greatest workflow and includes the iQ and iQ Vet which is of course for animals and used by vets They each have different payment plans with different perks These payment plans also have recurring subscriptions which allows Butterfly Network to have steady revenue BFLY Pricing https www butterflynetwork com pricing you can take a look at their list of products along with their pricing The medical imaging market As most medical imaging takes place in Hospitals or Niche Doctor Offices and of course imaging centers Butterfly Network plans on expanding the settings where medical imaging takes place such as at home long term care centers retirement homes prehospital and urgent care settings This not only helps grow the market of medical imaging but improves the healthcare system as a whole by increasing access to medical imaging Butterfly currently only has its products being sold in North America and Europe for the time being Now although the Butterfly iQ and their other products can gain market share within the western nations its most lucrative market may be emerging markets in developing nations The market for medical imaging is HUGE In fact 2 3 of the world has no access to medical imaging as well 2 3 of diagnostic dilemmas can be solved addressed by simple imaging This may be one of the reasons why Butterfly has attracted investments from the Bill amp Malinda Gates Foundation So not only is Butterfly Network disrupting an 8 billion global ultrasound market it can for sure expand the market as a whole with its products Official Butterfly Investors Presentation

c6de2dca19144bf11d712e2e6e8532d4694fbe48 Valuation Well it s hard to know what the valuation is some sources say there are 41 4 million shares outstanding while others say there are 164 86 million shares outstanding Once this is clarified we will have a better understanding of its market cap Personally I think that there are 164 86 shares outstanding as during the shareholder vote to bring BFLY onto the market shareholders gave them permission to create new shares to raise capital With 164 86 million shares outstanding and a price of 27 that would give it a valuation of 4 45 Billion While the merger is supposed to valued at 1 5 billion this company has great potential and could be worth 10s of billions in the years to come Investors Butterfly Network is backed by the Bill amp Melinda Gates Foundation along with Baillie Gifford Fidelity Management amp Research Company LLC and Cathie Wood from ARK Investment Management LLC just to name a few investors The main two investors to focus on are Cathie Wood and the Bill amp Melinda Gates Foundation as they focus on finding innovative companies with great potential With their investments I see this as a great sign of them succeeding in

amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s b8387d32d0a518c10f2a4bd6ae408004970f10c9 Concerns Well firstly is the market cap we currently can t confirm 100 what its valuation is Secondly some people have raised concerns over Bill Gates as an investor Sure he is everywhere and is investing in many companies and while he may not think that they will all succeed I m sure he is still looking for innovative companies and products that can better society as a whole Which is ALWAYS a plus There also isn t enough info that I could find at least on the companies revenue and its profit margin If anyone has more concerns I m willing to edit this section to add more to it amp x200B Thoughts As BFLY came onto the market recently I feel as if the majority of investors both Institutional and Retail have not been very informed of this company With the market craze how it is whether it s GME PLTR NOK AMC etc I think a similar effect could happen to this company depending on how the market reacts Taking a look at QS an EV battery company also another company back by Bill Gates as soon as it came on the market it only took a few days for it to boom from the 20 range to over 100 I m not telling ANYONE to get in because of this this is just a unique factor that has occurred over the past year with IPOs such as Airbnb ABNB coming to the market at over DOUBLE its valuation amp x200B tl dr Butterfly Network BFLY has innovative technology for medical imaging and has a bright future ahead of them Their business model allows them to grow while having a steady income They are also backed by large investors who believe in their success and their future to change the medical imaging market as a whole amp x200B btw this is to simply bring awareness to the company and this dd leaves out some info and concerns about the company and merger so take this with a grain of salt Positions About 170 Shares of BFLY Link to another DD of BFLY LGVW BFLY soon to be meme stock https www reddit com

estimates on their last eight earnings to the tune of 15 24 This isn t a EV pump and dump that you re going to make 60 in a week But a 20 share price gain can still take you to tendy town with the right call options and a good batch of shares The last week of crabbing share price has dropped the IV since the last earnings price spikes making it a perfect opportunity to pick up some calls pre Q3 fiscal results in April The Bull Case It s no secret that the only reason this stock is trading sub 40 is that their growth hasn t been drop dead sexy It s been consistently seasonal but it hasn t really blown the roof off the fucker until fiscal Q2 Industry analysts always expect FLWS to have a strong Q2 September December is their growth months however they never expected the company to post 1 72 EPS FLWS not only made more money overall but they also managed to lower management costs and improve e commerce growth up 59 7 YOY On some level a portion of this could be due in part to COVID 19 driving consumers online The real question is will the average consumer return to purchasing at their local florist if they re even open anymore or just become a FLWS customer Just before the earnings bomb was dropped the share price rose to a 52 week high 37 on hype alone Paper hands lit up and it dumped down to 28 The bull case would see the stock climb back to 40 over the next 2 3 months and perhaps even touching 45 before Fiscal Q3 earnings are due in April 2021 Wall Street expects a net loss of 9c share If FLWS can beat this and go positive it would mark the first time the company made a profit per share in Q3 I would imagine this would signal a shift in the companies growth and lead the stock to some sort of breakout If their newest acquisitions can drive earnings in the off season Q1 Q3 and Q4 then expect a huge upside Flowers has made some power purchases over the last two years to expand their ecommerce reach Their most recent acquisitions include 1 Berries com Shari s Berrys Purchased 08 19 for 20 5 million a This was a steal Shari was about to start selling used panties online after her retail model resulted in multiple store closures FLWS stepped in and scaled the business into a successful e commerce business on berries com Now they re dipping 9 million berries a year at 3 75 berry I would imagine the margins are pretty big on these given how little a strawberry and some dipping chocolate costs 2 PersonalizationMall Purchased 2 20 252 million A big player in the personalized gift space Ranks above Etsy on an organic google search which is nuts and is going to expose FLWS to a new sector for growth What s especially important about this acquisition is that the site drives business year round FLWS has a VERY cyclical earnings cycle subject to huge swings based on seasonal revenue the lion share of the companies earnings comes Thanksgiving through Christmas This site will drive revenue in the dry fiscal quarters for the company Q1 Q3 amp Q4 3 The gay bears are betting against us The stock has historically been shorted As of 1 29 21 data the stock is 20 of float short down significantly since earnings I wouldn t call it squeezable but

rainbow bear emoji Look FLWS is a seasonal business EPS is over a dollar in Fiscal Q2 and is often negative or barely positive in the remaining months The gay bears betting against this stock believe that it s possible FLWS doesn t go net positive for the rest of fiscal 2021 The question on everyone s mind is the stock actually making a positive growth trend Or was this just a fluke based on COVID 19 closures If the gay bear theories prove true the stock could sink FLWS doesn t report positive news very often only on acquisitions and fiscal Q2 earnings The rest of the year is basically hype A few shitty news cycles and this stock could have a VERY negative sentiment If FLWS doesn t blow away Fiscal Q3 I wouldn t expect much movement above 30 35 Still pretty safe to hold shares against gay
