screenshot so here you go Best of luck to everyone who s already jumped in Spread the good word about LZB as far wide as you can Let s make next week LZB week on Wall Street Hello everyone I just made an options play yesterday on LZB La Z Boy that I think is very exciting so I ll share it here I bought 35 call options for October 21 Current stock price is 36 so these calls at essentially At The Money TL DR Reasons Market cap 1 66B Same as GME and AMC in January 2021 Down nearly 15 over the last 2 days despite earnings beat on all metrics simply due to current global supply chain issues Now trading 33 below fair value of 53 39 as per Nasdaq com Last time stock traded near current 36 support level was after last major dump on February 1 Stock recovered to 41 10 by February 8 and hit 45 20 by March 12 As per June 15 earnings report orders are currently backlogged at record levels for all products due to record demand Trailing 12 months P E ratio 14 31 Now cheaper than furniture industry average of 17 67 for this iconic brand Long version full DD After the 10 bagger successes of GME amp AMC I think Reddit is ready for a new 10 bagger I have looked long and hard for that opportunity and I think it is LZB Why This stock has everything Reddit needs 1 LZB has extremely low market cap so it is easy to trade up the ticker LZB market cap is about the same as GME and AMC in January of this year before the mega pumps in price Even without Reddit involvement this stock is pretty much guaranteed to go up from here as per Entrepreneur com https www entrepreneur com article 374743 but if Redditors start buying this up this is EASILY the next ten bagger due to the low market cap 2 It is trading well below fair value after being dumped over the past 2 days Nasdaq com https www nasdaq com articles an intrinsic calculation for la z boy incorporated nyse 3Alzb suggests its 21 undervalued published an article yesterday saying the stock was trading 21 below value when it was trading at 42 Now it is at 36 the long term support which makes it 33 below fair value Why did it dump In their earnings call they issued a warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short term due to raw material price increases right now However they also said these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year So basically the dump is a super overreaction as their earnings report came out the same day J Powell did his press conference and caused the whole market to dump 3 The stock will recover soon because it does this Because this stock has low market cap any news causes a dump that soon recovers Simply looking at the chart over the past 6 months will show other such instances including the last major dump to this support level on February 1 and the subsequent recovery by 10 in only 8 days and a 20 recovery in just over a month after that amp x200B https preview redd it

where the money is notes that LZB is the poster child for the boom in home furnishings sales Some quotes for those that don t want to click through to the Forbes story gt If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer all you have to do is ask La Z Boy By one measurement that the company uses written same store sales for the entire Galleries network doubled increasing 100 for the quarter For the year those sales were up 31 Their CEO noted the following in the earnings call also covered at Forbes gt For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter record sales led to all time record profits driven by increased production capacity excellent performance by our company owned La Z Boy Furniture Galleries stores and continued growth and profitability at Joybird Fiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead 5 LZB beat on all important metrics including EPS and revenue as per their June 15 earnings report 6 And yet this iconic king of furniture brands is currently cheaper than the furniture industry average

stock I expect it to go to the moon I recommend getting in like I did Best of luck and don t forget to buy one of these with your tendies Lastly I want to add that the analysts covering LZB have all maintained and or raised their price targets into the 50s The lowest price target is 46 which would still be a nice gain from where we are now LZB has strong potential in the short and long term in my opinion I have been a long time holder of Restoration Hardware which has printed nice the housing boom will continue to contribute to a boom in furniture sales and for a fantastic earnings beat the drop in price was an overreaction I think it will bounce As always do your own DD and see you all on the damn moon https preview redd it g876vlb57x671 png width 996 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

to ensure that your brand new business entity is properly set up And if you re under pressure to get up and running fast because you have potential new clients vendors and employees lined up then making sure all your paperwork is in order becomes even more important The main attraction for business owners especially of new LLCs with a limited budget is that there are huge potential savings compared to having a legal firm on retainer You can also pay for legal tax advice which is often an important factor for a startup company to ensure every possible tax advantage and obligation is considered That all means you gain the support of attorneys for reviewing client vendor or employee contracts and pretty much any other kind of legal advice you require for a very reasonable price Some business formation services will offer expedited filing That doesn t mean that the state authority will handle the application faster What it means is that the LLC service provider will put your application at the top of their queue Once you have everything in place to start operating under your new business you can then opt for one of their membership plans for legal advice The mobile app

think a lot of people have a tough time understanding their business model and understanding why they have a legitimate shot at helping to fix one of the biggest issues with healthcare in America For some background I m an MD who did my undergraduate degree focused on healthcare systems and economics essentially many of the same courses someone pursuing an MPH would take I actually did about 2 3rds of the courses required for an MPH at my alma mater So in addition to being a WSB degen I understand what Clover Health is trying to accomplish and I m going to try and explain it because I think unlike a video game retailer or a movie theater most people have no idea wtf CLOV does What is Medicare Advantage and why was it created To understand Clover s business model we first need to understand what Medicare Advantage is because that s Clover s primary business model though they also have expanded into Direct Contracting Medicare which is somewhat similar Medicare Advantage was created by the government to try and fix a lot of the broken incentives in our healthcare system that have lead to rampant inflation in the cost of healthcare in the US Have you ever wondered why healthcare costs per person have more than doubled in the last decade https fred stlouisfed org series HLTHSCPCHCSA Healthcare costs have been growing for a long time and have worsened wealth inequality https www ft com content 0d7ea0c1 f0b8 4c8a a532 f18f147079bc due to growing 5X since 1980 but this inflation has accelerated the last decade so we re going to focus on the primary cause of this for simplicity Right now literally everyone in the existing healthcare system has had financial incentives to continue driving up costs from consumers to hospitals to physicians to drug companies to insurance companies Focusing on insurance though the crazy thing is that insurance companies only make more money if healthcare costs more money Wait a minute you say That makes no sense Why would insurance companies make more money if they re paying out more money That might have been the case in the past but over most of the last decade insurance companies have been restricted by the 80 20 rule https www healthcare gov health care law protections rate review a frankly economically stupid regulation that was ironically pitched as a way to bring costs down in health insurance You ll often see this referred to as a Medical Loss Ratio especially when talking about earnings for insurance companies But basically the law was changed so that insurance companies could only keep 20 of whatever money they charged for an insurance policy and had to pay out at least 80 So what did health insurance companies do With this new law it meant that every insurance company was now aligned with higher payouts to hospitals physicians and pharmacies and stopped trying all that hard lower healthcare costs https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC5145008 because the higher their payouts were the more money they could charge on their insurance policies the next year That s become the primary way for health insurers to grow their profits and revenues Letting healthcare costs grow out of control is a

Now most people in the United States may have private healthcare through their work But a very large chunk of healthcare costs are paid out by the government through Medicare because the oldest and sickest patients that use the most healthcare dollars are people over 65 The most expensive healthcare in America is the catastrophic kind where patients have a stroke have a heart attack get cancer and then they require repeated hospitalizations and extremely expensive treatments that run well into the six and seven figures As healthcare costs have gone completely insane the amount of money the government has had to spend on Medicare has gone crazy as well Medicare Advantage is their attempt at trying to align better healthcare that costs less with higher profits for insurance companies Instead of hospitals and doctors billing the government directly for care provided to Medicare patients the government just hands over a set amount of money for each patient that an insurer covers So the more patients a health insurance companies has the more money they get from the government for taking care of those patients This basically brings back into the system the old incentive where spending less money on healthcare leads to better profits Now you re going to think doesn t that just mean they ll just deny paying for everything and make bank No because combined with this the government also looks at the quality of the outcomes and care that patients get and the better the patients do the higher the pay you get per patient This is the government s attempt to fix the completely broken incentives in the healthcare system Why Clover Health So now you have some idea of what Medicare Advantage is Why should you invest in Clover and not just buy shares of United Healthcare and Anthem since they ve been printing money since before JPow bolted the turbo to the money printer What it comes down to are two things 1 Clover Health is a pure play where focusing on improving healthcare by preventing health problems before they become catastrophic will always improve Clover s profitability Clover only covers patients with either Medicare Advantage or Medicare Direct Contracting to avoid this being 80 pages long this is a type of hybrid of traditional Medicare with incentives for quality and cost reduction This means that they can aggressively focus on improving healthcare quality preventing patients from needing to be hospitalized preventing patients from having those heart attacks strokes cancer If other insurance companies aggressively improved the health of their patients they would actually make less money over time because the majority of their profits come from patients on plans where they only make more money if you re less healthy and requiring more and more expensive healthcare If United Healthcare or Anthem successfully got their patients to be healthier they d actually make less and less money due to the 80 20 rule So they literally cannot be aggressive in pursuing a focus on preventing those terrible healthcare problems because they ll actually annihilate their own profits if they succeed Any company that s attempting to do both traditional health insurance and also Medicare Advantage will be fighting with itself either they do really well with Medicare Advantage or they do really well with their traditional insurance business They can t actually succeed in both because the path to profitability for each are completely different With Clover if they succeed it s literally a win for everyone It s a win for shareholders with larger profits it s a win for patients because they have better health it s a win for physicians because their patients are healthier which actually means less of a workload and physicians actually getting paid to keep people healthy it s a win for the entire United States because we can maybe stop setting all our money on fire and maybe do something other than spend a quarter of a our salaries on healthcare while having our healthcare system ranked last place against similar nations https www citizen org article dead last u s health care system continues to rank behind other industrialized countries 2 Clover Assistant This is the killer app that Clover has been working on it s their electronic health records system that attempts to keep track of all the moving pieces in healthcare to help physicians help their patients in a timely manner For example a lot of the time a patient gets hospitalized and they get well enough to go home but they re supposed to follow up with their physician to make sure that they re continuing to improve that they re not getting worse again In traditional healthcare what happens is that the hospital physician sends the patient home and gives them a pile of papers and written somewhere in there is that they should go see their doctor within a week The patient may or may not read this and even if they do they ll call their doctor and the phone number will be busy and since they re not feeling well to begin with the patient gives up 2 weeks later the patient is feeling sicker than ever and ends up calling 911 ends up back in the emergency room back in the hospital Medicare has attempted to punish this type of thing by financially penalizing hospitals for this type of situation known as a bounceback https www cms gov Medicare Medicare Fee for Service Payment AcuteInpatientPPS Readmissions Reduction Program but it s still a rampant problem With Clover Assistant however the software is constantly looking at every patient s record and if it sees that a patient was hospitalized and discharged it proactively notifies their primary care physician that hey you need to see and follow up with this patient to make sure they re continuing to get better Then their physician might intervene with something like a 20 prescription for new antibiotics to help the patient continue to improve instead of yet another 20 000 hospitalization That s just one example of what it can already do today but the Clover Assistant will eventually be able to use a large dataset of health records with AI to discover new ways to improve healthcare Addressing short seller critiques To be frank the report from Hindenburg sounds like it was written by someone with absolutely no real knowledge of healthcare or the healthcare business But since this report is what so many people like to harp on when trashing Clover Health as some sort of scam I m going to address the points they bring up 1 Claim Clover is being investigated by the Department of Justice Clover received what is known as a Civil Investigative Demand from the Department of Justice which is a request for more information from Clover to make sure that there is no Medicare fraud occuring This doesn t mean that there s any actual fraud but it s standard when the government is your primary payer that you get hit with these CIDs to make sure that everything is on the up and up There s no credible evidence that this has any actual material impact on Clover Health s performance As an example where was Hindenburg s short report when Anthem dealt with a DOJ CID in 2018 https www fiercehealthcare com payer anthem doj medicare advantage risk adjustment chart review civil investigative demand If we take a look at Anthem s stock during this same time period https finance yahoo com chart ANTM

we can see that there was literally no impact from this on their share price and since 2018 their stock has grown over 70 It s absurd to believe that this has any material impact even if you do somehow believe that Clover broke the law in pursuing their vision They pitch it as an existential risk essentially insinuating that the government would stop working with Clover even though this is clearly not true as CMS has continued to approve Clover for new programs and frankly this has never happened to any legitimate health insurer Clover also recently added this heavy hitter to their board https www nashvillepost com business health care clover health taps former cms official for board article 51803ebc e162 596b a372 d7907d6abe7a html which will help them navigate the complex regulations around Medicare 2 Claim Clover had tons of patients inappropriately funneled to them through Seek Healthcare a Medicare plan comparison portal owned by Clover s head of sales This claim just has no factual basis the vast majority of plans recommended by Seek were for non Clover plans so all the evidence out there points to them having been neutral in matching patients to a plan that would benefit them Regardless Clover has made it clear on Seek s website that Seek is an affiliate of theirs 3 Claim Clover s software tries to upcode If you re not familiar with healthcare this will sound negative but what Clover s software is doing is literally what every piece of healthcare software does Medicare billing codes can be coded higher meaning that your care and work is seen as more valuable to Medicare based on how much data you ve included about a patient in your documentation Traditionally on a paper chart a doctor would have needed to write down the x rays labwork etc to bill the higher codes but with electronic health records systems you can code at a higher level without extreme effort because all the data is right there That s a large part of their business plan because they can show that yes we have the data and our physicians are able to review this to provide better and more detailed care Hindenburg makes it sound like they re doing something nefarious when in fact reviewing and providing this extra data is exactly what will provide better care Complete absurd negative spin from Hindenburg on this claim and I frankly don t know of any healthcare record software that would purposely not include healthcare data so that physicians would only be able to have rudimentary data free documentation That d be beyond moronic 4 Claim Doctor s whine about Clover s software So coincidentally in a past life I actually worked to train physicians to use electronic health record systems I m sure that Hindenburg was able to interview several physicians who would have complained about Clover Assistant but the part they re not telling you is that a third of physicians are over the age of 60 https www medicaleconomics com view physician retirement why its hard doctors retire There is no software in existence that isn t going to be whined about by physicians it doesn t matter if it s Allscripts Epic whatever the reality is that the older physicians will struggle to learn any new software they have to deal with If you ve ever tried to help your grandma learn how to use a computer you probably have a good idea of what I m talking about so to use this as a critique is yet again incredibly stupid 5 Claim Clover health pays doctors money to use Clover Assistant and they pay primary care physicians good money Hindenburg tries to spin this as a negative that doctors are getting paid 200 per patient visit to have them adopt Clover Assistant Well in order to improve patient outcomes and thus eventually make more money by having healthier patients the entire business model revolves around having physicians adopt Clover Assistant Clover also pays primary care physicians more money because investing more money into primary care to prevent health issues down the line is their business model Studies show that every 1 extra spent on primary care is going to save 12 down the line https www medicaleconomics com view delivering value healthcare starts increased primary care investment This is actually what sets Clover apart from the other health insurance companies they re going out of their way to pay primary care physicians more so they can spend more time with each patient so they can use the Clover assistant to deliver higher quality care that ll prevent more health problems down the line Hindenburg doesn t actually seem to be able to at all understand Clover s Medicare Advantage business model here which makes me seriously question how they felt they were qualified to analyze Clover at all 6 Claim Clover s CEO made his previous hospitals a ton of money charging a lot of money I could go into the nuances of how the CEO justified this type of billing as a negotiation tactic with existing insurance companies that had bullied these hospitals into bankruptcy in order to save hospitals that were going to be shut down But forget that and realize what you have here is a short seller spinning the CEO of a healthcare company being incredibly good at making money in healthcare as a negative I honestly can t think of a stupider fucking thing for a short seller to say Garipalli knows and understands the business of healthcare better than anyone else and now with Clover he s going to fix how fucked up it is while Clover makes bank Short term price catalysts Short Squeeze prospects This is probably the part that most of you degenerates care about so we probably should go over it I think Clover health is going to be an incredible long term hold Chamath thinks it s one of the most obvious 10 baggers he s ever seen and frankly I agree but let s break down the short term Short Interest Over the last few weeks SI has been 40 50 of the float I know some people have talked about some institutional shares being misclassified and the SI being even higher but it s not clear to me that this is the case Nonetheless Ortex is looking into this https twitter com trades dutch status 1406999851313807362 so we ll know for sure what the correct numbers are soon enough It really doesn t matter that much though this is extremely highly shorted When VW underwent their infinity squeeze the SI was only 12 what actually made it squeeze was that all of a sudden the short sellers couldn t cover their position that matters much more than the exact number the SI is 40 50 is honestly a massive number that s more than enough for a huge short squeeze to occur Why did the price just jump Now here s the big thing that makes me think that CLOV is a prime short squeeze target right now If you read BS financial blog posts a lot of people claim that it s because of WSB reading the SEC filings where the short squeeze is mentioned as a risk but that s not the reason Obviously WSB has obviously thought it s a possible squeeze target for a long time so to believe that an SEC filing triggered the price runup is stupid The reason is simply that 6 22 is the day that a ton of shares became unavailable for short sellers to borrow A ton of call options for CLOV expired ITM on 6 18 How these work is that they get executed after market hours finish and then the people who sold the calls have to settle them in 2 business days That s known as T 2 settlement which is the settlement time for options contracts in the US So any hedge fund that sold naked calls had another 2 business days to provide the shares Purchases can be done through prime brokerages with T 1 settlement meaning that the last day a hedge fund or market maker could have scrambled for shares to hand out on 6 22 was Monday 6 21 So they had a lot of incentive to drive the price down and force some liquidity on Monday which is pretty much what you saw happen But Tuesday all those shares went to people who executed their ITM call options Now if you think about it why would someone execute an ITM call option instead of just selling it off It s because those entities want to hold those shares for a longer time frame So as these shares got assigned off to folks who wanted to just hold these shares with their diamond hands you saw that share borrow availability tank By 4PM on 6 22 there were ZERO shares available to borrow at IBKR and the borrow fee had jumped to almost 9 Regardless that major change of hands in shares has likely made this one of the weeks where it s going to be harder than every before for short sellers to be able to obtain shares to close out their short position Even though CLOV has had a very high short squeeze score for a while now 100 100 at S3 https twitter com ihors3 status 1404880301428547585 s 19 I think the folks holding shares this week may be more likely than ever before to be the type that refuse to sell to the shorts cheaply Long term value This is admittedly hard to pin down because while CLOV doesn t currently generate profits they re an incredibly fast growing company If they manage to achieve what they re trying to achieve the sky is going to be the limit because we re talking about profit margins that would put every other insurer to shame while continuing to grow at double digit percentages per year Plus while their current core business is Medicare Advantage and Medicare they also have an entire other business in the possibility of licensing out Clover Assistant The EHR business could become another multi billion dollar business alone Allscripts is worth 2 5 billion and Epic is worth more but it s privately held It s going to be years of work before Clover grows to a massive size and scale but I think if it does happen then Chamath s 10 bagger estimate is going to look conservative Positions or ban What can I say I like the stock https imgur com a szRzWyw I doubled down on my YOLO before https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nr6rpz clov yolo part 2 the double down but with the drop to the 11 s on Monday I ve added another 25 000 shares and now hold 98888 shares of CLOV Ironically I started buying CLOV trying to find a stock that was heavily undervalued and was going to put 100K into it Now my attempt at building a diversified value portfolio with 1 million has somehow turned into this insanity but hey I guess I ve spent too much time

think a lot of people have a tough time understanding their business model and understanding why they have a legitimate shot at helping to fix one of the biggest issues with healthcare in America For some background I m an MD who did my undergraduate degree focused on healthcare systems and economics essentially many of the same courses someone pursuing an MPH would take I actually did about 2 3rds of the courses required for an MPH at my alma mater So in addition to being a WSB degen I understand what Clover Health is trying to accomplish and I m going to try and explain it because I think unlike a video game retailer or a movie theater most people have no idea wtf CLOV does What is Medicare Advantage and why was it created To understand Clover s business model we first need to understand what Medicare Advantage is because that s Clover s primary business model though they also have expanded into Direct Contracting Medicare which is somewhat similar Medicare Advantage was created by the government to try and fix a lot of the broken incentives in our healthcare system that have lead to rampant inflation in the cost of healthcare in the US Have you ever wondered why healthcare costs per person have more than doubled in the last decade https fred stlouisfed org series HLTHSCPCHCSA Healthcare costs have been growing for a long time and have worsened wealth inequality https www ft com content 0d7ea0c1 f0b8 4c8a a532 f18f147079bc due to growing 5X since 1980 but this inflation has accelerated the last decade so we re going to focus on the primary cause of this for simplicity Right now literally everyone in the existing healthcare system has had financial incentives to continue driving up costs from consumers to hospitals to physicians to drug companies to insurance companies Focusing on insurance though the crazy thing is that insurance companies only make more money if healthcare costs more money Wait a minute you say That makes no sense Why would insurance companies make more money if they re paying out more money That might have been the case in the past but over most of the last decade insurance companies have been restricted by the 80 20 rule https www healthcare gov health care law protections rate review a frankly economically stupid regulation that was ironically pitched as a way to bring costs down in health insurance You ll often see this referred to as a Medical Loss Ratio especially when talking about earnings for insurance companies But basically the law was changed so that insurance companies could only keep 20 of whatever money they charged for an insurance policy and had to pay out at least 80 So what did health insurance companies do With this new law it meant that every insurance company was now aligned with higher payouts to hospitals physicians and pharmacies and stopped trying all that hard lower healthcare costs https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC5145008 because the higher their payouts were the more money they could charge on their insurance policies the next year That s become the primary way for health insurers to grow their profits and revenues Letting healthcare costs grow out of control is a

Now most people in the United States may have private healthcare through their work But a very large chunk of healthcare costs are paid out by the government through Medicare because the oldest and sickest patients that use the most healthcare dollars are people over 65 The most expensive healthcare in America is the catastrophic kind where patients have a stroke have a heart attack get cancer and then they require repeated hospitalizations and extremely expensive treatments that run well into the six and seven figures As healthcare costs have gone completely insane the amount of money the government has had to spend on Medicare has gone crazy as well Medicare Advantage is their attempt at trying to align better healthcare that costs less with higher profits for insurance companies Instead of hospitals and doctors billing the government directly for care provided to Medicare patients the government just hands over a set amount of money for each patient that an insurer covers So the more patients a health insurance companies has the more money they get from the government for taking care of those patients This basically brings back into the system the old incentive where spending less money on healthcare leads to better profits Now you re going to think doesn t that just mean they ll just deny paying for everything and make bank No because combined with this the government also looks at the quality of the outcomes and care that patients get and the better the patients do the higher the pay you get per patient This is the government s attempt to fix the completely broken incentives in the healthcare system Why Clover Health So now you have some idea of what Medicare Advantage is Why should you invest in Clover and not just buy shares of United Healthcare and Anthem since they ve been printing money since before JPow bolted the turbo to the money printer What it comes down to are two things 1 Clover Health is a pure play where focusing on improving healthcare by preventing health problems before they become catastrophic will always improve Clover s profitability Clover only covers patients with either Medicare Advantage or Medicare Direct Contracting to avoid this being 80 pages long this is a type of hybrid of traditional Medicare with incentives for quality and cost reduction This means that they can aggressively focus on improving healthcare quality preventing patients from needing to be hospitalized preventing patients from having those heart attacks strokes cancer If other insurance companies aggressively improved the health of their patients they would actually make less money over time because the majority of their profits come from patients on plans where they only make more money if you re less healthy and requiring more and more expensive healthcare If United Healthcare or Anthem successfully got their patients to be healthier they d actually make less and less money due to the 80 20 rule So they literally cannot be aggressive in pursuing a focus on preventing those terrible healthcare problems because they ll actually annihilate their own profits if they succeed Any company that s attempting to do both traditional health insurance and also Medicare Advantage will be fighting with itself either they do really well with Medicare Advantage or they do really well with their traditional insurance business They can t actually succeed in both because the path to profitability for each are completely different With Clover if they succeed it s literally a win for everyone It s a win for shareholders with larger profits it s a win for patients because they have better health it s a win for physicians because their patients are healthier which actually means less of a workload and physicians actually getting paid to keep people healthy it s a win for the entire United States because we can maybe stop setting all our money on fire and maybe do something other than spend a quarter of a our salaries on healthcare while having our healthcare system ranked last place against similar nations https www citizen org article dead last u s health care system continues to rank behind other industrialized countries 2 Clover Assistant This is the killer app that Clover has been working on it s their electronic health records system that attempts to keep track of all the moving pieces in healthcare to help physicians help their patients in a timely manner For example a lot of the time a patient gets hospitalized and they get well enough to go home but they re supposed to follow up with their physician to make sure that they re continuing to improve that they re not getting worse again In traditional healthcare what happens is that the hospital physician sends the patient home and gives them a pile of papers and written somewhere in there is that they should go see their doctor within a week The patient may or may not read this and even if they do they ll call their doctor and the phone number will be busy and since they re not feeling well to begin with the patient gives up 2 weeks later the patient is feeling sicker than ever and ends up calling 911 ends up back in the emergency room back in the hospital Medicare has attempted to punish this type of thing by financially penalizing hospitals for this type of situation known as a bounceback https www cms gov Medicare Medicare Fee for Service Payment AcuteInpatientPPS Readmissions Reduction Program but it s still a rampant problem With Clover Assistant however the software is constantly looking at every patient s record and if it sees that a patient was hospitalized and discharged it proactively notifies their primary care physician that hey you need to see and follow up with this patient to make sure they re continuing to get better Then their physician might intervene with something like a 20 prescription for new antibiotics to help the patient continue to improve instead of yet another 20 000 hospitalization That s just one example of what it can already do today but the Clover Assistant will eventually be able to use a large dataset of health records with AI to discover new ways to improve healthcare Addressing short seller critiques To be frank the report from Hindenburg sounds like it was written by someone with absolutely no real knowledge of healthcare or the healthcare business But since this report is what so many people like to harp on when trashing Clover Health as some sort of scam I m going to address the points they bring up 1 Claim Clover is being investigated by the Department of Justice Clover received what is known as a Civil Investigative Demand from the Department of Justice which is a request for more information from Clover to make sure that there is no Medicare fraud occuring This doesn t mean that there s any actual fraud but it s standard when the government is your primary payer that you get hit with these CIDs to make sure that everything is on the up and up There s no credible evidence that this has any actual material impact on Clover Health s performance As an example where was Hindenburg s short report when Anthem dealt with a DOJ CID in 2018 https www fiercehealthcare com payer anthem doj medicare advantage risk adjustment chart review civil investigative demand If we take a look at Anthem s stock during this same time period https finance yahoo com chart ANTM

we can see that there was literally no impact from this on their share price and since 2018 their stock has grown over 70 It s absurd to believe that this has any material impact even if you do somehow believe that Clover broke the law in pursuing their vision They pitch it as an existential risk essentially insinuating that the government would stop working with Clover even though this is clearly not true as CMS has continued to approve Clover for new programs and frankly this has never happened to any legitimate health insurer Clover also recently added this heavy hitter to their board https www nashvillepost com business health care clover health taps former cms official for board article 51803ebc e162 596b a372 d7907d6abe7a html which will help them navigate the complex regulations around Medicare 2 Claim Clover had tons of patients inappropriately funneled to them through Seek Healthcare a Medicare plan comparison portal owned by Clover s head of sales This claim just has no factual basis the vast majority of plans recommended by Seek were for non Clover plans so all the evidence out there points to them having been neutral in matching patients to a plan that would benefit them Regardless Clover has made it clear on Seek s website that Seek is an affiliate of theirs 3 Claim Clover s software tries to upcode If you re not familiar with healthcare this will sound negative but what Clover s software is doing is literally what every piece of healthcare software does Medicare billing codes can be coded higher meaning that your care and work is seen as more valuable to Medicare based on how much data you ve included about a patient in your documentation Traditionally on a paper chart a doctor would have needed to write down the x rays labwork etc to bill the higher codes but with electronic health records systems you can code at a higher level without extreme effort because all the data is right there That s a large part of their business plan because they can show that yes we have the data and our physicians are able to review this to provide better and more detailed care Hindenburg makes it sound like they re doing something nefarious when in fact reviewing and providing this extra data is exactly what will provide better care Complete absurd negative spin from Hindenburg on this claim and I frankly don t know of any healthcare record software that would purposely not include healthcare data so that physicians would only be able to have rudimentary data free documentation That d be beyond moronic 4 Claim Doctor s whine about Clover s software So coincidentally in a past life I actually worked to train physicians to use electronic health record systems I m sure that Hindenburg was able to interview several physicians who would have complained about Clover Assistant but the part they re not telling you is that a third of physicians are over the age of 60 https www medicaleconomics com view physician retirement why its hard doctors retire There is no software in existence that isn t going to be whined about by physicians it doesn t matter if it s Allscripts Epic whatever the reality is that the older physicians will struggle to learn any new software they have to deal with If you ve ever tried to help your grandma learn how to use a computer you probably have a good idea of what I m talking about so to use this as a critique is yet again incredibly stupid 5 Claim Clover health pays doctors money to use Clover Assistant and they pay primary care physicians good money Hindenburg tries to spin this as a negative that doctors are getting paid 200 per patient visit to have them adopt Clover Assistant Well in order to improve patient outcomes and thus eventually make more money by having healthier patients the entire business model revolves around having physicians adopt Clover Assistant Clover also pays primary care physicians more money because investing more money into primary care to prevent health issues down the line is their business model Studies show that every 1 extra spent on primary care is going to save 12 down the line https www medicaleconomics com view delivering value healthcare starts increased primary care investment This is actually what sets Clover apart from the other health insurance companies they re going out of their way to pay primary care physicians more so they can spend more time with each patient so they can use the Clover assistant to deliver higher quality care that ll prevent more health problems down the line Hindenburg doesn t actually seem to be able to at all understand Clover s Medicare Advantage business model here which makes me seriously question how they felt they were qualified to analyze Clover at all 6 Claim Clover s CEO made his previous hospitals a ton of money charging a lot of money I could go into the nuances of how the CEO justified this type of billing as a negotiation tactic with existing insurance companies that had bullied these hospitals into bankruptcy in order to save hospitals that were going to be shut down But forget that and realize what you have here is a short seller spinning the CEO of a healthcare company being incredibly good at making money in healthcare as a negative I honestly can t think of a stupider fucking thing for a short seller to say Garipalli knows and understands the business of healthcare better than anyone else and now with Clover he s going to fix how fucked up it is while Clover makes bank Short term price catalysts Short Squeeze prospects This is probably the part that most of you degenerates care about so we probably should go over it I think Clover health is going to be an incredible long term hold Chamath thinks it s one of the most obvious 10 baggers he s ever seen and frankly I agree but let s break down the short term Short Interest Over the last few weeks SI has been 40 50 of the float I know some people have talked about some institutional shares being misclassified and the SI being even higher but it s not clear to me that this is the case Nonetheless Ortex is looking into this https twitter com trades dutch status 1406999851313807362 so we ll know for sure what the correct numbers are soon enough It really doesn t matter that much though this is extremely highly shorted When VW underwent their infinity squeeze the SI was only 12 what actually made it squeeze was that all of a sudden the short sellers couldn t cover their position that matters much more than the exact number the SI is 40 50 is honestly a massive number that s more than enough for a huge short squeeze to occur Why did the price just jump Now here s the big thing that makes me think that CLOV is a prime short squeeze target right now If you read BS financial blog posts a lot of people claim that it s because of WSB reading the SEC filings where the short squeeze is mentioned as a risk but that s not the reason Obviously WSB has obviously thought it s a possible squeeze target for a long time so to believe that an SEC filing triggered the price runup is stupid The reason is simply that 6 22 is the day that a ton of shares became unavailable for short sellers to borrow A ton of call options for CLOV expired ITM on 6 18 How these work is that they get executed after market hours finish and then the people who sold the calls have to settle them in 2 business days That s known as T 2 settlement which is the settlement time for options contracts in the US So any hedge fund that sold naked calls had another 2 business days to provide the shares Purchases can be done through prime brokerages with T 1 settlement meaning that the last day a hedge fund or market maker could have scrambled for shares to hand out on 6 22 was Monday 6 21 So they had a lot of incentive to drive the price down and force some liquidity on Monday which is pretty much what you saw happen But Tuesday all those shares went to people who executed their ITM call options Now if you think about it why would someone execute an ITM call option instead of just selling it off It s because those entities want to hold those shares for a longer time frame So as these shares got assigned off to folks who wanted to just hold these shares with their diamond hands you saw that share borrow availability tank By 4PM on 6 22 there were ZERO shares available to borrow at IBKR and the borrow fee had jumped to almost 9 Regardless that major change of hands in shares has likely made this one of the weeks where it s going to be harder than every before for short sellers to be able to obtain shares to close out their short position Even though CLOV has had a very high short squeeze score for a while now 100 100 at S3 https twitter com ihors3 status 1404880301428547585 s 19 I think the folks holding shares this week may be more likely than ever before to be the type that refuse to sell to the shorts cheaply Long term value This is admittedly hard to pin down because while CLOV doesn t currently generate profits they re an incredibly fast growing company If they manage to achieve what they re trying to achieve the sky is going to be the limit because we re talking about profit margins that would put every other insurer to shame while continuing to grow at double digit percentages per year Plus while their current core business is Medicare Advantage and Medicare they also have an entire other business in the possibility of licensing out Clover Assistant The EHR business could become another multi billion dollar business alone Allscripts is worth 2 5 billion and Epic is worth more but it s privately held It s going to be years of work before Clover grows to a massive size and scale but I think if it does happen then Chamath s 10 bagger estimate is going to look conservative Positions or ban What can I say I like the stock https preview redd it 887il0m5ky671 png width 1354 amp format png amp auto webp amp s cf1a285ed97bfcf2f544b9997b95b4b3067b6612 I doubled down on my YOLO before https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nr6rpz clov yolo part 2 the double down but with the drop to the 11 s on Monday I ve added another 25 000 shares and now

about stocks but could name all 898 Pok mon in reverse alphabetical order For those of you in that situation and wishing to educate them in terms they can understand then look no further than this thread With cool GIFs and relatable content their evolution from ASH to APE will happen faster than finding a Pidgey in Pok mon Go amp x200B STEP 1 Establish something valuable In this case that will be nothing other than a holographic Charizard amp x200B https preview redd it 3hysysl43y671 png width 1920 amp format png amp auto webp amp s ae12feff6eb486e6c3d4157e074e4a8a7c5026cd amp x200B amp x200B STEP 2 Introduce the villain Imagine opening this card up as a kid and then somebody convinces you that it was worth less than 5 because they wanted to buy it from you on the cheap That person would be a Jerk That person would be low life scum That person would be what we know as the Manipulative Hedge Funds They try to trick us into selling our shares of a company on the cheap and that aint cool They are the Team Rocket of this world and will use many tactics to see their profits blast off again and again https preview redd it r6qt5eljby671 jpg width 960 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 320611ea16e6883bc72e4971680118b7cb99c7cf amp x200B amp x200B STEP 3 Expose their tactics Explain how Team Rocket borrowed 100 pok balls from their boss in order to make a lot of money and put a pok shop out of business And it all started by selling Pok balls for less than what they were worth https i redd it fbvmla9cfy671 gif amp x200B With Team Rocket charging 1 less for each pok ball the pok shop is then pressured into lowering their price as well But it doesn t end there Team Rocket then makes the shop owners think that a new company is about to put the pok ball company out of business and that all of their pok balls will be worthless This causes the shop owners to panic sell their pok balls for way less than what they are worth https i redd it lqwsfwnyiy671 gif amp x200B amp x200B And this panic selling is exactly what they were betting on happening Once the shop owners dropped their sell price Team Rocket loaded up with 300 pok balls gave 100 back to their boss then disappeared for a little while and began their waiting game https i redd it ukiotd6hky671 gif amp x200B amp x200B As time goes by the pok ball price eventually settles back to its original price Once it does team rocket takes their 200 pok balls and sells them at market value making them 2 000 https i redd it ifaion1eny671 gif amp x200B STEP 4 Provide hope At this point your pok friend will surely recognize both the evil of Team Rocket and the injustice done to the shop owners This is when you let your pok friend know that there is a special move learned from TM42069 that could have stopped all of this injustice That move is known as Diamond Hands Diamond Hands is a rare move that has just recently been discovered is extremely powerful and anyone can learn it In fact every time you use it and see your enemy get destroyed you evolve into something fiercer than you were before you battled https i redd it gf0t072nqy671 gif amp x200B Way Fiercer amp x200B https i redd it u9fr7hisry671 gif amp x200B I m talking FREAKING CHARIZARD FIERCE https i redd it jgkf0zkrsy671 gif amp x200B amp x200B STEP 5 Enter the real world With your pok friend now more fired up than the freshly blasted off Team Rocket you lay down a truth bomb that will basically be like a mental voltorb to them The Hedge funds are the Team Rockets of our world our shares of AMC and GME are the pokeballs and us diamond handed apes are about unleash the fiercest attack we have in our arsenal The dreaded BUY amp HODL amp x200B https i redd it d6ln9h0wty671 gif amp x200B And just to make sure they understand this concept you explain to them that it s like fighting against a Magikarp with a Pikachu Or Zapdos Or freaking Thor the thundergod himself amp x200B https i redd it t16etcurzy671 gif amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B STEP 6 Recruit that newborn ape Now that your pok friend understands this movement recognizes the evil and sees our ability to do something about it the time is right to say the following I choose you to help us in this battle By purchasing more shares and holding them not only are you helping us fight evil in this world but you are also paving the way for your own financial freedom Those manipulative hedge funds are going to be bleeding out money and when we BUY amp HODL it gives us the sponges we need to soak up the profits Also this is not financial advice And then we simply sit back and watch as the Ape army continues to grow and refuses to allow manipulative hedge funds to continue their free reign of financial terror amp x200B amp x200B Well hope you all enjoyed this

change very soon Why BABA why now baba showed negative performance relative to the other tech stocks at the moment market sentiment due to politics alot of impact on the stock but baba strength can be seen in a few areas revenue growth solid financial position with reasonable debt and very reasonable and cheap valuation the profit margins are lower when comparing to peers right now but baba business have much to grow and much to be expected to fix that issue Baba stock experienced little decline in most recent quarter in comparison to performance from same quarter a year before but i

can compare them to every big tech you know they stand with the big dogs AMZN GOOG AAPL MSFT but they get less attention at the moment i think the sentiment towards alibaba is bound to change very soon Why BABA why now baba showed negative performance relative to the other tech stocks at the moment market sentiment due to politics alot of impact on the stock but baba strength can be seen in a few areas revenue growth solid financial position with reasonable debt and very reasonable and cheap valuation the profit margins are lower when comparing to peers right now but baba business have much to grow and much to be expected to fix that issue Baba stock experienced little decline in most recent quarter in comparison to performance from same quarter a year before but i think the next

the few remaining reopening recovery plays to really take off The Roaring 2020s People are desperately looking to get out and go somewhere And where would you want to go after being cooped up in the house year long The beach of course Thanks to the money printer US total personal savings have almost doubled from pre pandemic levels You bet some of it is going to be blown on nice vacations We have all witnessed how the recovery plays took off in the past few months leaving tech FD chads who had been winning last year on the breadline Last week was not so good for these plays but many of them are still not at levels worth buying the dip While any recovery stock has been literally free money so far as the boomers over at CNBC say tHe eAsY mOnEy hAs bEeN mAdE It is now time to pick the clear winners of the reopening The market is bigly underestimating pent up leisure demand Playa Hotels amp Resorts is a luxury all inclusive oceanfront resort chain with hotels and properties in Mexico

will be just be going back to normal by next Jan which is usually peak demand season for their beach resorts However they are going to absolutely crush the numbers from previous years as their business is picking up steam rapidly Their average room rate is already exploding and they could be operating at peak demand from July which is unprecedented Their June and July rates have also

kayak com also points to an increase in traffic to the locations where PLYA has resorts All this without significant traffic from Europe Canada and Asia They have been slower to reopen compared to the US but when they inevitably do expect the demand to skyrocket even higher Unlike many recovery plays they have pricing power And they are going to absolutely milk this opportunity by charging top

5e94839cee17f93b1b4d7d818084cf92b25f354a That is a nice way of saying that they will be adopting a fuck you pay me approach to doing business when demand booms So they were anticipating this and planning accordingly So far it looks like they are going to have a blowout quarter Financials Not that y all care but they have a healthy balance sheet They raised cash back in Jan with an underwritten public offering of shares Cash and cash equivalents are up and debt and liabilities are down compared to the previous quarter so there is little chance of further dilution now that their

upgraded the PT from 8 00 to 10 00 Even Bank of America which which used to have a 1 5 PT on our beloved gamestonk has initiated coverage recently with a PT of 10 00 Technicals I passed PLYA through u pennyether s tried and tested SMELL system Short Interest SI is currently estimated to be 7 03M shares by MarketWatch which is about 5 5 of the float Even though it is low which is good news fundamentally ya apes this is a very illiquid stock with an average volume of 1 29M shares and 5 34 days to cover So shorts covering quickly due to the market waking up to the potential should give a nice boost to the SP Market Cap Market Cap is 1 23bn Extremely Memeable Memeable Idk I really like how the ticker sounds Low Liquidity Average volume is just 1 29M shares 9 38M or 0 7 of market cap Institutional ownership is high and sits at 75 74 which makes it even more illiquid Low IV IV is currently at 51 64 with the IV Percentile at 10 and an IV rank of 4 46 So the IV currently is nearly as low as it gets for PLYA I have seen that many of you regularly make generous recurring weekly donations to our favorite market maker Citadel by buying overpriced FDs with IV above 200 so here is a chance to not do that I don t play with crayons but PLYA briefly dipped to the 100 day SMA last week with JPow tanking the market and the general drubbing of the recovery plays Expecting this short term dip to be eaten up very quickly Also I am just another tard and did not come up with the trade I shamelessly copied most of the stuff from the amazing research done by Chris Camillo The incredibly successful social arb trader in Jack Schwager s Unknown Market Wizards and friends who specifically hunt for opportunities like this This trade has gone under the radar so far though I suspect it shall not remain so for long Bear case The only bear case I can think of is another COVID surge which could potentially drive down demand but the chances of that happening in the short term is small enough to neglect imo Even then they are less likely to be affected compared to other hotel chains as they don t have any business locations TLDR People are flush with cash and the pent up demand for leisure is exploding PLYA is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this with their amazing all inclusive beach resorts and the market has failed to appreciate it so far Technicals and fundamentals point to a good entry now Positions Commons are safe but I am allergic to commons and playing options only Jul 7 5C Betting on the market realizing that Playa is going to absolutely crush

by Rafael Freitas amp x200B TASA3 TASA4 amp x200B 1Q21 amp x200B Possibly this is the last thread I will do about the role I ve already exposed the bulk of the thesis here and it all ends up getting boring Share capital CVM358 balance sheets expenses Everything has already been said Exceptionally something very off the radar I I come back here out of respect for those who followed the news to talk about something more complex about the case amp x200B Let s get to the result Trying to model what was to come in this first quarter the accounts were simple Always taking 4Q20 as a reference Most of the data was already known we would have amp x200B an average dollar of 5 48 for revenue 1 7 and 5 70 9 6 last ptax for cash markdown company debt QoQ Obviously generating the well known financial expense for us eroding a good part of the period s net income We also knew that production would have ended the quarter with 8 500 weapons day against 8 200 a d The transfer of 13 2 of IGPM on revenue from the domestic market and obviously the average ticket which was perhaps the main point to be addressed by the company at 210U consolidated in 2020 amp x200B Now in a call with RI there was already the theoretical information that the average production for the quarter would have been slightly lower than the peak production in late March What didn t cross my mind was that this number would come 7 lower Yes we ended 1Q21 with an average of 7 900 weapons day All this was addressed to with the company From the outset it is understood that every manufacturing process involves issues that a simple rule of 3 does not include There were mandatory vacations fewer working days and training that would imply optimizing your current process lines That said at first the revenue below 4Q20 caught my attention Again the issue of daily production ends up being one of the reasons Going further I bring up a reflection on the company s audit regarding this amount of weapons produced daily The volume was higher QoQ which instinctively it would not make sense if the 8 200 guns day of the 4Q had been conceived This is something of internal management which I will cover later especially regarding the upcoming production Anyway let s go back despite the theoretical shortfall in this first quarter of the year the volume amp x200B GREATER produced thus attention is paid to SMALLER revenue in addition to a SALES volume also LOWER QoQ Let s do it by steps Synthesizing We produce more sell less and generate less revenue per weapon sold Average Ticket dropped Why did this happen We don t have the entire backorder sold It is here that the main points of this balance reside which are not explicit to those who look only at the numbers 1 The QoQ stock grew 35 2 The ticket actually fell 498 000 weapons were sold 512 5M of revenue generated Dollar 5 48 This makes us reach a average ticket of 187 8U per quarter in question 11 lower than the 2020 consolidated amp x200B What the fuck was that haha amp x200B Everything needs to be analyzed calmly They exist reasons for the above Once again everything was promptly addressed to the company which was very helpful in answering all points The ticket dropped due to turnover and breakdown of sales and specific production in the 1Q Mostly low value products were sold like Heritage which would tend to generate less revenue for us but higher margin So it was done Follows message from CFO S rgio The ticket being disclosed only in the 4Q annual result has a reason This composition is dynamic The 2Q will contain billing for Rifles amp x200B amp x200B being sold for at least 560U 200 above the 1Q ticket The company continues with its relentless commitment to add the increase in this consolidated average ticket in 2021 as this is one of the main points where there is room for Taurus to grow at the expense of its competitors Therefore this potential revenue additive should appear in the next results The stock inventory and its fattening Why was this production not readily transformed into sales given the backorder sold The answer is simpler than it sounds and brings out once again real life stuff Logistics Yes logistics The majority of BR production takes an average of 15 20 days to arrive in the US Included in this current stock are weapons destined for bids already known by the market and quite possibly part of the GX4 with scheduled release for May 19th Let s go back to quantitative analysis and company perspectives Commented on this adverse issue of the audit regarding the average daily production of weapons this time the doubt was removed so that there was no room for interpretation Taurus 2Q21 is operating with a daily production capacity of 9 510 weapons per day 20 more than the 1Q21 average Capabilities

commented on both by RI and by Sal sio But there is always pragmatism on both sides and this in fact is the best way to follow This number implies paying for the complete backorder of the company still in 2021 At least as far as its production is concerned Final sales could spill over into 1Q22 Little changes What needs to be highlighted is the company s current potential Which is NOT in the prices and NOT it reflects the maximum capacity they can get as I see many preaching The case today reflects strategic planning delivery There is no longer the asymmetry of a turnaround however what is on the table still exposes us to a beautiful earning potential I will not amp x200B bring up here calculations and calculations of how much revenue would tend to generate from the total sale of this backorder much less how much the 2021 consolidated ticket could be You need to sensitize scenarios with an average dollar for this year and understand where you are getting into I remain very calm with the charge of my position even having increased it at the beginning of the trading session Finally the debt just to make an imagination of the scenario in terms of multiples Net debt closed the quarter at 665 7m With 221 5M in the maturity profile for 2021 100M rollable Forget about those projections they brought in on the balance sheet including the sale of helmets and land in POA Use this as an add on if they materialize 2021 final EV gt I ll embed the remaining T13 and T15 deleveraging here full subscription and do not put anything on the account of the T17s still in circulation That would take us to 80M provided with this strand I will use the 5 40 dollar as a base both to calculate debt and ebitda That said keeping the current composition unchanged we would have 40M currency exposure Now the main point when measuring the company s enterprise value The possible cash until the end of 2021 Excluding the debt that will have to be paid by the end of that year 110M and adding 150M of capex announced by the company these launches can be diluted I ll just normalize 1Q21 EBIT to imagine where we would be headed 168 4 3T remaining EV 115 000 000 diluted Q13 Q15 26 00

Hate it You will never stop hearing about it And here s why Palantir was created for a world that didn t exist yet A world where information and data would become so large no human workforce could ever be able to manage it effectively let alone extrapolate insight from So what s data do It either sits there or becomes a parasite on you for companies like google and facebook to target your dollars in the form of user specific ads This way of utilizing data is indeed parasitic and Palantir rejects this use of data in everyway possible But what if data wasn t used to fuck over your own customers but instead used to help save them money and resources Perhaps their lives Restore supply chains accelerate cancer research and help restore the world to somewhat normalcy post pandemic The sophisticated tools required to manage this type of data would have been inconceivable No one predicated this kind of disjunction Well maybe some but no company that would sacrifice half their revenue in R amp D to solve problems of this magnitude they may or may not come to fruition No one Except 1 company Valued at less than 1 billion back in 2010 then up to 9 billion in 2013 and 20 billion in 2015 And as high as 41 billion right before becoming public Palantir 40x in 10 years is impressive but its total addressable market would suggest a runaway so large and growing so fast that those returns are far from over How big is this market Well Looking at the S 1 Filings it s estimated to be 119 billion This is broken down into 63 billion in government and 56 billion in commercial This is less than a fucking percent How fast is it expanding Well the S 1 is old news in my opinion of the macrotrend that Alex Karp says is happening This comes from COO Shyam Sankar himself And and with our investments in the end to end sensor to shooter workflows from space to mud we re not just going after the roughly 60 billion of government IT spend anymore we re talking about the quarter trillion dollars of U S DOD weapons system spend in 2020 This is fucking huge And is completely overfucking looked Everyone is still looking at the S1 filings about PLTR s TAM and its just wrong it s so far much more now This is why perhaps that government revenue is actually picking up at a more rapid pace despite it being their main customer base to this date Government revenue grew at 68 YoY in Q3 2020 and in Q1 2021 it was 72 percent With US revenue at 83 All in all I believe that a price to sales ratio of 40 is completely justified This TAM is most definitely expanding into the commercial space as well As IBM pointed out 90 of all data has been generated in the last 2 years alone This means that the data is growing faster then people can analyze it This is where software like Palantir will be crucial in the future What we re seeing with covid is all but just 1 example of how Palantir has been preparing for a future of disjunction Palantir s investments only exacerbates the obviousness of the problem the large amounts of disperse data creates They re putting their money where their mouth is by not only putting half of their revenue into R amp D 561 Million up 100 from 2018 but taking whatever s left over into data intensive business startups that utilize Palantir software These actions of SPAC investments are probably more or less on Peter Thiel s part considering he s created the Founder s Fund and has a track record of picking innovative companies This doesn t suggest that Palantir is slowing down and that Palantir simply doesn t know where to put their money but they re more or less trying to plant seeds in industries and sectors that they are wanting to penetrate Not only could they see significant returns that startups that succeed bring about but also an increase in reputation and a testament of Palantir s usefulness in that sector They want to make examples like BP saving 50 million in the first 2 weeks to potentially a billion a year off using Palantir s software become the Rule and not the Exception to the Rule Palantir s usefulness is not niche but can be applied across any sector I don t want to consider this DD as I barely did any research that I m sure most of you guys already didn t know My main point here is the counter argument to Palantir s valuation And the skepticism surrounding its potential slow down in the future In my opinion Palantir and their competitors aren t growing as fast as the TAM and that s why I don t expect to see revenue both on commercial or government to grow slower than 45 in a couple years when the entire commercial sector will start to generate so much data that they ll have to switch to something new then their own built in piece by piece enterprise software that simply just doesn t work This is the reoccurring problem Palantir has on it s sales side It s not other software enterprise companies that they mainly compete with but their own customers they try to build their own systems If they can get this much revenue from less than 200 customers not to mention that the top 20 customers continue to pay 30 more for their subscriptions on a YoY basis then any fear of a slowdown should not be on your mind when deciding whether or not to purchase Palantir stock My main concern for Palantir is ironically how much cash it has I say ironic because Peter Thiel ripped in Googles cash hoard saying they aren t innovative enough to know how to use their 50 billion cash hoard Now Palantir only has 2 3 billion cash but there market cap is much smaller than Googles back in 2012 when their massive cash hoard was addressed 50 billion Vs Googles 270 billion Now this cash hoard isn t nearly as severe and a drag as google s through the forces of inflation but it does pose some headwind if they cannot utilize it in innovative ways Now Palantir has invested in 4 additional SPACs that I m aware of since their ER Perhaps 5 Idk if the partnership with Primer includes a PIPE investment and perhaps we may actually see a decrease next quarter on their cash on hand which I m not opposed to as long as its being reinvested in some way amp x200B TLDR Palantir may be a multibillion dollar company but the the billions of dollars spent on R amp D are just now beginning to pay as the macrotrends are beginning to point closer and closer to companies like Palantir to be the next solution to the next problems that will plague the world in the not too distant future Positions 4882 shares 24 01 cost basis

do long term investments This is not a pump and dump maneuver I back my investments with data First of all I would like to disclose that I used to work for an investment fund as a commodities consultant My job was to go through earning reports and keep up with geopolitical bullshit all over the globe Now I trade with my own funds I work for myself Now let s go back to J Pow He said a couple of days ago that they expect inflation to go up My autistic brain tells me that there will be some market movement and some funds will change hands He also said that the rates would eventually go up What will happen in the next 6 months to a year With a higher Fed interest rate Macroeconomically high growth stocks will go down as well Dow stocks because it will become more expensive to borrow money However that change is scheduled two years down the road so why the transition will happen faster Because big capital is always ahead of the market that s why those pendejos stay rich Big capital will dump all their high growth shit and move to safer options As for inflation rate higher rates trigger a transfer from growth stocks to commodities because those are considered refuge assets Gold Silver and all the other shit that your grandma loves to buy is part of that Those things will go up but me I don t fuck with that boomer shit because I d rather invest in a commodity that

and store them in your mom s shed and sell them in a couple of years or option two own stocks from a mining company that has a good outlook I personally chose option two but you do you When I researched the different stocks here are the final five that made the cut Rio Tinto NYSE RIO https stockmarket com ticker symbol RIO Southern Copper Corporation NYSE SCCO https stockmarket com ticker symbol SCCO Newmont Corporation NYSE NEM https stockmarket com ticker symbol NEM Freeport McMoRan Inc NYSE FCX https stockmarket com ticker symbol FCX Turquoise Hill Resources NYSE TRQ From the title of the article you can tell that TRQ is the one I picked Why Presently It has a P E ratio of about 5 2 This stock is CHEAP for what the company delivers The fundamentals are solid Debt is under control and all the other metrics are solid Trust me I checked After many years of development and negotiation with the government of Mongolia The mine it owns finally started delivering The first of SIX Oyu Tolgoi deposits is beating yield expectations by almost the double The first open pit deposit is scheduled to be followed by a more promising underground deposit expected to deliver 550 000 tons of copper yearly by 2025 from about 145 000 now I hate Rio Tinto because it always fucked poor people over by bribing government officials around the world and pillaged their resources Rio Tinto managed to own 51 of TRQ via hostile acquisitions and is now trying to dilute the stock and the goal is to own the whole fucking thing They found some success because the stock suffered some big setbacks due to a heavy short activity Their pressure won t last though because TRQ is gaining a lot of visibility among investors gained about 15 the last three days Again you need to do your own research and you ll figure out why this stock is promising Stop being lazy and stop believing everything you read on Reddit

There is a big opportunity for non alcoholic beverage companies post pandemic with the demand of beverages from restaurants resurfacing as they go back to full capacity This can help beverage companies especially if they are able to maintain their current level of at home sales Given my valuation techniques and the valuations of analysts there is a broad consensus that Monster beverages is undervalued and presents a good buying opportunity Based off of the plan that I formulated near the end of this report there is a potential upside to an investment in Monster of 14 13 However there are always risks to investments which are highlighted later in this report Company Information Monster develops markets sells and distributes their energy drink beverages under 32 different brand names most notably Monster Reign and NOS For reporting purposes Monster has 3 operating reporting segments Monster Energy Drinks Strategic Brands Other Brands AFF American Fruits and Flavors develops and manufactures the flavours for Monster s drinks After these flavors are perfected approved the recipes are passed on to third party bottlers and packers This means that Monster does not manufacture their own drinks but they outsource them Investment Information Macroeconomic Outlook The beverage industry was heavily affected by COVID and the lockdowns that ensued COVID forced restaurants bars bistro s etc to shut their doors which meant that they would no longer need to be purchasing beverages from the beverage companies that the carry This resulted in a massive decline in sales in this segment for beverage companies However some beverage companies offset this loss through exhibiting an increased number of in home consumption sales As we are starting to open back up the demand for beverages from restaurants will start to pick up as well and hopefully return back to normal However it will be interesting to see if these beverage companies can still maintain a higher level of in home sales than pre pandemic times If these companies can manage to do that and the demand from restaurants picks back up they will be able to post great revenues and perhaps beat earnings estimates If these companies beat these estimates than it is very likely that we see their stock price shoot up as a result Analysts are forecasting a bounce back once we start to reopen as well as they have projected the non alcoholic beverage industry will grow at a 6 CAGR over the next 5 years Sources COVID 19 Impact on food amp beverage consumer products companies deloitte com https www2 deloitte com

Inferno Energy 2 Strategic Brands This segment includes BPM BU Burn Full Throttle Fury Gladiator Live Mother Nalu NOS Play Power Play Predator Relentless Samurai and Ultra Energy 3 Other Brands This segment consists of AFF American Fruits and Flavors selling products to third party customers Intellectual Property Currently Monster beverages owns in the process of owning over 14 200 trademarks worldwide on their beverage names and the graphics content on their packaging Monster believes that these trademarks are an important part of their business as they will be able to pursue businesses who are using their product names without the authorization of Monster These trademarks are not advantageous to Monster based off of the fact that they can do something their competitors cannot however these trademarks help them to uphold their brand name and product names to their own standards and profit off of copycats Seasonality Monster has recognized that their sales are the best during the second and third quarters of each year They have attributed this seasonality to the change in weather during these months Their reasoning for this is when it is winter in countries that have large weather changes ie Canada there is not as much to do and the weather may make it harder to buy their products Monster has also found that the seasonality of their energy beverages are not as volatile variable as traditional non alcoholic beverages Financial Information Financial Performance Good Monster has increased their revenues by 9 47 YoY their gross profit by 8 14 net income by 27 26 decreased their effective tax rate to 13 3 from 21 7 and has a 59 2 gross margin Monster had a great financial performance in 2020 and is very profitable which should generate some excitement among investors increasing the demand for their stock Financial Performance Bad Monster s cost of sales increased by 14 13 YoY which is worrying given that the cost of sales increased more than actual sales hurts margins their gross profit decreased from 60 2019 to 59 2 2020 this was a result of the cost of sales increase mentioned above Additionally Monster s sales in quarter 2 of 2020 were down by about 1 this is understandable due to the uncertainty with COVID during this quarter Outstanding Options Currently Monster has 8 323 000 shares outstanding in options that can be exercised this year If all of these options were to be converted into common shares and sold on the market it would cause a dilutionary effect of 1 57 RSU s and PSU s Restricted Performance Stock Units In 2021 Monster will have 947 000 RSU s and PSU s to award to their employees If all of these units are vested in 2021 then it would cause a dilutionary effect of 0 18 March 2020 Repurchase Program In March of 2020 Monster s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program that would allow the company to repurchase 500M worth of common stocks In 2020 Monster repurchased 58 5M worth of shares and have 441 5M left to repurchase shares in the future If Monster was to use all of this money to repurchase shares which they tend to do within the year then Monster will be repurchasing about 7 905 103 shares at 55 85 share which is the agreed upon price If all of these shares were repurchased then the existing shares will rise in value by about 1 5 Employee Stock Purchases Monster s employees repurchased 200 000 shares in 2020 inflating existing shares by approximately 0 04 Analyst Coverage The low analyst estimate for Monster is 92 share the average estimate is 104 11 share and the high estimate is 118 share These estimates come from 21 different analysts and I found this data via the Wall Street Journal https www wsj com market data quotes MNST research ratings Competition In order to undergo my comparable analysis I had to find 4 companies that I could compare to Monster These companies needed to be public companies with financial ratios and multiples that I could compare against Monster have similar market caps although this is not a priority in a niche industry in the stock market like energy drinks operate in similar geographies and have similar businesses operations To best check off these items as listed above I decided to choose the following 4 companies to compare KDP Keurig Dr Pepper CELH Celsius Holdings FIZZ National Beverage Corp and KO The Coca Cola Company Investment Valuation Comparable Analyses EV Assets By comparing Monster s EV Assets multiple to that of their competitors found in the competitors section of this report I arrived at a fair value of Monster of 141 80 If this was to be true the upside of this investment would be 54 96 This is very high and contradicts the results found in the DCF model thus I decided to undergo another comparable EV Revenue By comparing Monster s EV Revenue multiple to their competitors I found that Monster s fair value should be 128 46 which would imply an upside to such an investment of 40 38 Once again this is very high and contradicts the results achieved in the DCF model However I decided to undergo another comparable to see If this high valuation was consistent among comparable analyses P E By comparing Monster s P E ratio to their competitors I arrived at a fair value of 353 32 which would imply an upside of 286 10 This is extremely high however it confirms that the comparable indicate that Monster is severely undervalued In order to get one final valuation I decided to take a weighted average of the result achieved through the comparable analyses Weighted Average Comparable I assigned a 45 weight to the figures achieved in the EV Assets and EV Revenue multiples and assigned a 10 weight to the figure achieved in the P E ratio By doing this I arrived at a fair value of Monster of 156 95 which implies a share price increase of 71 51 Plan Any entrance into a position under the 92 mark helps to limit the downside as it is below the low analyst price target If the price decreases below 87 75 I will exit my position and look for a re entrance at the 78 33 level and potentially even the 67 67 level if the prices dipped this much I will look to sell my shares if the price reaches 105 share which is justified through my average result from both the comparable and the DCF model and this level is also near the average analyst estimate Risks Financial Performance Based off of their high valuation when comparing their current price to the fair value I achieved in my DCF model investors may be pricing in high earnings and growth However if Monster is not able to live up to this expected growth then investors may dump their shares which will hurt the share price Share Dilution As I stated in the financial information section of this report Monster has a couple of different streams of potential share dilution The main 2 forms of dilution in Monster are their outstanding options and their RSU s PSU s which can combine for a total dilutionary effect of 1 75 This is not bad at all as many companies exhibit way higher dilution however it is something that investors should still pay mind to Catalysts Financial Performance As previously stated some investors may be pricing in good financial performance from Monster However if they are able to outperform these optimistic estimates then their share price will soar This can be seen through their Q2 2020 financial performance as they beat earnings by a fair amount and as a result their share price jumped by over 6 5 Share Repurchase Monster has previously repurchased their shares which is good to see as an investor This is not expected to change anytime soon as monster has authorized 441M in share buybacks through their March 2020 repurchase program Additionally employees have the option to buy back shares as well In total Monster has the ability to repurchase over 8 1M shares which will increase the value of the existing shares by 1 54 This repurchasing can offset majority of the effects of their dilution and makes the share dilution less of a risk This should help limit the risk for potential investors and entice them into entering a position Re opening Reopening could help Monster to drive their sales as it is likely that they will start to notice higher demand from restaurants as they start to re open and reach full capacity This increased demand can help Monster to grow their sales hugely if Monster can find a way to keep their at home sales up Full analysis can be found here https utradea com positions Dont be scared of an investment into

undervalued and presents a good buying opportunity Based off of the plan that I formulated near the end of this report there is a potential upside to an investment in Monster of 14 13 However there are always risks to investments which are highlighted later in this report Company Information Monster develops markets sells and distributes their energy drink beverages under 32 different brand names most notably Monster Reign and NOS For reporting purposes Monster has 3 operating reporting segments Monster Energy Drinks Strategic Brands Other Brands AFF American Fruits and Flavors develops and manufactures the flavours for Monster s drinks After these flavors are perfected approved the recipes are passed on to third party bottlers and packers This means that Monster does not manufacture their own drinks but they outsource them Investment Information Macroeconomic Outlook The beverage industry was heavily affected by COVID and the lockdowns that ensued COVID forced restaurants bars bistro s etc to shut their doors which meant that they would no longer need to be purchasing beverages from the beverage companies that the carry This resulted in a massive decline in sales in this segment for beverage companies However some beverage companies offset this loss through exhibiting an increased number of in home consumption sales As we are starting to open back up the demand for beverages from restaurants will start to pick up as well and hopefully return back to normal However it will be interesting to see if these beverage companies can still maintain a higher level of in home sales than pre pandemic times If these companies can manage to do that and the demand from restaurants picks back up they will be able to post great revenues and perhaps beat earnings estimates If these companies beat these estimates than it is very likely that we see their stock price shoot up as a result Analysts are forecasting a bounce back once we start to reopen as well as they have projected the non alcoholic beverage industry will grow at a 6 CAGR over the next 5 years Sources COVID 19 Impact on food amp beverage consumer products companies deloitte com https www2 deloitte com

https www marketdataforecast com market reports non alcoholic beverage market Segments 1 Monster Energy Drinks This segment consists of Monster s Energy Drinks Monster Espresso Energy Drinks Monster Java Energy Drinks Monster Coffee Energy Drinks Monster Energy Teas Monster Muscle Monster Maxx Monster Rehab and Monster Hydro Furthermore this segment also includes Reign Total Body Fuel and Reign Inferno Energy 2 Strategic Brands This segment includes BPM BU Burn Full Throttle Fury Gladiator Live Mother Nalu NOS Play Power Play Predator Relentless Samurai and Ultra Energy 3 Other Brands This segment consists of AFF American Fruits and Flavors selling products to third party customers Intellectual Property Currently Monster beverages owns in the process of owning over 14 200 trademarks worldwide on their beverage names and the graphics content on their packaging Monster believes that these trademarks are an important part of their business as they will be able to pursue businesses who are using their product names without the authorization of Monster These trademarks are not advantageous to Monster based off of the fact that they can do something their competitors cannot however these trademarks help them to uphold their brand name and product names to their own standards and profit off of copycats Seasonality Monster has recognized that their sales are the best during the second and third quarters of each year They have attributed this seasonality to the change in weather during these months Their reasoning for this is when it is winter in countries that have large weather changes ie Canada there is not as much to do and the weather may make it harder to buy their products Monster has also found that the seasonality of their energy beverages are not as volatile variable as traditional non alcoholic beverages Financial Information Financial Performance Good Monster has increased their revenues by 9 47 YoY their gross profit by 8 14 net income by 27 26 decreased their effective tax rate to 13 3 from 21 7 and has a 59 2 gross margin Monster had a great financial performance in 2020 and is very profitable which should generate some excitement among investors increasing the demand for their stock Financial Performance Bad Monster s cost of sales increased by 14 13 YoY which is worrying given that the cost of sales increased more than actual sales hurts margins their gross profit decreased from 60 2019 to 59 2 2020 this was a result of the cost of sales increase mentioned above Additionally Monster s sales in quarter 2 of 2020 were down by about 1 this is understandable due to the uncertainty with COVID during this quarter Outstanding Options Currently Monster has 8 323 000 shares outstanding in options that can be exercised this year If all of these options were to be converted into common shares and sold on the market it would cause a dilutionary effect of 1 57 RSU s and PSU s Restricted Performance Stock Units In 2021 Monster will have 947 000 RSU s and PSU s to award to their employees If all of these units are vested in 2021 then it would cause a dilutionary effect of 0 18 March 2020 Repurchase Program In March of 2020 Monster s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program that would allow the company to repurchase 500M worth of common stocks In 2020 Monster repurchased 58 5M worth of shares and have 441 5M left to repurchase shares in the future If Monster was to use all of this money to repurchase shares which they tend to do within the year then Monster will be repurchasing about 7 905 103 shares at 55 85 share which is the agreed upon price If all of these shares were repurchased then the existing shares will rise in value by about 1 5 Employee Stock Purchases Monster s employees repurchased 200 000 shares in 2020 inflating existing shares by approximately 0 04 Analyst Coverage The low analyst estimate for Monster is 92 share the average estimate is 104 11 share and the high estimate is 118 share These estimates come from 21 different analysts and I found this data via the Wall Street Journal https www wsj com market data quotes MNST research ratings Competition In order to undergo my comparable analysis I had to find 4 companies that I could compare to Monster These companies needed to be public companies with financial ratios and multiples that I could compare against Monster have similar market caps although this is not a priority in a niche industry in the stock market like energy drinks operate in similar geographies and have similar businesses operations To best check off these items as listed above I decided to choose the following 4 companies to compare KDP Keurig Dr Pepper CELH Celsius Holdings FIZZ National Beverage Corp and KO The Coca Cola Company Investment Valuation Comparable Analyses EV Assets By comparing Monster s EV Assets multiple to that of their competitors found in the competitors section of this report I arrived at a fair value of Monster of 141 80 If this was to be true the upside of this investment would be 54 96 This is very high and contradicts the results found in the DCF model thus I decided to undergo another comparable EV Revenue By comparing Monster s EV Revenue multiple to their competitors I found that Monster s fair value should be 128 46 which would imply an upside to such an investment of 40 38 Once again this is very high and contradicts the results achieved in the DCF model However I decided to undergo another comparable to see If this high valuation was consistent among comparable analyses P E By comparing Monster s P E ratio to their competitors I arrived at a fair value of 353 32 which would imply an upside of 286 10 This is extremely high however it confirms that the comparable indicate that Monster is severely undervalued In order to get one final valuation I decided to take a weighted average of the result achieved through the comparable analyses Weighted Average Comparable I assigned a 45 weight to the figures achieved in the EV Assets and EV Revenue multiples and assigned a 10 weight to the figure achieved in the P E ratio By doing this I arrived at a fair value of Monster of 156 95 which implies a share price increase of 71 51 Plan Any entrance into a position under the 92 mark helps to limit the downside as it is below the low analyst price target If the price decreases below 87 75 I will exit my position and look for a re entrance at the 78 33 level and potentially even the 67 67 level if the prices dipped this much I will look to sell my shares if the price reaches 105 share which is justified through my average result from both the comparable and the DCF model and this level is also near the average analyst estimate Risks Financial Performance Based off of their high valuation when comparing their current price to the fair value I achieved in my DCF model investors may be pricing in high earnings and growth However if Monster is not able to live up to this expected growth then investors may dump their shares which will hurt the share price Share Dilution As I stated in the financial information section of this report Monster has a couple of different streams of potential share dilution The main 2 forms of dilution in Monster are their outstanding options and their RSU s PSU s which can combine for a total dilutionary effect of 1 75 This is not bad at all as many companies exhibit way higher dilution however it is something that investors should still pay mind to Catalysts Financial Performance As previously stated some investors may be pricing in good financial performance from Monster However if they are able to outperform these optimistic estimates then their share price will soar This can be seen through their Q2 2020 financial performance as they beat earnings by a fair amount and as a result their share price jumped by over 6 5 Share Repurchase Monster has previously repurchased their shares which is good to see as an investor This is not expected to change anytime soon as monster has authorized 441M in share buybacks through their March 2020 repurchase program Additionally employees have the option to buy back shares as well In total Monster has the ability to repurchase over 8 1M shares which will increase the value of the existing shares by 1 54 This repurchasing can offset majority of the effects of their dilution and makes the share dilution less of a risk This should help limit the risk for potential investors and entice them into entering a position Re opening Reopening could help Monster to drive their sales as it is likely that they will start to notice higher demand from restaurants as they start to re open and reach full capacity This increased demand can help Monster to grow their sales hugely if Monster can find a way to keep their at home sales up Full analysis can be found here https utradea com positions Dont be scared to invest into Monster

comments o6kycx dont be scared of an investment into monster mnst and following up with one about DKS Investment Thesis Recently due to the pandemic many sporting goods stores have struggled to make money and the sector is expected to bounce back this year Dicks was one of the lucky few to report a profitable year However Dicks did not just have a profitable year they were able to have an incredible year and impress investors by beating estimates by a long shot As a result of their recent successes I have decided to look into Dick s and find out if it is a good investment and if they can keep outperforming their industry competition According to my valuation techniques Dicks is undervalued and has the potential to grow By following the plan set out in this report if everything goes to plan the potential return of an investment into Dicks will be 23 77 There are risks to every investment these risks are highlighted at the end of the report Along with the risks there are several catalysts that are also listed at the end of this report Company Overview Founded in 1948 Dick s Sporting Goods https utradea com stocks DKS is a leading sporting goods retailer in the USA that offers high quality equipment apparel footwear and accessories to their customers Currently there are 730 Dick s locations across the USA and own operate 125 Golf Galaxy and Field amp Stream stores also in the USA Dick s goal is to create confidence and excitement by equipping their athletes customers with the necessary equipment to enjoy their sporting experience Investment Information Macroeconomic Outlook COVID 19 had a negative impact on the sporting goods and sportswear industries However some companies were able to perform well due to their ability to change their operations to fit around COVID ie Online DTC curbside pick up etc The companies that were able to adapt the quickest and most effectively were the ones that succeeded big time Fortunately Dicks already had an E Commerce presence but due to the pandemic were able to focus on this channel more and further develop their online store to be one of the best Dick s was able to grow their online sales by 100 YoY due to the pandemic and their increased focus on their eCommerce store Due to the pandemic many sports leagues were closed down as people were advised to stay at home Although this was not favourable for sporting good companies there was an increased participation in home workouts and increased demand for activewear This helped companies to offset their losses in sporting goods and perform well financially during the pandemic Although this industry was hit hard they are expected to bounce back very quickly as the world starts to open back up again This industry is expected to grow 14 7 this year and 7 yearly until 2025 However as we know Dick s performed well last year and I expect them to outperform other companies as the USA starts to reopen Sources State of the sporting goods industry

text The 20global 20sporting 20and 20athletic 20goods 20market 20is 20expected 20to CAGR 20of 2014 7 25 amp text The 20market 20is 20expected 20to at 20a 20CAGR 20of 207 25 Financial Information Financial Performance Good Over the past year Dick s has been able to increase their revenues by 9 5 while only exhibiting an increase in the cost of revenue of 5 44 This helped to increase Dick s gross profit by 19 42 and increase their net income by 78 26 Furthermore Dick s was able to increase their profit margin to 31 8 from 29 2 and increase their operating income by 97 60 This financial performance is fantastic and gets investors excited about future financial performances and potential future expansion Financial Performance Bad Over the past year Dick s has increased their interest expense by 186 93 which is a lot and is a result of them taking on 85 19 more debt It is not good to see them taking on this much debt However they should be able to pay off their debt as their current and quick ratios are good Share Repurchase Program On June 12th 2019 the board of directors approved a 5 year share repurchase program that authorizes over 1B of funds available to repurchase shares If these shares were all to be purchased assuming their current price of 95 01 they would be able to purchase 10 525 208 shares over the next 3 years which would increase the value of existing shares by 12 79 Knowing this we can expect 292 367 shares to be purchased each month increasing the value of existing shares by roughly 0 33 per month Opening Stores In 2020 Dick s was able to add 2 of their own stores and 2 of their specialty concepts stores to their total number of stores open The fact that they were able to add new shares during the pandemic is a good sign given the fact that retail stores did not perform very well in 2020 It will be interesting to see this year s number of new stores given the re opening of the country and getting things back to normal Liquidity Dick s has increased their cash and cash equivalents position by 2292 64 to 1 66B This huge cash position should help them to be able to meet short term cash and interest requirements It would be nice to see them use some of this cash to expand operations and try to grow rather than their cash sitting idle however it provides a safety net which will draw in investors Convertible Shares Currently Dick is has a total of 849 000 possible shares that are not yet issued and will be issued if their instrument s are converted If all of these shares were to be converted it would cause a dilutionary effect of 0 95 Equity Compensation Plan Under Dick s equity compensation plan they have 4 352 896 shares that are yet to be issued through the exercise of warrants rights and options Additionally they have 848 800 shares in actual common shares that are yet to be issued Totalling these two figures arrives at a total of 5 201 696 shares that are yet to be issued under their plan However if these shares were to be issued it would cause a dilutionary effect of 5 83 Corporate Social Responsibility According to the US Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment the total Assets Under Management AUM for ESG companies increased by 42 over the past two years ESG stands for Environmental Social and Governance and companies labelled as ESG have social missions and aim for equality in the workplace People who are investing into these types of companies are said to be sustainable investors Knowing that this type of investing is growing quick can be good for companies like Dick s who are constantly looking for ways to be more responsible What Dick s has already done Dicks has already diverted 29 000 pounds of plastic waste from landfills and oceans via their partnership with First Mile Dicks has reduced their scope 1 amp 2 GHG emissions by 28 What Dick s is planning to do 2021 Goals Maintain their gender pay ratio of 100 This means that they pay men and women the same for the same roles in the company no matter if it is a member of management or an employee 2024 Goals By 2024 Dick s plans to donate enough money and merchandise so that they can give over 1 000 000 kids the chance to play sports 2025 Goals By 2025 Dicks plans to eliminate all single use point of sale plastic from all of their stores nationwide Furthermore Dick s is also planning to meet disclosure standards their Human Rights Watch Transparency Pledge for all of their vertical brands Comparable Analyses In order to undergo this analysis I compared Dick s financial ratios to that of their public competitors found above in the competitors section EV EBITDA By undergoing this comparable I was able to find the fair value of Dick s to be 97 27 which would imply a share price increase of 3 29 from current prices This supports the argument that Dick s is undervalued however this comparable argues that Dick s is undervalued by far less than the DCF estimates Dick s to be EV Revenue These comparable estimates the fair value of Dick s to be 88 88 which would imply a share price decrease of 5 62 Unlike the previous 2 valuations this comparable argues that Dick s is overvalued so I decided to undergo one more comparable to get a final verdict P E By undergoing this comparable the fair value of Dicks was estimated to be 104 33 which would imply a share price increase of 10 79 This supports the fact that Dick s is undervalued however I decided to take the average of the comparable to get one final comparable price target Average Comparable By taking the average result from the 3 comparable analyses underwent I arrived at one final estimate of 96 83 share This indicates that Dick s is slightly undervalued and presents a good buying opportunity Plan Based off of the valuation techniques underwent in this analysis I was able to formulate a plan on how I would play this Buying Dick s between its current price 94 17 and the average comparable price 96 83 would be a great buying opportunity and help to limit the downside risk of such an investment If the price falls below 93 I will sell my position and look for a re entrance at the 88 88 level I would consider selling half of my position at 104 33 and the other half if the price reaches 128 78 Risks Share Dilution Dick s has a couple different forms of dilution that investors need to watch out for These include convertible shares and equity compensation plans Together these two forms can account for a maximum share dilution of 6 78 However this dilution may be offset by their repurchasing Lastly this level of dilution is not of much concern for a company that is growing as quick as Dick s Sporting Goods is Catalysts Financial Performance despite the global pandemic Dick s was able to have a fantastic financial performance in 2020 They increased their revenues margins profits and income during this period which cannot be said by many other sporting good companies Dick s great performance amidst uncertainty and poor retail conditions sparked my interest and the interest of many other investors who think that Dick s can continue their great performances Share Repurchase As previously mentioned Dick s can repurchase up to 1B in shares If they were to do this they would increase the value of existing shares by 12 79 This would be fantastic for investors however even if they only repurchase half of the available shares they would still be able to offset their total dilution as mentioned above Just knowing this is great news for investors however we need to be alert and tracking them repurchases to determine how many shares they are purchasing every month to see if they are meeting expectations Social Responsibilities As mentioned previously many people are turning to ESG and socially responsible investing The fact that this type of investing is growing as quickly as it represents an opportunity for Dick s to attract investors and increase demand for their shares If they meet the targets they set out and perhaps set new and more ambitious ones they will be drawing in more potential investors which should drive their prices higher TLDR Long on Dick s Sporting Goods Full analysis can be found here https

incredible year and impress investors by beating estimates by a long shot As a result of their recent successes I have decided to look into Dick s and find out if it is a good investment and if they can keep outperforming their industry competition According to my valuation techniques Dicks is undervalued and has the potential to grow By following the plan set out in this report if everything goes to plan the potential return of an investment into Dicks will be 23 77 There are risks to every investment these risks are highlighted at the end of the report Along with the risks there are several catalysts that are also listed at the end of this report Company Overview Founded in 1948 Dick s Sporting Goods https utradea com stocks DKS is a leading sporting goods retailer in the USA

Macroeconomic Outlook COVID 19 had a negative impact on the sporting goods and sportswear industries However some companies were able to perform well due to their ability to change their operations to fit around COVID ie Online DTC curbside pick up etc The companies that were able to adapt the quickest and most effectively were the ones that succeeded big time Fortunately Dicks already had an E

of their vertical brands Comparable Analyses In order to undergo this analysis I compared Dick s financial ratios to that of their public competitors found above in the competitors section EV EBITDA By undergoing this comparable I was able to find the fair value of Dick s to be 97 27 which would imply a share price increase of 3 29 from current prices This supports the argument that Dick s is undervalued however this comparable argues that Dick s is undervalued by far less than the DCF estimates Dick s to be EV Revenue These comparable estimates the fair value of Dick s to be 88 88 which would imply a share price decrease of 5 62 Unlike the previous 2 valuations this comparable argues that Dick s is overvalued so I decided to undergo one more comparable to get a final verdict P E By undergoing this comparable the fair value of Dicks was estimated to be 104 33 which would imply a share price increase of 10 79 This supports the fact that Dick s is undervalued however I decided to take the average of the comparable to get one final comparable price target Average Comparable By taking the average result from the 3 comparable analyses underwent I arrived at one final estimate of 96 83 share This indicates that Dick s is slightly undervalued and presents a good buying opportunity Plan Based off of the valuation techniques underwent in this analysis I was able to formulate a plan on how I would play this Buying Dick s between its current price 94 17 and the average comparable price 96 83 would be a great buying opportunity and help to limit the downside risk of such an investment If the price falls below 93 I will sell my position and look for a re entrance at the 88 88 level I would consider selling half of my position at 104 33 and the other half if the price reaches 128 78 Risks Share Dilution Dick s has a couple different forms of dilution that investors need to watch out for These include convertible shares and equity compensation plans Together these two forms can account for a maximum share dilution of 6 78 However this dilution may be offset by their repurchasing Lastly this level of dilution is not of much concern for a company that is growing as quick as Dick s Sporting Goods is Catalysts Financial Performance despite the global pandemic Dick s was able to have a fantastic financial performance in 2020 They increased their revenues margins profits and income during this period which cannot be said by many other sporting good companies Dick s great performance amidst uncertainty and poor retail conditions sparked my interest and the interest of many other investors who think that Dick s can continue their great performances Share Repurchase As previously mentioned Dick s can repurchase up to 1B in shares If they were to do this they would increase the value of existing shares by 12 79 This would be fantastic for investors however even if they only repurchase half of the available shares they would still be able to offset their total dilution as mentioned above Just knowing this is great news for investors however we need to be alert and tracking them repurchases to determine how many shares they are purchasing every month to see if they are meeting expectations Social Responsibilities As mentioned previously many people are turning to socially responsible investing The fact that this type of investing is growing as quickly as it represents an opportunity for Dick s to attract investors and increase demand for their shares If they meet the targets they set out and perhaps set new and more ambitious ones they will be drawing in more potential investors which should drive their prices higher TLDR Long on Dick s Sporting Goods Full analysis can be found here https utradea com positions Why Dicks Sporting

with this one and my new addiction is buying shares of this company at this bargain bin price Let s begin Contents 1 Summary 2 History of Existing Due Diligence and Analyst Targets 3 Some Company Background 4 My GORE Porn 5 Sentiment vs Other Asset Classes 6 Looking Towards the Future and Dipping My Feet In Summary since I hate scrolling to read a TL DR too As stated in my previous post I made after first gaining confidence in the play KGC Kinross Gold Corp has recently had a massive fire interrupt operations at their Tasiast gold mine in Mauritania In Section 4 I ve added updates from Kinross about the fire and how that might have influenced the hesitant reversal yesterday The mine is one of their top three revenue streams and the public reaction to the news was a HEAVY dip in the stock price to the tune of 32 over the course of the following week The mine is now operational again much quicker than many have expected The mill is still down as the discharge area of the mill was the epicenter of the fire so it will be a bit longer before they can process any high quality metals Given how fast mining operations resumed I can only expect the mine to return to full working order in similarly short notice Even if it doesn t this stock is now well under analyst projections and what was previously a buyable price point I see no reason why 6 wouldn t be more attractive than the 8 shares being bought up just earlier this month Considering this stock was previously featured on wallstreetbets as a heavy gold mining contender with an improving balance sheet wsb attitudes aligning with analysts is a catching sight so I see this dip as a classic overreaction A Brief History of Existing Due Diligence and Analyst Targets This ticker has made brief appearances on this sub as stated previously Mostly bullish opinions and many of the posts were prompted by analyst price targets being upgraded to 10 14 Targets were immediately downgraded since the fire which I think is very shortsighted Some Company Background Founded in 1993 Kinross Gold is a gold mining company with mines and projects in the United States Brazil Chile Ghana Mauritania and Russia President amp CEO J Paul Rollinson a committed steward who has been improving the balance sheet explains how the Tasiast mine was 2020 s standout performer for the company https www miningmx com news gold 45190 kinross ceo rollinson says mauritanias tasiast was groups stand out performer in 2020 The Executive Vice President is literally named Geoffrey P Gold which excites me on a linguistic level My GORE Porn Guidance Outlook Revenue and Earnings When evaluating a stock I like to look at these four things above all else I do this because even if I m trading something short term it s important to me that if I m doing something like cash secured puts to run a wheel on this that I would be perfectly fine owning a few hundred shares of the underlying Not only is the mine back but the mill that suffered the most damage will be back online by the end of the year According to this release by Kinross reported on by SeekingAlpha I would link but ya know costs to repair the mill can be estimated to be 50 million KGC s free cash flow can pay for a new mill ten times over While guidance has dropped the expected return of the operation to be reduced to 21 million on account of this event the previous target was very close by at 24 million Again a sign of a healthy company that is able to withstand sudden disasters Diluted EPS has been positive for two years in a row 2019 0 57 2020 0 97 There are quite a few news sources who call this company unprofitable but I see one that is quickly becoming a cash flow monster What I see with my own two eyes is a company with close to 3 billion in available liquidity with a billy in cash Their Net Debt vs EBITDA is low and manageable with more straight cash being thrown into the balance sheet each quarter Total Revenue has been rising steadily for years and in 2020 Kinross brought in 4 2 BILLION in cash As a final kicker KGC over the past year has also outperformed the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF GDX Sentiment vs Other Asset Classes GLD At first glance the price of a gold mining company s stock might appear to be almost directly correlated with the price of gold I don t believe this to be entirely true as the stock price of KGC depends solely on their ability to actually sell the gold they mine and investor psychology sentiment on the stock Therefore even though the price of gold has stabilized back to it s 60 day support level after a run up that makes an impression https goldprice org I believe the sell off in Kinross shares to be only very partially to blame on the decline of gold Looking further back in the 1 year chart we can see that the price of gold is actually consolidating Admittedly you still need to pay very close attention to the price of gold as your position plays out if you choose to enter one as the price of gold will determine how much revenue Kinross is able to generate from selling their inventory BND If interest rates go up sooner than expected I know I know hear me out sentiment on value stocks especially value names that are involved with the procurement and sale of commodities have a great shot at becoming even more positive than they are now If you remember KGC was mentioned in this subreddit quite a bit when the first wave of inflation fear hit the markets It seems to be a go to ticker for traders trying to capitalize on the interesting commodities market we find ourselves in with options traders gleefully snagging up calls IN GENERAL I believe the recent mild interest in mining stocks is because they aren t as correlated with prevailing market trends This characteristic leads me to believe investors might see this company as a comfortable buy that can weather a storm if they are uncomfortably unsure of the medium long term market outlook Looking Towards the Future and Dipping My Feet In I first heard about this stock on Reddit when it was trading near 9 I did not purchase any shares but was very intrigued by the analyst reports claiming it had the potential to reach 14 there are actually analysts who maintain their 14 target I ve seen numbers ranging from 10 14 47 I ve been slowly accumulating a position these past two weeks as the price has dumped and I couldn t be happier with my cost basis I will continue to keep buying shares at any price until the price returns to highs where I will then consider preservation focused spreads as I hit the refresh button on my short term opinion Long term though I m here for it
