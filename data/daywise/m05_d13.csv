type Put this on your tongue and listen up The topic for discussion today is MindMed MNMD I don t want to lose anyone when it starts kicking in so I m going to break it up into sections Also obvious disclaimer this is not financial advice I m just a drug addict First off if you don t know already and if you don t know I don t know how the fuck you got here in the first place MindMed is a Canadian based company researching medical treatments for depression drug addiction depression PTSD and pain utilizing psychedelics and other entactogenic substances like MDMA Mental health treatment is suffering from a severe lack of highly successful treatments and will be seeing a massive increase in attention due to the growing global acceptance of mental disorders The other area of focus is pain one of the largest markets for pharmacological substances And thanks to the opioid epidemic many jurisdictions are open to finding alternative treatments for pain at any cost simply to save lives Highly scrutinizing the sale of one of the largest revenue generating pain medications leaves a bit of demand in its wake as not only doctors but politicians and citizens are looking for a safer drug for physical pain Not to mention how are we going to continue to treat all of the individuals who became addicted to these substances due to malpractice Welcome MindMed That s right there s hope to get mental health on track physical pain managed and addiction to those previous substances all treated with one class of drug Psychedelics So yes that s a lot of good news What s the downside you may be wondering I saw a bearish sentiment that the psychedelic market is gonna be a bloodbath They re all using the same drugs Yeah yeah shut the fuck up This fucking company has patents already has patents for an LSD trip neutralizing agent Ever been tripping balls and wanted nothing but the room to stop breathing and you mom to give you a nice glass of milk This is that nice glass of milk No psychiatrist is going to want their patients to feel side effects of their treatment if using high doses for any longer than necessary during the appointment It would be a terrible idea Make a mistake and take more than prescribed yes it does happen to people who aren t drug addicts like me Having a neutralizing agent for such a long lasting drug is necessary and already patented by this company I m just getting fucking started Ever heard of the state Oregon Yeah me neither But it turns out they legalized the sale and purchase of psilocybin containing mushrooms recreationally Those same drugs that everyone talks about in pop culture from music to current movies That the entire public is so intrigued with right now Once one state legalizes its only a matter of time before more catch on In fact California is attempting to pass legislation for the possession and sale of mushrooms The state with the largest recreational drug market If all of this wasn t enough already I don t know why you ve gotten this far But that s only why everyone should obviously have bullish sentiment for this company Now s time for me to show you my pretty graphs MindMed Peaks https preview redd it 14dr9cx1bty61 png width 623 amp format png amp auto webp amp s d046dc0b4213fcf1ddb90d889ecbf2fda157f572 Notice the volume April 27 of this year That s the day it got listed to Nasdaq If you can t find it I ll make it easy It s the largest volume bar Now it s obvious volume would be much much higher in its opening days on the exchange The numbers are staggering though In the first five days trading on Nasdaq MindMed volume was about 160 million over half of it s float and about 8 weeks worth of average volume from when it was a penny stock Interest in the company continues to increase from media attention people are buying up the float fast and price is falling In fact the price is currently about 75 of it s highest peak as a penny stock and half it s debut open After rising above the 2 point in late 2020 price has never gone below that Current support looks like it doesn t want to fall too far below 3 now This will most likely be the lowest price for the next few months if not ever if we go off historical data So that s all well and good but Where s it going next Drawing the most conservative extension lines for the original 5 price movement and following retracement from December 2020 until April of this year Fibonacci retracements would have be able to be used to predict a 100 retracement of 5 69 And what was the upper extreme for the next price movement 5 77 FibExtensions

momentum as last time The price should reach about 7 80 at it s next peak However notice that each peak has gotten higher and higher While there was a long retracement and profit taking period MindMed is actually still on the same uptrend that started in late 2020 So 7 80 is a safe guess but it might have the momentum this time to hit the next extension 10 85 Those are some juicy profits Especially when the first options ever traded for MindMed expire May 21 with the highest strike point at 7 5 Beneath the historically expected price movement If risk isn t your thing the 5 strike point options would be incredible profit at even the lowest extension point Here s the profit spread on those 7 5 strike calls at 100 contracts amp x200B May21 7 5C https preview redd it qqldxlzebty61 png width 624

7834766c3b5b32ccf9695f98d4a793866dea734b Behold the most beautiful graph I have ever laid my eyes on Using Fibonacci time extensions on the two previous price increases we get a two day range predicting the next peak given that both extensions are drawn from the two greatest peaks Despite such a different time frame both of these extensions are 100 extensions based on time from both of the last peaks in price Right before those first options expire Not only that but drawing an oval to visualize an upside down parabola The slope of the price decrease following the last increase rides along the slope of the oval pictured When in this type of price formation generally the slope of the line will leave the parabola at the same slope it entered following it s second touch on the right side after the trend has reversed upwards The graph already touched once on May 11 and May 12 it closed on the second touch point following the support from the last day and a half Next stop is the breakout period which also lines up in the middle of the time frame expected for the next price increase From there call options can be exercised for the 5 strike point which will drive the price higher And there s a ton of open interest I think I rest my case

rates remained at very low levels One of the best illustrations of those stimulative policies is the amount of dollars printed in 2020 21 of the United States dollar was printed in 2020 as shown in Figure 4 This large injection was used for both direct and indirect assistance in the COVID situation This at the same time indirectly channelled part of this aid to the financial markets increasing

edged sword Injecting money to the economy is always something controversial Through the law of supply and demand it is easy to infer that a considerable increase in supply without a similar increase in demand will reduce the price of a good In money when this happens we say that the money loses value i e one monetary unit can acquire fewer products In other words this is what we call inflation Even Warren Buffet has shown concern for inflation in the past month gt We are seeing very substantial inflation We are raising prices People are raising prices to us and it s being accepted This raise on prices can be already tracked on several indices such as Bloomberg s agriculture index shown in Figure 5 and also in the annual single family home price as shown in Figure 6 amp x200B Figure

month gt It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn t overheat But what would happen if inflation persists and interest rates have to be risen Remember that I previously said that stocks are trading at a premium due to the lack of attractive alternative investments This would no longer be true and this premium would no longer be a thing And thus we should expect a decrease in the stock price The market can not be timed Even with all these indicators it is difficult to say whether this will happen in the short to medium term There are many factors which could deter inflation away and interest rates low As an example Berkshire Hathaway has been stacking cash during the last years as shown in Figure 7 playing a slightly more defensive position This may be due the fact that they already saw that low interest rates during the last decade were driving the stock market at high prices However interest rates are still low and during that time the stock market has continued rising Figure 7 Berkshire s Cash Holdings https preview redd it 3ag5lqt6cvy61 png width 744 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f91b8be62cb599332c4c1404ef878e6dcf6529a3 Summary The first decade of the 2000s was characterized by two economic crisis which defined an economy with very low interest rates Low interest rates increased stock market prices since there were no attractive alternative investments and thus stock markets traded at a premium The Covid crisis led to a massive injection of money into the economy This money injection is a double edged sword which may have brought an exuberance illusion awakening a ghost that has been dormant in recent years inflation The emergence of inflation would imply an increase in interest rates An increase in interest rates would mean that the premium paid for stocks would be lost Despite all these facts timing the market is no easy task And thus other factors could keep inflation away and interest rates away prolonging this situation

program for People age 65 or older People under age 65 with certain disabilities People of all ages with End Stage Renal Disease permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant Medicare has different parts that help cover specific services Medicare Part A Hospital Insurance Part A helps cover inpatient care in hospitals including critical access hospitals and skilled nursing facilities not custodial or long term care It also helps cover hospice care and some home health care Beneficiaries must meet certain conditions to get these benefits Most people don t pay a premium for Part A because they or a spouse already paid for it through their payroll taxes while working Medicare Part B Medical Insurance Part B helps cover doctors services and outpatient care It also covers some other medical services that Part A doesn t cover such as some of the services of physical and occupational therapists and some home health care Part B helps pay for these covered services and supplies when they are medically necessary Most people pay a monthly premium for Part B Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Coverage Medicare prescription drug coverage is available to everyone with Medicare To get Medicare prescription drug coverage people must join a plan approved by Medicare that offers Medicare drug coverage Most people pay a monthly premium for Part D amp x200B Private insurance companies offer benefits in addition to original Medicare in the form of a Medicare Supplement or Medicare Advantage plan A recipient will enroll in either a Medicare Supplement or Medicare Advantage plan they can t have both Below you ll see Q4 2020 enrollments including Med Sup and MA you ll see there is a far larger market share for supplements than advantage plans CLOV only offers MA

most of the market share in the Medicare Advantage space and they do it well That 18 of all other insurers is where CLOV fits into the graph below What concerns me about CLOV is that a majority of those other companies are not for profit and affiliated with small networks and hospital group Why is CLOV operating for profit and publicly traded in this space The SEC has questions as well Red

they re benefiting from doing well CLOV claims on their website that they are doing healthcare differently but their model is exactly the same as every other carrier with fewer features and benefits than most Their customer service must be amazing then right Luckily the CMS measures this in the form of a star rating they assign to each carrier every year As part of a Medicare Advantage appointment we are required to review a companies Star Rating with the member The Star rating is a score provide by CMS that assess customer service and quality of care You ll see below that the star

282dcfea99c4f6f3e12229793db1f81b217d0b01 Oh and there s that thing about them being approved as a direct contracting entity that must be big news right No do you even know what that means Let me explain This is basically a pilot program that 53 carriers are participating in throughout the country 53 is a lot btw When a customer enrolls in a MA plan they have to designate their primary care physician PCP Under the direct contracting model the MA plan will pay the PCP a specific dollar amount per member like a membership In return the doctor will provide services to the member but not charge the plan per service since they are receiving payment for care upfront overtime This is basically to see if this model is more cost effective than the fee for service model The customer will still received itemized statements as they would under the traditional fee for service model So essential the customer doesn t notice anything different is happening other then they likely will not have a copay or possibly a lower copay But this doesn t make CLOV unique in any way TLDR Clover Health Investments is not doing anything of value in the Medicare Space I m sorry but your bags look

Lot jumped in and I ve lost my shirt with shares I also bought LOGI thanks u 1xndsu which have done well I m learning to sell covered calls and buy puts with my premiums to make up for some losses However I believe it s time for Corsair to breakout I would really appreciate anyone s bearish sentiment to explain further downward price action Here is my DD thesis Using most recent closed price 31 39 1 Financials The one you all don t care about but what makes this stock undervalued 2020 sales 1 7 billion with a GP of 465MM TTM 1 92 billion with a GP of 547MM The current market cap is 2 9Billion 2021 estimates As per Andy Paul CEO and Michael Potter CFO who have always been conservative with their estimates 2021 sales estimate 1 9 billion to 2 1 billion representing growth of 11 6 to 23 4 Adjusted operating income in the range of 235 million to 255 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of 245 million to 265 million Most recent quarter Q1 revenue of 529MM with an adjusted net income of 58 2MM EPS beat of 0 58 vs the 0 33 estimate a 75 beat They also paid down 10 of their debt which now stands at 300MM which means 1MM more is guaranteed next year 2 Growth WHAT They beat stay at home winter time holiday time holiday sales revenue which was 53MM What does this mean They are still selling and will continue to sell even though COVID gave them a nice boost Furthermore hardware and gaming peripherals quarters are their weakest in Q1 With growing quarters this year their EPS for 2021 will be a minimum of 2 5 giving Corsair a P E ratio of 12 5 for a company growing 100 YOY and expected to continue at 20 YOY They beat Q1 estimates of 75 This will continue this year remind me in a years time to say I told you so Ultimate growth DDR5 Corsair has the 1 market share in memory sales https www corsair com us en blog ddr5 primer We ll be adding significant resources to the company this year both in marketing and R amp D as well as infrastructure as we move towards a 2 billion revenue number Boom They re choosing to pay more for growth rather than just buying down debt They believe in themselves and so does EagleTree the majority shareholder They also just signed a new three year lease on a brand new campus with a lot more room Finally their Glassdoor reviews are finally bullish again they used to suck Yes I even look at Glassdoor reviews when going all in on a company I recommend you read MC s article 18 Words From Corsair Gaming CEO Could Spell Monster Returns for Investors Where Andy Paul said The vast majority of people that are playing video games have bought no specialist gaming gear at all 3 Technicals Okay they suck Triple MACD crossover lack of support but when has that ever stopped any of you retards Food for thought this stock is down 31 after it has had TWO quarterly earning beats It s been lumped in with other overpriced tech stocks and has been hit very hard We see 30 50 as a solid support level you cannot go wrong unless you put everything into call options 4 Insiders Trading Michael Potter CFO Sold 1 25 of his shares 7 500 shares of his 600 000 shares Good for him he made some tendies and I hope he buys a lambo Thi L La COO Purchased 100 000 shares at 32 64 He literally spent 3 25 million betting on the company he may know more about than anyone else It is only fair to note that he sold 100k shares at 35 in January in a public offering We can only assume it was to buy GME with us and jump back in later right 5 Round 2 for institutions and ETFs When scratching my head and pondering why prices dropped and as new reports are emerging it is clear that many of the initial IPO investors like JP Morgan have sold I mean cmon they made 100 return on 10 s of millions in investments Meanwhile new institutions are tapping in from the ER beats some even increasing positions and going heavy on call options Finally 180 days have now passed which some institutions and ETFs consider a waiting period before buying into an equity 6 Don t trust me Trust every article published in the past three months Show me one negative or bearish article Finally analysts have an average PT of 46 67 with Barclays giving it a 47 Not one has it as a sell Screaming Buy some articles call it 39 return in 12 months How spoiled are you not to jump on near 40 return in a company that distributes products that you actually would like to own 7 Possibilities these depend on EagleTree Partners If anyone knows someone who works there hit me up Buyout EagleTree owns 67 of the shares That s funny because equity buyouts often exceed 60 ownership A big if but they could potentially sell to someone which would make some millionaires here Short Squeeze more like a hug The float is 88 13MM shares Meanwhile EagleTree owns 61 99MM of those shares Assuming EagleTree does not add more to the float there is a 17 2 SI based on the most recent SI report from Nasdaq However millions of shares were shorted from tech sell off as well as last earnings report could be as high as 21 Meanwhile days to cover IS OVER 7 No no not a short squeeze but it could cause some covers from the shorts that were taken back in the 40 s TDLR Financials are great Company is growing Analysts are all bullish Some possible moon scenarios Everyone here says Corsair will have its day but why not make that happen today not tomorrow Position I am shorting the fk out of it because it seems like the prices of every DD on a fundamentally solid company goes to shit

residential real estate market is booming REITS are too boomer for you so you look for growth plays to play real estate Redfin RDFN is a play that is greatly undervalued What is Redfin Redfin is a residential real estate brokerage The company uses technologies such as map search and virtual house showings to increase exposure improve the quality of the customer experience all while delivering efficiencies and saving the consumer costs Redfin also provides the ability to do digital and online document management making it a one stop shop for one s real estate needs Their mission is to redefine real estate in favor of the consumer To change an industry that has had little disruption Redfin s business model to undercut competition is based on sellers paying Redfin a discounted fee either 1 or 1 5 to list the seller s home This company does it all they will buy your house sell your house you can buy a house on it get approved for a mortgage get a mortgage or even hire a concierge service to get your home ready for people to view it in person or online Your wife s boyfriend can take care of all his real estate needs and finally get you a house to you don t have to ask him if you can turn on the AC at night Think of this company as a potential amazon of real estate and nobody does what they do amp x200B https preview redd it eyreywz51xy61 png width 1200 amp format

45d864509782271001b5de5c5d29c7eaf3dd814c In the past few years Redfin has had crazy growth in 2019 alone they had over 60 revenue growth and during the quarter of COVID lockdowns they sustained over 4 growth compared to that quarter last year which is crazy because everybody was under lockdown amp x200B Recently the company lost over 30 of its share value after earnings per share miss They beat revenue estimates and the Nasdaq brutality that has happened lately They are currently trading at around 49 50 dollars a share as I write this which is about a 5 billion dollar market cap They are projected to have well over 5 billion dollars in revenue alone and be profitable in 2025 They will be profitable by end of 2021 This is a company that recently in 2016 only had about 33 of all the homes sold in North America and now they have over 1 and growth will be exponential as they acquire more listing through their catalysts I did a DCF analysis and the perpetuity approach price value of the stock using slightly bullish over consensus numbers was around 95 per share With sensitivity analysis the best case is around 150 per share The investment thesis Redfin will trade higher through the catalysts of surging real estate prices due to people moving out of cities due to Covid inflation interest rates and the general economy booming right now the acquisition of Rentpath and the expansion of RedfinNow program Plus the company right now is way undervalued and is a steal Real Estate Industry Outlook In 2020 Redfin accounted for 1 00 of total home sales leaving much more room for redfin to acquire market share 8 estimate rise in real estate sales in 2021 which will benefit Redfin s business As home prices rise the profits for Redfin rise as well During 2020 revenue in the real estate market hit 33 6 trillion Over the last 10 years mortgage rates have declined by 2 42 benefiting residential real estate Essentially real estate is booming and Redfin was already in hyper growth mode before COVID amp x200B Expansion of RedfinNow This is a newer program and they are committed to growing it recently adding San Francisco to territory this program exists RedfinNow is a great way to liquidate your home with a cash offer from Redfin You get a no obligation offer in a few days Close on your schedule and move when you re ready This is helping them get more listings because in this industry more listings makes you get more views and Redfin is already the most visited online brokerage by a lot This will add to their exponential growth of their business and as long as they buy the houses for dirt cheap they will also churn out good profit on them This is their number one growing segment of revenue amp x200B Acquisition of Rentpath In February Redfin moved into the rental industry acquiring RentPath for 608 Million RentPath has more than 20 000 apartment buildings on its rental websites and grew its traffic more than 25 last year One in five of Redfin s 40 million monthly visitors also wants to see homes for rent Redfin plans to have all of Rentpath s listing on their own website by 2022 the partnership will allow for Better Search Experience Better Value for Advertisers Higher Traffic Growth And open up to a younger customer base as many younger people want to see rentals because they are not in a position to buy a house whether it be because of finances job etc amp x200B Summarization Redfin is extremely undervalued where it is at right now and is a steal The company has no competitor that does what they do Zillow only makes its money from advertising while Redfin has all sorts of revenue segments that are diverse The real estate market outlook that has been brought on by Covid took this already crazy growth company pulled it back a little in a slingshot and let it rip Throw in RedfinNow and Rentpath and this company is going to be a terror for other companies to deal with This is a great long term play and longer dated call options are going to be great At the end of the day redfin is a company for the consumer and saves them lots of money while they make money you can save up to 40k selling a million dollar house on their website That s a lot of money to use on some FD s amp x200B Literally Can t go tits up Positions I Entered Today Aug 20 55 calls 2022 Leaps

shorting the stock and following necessary guidelines then they only have access to 15 of the shares at max in order to gamble with In this case we know that is a lie The reason this is significant is because short selling could in fact trigger a sell off if long holders paper hand and in this case that is not happening But wait there is more Naked Shorting amp x200B https preview redd it

experiencing and based off of the history of this stock we saw a strong volume upward movement in Jan when we should have saw the squeeze until our friends at RH ruined it but did they really ruin it or just set us up for even greater heights lol oh the irony Anyway ever since then we saw dips price increases but for the most part we saw a whole lot of sideways movement As time passes these fake overhanging supplies should be fading due to diamond hands and more importantly the accumulation of even MORE AND even more importantly they are counting our votes as we speak Ok I am calm Side note I have a friend named Margin and they were asking for their number TLDR All speculation but in my opinion the naked short selling of hedge funds have created an overhanging supply acting as a security block of synthetic shares that is constantly pushing the price down and causing resistance However with the low volume in place and a constant increase in OBV no one is selling and with shares drying up there will no longer be a synthetic block inhibiting us from reaching the moon References https finance zacks com light volume affect stock market 1152 html https finance zacks com light volume

experiencing and based off of the history of this stock we saw a strong volume upward movement in Jan when we should have saw the squeeze until our friends at RH ruined it but did they really ruin it or just set us up for even greater heights lol oh the irony Anyway ever since then we saw dips price increases but for the most part we saw a whole lot of sideways movement As time passes these fake overhanging supplies should be fading due to diamond hands and more importantly the accumulation of even MORE AND even more importantly they are counting our votes as we speak Ok I am calm Side note I have a friend named Margin and they were asking for their number TLDR All speculation but in my opinion the naked short selling of hedge funds have created an overhanging supply acting as a security block of synthetic shares that is constantly pushing the price down and causing resistance However with the low volume in place and a constant increase in OBV no one is selling and with shares drying up there will no longer be a synthetic block inhibiting us from reaching the moon References https finance zacks com light volume affect stock market 1152 html https finance zacks com light volume

commodity the price of electricity constantly fluctuates in accordance with supply and demand However unlike most commodities electricity is not cheaply storable This causes a huge inefficiency for electricity providers because they must develop enough power plants to meet peak power demand Building new power plants is incredibly capital intensive and a poor use of capital if those plants are only needed for a few hours per day week or month during high load events Instead utilities are incentivized to flatten the curve of electricity demand and keep their capital investment in new power plants low Historically prices to consumers have been fixed with time of day fluctuations built into the calculation but smart meters and deregulation have led to more states offering real time pricing source https extension psu edu real time pricing for electricity This creates opportunity It s a load balancing problem Power plants can supply all the necessary power if demand is spread uniformly but when everyone wants that power from 4PM 8PM on a hot summer day it s a problem and black outs occur Enter V2G Why let any asset sit idle when it could be making you money Rather than turning your EV into a robo taxi when you re not using it here s a simpler idea leverage the most valuable component of the EV the battery Grid operators will pay to rent your energy storage and use your car s battery as a virtual power plant to meet peak demand The future of the grid Green energy like solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of electricity generation in most parts of the world Bloomberg 2019 Energy Outlook https www enelgreenpower com media news 2019 07 bloomberg new energy outlook 2019 Yet passive green energy generation varies depending on conditions and cannot respond to greater demand like a traditional power station Additionally electricity demand will continue to grow with the population and EV ownership By 2035 an estimated 50 of ALL cars will be electric Scientific American https www scientificamerican com article ninety percent of u s cars must be electric by 2050 to meet climate goals Adding more battery storage to the grid is part of the solution Hurdles Plug problems There are 2 dominant fast charging plugs used for EV s CHADeMO and CCS adapters between the two are not possible In North America and Europe CCS has become and will continue to be the standard but it does not yet support bidirectional charging which is projected for 2025 Inside EVs https insideevs com news 342354 charin ccs combo standard to offer v2g by 2025 CHADeMO does support bidrectional charging and has decent coverage across the globe but it s dying everywhere outside of Japan There are a couple mass market CHADeMO vehicles on the market notably the Nissan Leaf but it s difficult for people to justify buying V2G equipment right now because changing from a CHADeMO to CCS vehicle would render the V2G equipment useless Tesla In the US Tesla uses a proprietary plug for fast charging instead of the CCS standard they have shifted towards in most other markets Tesla is the single largest EV maker so their proprietary plug poses problems for a V2G future Tesla would need to be willing to enable bidirectional charging on their fleet and potentially canabilize their Powerwall business Battery degradation All studies I ve seen suggest this is minimal source https youtu be QKg GWDogFc t 420 Advancing technology in accordance with Wright s law source https www visualcapitalist com electric vehicle battery prices fall should bring larger cheaper more resilient batteries so long term I do not expect this to be an issue Battery capacity and user error Let s say you re a 9 5 wage slave You plug in your vehicle at 5 30 and it starts powering your house to offset peak power prices But a couple hours later you decide you want to go out only to discover your vehicle has lost 10 kWH powering your house Obviously this defeats the purpose of such a system There are 2 solutions to this 1 Press a button on the V2G equipment that will keep your car charging instead of discharging on days when you may go out 2 Get a car with a large enough battery that it practically has no effect If your car doubles as a home battery backup it makes sense to spend the extra money on this and benefit from the greater range It s beautiful wait for it synergy Regulation Back in 2016 Tesla s CTO said battery degradation and regulation were the 2 largest risks source https www youtube com watch v uzAPyk8Wbhk amp t 219s I don t disagree about regulation This is where V2H makes a lot of sense Getting permission from numerous different regulatory agencies sounds like a bureaucratic nightmare It s feasible because it s essentially the same scenario as someone with solar panels that feed back into the grid Yet we still see nightmare cases like Bill Maher who waited over 1 000 days to get regulatory approval for solar panels Fortunately V2H is plenty profitable and should require less regulation since you would not feed power back into the grid I plugged in my own home energy usage and found I could decrease my capacity charge on my electric bill from 50 month to 0 month if my vehicle powers my house everyday from 4 6 PM during typical peak demand and then recharge late at night using practically free electricity Conclusion At present EV buyers are generally wealthier and more educated So they are likely to adopt V2G V2H because the math works out It s a low risk investment with consistent returns via savings on energy bills The only issue There s no V2G product available on the US market yet You want to extract as much value from a depreciating asset like a vehicle as fast as possible because advancing technology makes your vehicle more obsolete everyday If battery degradation is minimal as evidence suggests then it s only logical to enroll your vehicle into V2G and extract maximum value from it with minimal inconvenience CHADeMO vehicles have served as the guinea pigs They have shown the feasibility of V2G Utilities have partnered with private companies even with residential customers residential experience https www youtube com watch v 7h9EecmLatY amp Now it s a matter of waiting for CCS to achieve bidirectional charging waiting for enough vehicles to proliferate and then the V2G payday will come Positions Long 8k Nuvve pronounced new vee bag holder It was an SPAC that has since merged miss me with that banhammer

other commodity the price of electricity constantly fluctuates in accordance with supply and demand However unlike most commodities electricity is not cheaply storable This causes a huge inefficiency for electricity providers because they must develop enough power plants to meet peak power demand Building new power plants is incredibly capital intensive and a poor use of capital if those plants are only needed for a few hours per day week or month during high load events Instead utilities are incentivized to flatten the curve of electricity demand and keep their capital investment in new power plants low Historically prices to consumers have been fixed with time of day fluctuations built into the calculation but smart meters and deregulation have led to more states offering real time pricing source https extension psu edu real time pricing for electricity This creates opportunity It s a load balancing problem Power plants can supply all the necessary power if demand is spread uniformly but when everyone wants that power from 4PM 8PM on a hot summer day it s a problem and black outs occur Enter V2G Why let any asset sit idle when it could be making you money Rather than turning your EV into a robo taxi when you re not using it here s a simpler idea leverage the most valuable component of the EV the battery Grid operators will pay to rent your energy storage and use your car s battery as a virtual power plant to meet peak demand The future of the grid Green energy like solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of electricity generation in most parts of the world Bloomberg 2019 Energy Outlook https www enelgreenpower com media news 2019 07 bloomberg new energy outlook 2019 Yet passive green energy generation varies depending on conditions and cannot respond to greater demand like a traditional power station Additionally electricity demand will continue to grow with the population and EV ownership By 2035 an estimated 50 of ALL cars will be electric Scientific American https www scientificamerican com article ninety percent of u s cars must be electric by 2050 to meet climate goals Adding more battery storage to the grid is part of the solution Hurdles Plug problems There are 2 dominant fast charging plugs used for EV s CHADeMO and CCS adapters between the two are not possible In North America and Europe CCS has become and will continue to be the standard but it does not yet support bidirectional charging which is projected for 2025 Inside EVs https insideevs com news 342354 charin ccs combo standard to offer v2g by 2025 CHADeMO does support bidrectional charging and has decent coverage across the globe but it s dying everywhere outside of Japan There are a couple mass market CHADeMO vehicles on the market notably the Nissan Leaf but it s difficult for people to justify buying V2G equipment right now because changing from a CHADeMO to CCS vehicle would render the V2G equipment useless Tesla In the US Tesla uses a proprietary plug for fast charging instead of the CCS standard they have shifted towards in most other markets Tesla is the single largest EV maker so their proprietary plug poses problems for a V2G future Tesla would need to be willing to enable bidirectional charging on their fleet and potentially canabilize their Powerwall business Battery degradation All studies I ve seen suggest this is minimal source https youtu be QKg GWDogFc t 420 Advancing technology in accordance with Wright s law source https www visualcapitalist com electric vehicle battery prices fall should bring larger cheaper more resilient batteries so long term I do not expect this to be an issue Battery capacity and user error Let s say you re a 9 5 wage slave You plug in your vehicle at 5 30 and it starts powering your house to offset peak power prices But a couple hours later you decide you want to go out only to discover your vehicle has lost 10 kWH powering your house Obviously this defeats the purpose of such a system There are 2 solutions to this 1 Press a button on the V2G equipment that will keep your car charging instead of discharging on days when you may go out 2 Get a car with a large enough battery that it practically has no effect If your car doubles as a home battery backup it makes sense to spend the extra money on this and benefit from the greater range It s beautiful wait for it synergy Regulation Back in 2016 Tesla s chief technology office said battery degradation and regulation were the 2 largest risks source https www youtube com watch v uzAPyk8Wbhk amp t 219s I don t disagree about regulation This is where V2H makes a lot of sense Getting permission from numerous different regulatory agencies sounds like a bureaucratic nightmare It s feasible because it s essentially the same scenario as someone with solar panels that feed back into the grid Yet we still see nightmare cases like Bill Maher who waited over 1 000 days to get regulatory approval for solar panels Fortunately V2H is plenty profitable and should require less regulation since you would not feed power back into the grid I plugged in my own home energy usage and found I could decrease my capacity charge on my electric bill from 50 month to 0 month if my vehicle powers my house everyday from 4 6 PM during typical peak demand and then recharge late at night using practically free electricity Conclusion At present EV buyers are generally wealthier and more educated So they are likely to adopt V2G V2H because the math works out It s a low risk investment with consistent returns via savings on energy bills The only issue There s no V2G product available on the US market yet You want to extract as much value from a depreciating asset like a vehicle as fast as possible because advancing technology makes your vehicle more obsolete everyday If battery degradation is minimal as evidence suggests then it s only logical to enroll your vehicle into V2G and extract maximum value from it with minimal inconvenience CHADeMO vehicles have served as the guinea pigs They have shown the feasibility of V2G Utilities have partnered with private companies even with residential customers residential experience https www youtube com watch v 7h9EecmLatY amp Now it s a matter of waiting for CCS to achieve bidirectional charging waiting for enough vehicles to proliferate and then the V2G

reddit com r wallstreetbets comments msv8n1 tbh i only trust retards I am so confident in it that I dared to put my beard which I have for five years already on the line Worth your full read I promise I decided to structure the analysis in the following way first we ll take a look at the VW short squeeze revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA after that I ll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks through which the GMESS https imgur com a Sd4uE1b thesis will be dissected applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example then the process will be repeated but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon Finally all of the data accumulated in the process as well as the major findings made will be applied to the current technical state of GME in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action Buckle up and eat a crayon let s start Oh and one more thing I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me because the thesis can only be understood if all of the factors are considered in the sharpest detail first and then in the aggregate zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences interdependences and probabilities Dafaq did I just write Dunno but that s exactly what I meant Not a financial advice as I am not a professional advisor just an amateur ANALyzer amp x200B amp x200B Volkswagen Das Short Squeeze Sep 2007 Mar 2009 amp x200B amp x200B Remember when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading I bet Pepperidge apes remember The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario orchestrated largely by one very interesting person Back then the former President of Porsche Wendelin Wiedeking must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen In this process he used cash settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche s market operations While being acquired by Porsche Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares As the general public was finding out about Wendysking s takeover plan hedge funds and particularly short sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries approximately 70 While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased the preferential shares stayed put and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence For a moment there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence Only to get blindsided as it turned out later One shorts frying weekend Porsche announced its total holding in VW cornering the substantial part of the float and leaving only 6 in free float In the meantime short sales had risen to 12 of total stock outstanding When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74 1 of the outstanding shares through the intransparent cash settled options VWSS happened briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world and finally allowing the shorting side to GUH https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments dpnzup i recorded todays marketopen and the instant gt It was mathematically impossible for every short seller to buy a share and therefore close their position In other words half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out A panicked dash for the exit began A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell an FT journalist Hedge funds are estimated to have lost 20 to 30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock What is really ironic in Palpatine voice even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers the company couldn t pay up for the huge positions it had created and ended up being acquired by VW instead Processing img ntwkhbri3hy61 Also interestingly enough after his departure from Porsche Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success Lucking Fegend amp x200B Now let s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart VWSS daily chart https preview redd it fr7lt1clyoy61 jpg width 2388 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 1f472b4e578fef2c7718cfabd2399ffab6a68282 amp x200B Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance don t worry I ll explain There are only two major TA instruments used here namely Fibonacci retracement tool useful for assessing altitude and the crucial support resistance levels check out the in depth explanation of this TA tool in my other post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments mwevzz the big short 20 why bears may soon reconsider The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods pink grid with numbers 0 0 382 0 618 and so on for setting the major time landmarks and zones Furthermore you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures and the purple line which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis In the process of working with VW TSLA and GME charts I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts to one degree or another The most prominent one in my opinion is the killer purple resistance support level For the current VW example it is somewhere around 30 mark or 29 27 if you like precision One may observe on the chart above that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS First the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007 was held back and repulsed by this level s resistance on the last day of October It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008 This was followed by a consolidation with several failed attempts of breakout just below this level which lasted for more than 100 days before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July 08 And guess what Even after that the level played the major supportive role for the price action with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008 You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix I decided to name it Purple Haze Let s inspect the fancy geometric shapes now These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance The first one in orange is a cup shaped consolidation let it be called the Squeezy Grail because why not taking place above 100 Fibo and just below the Purple Haze which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature if you know what else is of a flatter nature comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award which again plays around the main 30 level on the chart The second consolidation highlighted by the pink rectangle a k a the Runway is actually more important than the first one because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens the Purple Haze resistance is blew off in the middle of 0 382 period Based on that observation it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate the Purple Haze has to be conquered at some point inside 0 382 Fibo time zone during the Runway stage Finally the triangular Squieezluminati Confirmed part is self explanatory imho Oh just one commentary worth being made here take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate bipartite and fits well into the isosceles triangle The nature surely knows how to play with stonks too Especially when we talk about Fibonacci The horizontal grid Fibo retracement is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend s depth as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle The 12th of September 07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application because on that day another important resistance of 20 72 was penetrated for the first time then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan 08 Furthermore 20 72 level works like an ideal 100 Fibo retrace level for the current example and supports the Holy Grail comparable to how my granny supports me Also take a note of the Purple Haze being relatively in the middle in between 78 6 and 100 of Fibo retracement an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend based Fib time grid TBFTG to be fucked then go alternatively This one is a complex instrument so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it Just like Fibo retracement TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence but this one applies to time periods instead of the price action and levels In order to use this instrument properly it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods Oh it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends trust me Tbh it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA But the result was worth the effort I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS and hypothetically to GME too TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend plus Squeezy Grail phase The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified and I m talking about all of the examples but possible especially when looking at the TA as a whole referring to how the grid applies to the price action and comparing the examples between each other That is pure rocket science if you ask me And most importantly the TBFTG measurement duration pink dash and dash trend seem to be very similar in length to Squieezluminati basis check the bars measurements on all of the charts blue lines for VW Pay attention to the following features which really help to dissect the squeezes anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework the Purple Haze breakout occurs in 0 382 TBFTG zone and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0 618 zone peaking at 1 TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus Squeezy Grail as it has been mentioned above Furthermore the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized Noice but let s move further amp x200B amp x200B Tesla or how Elon Mask truly is become meme Destroyer of shorts Apr 2019 Apr 2020 amp x200B amp x200B Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis and even after the run ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC for now the former have been winning The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark to market losses of over 40 billion in late 2020 as the company s shares exploded 740 last year This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners a fin anal company Remember the not so distant in past Tesla mania The prospects of Tesla s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse have over the years contributed to an extreme voleitility in the stock price Elon Musk openly criticized the short sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company The taking Tesla private play seemed to work out for the short sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50 from November 2018 to May 2019 After that amidst Tesla s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company s first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations the tables have turned and the bear beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price not without noble WSBetters help definitely Needless to say that previously steady short sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions amp x200B Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor that shorting Tesla is gt The longest unprofitable short I ve ever seen https www institutionalinvestor com article b1mzy62nf393lw The Longest Unprofitable Short I ve Ever Seen Well Mr Dusaniwsky WSB seem to have an answer for everything Processing img 81j9npzr0hy61 amp x200B While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise or even do worse things if you know what I mean Musk s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled In the middle of 2020 Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing short shorts These now sell at a premium on Ebay It s all nice and good but I have another cool merch idea shortz r fuk

through the short squeeze anatomy checklist thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW First things first the Squeezy Grail is present but it resembles more of a V shape structure Next the Runway stage is good looking a fucking massive gap happened there and this time 78 6 Fibo level is tested during the Runway being indicative of the TSLA bulls crazy power Squieezluminati Confirmed is also really interesting here as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure but rather a chainsaw like volatile price action taking place Furthermore you may see that inside of the triangle there is the after peak 78 6 Fibo zone retest which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of Moon Blessed be the bulls Looking at the Purple Haze which is again in between Fibo 78 6 and 100 important for TSLASS the major price level manifested at 52 46 During the first half of 2019 this level played a role of a magnetizing support with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April Again a lengthy half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level and above Fibo 100 retracement The breakout occurs you guessed right in the TBFTG 0 382 zone And what is really fascinating is the fact that after the breakout the Purple Haze has never been retested But who knows what the future hodls And the Fibos The retracement again apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure 78 6 is trialed several times all of the upper levels except for 38 2 were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23 6 Fibo level and the high of 189 4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze Ah almost forgot 100 35 75 Fibo level firmly holds the Squeezy Grail in hand again Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too Particularly the downtrend as opposed to VW uptrend serves as the core for TBFTG s application again refer to the dash and dash pinkish line This core is composed of the pre Squeezy Grail downtrend plus the Grail itself Take a look at gray measurements which cover this phase and the triangle duration again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases Crucially the Purple Haze breakout occurs in 0 382 TBFTG zone again then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0 618 zone with the false first peak during the final stages of 0 618 and the proper peak at 1 Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above if you ask me Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account Two quotes are of a relevance here amp x200B gt Coincidences mean you re on the right path Simon van Booy amp x200B gt If you gaze long enough into an asshole the asshole will gaze back into you u roman axt amp x200B Some additional food for thought from TSLA Processing img lvcdo6gjxjy61 amp x200B Game stopped or it is just a beginning amp x200B I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself

necessary Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way and my beard supports my manly confidence However this is the market and it all may go another way at any point in time that s the nature of things Think critically learn and do your own DD and TA In a good memory of u ControlTheNarrative at least And so it begins Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis s thesis since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to The first and most important one is surely the Purple Haze I should remind you that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated For GME this major price level seems to be at about 233 mark with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above Then the shapes The Squeezy Grail again occurring in between 78 6 and 100 consolidation is also easily identifyable here and it is yet again followed by the rectangular Runway consolidation where the price action currently stands Remember how historically in TSLA and VW the Purple Haze breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action in 0 382 Fibo time zone Well to paraphrase Ian Fleming once is VW happenstance Twice is TSLA coincidence Three times is GMenemy action Fibos Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass Firstly because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument being ordinarily applied to the completed trend But since the situation is not ordinary at all I played smarter or more autistic if you like Due to the fact that the Purple Haze level was approximately in between 78 6 and 100 Fibo in both of the previous examples I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78 6 by the price action on Jan 28th And when these two major levels were identified the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze Fibos

Release https www prnewswire com news releases cleanspark announces pricing of 200 million underwritten public offering 301247790 html CLSK stock tanks to 22 share Hugely important cap structure move for them as it gave them the ability to scale their mining operations extremely quickly and compete with RIOT and MARA as top public miners If I sent you my deck from work this is what I was proposing we should do with them a 200m PIPE CLSK announces purchase of additional 4 778 mining rigs Press Release https www prnewswire com news releases cleanspark purchases bitcoin mining equipment and infrastructure discloses current 95 carbon free mining 301256639 html Announces CleanSpark currently operates Bit coin mining rigs capable of processing approximately 315 PH s within its Atlanta complex and as previously announced it intends to reach between 1 0 and 1 3 EH s by the end of summer 2021 This translates to a Q1 capacity of about 1 6 B TC day CLSK announces purchase contract for 22 680 miners over the next 14 months Press Release https www prnewswire com news releases cleanspark purchases 22 680 additional bitcoin miners and anticipates 3 2 ehs capacity after deployment 301269880 html The units purchased under these contracts are expected to be delivered at an average rate of approximately 1 620 units per month over a 14 month period with the first batch scheduled for delivery in August 2021 By the end of August they will be producing 6 8 B TC day The Company expects that these new units will enable CleanSpark to increase its total mining production capacity to over 3 2 EH s following the delivery and deployment of all the equipment 3 2EH s at current difficulty levels translates to 16 18 B TC day Puts them on par with Riot and Marathon in mining capacity by August and has them in line with RIOT MARA projected mining capacity going forward Also the only one that is producing B TC w renewable energy We are extremely proud to have CleanSpark achieve what we believe to be the only Bit coin miner to achieve 95 carbon free operations at scale in the United States We have a goal of pushing it further to achieve full carbon neutrality in the coming years CLSK Announces 16 2 Million Increase in Microgrid Contracts a 220 Improvement as well as B TC mining update https www prnewswire com news releases cleanspark announces 16 2 million increase in microgrid contracts a 220 improvement 301271134 html https www prnewswire com news releases cleanspark announces 16 2 million increase in microgrid contracts a 220 improvement 301271134 html As of April 18 2021 the Company s backlog of executed contracts has grown to over 23 5 million Representing an increase of 16 2 million or 220 from 7 3 million as mostly recently announced on February 12 2021 Amer Tadayon CleanSpark s Chief Revenue Officer stated We are very pleased with the results being generated by our sales and marketing teams All of our efforts have begun to bear fruit especially our residential initiative which has been yielding incredible results In the quarter ended March 31 2021 the Company produced more than 144 Bit coins and has produced 205 Bit coins since acquiring its mining operations on December 10 2021 As of April 18 2021 CleanSpark is holding more than 143 Bit coins on its balance sheet all of which have been produced by its mining operations The growth from 1 1 EH s to 3 2 EH s is expected to occur at an average rate of 160 PH s per month from September 2021 to September 2022 At current difficulty rates this would result in Bit coin production increasing by approximately one additional Bit coin per day every month Some Takeaways The stock is viewed as a failing microgrid business no more than that right now From a fundamental perspective the market is not pricing in their current B TC mining operations into valuation Incredible low cost growth track ahead The mining investments are instantly cashflow positive The equity raise was necessary to ramp up mining however future growth is funding through operational cash flow The microgrid business is extremely well positioned to finally succeed under the current administration The proposed Infrastructure Bill includes 50 billion to improve infrastructure resilience including in communities vulnerable to climate driven disasters Also includes a 10 year extension to tax credit program for renewables But what I m most focused on is the valuation disconnect Because the business doesn t have many variables we can take a look at some projections using the stated capacity timeline and price assumptions of 30k B TC for downside and 55k B TC for upside https preview redd it ue0t5vassyy61 png width 1363 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 096f3b0f935e7f6f8aaed75b51195a27638cd76a What we can
