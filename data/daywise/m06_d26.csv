this options never hit huge but another one DJ KHALID VOICE OPTION HAS 77K OPENINTREST 3 CALL 77K JULY 16 2 CALL 77K JULY 16 YOLO IDGAF GSAT TO THE MOON As there seems to be some confusion around spectrum and its value and use cases let me provide some perspective Globalstar hold 8 725MHz of spectrum in L band 1610 1618 725 and another 16 5MHz of S band spectrum 2483 5 2500 MHz of which 11 5MHz are also authorized for terrestrial use in the US So in total they have 25 225MHz for user links satellite to terminals SpaceX s Starlink uses a total of 3150MHz for user links in the Ku band 10 7 12 7 GHz 12 75 13 25GHz 13 85 14 5 GHz so about 125 times the spectrum Globalstar hold Let s ignore either party s authorizations for gateway links in C and Ka band for this exercise Obviously Starlink have a hell lot more spectrum than Globalstar which is why the earlier is categorized as broadband service and the latter as narrowband Since spectral bandwidth dictates how much throughput your system can deliver to your users this means Starlink can delivery much more Mbps to much more users than Globalstar So at first glance Globalstar s spectrum appears to be minisucle compared to Starlink or other broadband satellite services which dispose of 1000s of MHz of spectrum raising the question of its value However there are four aspects here that distinguish Globalstar s spectrum from Starlink 1 Lower frequencies travel further and propagate much better spread out wider than higher ones Globalstar s spectrum is 4 to 9 times lower than Starlink s That is why for Starlink you need this expensive bulky elaborate tracking antenna which consumes 100W of power while Globalstar has handheld terminals with power consumption in the mW range and days of battery life that do require a clear sky but no antenna pointing So there are some very significant technical trade offs between these frequency bands and the required hardware Globalstar has portable low cost handhald terminals that work even in the harshest conditions but with low bandwidth while Starlink delivers very high data rates at the expense of terminal size cost power and line of sight requirements Globalstar therefore targets completely different users and applications such as IoT devices GPS trackers personal messengers etc while Starlink is all about broadband Internet access 2 While SpaceX share their frequency spectrum with hundreds of other satellites so far predominantly geostationary ones but soon also with other LEOs like OneWeb to which they have to avoid interference posing increasing challenges as LEO will be populated by more and more satellites including such with higher ITU priority Globalstar has exclusive rights globally for 7 775MHz of L band 1610 1617 775 MHz and the S band 2483 5 2500 MHz globally which means nobody else is allowed to use their frequencies hence there is no risk of interference and they can deploy into those bands whatever they want as long as its a satellite based service 3 While Starlink struggle to secure market access for every single jurisdiction across globe Globalstar did that decades ago and are licensed to sell their services in most of the world 4 Globalstar have authorization in at least the US and Canada to also use the S band portion of their spectrum on the ground for ordinary cellular networks while Starlink can t deploy any Ku band service on the ground Obivously comparing Globalstar to Starlink is like comparing a trail bike to an 18 wheeler or a Swiss pocket knife to a chainsaw The two serve entirely different purposes and have their own advantages and disadvantages So what could Globalstar s spectrum be used for and who might have an interest to lease it buy it or take over the entire company First of all spectrum is becoming increasingly scarce and particularly in these relative low frequency ranges with their benign propagation characteristics there is simply no unused spectrum left and in particular not such that could be deployed instantly globally Obviously the S band portion could be used for 5G networks at least in the US and Canada be it for enterprise campus networks or on a country wide scale Although 11 5MHz is not much compared to the hundreds of MHz typically deployed across various frequency bands for 4G 5G in urban areas it could still be interesting for the extra capacity or just for an IoT focussed service Maybe Amazon would want to add some licensed frequency bands to their Sidewalk network which today is based on the unlicensed 902 928 MHz range where there s no protection from interference According to ITU filings the Chinese GW Guo Wang constellation of 13k satellites set to counter Starlink will feature both a broadband and narrowband payload https twitter com Megaconstellati status 1310703406256971776 https twitter com Megaconstellati status 1310703406256971776 and the Europeans have also been studying the possibility of multi mission satellites that combine different payloads including MSS narrowband and FSS broadband services Given the many synergies here sharing the satellite bus gateway links and ground infrastructure and the value of integrated solutions broadband service falls back to narrowband during bad weather or obstruction I could imagine that some of the megaconstellations like Starlink OneWeb Telesat or Amazon s Kuiper could have an interest in Globalstar As Globalstar will need to replace their satellites by 2025 there s the opportunity to integrate Globalstar s service as a secondary payload into the earlier s next generation satellites which would not only fit techncially but also timewise Various companies including Xona are proposing a GPS alternative based on LEO satellites and actually Globalstar s competitor Iridium does already offer a so called PNT Positioning Navigation and Timing service through a subsidiary called Satelles that operates a hosted payload on Iridium s 2nd gen Next satellites and broadcasts a GPS like signal in a subcarrier of Iridium s L band spectrum However Satelles is not very precise only 20 50m and there s certainly a very significant market for a system that a is more accurate by leveraging more advanced chip sized atomic clocks CSAC resulting in higher accuracy and b works simultaneously in different frequency bands L and S band to counter the growing inferference jamming and spoofing issues of all the GNSS that are all L band based today Interestingly at least OneWeb which I mentioned already in the previous bullet point is working on adding a PNT function to their next generation satellites but suffer from the issue that they only own Ku band spectrum which would require a large elaborate antenna on the receivers so it would not be possible to receive their Ku based PNT signal on a handheld device unless they secured spectrum in another frequency band Various satellite operators use Globalstar for TT amp C so basically to control and monitor their small satellites in lower orbits This enables realtime control whereas today most satellites can only connect infrequently for a few minutes during every orbit while overflying a ground station and eliminates the need of licensing ground stations around the world While TT amp C alone is not a huge market justifying the acquisition of Globalstar or its spectrum it could support the business case as secondary application for the above scenarios Such system becomes particularly interesting if it also provided a PNT service allowing more precise orbit determination of cubesats and other small satellites So there are certainly a number of use cases for Globalstar s spectrum that would unlock much more value than is actually visible today The most value could be unlocked if someone bought Globalstar to do all of the four points above Deploy the S Band porition terrestrially in urban areas in parallel maintain a satellite service put the space segment as hosted payload on a larger multi mission satellite bus hence reducing the cost of the space segment introduce a highly precise PNT service and offer TT amp C to other satellites P S

please let me know if I made any errors Also no part of this post should be construed as financial investing advice You should always do your due diligence before putting your money anywhere and this is no exception Tl dr Leveraged ETFs such as SPXL UPRO TQQQ tend to be very favorable over the long run despite popular belief They tend to over perform their leverage when the return is positive and under perform their leverage when the return is negative causing there to be a sort of lopsided upside In this post I attempt to find a way to model the return of SPXL a 3x leveraged bull S amp P 500 ETF based on the return of SPY over long periods of time mainly 1 year It seems that the general consensus among investors is that leveraged ETFs are a bad long term investment mainly because these ETFs only multiply the the return of the underlying daily For example SPXL a 3x leveraged fund that tracks SPY only returns 3 times the return of SPY daily so if SPY goes up 3 on a given day it goes up 9 The implication of this is that there is a great deal of uncertainty over the long term return of the leveraged ETF there is no guarantee that the ETF multiplies the return of the underlying over longer periods of time The second main argument against leveraged ETFs is that as a consequence of the magnified movement of the underlying up and down the math works against leveraged ETFs causing them to lose value over time a phenomenon known as negative return bias People that support this point argue that this negative return bias causes the leveraged ETF to underperform the underlying in the long run and in many cases even go down when the underlying goes up Although there is some evidence to back this a closer look at the historical returns of SPXL and SPY in green years would say otherwise SPXL out performed SPY in 2019 2017 2016 2014 2013 2012 2010 2009 An important outlier here is 2020 in which SPXL under performed SPY despite it being a green year I will address the reasons behind this later on This video https www youtube com watch v NVt6ilphs7Q amp t 499s does a better job debunking this belief by performing an autocorrelation t test to determine if the negative return bias is statistically significant It is not Either way the main purpose of this post is not to counter the second argument but to address the concern behind the uncertainty of the long term returns of leveraged ETFs I did so by trying to develop a mathematical model that predicts the return of the 3x leveraged ETF SPXL based on the return of underlying SPY over a one year timeframe First I collected the historical prices of SPY daily since 1993 Then I calculated the daily return of SPY in every day since 1993 using the formula close open open 100 to get a distribution of all daily returns historically for SPY I could now model SPY s movement over longer periods of time by stringing together these returns specifically I was able to simulate SPY s yearly return and a 3x leveraged S amp P bull by randomly selecting 250 daily returns since there are 250 trading days in a year from my distribution of all daily returns I did this 10 000 times to simulate 10 000 years I then plotted the the 3x daily leveraged ETF VS SPY and the results were interesting amp x200B https preview redd it qi3032zuim771 png width 397 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 6e6a160bd86c4e74041f78bb614e3676e9c70855 As you can see there seems to be a very clear polynomial exponential pattern shown with some variability I fit a cubic model to this data and it seems to be a nice fit amp x200B The axes are somewhat mislabeled it was supposed to say SPXL on the y axis and SPY on the x axis not vice versa https preview redd it 2ljigk4kjm771 png width 397 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 431c8681808af25c4584bff3ead0272a2365b8ed My primary observation is that the data seems to be curved in a way that makes the 3x leveraged ETF very favorable it tends to overperform the 3x leverage when SPY goes up for instance when SPY goes up 25 in a year it is estimated that the leveraged ETF will go up by more than 75 in this case almost 100 and it tends to underperform the 3x leverage when SPY goes down for instance when SPY goes down 10 it is estimated that the leveraged ETF will go down by less than 30 This is supported by historical data SPY has gone up an impressive 42 in the last year while SPXL has returned 173 more than 3 42 126 Obviously this model would be meaningless if I didn t test it with actual historical data SPXL was established back in 2009 so I used the plugged all the yearly returns of SPY since 2009 into my model to predict the yearly returns of SPXL since 2009 and I compared those findings to the actual yearly returns of SPXL since 2009 On average I was off by about 9 which isn t really that impressive but is still reasonable when you take into account that the average absolute return of SPXL is about 56 To me overestimating or underestimating 56 by 9 isn t a big deal From what I saw it is very good in predicting the return if the volatility is less since that leaves less room for compounded variability The model was eerily accurate in predicting the return of 173 in the last year it was off by about 2 It was very inaccurate in predicting the return of SPXL in 2020 mainly because that was a period of high volatility and low net movement I haven t really rigorously tested the model but I plan on doing so when I get the time An analysis with QQQ and TQQQ yields similar results which leads me to believe that leveraged ETFs are a good way to get better returns Although it isn t advisable to pour your life savings into such instruments investing a part of your portfolio in leveraged ETFs might be the move If you ve

please let me know if I made any errors Posting again because I made a mistake in the first version that I wasn t able to edit for some reason Also posting this as discussion because I don t think this is suitable as DD It isn t as extensive as most DD is and I m here to see what other people think Also no part of this post should be construed as financial investing advice You should always do your due diligence before putting your money anywhere and this is no exception Tl dr Leveraged ETFs such as SPXL UPRO TQQQ tend to be very favorable over the long run despite popular belief They tend to over perform their leverage when the return is positive and under perform their leverage when the return is negative causing there to be a sort of lopsided upside In this post I attempt to find a way to model the return of SPXL a 3x leveraged bull S amp P 500 ETF based on the return of SPY over long periods of time mainly 1 year It seems that the general consensus among investors is that leveraged ETFs are a bad long term investment mainly because these ETFs only multiply the the return of the underlying daily For example SPXL a 3x leveraged fund that tracks SPY only returns 3 times the return of SPY daily so if SPY goes up 3 on a given day it goes up 9 The implication of this is that there is a great deal of uncertainty over the long term return of the leveraged ETF there is no guarantee that the ETF multiplies the return of the underlying over longer periods of time The second main argument against leveraged ETFs is that as a consequence of the magnified movement of the underlying up and down the math works against leveraged ETFs causing them to lose value over time a phenomenon known as negative return bias People that support this point argue that this negative return bias causes the leveraged ETF to underperform the underlying in the long run and in many cases even go down when the underlying goes up Although there is some evidence to back this a closer look at the historical returns of SPXL and SPY in green years would say otherwise SPXL out performed SPY in 2019 2017 2016 2014 2013 2012 2010 2009 An important outlier here is 2020 in which SPXL under performed SPY despite it being a green year I will address the reasons behind this later on This video https www youtube com watch v NVt6ilphs7Q amp amp t 499s does a better job debunking this belief by performing an autocorrelation t test to determine if the negative return bias is statistically significant It is not Either way the main purpose of this post is not to counter the second argument but to address the concern behind the uncertainty of the long term returns of leveraged ETFs I did so by trying to develop a mathematical model that predicts the return of the 3x leveraged ETF SPXL based on the return of underlying SPY over a one year timeframe First I collected the historical prices of SPY daily since 1993 Then I calculated the daily return of SPY in every day since 1993 using the formula close open open 100 to get a distribution of all daily returns historically for SPY I could now model SPY s movement over longer periods of time by stringing together these returns specifically I was able to simulate SPY s yearly return and a 3x leveraged S amp P bull by randomly selecting 250 daily returns since there are 250 trading days in a year from my distribution of all daily returns I did this 10 000 times to simulate 10 000 years I then plotted the the 3x daily leveraged ETF VS SPY and the results were interesting amp x200B https preview redd it kcwtxloxpm771 png width 397 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 9d3f8a25ccdf5c3e5cee47e387d82caa4c8ed11f As you can see there seems to be a very clear polynomial exponential pattern shown with some variability I fit a cubic model to this data and it seems to be a nice fit amp x200B The axes are kind of mislabeled it was supposed to say SPXL on the y axis and SPY on the x axis not vice versa https preview redd it r122j7zypm771 png width 397 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b9644507150cfe0e85956b7f7f146b579499fb5a My primary observation is that the data seems to be curved in a way that makes the 3x leveraged ETF very favorable it tends to overperform the 3x leverage when SPY goes up for instance when SPY goes up 25 in a year it is estimated that the leveraged ETF will go up by more than 75 in this case almost 100 and it tends to underperform the 3x leverage when SPY goes down for instance when SPY goes down 10 it is estimated that the leveraged ETF will go down by less than 30 This is supported by historical data SPY has gone up an impressive 42 in the last year while SPXL has returned 173 more than 3 42 126 Obviously this model would be meaningless if I didn t test it with actual historical data SPXL was established back in 2009 so I used the plugged all the yearly returns of SPY since 2009 into my model to predict the yearly returns of SPXL since 2009 and I compared those findings to the actual yearly returns of SPXL since 2009 On average I was off by about 9 which isn t really that impressive but is still reasonable when you take into account that the average absolute return of SPXL is about 56 To me overestimating or underestimating 56 by 9 isn t a big deal From what I saw it is very good in predicting the return if the volatility is less since that leaves less room for compounded variability The model was eerily accurate in predicting the return of 173 in the last year it was off by about 2 It was very inaccurate in predicting the return of SPXL in 2020 mainly because that was a period of high volatility and low net movement I haven t really rigorously tested the model but I plan on doing so when I get the time An analysis with QQQ and TQQQ yields similar results which leads me to believe that leveraged ETFs are a good way to get better returns Although it isn t advisable to pour your life savings into such instruments investing a part of your portfolio in leveraged ETFs might be the move If you ve made it this far thanks a lot for reading Please let me know if I ve made any mistakes and or if you agree or disagree with my findings

that I used to work for an investment fund as a commodities consultant My job was to go through earning reports and keep up with geopolitical bullshit all over the globe Now I trade with my own funds I work for myself Now let s go back to J Pow He said a couple of days ago that they expect inflation to go up My autistic brain tells me that there will be some market movement and some funds will change hands He also said that the rates would eventually go up What will happen in the next 6 months to a year With a higher Fed interest rate Macroeconomically high growth stocks will go down as well Dow stocks because it will become more expensive to borrow money However that change is scheduled two years down the road so why the transition will happen faster Because big capital is always ahead of the market that s why those pendejos stay rich Big capital will dump all their high growth shit and move to safer options As for inflation rate higher rates trigger a transfer from growth stocks to commodities because those are considered refuge assets Gold Silver and all the other shit that your grandma loves to buy is part of that Those things will go up but me I don t fuck with that

x200B CONCLUSION The 2nd Quarter ends Wednesday The amount of shorting at such high interest rates combined with the very low availability of shares to short tells me two things 1 Hedge funds are desperate to hold their short positions as low as possible this quarter to minimize losses They only plan to hold short for a very brief period of time at that cost to borrow 2 There is a very high likelihood some if not most will cover those short positions and possibly even flip to long positions July 1st as a new quarter begins The price of this stock is going up at the turn of the quarter

in value since going public in 2020 despite the fact that the e commerce sales app has more than 100 million monthly active users with a revenue of 2 5 billion growing 31 year over year The drop

selling is yet another creation of the securities industry and is in essence nothing more than a license to create counterfeit shares When you are inflating the amount of stock that is outstanding in a company this is considered counterfeiting The rules justify the practice by saying it helps create smooth efficient and orderly markets Same stuff we have heard countless times around high frequency trading but in reality we believe this practice leads to shady characters creating unlimited supplies of counterfeit stocks which in turn results in your investment continuing to decline and investors are left wondering why Key Differentiator Wish Successfully Profits From Data Their pervasive social media strategy characterized by large advertisement spending makes use of easy available data of visitors By attracting social media users and giving them the option to enter the platform only with their social accounts Wish automatically gets a profile of each customer which makes keeping visitors on the platform easier Wish uses their social media information to compile a more comprehensive picture of their customers and their product preferences Wish thrives on the information rich digital age as over 70 of the sales on the Wish platform do not involve a search query and instead come from personalized browsing This underlines the success of their strategy by attracting visitors with low prices and converting them into shoppers by using their preferences against them With the gamble like experience featuring an interface looking more like a browsing page of pictures rather than an e commerce store the developers try to affect habits and patterns of the app users which eventually lures them into purchasing goods on the platform The corona outbreak partially has hurt sales as their low income target clients had less to spend during these unprecedented times However as the United States reopens and Europe gets increasingly vaccinated too their target audience could return with even larger numbers spending more than ever as economies seem to be booming in the corona aftermath The Golden Investor thinks that ContextLogic Inc WISH will be able to overcome challenges and grow further as cheap market place for low income consumers The company could grow even more if it would enter the Indian market with a growing middle income group with less to spend This will be very challenging but is not entirely unimaginable as growth in the United States is hitting its top level The innovative and research heavy focus of the company will prove lucrative for early investors as it could grow to much larger extents in the coming years Call Options and Technical Analysis The company whose stock has rallied 25 in the past week is bull flagging and looks to

pervasive social media strategy characterized by large advertisement spending makes use of easy available data of visitors By attracting social media users and giving them the option to enter the platform only with their social accounts Wish automatically gets a profile of each customer which makes keeping visitors on the platform easier Wish uses their social media information to compile a more comprehensive picture of their customers and their product preferences Wish thrives on the information rich digital age as over 70 of the sales on the Wish platform do not involve a search query and instead come from personalized browsing This underlines the success of their strategy by attracting visitors with low prices and converting them into shoppers by using their preferences against them With the gamble like experience featuring an interface looking more like a browsing page of pictures rather than an e commerce store the developers try to affect habits and patterns of the app users which eventually lures them into purchasing goods on the platform The corona outbreak partially has hurt sales as their low income target clients had less to spend during these unprecedented times However as the United States reopens and Europe gets increasingly vaccinated too their target audience could return with even larger numbers spending more than ever as economies seem to be booming in the corona aftermath The Golden Investor thinks that ContextLogic Inc WISH will be able to overcome challenges and grow further as cheap market place for low income consumers The company could grow even more if it would enter the Indian market with a growing middle income group with less to spend This will be very challenging but is not entirely unimaginable as growth in the United

can help at least one person If you are like me you re only able to rationally and logically analyze a position before and after the fact and are unable to do so in the moment You re great at picking winners and entering positions but then it always seems to fall apart and you somehow manage to throw it all away gt but maybe it s just like gambling It s not just like gambling it s exactly like gambling You may have never seen yourself as a gambler or like one of those people but you are sure this place is called Wall St Bets and yeah this is a casino and what s an exit strategy but those are all just memes right You and me the smart and disciplined people we re actually investing right Wrong I ve been wrestling with this for a while in a very painful and psychologically destructive way I d be lying if I said it hasn t partially shattered my ego I m the type of person that needs to understand why why I did or did not do a particular thing in the moment Why did I ignore my gut or plan or second guess myself or ignore past lessons experiences or lose sight of the big picture and my goals or become blind to context and lose perspective I ve made myself physically and mentally ill for days turning the situations over and over in my mind replaying them looking for some clue or explanation as to why I acted the way I did A few realizations that helped me move forward and learn about myself by watching the market continuously day after day minute by minute I turned my trading screen into a slot machine you may not have been a gambler before but constant exposure to a slot machine will physically rewire your brain the same way that doing coke or heroin will Accept that your hardware is compromised and cannot behave appropriately anymore the software you re running is irrelevant gt And yes I have a trading rule book But in the moment it s fucking thrown out I have written pages of lessons and how I felt and goals and rules then immediately forgot about all of it in the moment even as past events replayed themselves exactly as before and even as my gut and head were screaming for me to run for the exit This article is a must read and I encourage everyone to do their own further research https www fastcompany com 90217918 how gambling distorts reality and hooks your brain gamblers are not addicted to the high they get from winning they are addicted to the high they get from uncertainty and anticipation You get a dopamine hit when the numbers move how you thought they would You even get a dopamine hit from losing You do not get a dopamine hit from exiting a position because then the game is over This is why you can t exit gracefully the more you are craving has nothing to do with making money it has to do with seeing the numbers go up Once you get your next hit you ll immediately want another and that next hit has nothing to do with smashing the Sell button and so you never will You ll stick around FOREVER glued to watching the numbers flash and smash your neurons with dopamine even as it drains to zero Here are some tips I ve tried to drill into myself but they will only help if you step away from the machine It s not your money until you sell Until you sell it s the market s money Frame it as how much of this position am I actually willing to lose Ask yourself would I buy into this position right now at its current value If you re up 300 in 2 days the answer is probably no and you should start thinking about selling Think about how much money it actually is Is it a utility bill your rent mortgage a steak dinner a vacation a sports car an early retirement People value time think about it in terms of salary and feel a little guilty Imagine the hardest working poor person you know is it twice their yearly salary 4x Imagine telling a loved one you flushed the equivalent of years of their hard work and how disrespectful that would be Imagine how many months or years you d have to work to break even if you lost it all Step away from the screen Stop looking at the flashing numbers Commit to sampling the curve and seeking the peak via stop losses and limits You won t ever get it perfect so stop trying perfect is the enemy of good enough Rewire your brain to see taking profits and not losing money as the win Think about downside exits Remember stairs up elevator down The next rug pull is always just around the corner and you have NO guarantee that a stock will trade sideways or give you time to exit slowly Don t day trade Try to look at the screen as little as possible Set limits and stops to automate the process Yes you will miss out on gains and get stopped out but is that worse than flushing thousands watching it go to zero in real time over and over Even with these rules in mind remember you re a gambler you re an addict your brain is physically and functionally compromised and no amount of rules or nice thoughts will change that If you want to keep trading you have to enforce equivalent physically based habits and guardrails that sidestep the slot machine If you re staring at the screen you re gambling Period Your judgement is fucked and you will not make the correct decisions because the selection of choices and perspectives you have available in that moment has been artificially limited You won t ever lock in your gains because the sell option has been removed from the menu by the blind spot in your brain If you want to win you have to take steps to change the rules of the game in your favor
