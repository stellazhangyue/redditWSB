Theta time decay Implied volatility Implied volatility percentile or IV IVP similar to RSI for options Vega the change in the option premium with respect to the the change in implied volatility by 1

underlying stock price Rho the change in option premium respective to the change in the 10 year rate if the 10 year rate increases the rate of the premium is going to go up Variables used to measure a call put option price Strike price time underlying stock price implied volatility and interest rates Naked call options short strangles short straddles all have unlimited risk Short Strangle Short Straddle has unlimited risk because of you betting on a range and if it goes out of the range then you have unlimited losses on the call option because the price can go to an infinite number Intrinsic value the value of the strike price and the underlying stock price has to be in the money exercise value if the stock price is above your strike price Use the strike price the stock price to find your intrinsic value Extrinsic value the value of implied volatility time and interest rates the difference between the market price of an option also knowns as its premium and its intrinsic price Long strangle profit from it going out of the range up or down really fast IV buy when it s really low because you re buying a vanilla call and a put You can buy this on a Friday during power power hour if the stock is trading sideways and see which direction it s going to go on Monday and then cut the one that s going down Short strangle profit from it staying within the range High implied volatility Vertical call spread and vertical put spread is called an iron condor is for high IV spread for high range Shorting a put spread and shorting a call spread for short term Long strangle your directionally betting in both ways Short strangle is you betting on it not going anywhere you re profiting more on it staying within that range because you make double the premium Long Straddle is buying a put and a call at the money strike Short Straddle sell a call and a put at the strike price whichever one breaks you would close out that position High IV you want to short options and low IV you want to buy long options Credit spreads put call whenever IVP is very high shorting strategies Negative side going against something Debit spreads is going long on something IVP is very low Credit think of inflow of money think of the negative sign sign shorting You want the credit to expire out of the money Debit think of outflow of money think of the positive side sign long position You want the debit to expire in the money Long position always buying position debit strategy Short position always selling but selling is not always equal to shorting position credit strategy Borrowing something the less the value becomes the less you have to pay back Short selling to open and buying to close Diagonal credit spread is where you short a put call at a long term expiration and then you buy a long put call at a short term expiration Diagonal debit spread is when you short a call put at a short term expiration and then you buy a long call put at a long term expiration Diagonal means that you have two different expirations and strike price Calendar spread is different expirations same strikes similar to a diagonal spread another way to say it is a horizontal spread Breakout for free strategy sell two put credit spreads and one call credit spread A synthetic put is an options strategy that combines a short stock position with a long call option on that same stock to mimic a long put option It is also called a synthetic long put Essentially an investor who has a short position in a stock purchases an at the money call option on that same stock Jade lizard strategy this is a neutral bullish credit strategy Short a put add another leg short call option when the IV is high then you re buying an out of the money call even higher in price to benefit from any hard moves to the upside What you can do is wait for the IV to drop low and then buy the call option You have to have the capital to do the cash secured put and the stocks to sell the covered call Iron butterfly the shorted put and shorted call are the same strike price vertical credit spread has the same expiration date you re betting on the stock trading sideways Butterfly debit strategy puts or calls and it s a credit and a debit spread with one mutual strike price same expiration Neutral position and you re betting on either the call side or the put side You want the price to hit in the middle of the strike price and then sell the contract When you re doing a butterfly they re usually long strategies and you short two strike prices in the middle and you long two strikes Vertical spreads have the same expiration and have different strike prices Horizontal spreads have different expirations and have same strike price Diagonal spreads have different strikes and different expirations Wheel strategy is doing a cash secured put and being long the stock so you get premium and if you wait until expiration you get to keep the premium if it expires out of the money if it expires in the money then you will get assigned shares and the premium will help you to reduce your average cost and then you can do a covered call which is shorting a call option covered call and collecting more premium and then if it expires in the money then you sell at the strike price That way you make the difference between the cash secured put strike price and the covered call strike price Vertical Debit spread is when you sell a call put at a lower strike price and then you buy a long call put at a higher strike price same expiration is for low implied volatility Vertical Credit spread is when you sell a call put a higher strike price and buy a long call put at a lower strike price same expiration is for high implied volatility

brand has established itself as the top selling jeans brand by retail value in the U S and the world for their quality durability and timeless style Despite the fashion and apparel industry constantly changing LEVI has managed to stay relevant through their strong design styles fierce IP protection and celebrity endorsements Although there are many publicly traded competitors in the industry LEVI is forecasted to grow faster than overall apparel as an industry Additionally throughout the years LEVI has developed many strategic partnerships with sustanaibly produced cotton and hemp growers that has allowed for them to pave the way for more environmentally conscious business practices in the production of denim jeans Management CEO Blue Chip Bergh is no soft baked cookie With over 21 years of experience in brand management from working at Procter amp Gamble Chip has used the skills he developed there to help elevate Levi Strauss amp Co as a global force since joining the company in 2011 paving the way for 13 9 year on year growth in global revenue in 2018 before successfully launching an IPO in 2019 Since then he has also increased Levi s DTC business to almost 40 from 21 Chip is a strong advocate for being on the right side of history and believes that business leaders have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their employees their customers and their communities As a socially conscious company LEVI continues to act on this belief by donating towards equitable causes and working with nonprofit organizations to raise money for social justice issues two recent examples being donating 100 of proceeds from their pride collection to support LGBTQ rights and championing over voter s rights laws This man wears his jeans in the shower https preview redd it

a stronger company and they set themselves up to do so Levi s return to the public market in 2019 helped them double down on the investments that they had laid out which included diversifying beyond denim to tops expanding online and selling more directly to the consumer Levi s launched their first app in late 2019 and saw strong success as the pandemic raged on in 2020 This past quarter LEVI saw their e commerce grow 25 and an increase in total online revenue of 41 Following strong results LEVI raised their dividend in April by 50 oh yes they give dividends to 0 06 per share in Q2 which ended up being paid out May 25th 2021 Guess what happened from April to May earlier this year LEVI hit all time highs reaching up to 30 84 3 month stock chart showing price volume 50MA and RSI https preview

is a buy and hold and most analysts have listed LEVI as a buy or overweight stock Throughout the past year LEVI has continued to beat earnings estimates despite getting beat down by the pandemic along with the rest of the retail industry This upcoming quarter LEVI s boosted their sales growth expectation to 25 and they are expected to beat analyst expectations for earnings of 5 cents to 9 cents Their Q2 earnings conference is scheduled for next Thursday July 8th after hours 2 00pm PST Slowly but surely LEVI has been building up on a pre anticipatory run for their earnings but is on the way to reach higher highs by the end of the year They also recently renewed the lease for their entire San Francisco headquarters after previously listing a third of the space for sublease The Growth in Waist Sizes One of Chip Bergh s growth plays was the acquisition of The Jeans Company TJC in 2019 to help boost sales in the Andean Region and overall accelerate growth in South America through their distribution chain Similarly straight from the BECKY stock playbook Levi s launched a secondhand store a la Lululemon power play As many investors know growth in apparel means needing to see growth in women s sales as Levi s has managed to do as well as staying on top of identifying rising trends to match demand For one the boom in loss fitting jeans during the pandemic as many of us may know from firsthand experience was a quick transition for a company like LEVI Furthermore data is showing that clothing sales are spiking even higher than 2019 levels this year because roughly 25 of consumers are a new size post pandemic As people continue to go out after getting vaccinated and buying new clothes this creates something called the peacock effect in which more and more people start dressing to impress and thus buying more new clothes for their wardrobe This on top of the child tax credit kicking in for many families adds more fuel with the key back to school shopping season coming upon us All the meanwhile LEVI has been focusing on the growth of their DTC business to increase company gross margins and improve the overall profitability of the company Over time they plan to operate more like a retailer and less like a wholesaler Ultimately LEVI is strategically positioned to benefit from the upcoming boom in consumer retail spending Twitter Proof from BOA https preview redd it

SweetWater Q The Sweetwater acquisition was sold as having a foot in the door in the US but I fail to understand how this relates to cannabis besides branding Is Sweetwater Aphria s main engine in the US A SweetWater is about more than beverage alcohol and it is about more than owning a company in the US It is about finding a platform to share our cannabis brands with Americans prior to our entry into the market Pardon the KISS reference here but SweetWater has reached such iconic status in a major part of the US that its brand loyalists can safely be referred to as the SweetWater Army almost like the Aphria Army on Reddit These brand loyalists are extremely passionate about good times good beer and growingly good cannabis SweetWater carefully crafted a following of people based on outdoor themes and cannabis They surround those people with opportunities to do things together most importantly SweetWater s 420Fest 75 000 brand loyalists descending on Atlanta for a weekend of concerts great beer and cannabis What an amazing venue to introduce our brands to people who are already predisposed to be likely cannabis consumers While we wait for US legalization we can introduce those loyal followers to Aphria s brands creating a situation where once federally legalized a SweetWater aficionado enters a cannabis store and sees RIFF cannabis on display Recognizes the brand name and is predisposed to purchasing RIFF cannabis because the brand already resonates with them It also allows us consistent with US law to advertise SweetWater and our brands in the US Who knows maybe you will see a sports broadcast in the next year with a SweetWater RIFF beverage advertising board Stay safe amp GLTA

a reverse merger Sofi has features such as Checking Accounts Credit Cards Stock Investing Student Loan Refinancing and Origination Personal Loans Mortgage Refinancing Auto Loan Refinancing and Early Payday so you can blow your Wendy s paycheck 2 days earlier The vast array of products they offer and partnerships they have formed with other companies gives them a unique ability to cross sell their products to customers and retain customers by doing so For example someone may come to SOFI refinance their gender studies student loans but end up banking and investing with them This is because of a singular key factor Convenience Sofi s target audience for their products are millennials who are financially savvy What do we know about millennials They value convenience It s why people will use Grubhub Doordash or Uber Eats despite the absurd fees and cold tendies they receive why people will use Amazon Prime to order stuff rather than go in person why people will use Robinhood despite it going down every time something interesting actually happens in the market This creates a dynamic where people will switch over their entire financial life to Sofi in order to simplify things and makes Sofi in many ways a superapp in the making similar to that of Alipay Sofi has worked out deals with big banks so that retail can get an equal footing in IPO s Provided a Sofi member has 3 000 in their Sofi Invest account they are eligible to get in on an IPO at the IPO s reference price as opposed to market price https preview redd it pnyzn6ihf7871 png width 1396 amp format png amp auto webp

deals with high quality customers with good income and good credit scores rather than degenerates like you Because of this they can run a business model that is beneficial to all parties involved Sofi can charge lower interest rates due to the low risk of default on any lending they do and customers can get low interest rates with flexible payment options This provides a good experience for customers and helps Sofi retain them or better yet cross sell them on other products As it stands now Sofi s bread and butter is Business to Consumer B2C lending which makes up a large portion of their revenue however as time goes on and we see an expansion and more adoption of their financial services Banking Credit Cards Investing we will see this shift to be more diversified Sofi projects 43 CAGR which is far above other companies in the sector such as PayPal and Square who project 20 2 and 29 3 respectively Sofi will be profitable this year as well and by 2025 will be raking in Billions of dollars in annual profits Overall Sofi is in a very healthy position with a boatload of cash on hand ready to expand the business be it through acquisitions or building out products https

shares aspects with dozens of companies such as investing with Robinhood Webull Chime Acorns banking with legacy banks such as GS JPM BAC WFC and many other companies who parallel Sofi With this said Sofi has a massive advantage over other fintech platforms Galileo No not the astronomer Galileo is to Sofi what AWS is to Amazon Galileo is a fintech API which powers many of the fintech companies we know and love or hate today Companies such as Robinhood rely on Galileo to power aspects of their business such as issuing debit cards and opening accounts What this means for all you smoothbrains out there is that as those companies grow and gain members Sofi gets a cut of that Though Robinhood is the most well known of the companies handled by Galileo there are dozens of others who all rely on it

merger deal was announced earlier this year In February Sofi peaked at an ATH of 28 2 dollars right before the Inflation Boogaloo made the markets throw a fit From then it s had some choppy price action but has continued in it s uptrend Recently Sofi has dropped due to Pipe unlocking allowing them to sell Pipe No not the lead thing you licked as a kid putting your room temp IQ ass on the path to WSB PIPE Private Investment in Public Equity is when big investment firms are offered the ability to invest before a merger is announced at a favorable price In doing this their shares are locked up for a period of time so that they don t immediately sell As of last Friday PIPE investors were able to sell their shares if they wanted On Friday and Monday we saw high volume price action with lots of volatility Friday was somewhat brutal for holders but Monday not only presented opportunities for dip buying but had a great close Sofi rejected the lows of 17 6 and closed at 19 4

almost no shares available to short at any given time however and retail are getting paid 46 interest just for diamond handing shares and lending them Pretty sweet right With the bullish price action

existing charter so that instead of getting a brand new charter they can simply request a transfer of control This will speed up the process and although the bank charter will probably be approved

Billion transaction including debt A deal that would merge two of Canada s largest telecom conglomerates second and fourth respectively Rogers acquired all issued and outstanding class A shares and class B shares for a price of C 40 50 per share in Cash This reflects a premium of about 70 Rogers to invest 2 5 billion to build 5G network in Western Canada driving economic growth and strengthening innovation sector New 1 billion fund dedicated to connecting rural remote and Indigenous communities to high speed Internet across the four Western provinces Additional 3 billion to support additional network services and technology investments Rogers to maintain and grow local Shaw jobs so that teams across Alberta British Columbia Manitoba and Saskatchewan will continue to serve customers and support local communities The combined company is committed to continue offering affordable wireless plans with no overage fees that meet the budgets and needs of Canadians As part of this commitment Rogers will not increase wireless prices for Freedom Mobile customers for at least three years following the close of the transaction Source https www globenewswire com news release 2021 03 15 2192622 0 en Rogers and Shaw to come together in 26 billion transaction creating new jobs and investment in Western Canada and accelerating Canada s 5G rollout html amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Why Shaw communications is a good stock to invest in amp x200B Shaw communications has been providing one of the best internet TV and phone deals out there in comparison to their competitors They have significantly increased their market share after they re entered wireless market in 2016 In the last 4 years 2016 2020 the company has been successful in increasing their subscribers growth The company doubled their wireless subscriber base Not only did they increase their subscriber base but they also expanded their wireless EBITDA margin by 900 basis points The company was also successfully able to increase average billing per user ABPU by 20 and still able to maintain and grow their subscriber base Shaw s ROICs has stayed between 7 0 and 7 5 for the last five years and is expected to go up once merger has been closed out The Canadian government is keen on bringing wireless competition to the big three incumbents Unlike previous national upstarts Shaw s strong financial position and family control afford it the time and money to stick with a long term strategy to succeed amp x200B Are there any risks Yes of course there are risks There is no free money in this world and returns are directly proportionate to the risk Let s talk about the risk below amp x200B The largest merger since 2000 could not actually be approved The companies are expected to close the merger by early 2022 The largest telecom merger has set off some alarms in the eyes of regulatory Many investors and analysts believe that regulatory risks are imminent However if this merger closes out and deal goes through then the merger could significantly reduce competition in mobile wireless markets in cities and provinces across the country The earnings are tomorrow 7 30 after hours Earnings are always a risk so if you re a risk averse investor then you should be waiting for earnings results The biggest risk is that the merger with Rogers fails to gain regulatory approval so there is significant downside if the merger doesn t go through but only limited upside if it does Shaw is overly concentrated in its wireline business which accounts for 80 90 of revenue and profits there are not doing very well in television and landline phone subscribers When the press release came out Shaw shares surged 45 and the stock is currently trading at C 35 59 which is still 12 below the deal price This 12 discount is for regulatory approval which is a big challenge and could jeopardize the deal But Rogers and Shaw wouldn t have taken such a big step if they were not confident of the deal

the DD if you want the bus skip the DD Why is TTCF about to devour the food industry Even if I and probably tons of you are beef eaters rather than grass enjoyers it s estimated that a 100m degenerated in the US right now that are interested in plant based foods but there hasn t been enough innovation within their sector to really fulfill their needs The food industry is dominated by the same companies since the 1950s However we ve seen starting to disrupt this sector We want to invest in this innovation in a way that gives a high probability of great returns Here comes the most undervalued company in this sector TTCF and likely in the whole market By disrupting the market TTCF is not competing with anyone right now they are creating their own market They are not competing in

DD if you want the bus skip the DD Why is TTCF about to devour the food industry Even if I and probably tons of you are beef eaters rather than grass enjoyers it s estimated that a 100m degenerated in the US right now that are interested in plant based foods but there hasn t been enough innovation within their sector to really fulfill their needs The food industry is dominated by the same companies since the 1950s However we ve seen starting to disrupt this sector We want to invest in this innovation in a way that gives a high probability of great returns Here comes the most undervalued company in this sector TTCF and likely in the whole market By disrupting the market TTCF is not competing with anyone right now they are creating their own market They are not competing in the plant based meat category they are creating a whole array of plant based foods but most importantly products that customers actually like This is pioneering at its best I can already hear you saying oK bUt wHaT aBoUt BYND Beyond Meat only produces plant based meat TTCF has a whole range of plant based MEALS like a ratatouille that tastes better than R mi s and ready in minutes cauliflower mac amp cheese etc

they own the whole damn supply chain From the vegetables all the way to the final product They are constantly increasing capacity to be able to meet demand This enables TTCF to munch on inflation as they don t have suppliers Essentially this will guarantee rock solid margins once they slow down their growth and focus on profitability This also means they ll be able to diversify out of frozen food

some is compiled from elsewhere I have verified all of it to my own satisfaction Case for silver in general This post is about a silver stock not silver in general But suffice it to say silver is the only commodity which is at only half its nominal high from 1980 High inflation is now being admitted everywhere If silver got to only 50 again silver miners would soar to the moon And from 1971 to 1984 silver went up 36x in price from 1 3 to 50 According to ShadowStats the true inflation adjusted ATH of silver is 966 about 36x from today s silver price an interesting coincidence Case for silver stocks in general First of all some precedents The average penny silver stock went up 150x in price between 1962 and 1968 when the price of silver merely doubled In other words a 1000 investment became 150 000 One stock Coeur D Alene Mines even went up 1000x Here are some sources for this figure From 1962 to 1968 the average penny silver stock moved upwards over 150 times in price one went up over 1000 times due to a mere doubling of the price of silver and speculative fervor on the part of investors Doug Casey Crisis Investing 1980 Spokane continued to roll in silver The average penny stock appreciated 160 times between 1960 and 1968 Dr John Fahey Optimistic Imagination The Spokane Stock Exchange https www jstor org stable 40491757 Pacific Northwest Quarterly Vol 95 No 3 Summer 2004 See also a rare and interesting book called Small Fortunes in Penny Gold Stocks by Norman Lamb first published in 1973 which contains much rare and interesting data about the 60s silver bull market 150x is obviously the utmost that anybody could hope for and few penny stocks are likely to attain quite that number at 50 silver but it points us in the right direction as to the remarkable gains of which these stocks are capable General summary of the company s situation Bayhorse silver is a near term 1 3 million ounce producer which sits at a mere 30 million market cap The grade of the silver in the mine is higher than that of any other developer or explorer 22 ounces a ton The cost to produce an ounce is only 10 and the share price is therefore objectively capable of going 50x to 10 at 50 silver at a 30x cash flow valuation a valuation which is common in PM bull markets Proportional gains would obviously come thereafter 100x at 100 silver 200x at 200 silver etc They have an off take agreement in place with one of the biggest and most important concentrate firms in the world Ocean Partners whose experienced Senior Trader is pleased to work with them and wants a long term relationship with them They have four PhDs working on their project each of whom is world renowned They have a large team of experienced miners who are locals to the Silver Valley and whose families go back in the area for a century They own the largest silver deposit ever discovered in Oregon which only closed because of low silver prices not mine depletion They have a silver bull CEO who is friends with people like David Morgan and who truly understands the value proposition of silver A CEO who owns a large percent of the float personally speaks with his investors on the phone and who views his shareholders as a family Every penny of his net worth apart from his house is invested in BHS Another view of why BHS is special The grade of the silver is so high 21 oz t that Graeme the CEO could have taken a predatory loan offer and gone into production years ago Bayhorse are profitable even at 12 silver But he chose to bide his time and stick by his principles to wait for higher silver prices all the while funding the company with his own money His choice to do so has undoubtedly contributed to starving the COMEX by with holding 10 million ounces which they otherwise would have got at rock bottom prices Also the Bayhorse Silver Twitter account has put the silversqueeze hashtag in every single post from the very beginning of silversqueeze long before it became fashionable to do so and is always retweeting silversqueeze related news This is very radical stuff too like Craig Hemke s May COMEX raid A view of their exploration potential true blue sky Bayhorse are mining and exploring at the same time just like the miners of old This is for two reasons both to avoid wasting money and because they are already so confident in the property they hold Bob Moriarty a top mining analyst holds Bayhorse Silver as his 5th largest position and this is what he had say about this subject in 2018 I say that mining is the art and science of extracting minerals from the ground at a profit Mining is not poking a bunch of holes in the ground until a project looks like a giant Swiss cheese Counting ounces is not mining It may eventually contribute to profit but for the most part counting ounces is an expense I love what Graeme O Neill is doing I m so sick of guys presenting me formal 43 101 blessed numbers and promptly blowing up their companies Even in the conventional sense Bayhorse have considerable blue sky potential Bayhorse Mine itself is the largest silver deposit ever discovered in Oregon And it closed because of low silver prices NOT mine depletion One company took out a mere 150 000 ounces another took out 100 000 and that is all The present 21 oz t grade is already higher than that of ANY other silver developer or explorer CMC Metals Feb 2021 Bayhorse s three world class geologists anticipate that the ore body may go back at least 4000 feet into the mountain 1 million tons per 1000 feet and therefore 21 million ounces in the first 1000 feet alone and that the grade will only get better as time goes on See this interview https www youtube com watch v 8iJ30m Z8LE with David Morgan When U S Metal Company were operating the mine between 1920 and 1925 the average grade was 29 ounces a ton If we see that kind of grade again Bayhorse have 100 million ounce potential The company also owns the Brandywine property which many people e g top mining analyst Jay Currie think is even better than Bayhorse Mine itself and which can be turned into an excellent open pit silver mine Bayhorse s geologists believe that it s the next Eskay Creek The First Nations are on board with the project The real blue sky in Bayhorse however is the fact that unlike almost all other silver companies they are going to produce for themselves and keep on producing and NOT look for a buyout The CEO who personally owns 15 of the float is determined to stick by his shareholders He sees them as a family and wants to give them seven years of feast after seven years of famine a direct quote Combine this consideration both with BHS s present minuscule market cap and their impressive production potential and it becomes clear that BHS has 100 1000x potential in this silver bull market It s a completely unique company and unlike virtually any other silver stock in existence How high BHS might possibly go Bayhorse s cost to produce an ounce may be as low as only 5 But a more conservative figure is 10 Using that more conservative figure I thought that I d make a detailed account giving some clear targets as to where Bayhorse can go at different silver prices We also learn from Don Durrett that that it is common for miners to trade at a 30x cash flow valuation in miner bull markets I have found that this can be the case even for one mine producers If I am not mistaken Starcore International Mines a one mine producer in Mexico which is similar to Bayhorse did actually trade at a 30x cash flow valuation in the 01 to 11 miner bull market Bearing in mind everything that I have said to what price might Bayhorse attain for somebody who buys it now for a minuscule 30 million market cap It is generally agreed that Bayhorse can produce 1 3 million silver ounces per annum At an AISC of 10 this means that BHS could conceivably go 50x to 10 at 50 silver In other words a 1000 investment would become 50 000 1 3 million x 50 silver 10 AISC x 40 52 million cash flow at a 30x cash flow valuation about a 1 6 billion market cap 10 BHS Extrapolating from here is easy At 100 silver BHS can go 100x 20 At 200 silver BHS can go 200x 40 At 400 silver BHS can go 400x 80 At 800 silver BHS can go 800x 160 This last figure means that a 1000 investment would turn into 800 000 Most people would be happy with making the 50x at 50 silver But believe me 800 silver is not impossible In fact according to ShadowStats 966 was actually the true inflation adjusted ATH for silver in 1980 That s when the Dow Gold ratio went to 1 1 and the Gold Silver ratio went to 1 14 Calculate a 1 1 DGR and a 1 14 GSR again and you get a similar number for silver today And a 1 14 GSR is simply the normal historical GSR All that the Hunt Brothers did was to expose what the price of silver is when the derivatives market collapses they cornered nothing I highly recommend this interesting article from 1980 called Hunt for Silver https s3 amazonaws com camppictures CampArchive Economy Hunt 20For 20Silver pdf to learn more about the Hunts The Hunts themselves had a 1 5 GSR as a fair target The average historical wage in silver is only 1 10th of an ounce The gold silver mining ratio is 1 8 silver is critical for modern life and high grade deposits and stockpiles are utterly depleted because of the criminal manipulation by the banks so who really knows what is possible At any rate these are my targets 50x on Bayhorse at 50 silver and even 1000x is clearly possible also should the silver derivatives market break which I believe is inevitable It is rare that you can can demonstrate these kinds of gains in a silver stock As Don Durrett says https youtu be m qYvxpsQ8E t 909 only 18 companies in the world which call themselves silver companies even produce more than 1 million ounces a year Even Impact Silver doesn t produce that many and its market cap is 4x higher than that of Bayhorse If you are willing to accept the usual Black Swan risks associated with a one mine producer Bayhorse Silver is quite literally and demonstrably the greatest risk reward opportunity on earth

to uplist to Nasdaq A transmission from the Burryologists , My last and first post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nkrbt7 gme is a rocket launch site 190 5star set up turned out pretty good Let s see how this one turns out It ll require some background but it s worth it In my last post on May 25 at 10 40am ET GME was 185 and I wrote gt I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch The key level to break out of the wedge is 190 which we re pretty much exactly at now Above 190 the path looks open to 300 2 weeks later GME hit 345 The fact that my last call was right doesn t mean I ll be right with this call but I hope it earns me your attention Do your own DD This is my 2 cents not advice Here we go gt Summary full DD below Over the last week a handful of geniuses in the Burryologists subreddit cracked a code from a Michael Burry tweet that hypes a cannabis penny stock called Kush Co KSHB that s about to uplist to Nasdaq via merger with Greenlane GNLE gt gt Right now KSHB trades at 1x sales 1x book which is as low as you ll see for a company that s EBITDA positive not in debt has good mgmt and tracking a rapidly growing industry like US cannabis Greenlane the company its about to merge with is similarly cheap Basically this is an epic Deep Value play combined with a near term Nasdaq catalyst gt gt Most US cannabis companies like Curaleaf Green Thumb etc are plant touching so they have to trade on a small Canadian exchange called the CSE and have almost 0 institutional investment KSHB and GNLE aren t plant touching so post merger the combined entity will be added to Nasdaq Ancillary cannabis stocks like Kushco Greenlane GrowGen and Scotts Miracle Gro are the picks and shovels of the industry they re a bet on the space instead of a horse in the race gt gt Hedge funds can t buy KSHB yet but will be able to once it uplists to Nasdaq The agreement says the merger will happen in late Q2 or early Q3 which means any day now There s a shareholder vote this Thursday which is expected to approve of it so maybe it ll happen soon after that gt gt For years KSHB hasn t had access to serious capital since it hasn t been large enough to list on a major exchange then in late 2019 we had the vape crisis which ultimately was caused by unrelated black market vapes but still took a toll Now KSHB is outta debt and EBITDA positive and about to join a major exchange where hedge funds will be allowed to buy it It ll also be over 2x as large 170m today 360m after the deal which ll also mean more hedge funds will be able to buy it gt gt Valuation for its most comparable peers GrowGen and Scotts Miracle Grow are 5 6 times higher than Kushco s amp Greenlane s Since GrowGen joined Nasdaq in December 2019 it s up 10x With the scale and access to capital this merger will bring I think Kushco should be about to re rate Props to u Bernardsman and the other geniuses in the subreddit

touching US cannabis stocks since compliance departments think it could be considered money laundering as long as pot s Schedule 1 federally After Dems won the US Senate Georgia runoffs in January hedgies started jumping in which sent the whole US cannabis industry higher Then in February the whole industry sold off for no known reason turns out this was because of mass de risking through the hedge fund space following the collapse of Archegos Capital https www morningstar ca ca news 212284 cannabis investors see over 100 returns aspx The story of Archegos is that this guy Bill Hwang took on 100x leverage with multiple major banks causing 6 of them to lose over 10 billion and nearly blowing up the financial system After that many banks pulled back on their prime allowances to hedge funds and mutual funds forcing them to sell plant touching US cannabis stocks https www barrons com articles after building cannabis stake a mutual fund sells for compliance reasons 51620783073 The Safe Banking Act will change that but who knows when we get that maybe this fall maybe next year gt gt So now we have a situation where hedge funds want to get into US cannabis but can t and since Kushco has partnerships with a lot of the big players in US cannabis KSHB is about to give them another way to access the industry legally similar to GrowGen and Scotts Miracle Gro which both trade at expensive multiples gt gt Now to Kushco KSHB specifically So Burry is obviously talking about US cannabis but what stock trades at 1x price to sales Here s a list of the cheapest US cannabis stocks

0 en KushCo Holdings Adds Famed Investor Danny Moses and CNBC s Tim Seymour to Advisory Board html So Michael Burry is talking about KSHB and it s super cheap So what Why won t it just stay cheap Because KSHB is about to join the Nasdaq any day now via a merger with a similar ancillary company called Greenlane which is also near the top of the list of the cheapest US cannabis stocks How can KSHB join the Nasdaq before the Safe Banking Act Because Kushco is an ancillary cannabis company meaning it supports the US cannabis industry with vapes packaging other supplies but doesn t touch the plant After merging with Greenlane it ll be large enough for Nasdaq After getting capital starved on OTC pink sheets for years KSHB is about to merge with Greenlane and uplist to Nasdaq When it does hedge funds will have a new way to access the growing US cannabis market Seems to me a near term multi bagger is possible if not likely The two most similar ancillary cannabis companies on US exchanges are GrowGen and Scotts Miracle Grow which trade at about 5 6x the valuation of KSHB GNLN With the scale this merger will give these companies I think 4x sales is easily in reach https

slightly favors KSHB over GNLN If the deal were to happen right now KSHB shareholders would get a slightly better deal 4 4 From the agreement KSHB shareholders will get 0 2546 shares of GNLN for each KSHB share they hold Math Merger spread 4 38 0 2546 1 11 1 0464 FYI KSHB is buyable pre merger on brokers like Fidelity Schwab Etrade etc On Robinhood and Webull only GNLE is available pre merger

facilities and deal in natural gas natural gas liquids crude oil and refined oil products Their large footprint made larger by the recent 7 2 billion all equity purchase of ENBL allows them to leverage their size you know like your wife s boyfriend to operate more efficiently and they ve been spending the last 25 years reinvesting those profits to continue building out their infrastructure They own Lake Charles LNG and also hold stakes in Sunoco LP SUN and USA Compression Partners USAC In addition they hold patents related to dual drive natural gas compression technology and have international offices in Beijing and Canada Their CEO and co founder is Kelsy Warren a dude who s been in the oil and gas industry his entire career leading various companies He was ranked 299 on the Forbes 400 list in 2020 so he s clearly successful at what he does Side note Warren has a collection of music memorabilia that includes an autograph of Jackson Browne and drumsticks signed by The Eagles so depending on where you stand in relation to those bands he s either a complete poser or definitely fuks Either way the guy knows how to profit in his line of work and for our purposes that s

and 18th it bounced back a bit and spent most of last week consolidating amp x200B It s currently sitting at the bottom of its channel using Bollinger Bands as a guide as seen below If it continues

overlay we see that the stock price may indeed continue to pull back a bit but I expect the 10 50 support to hold indicating a continuation of the uptrend We re looking for the blue line to cross back

any company in the oil and gas sector ET is susceptible to more stringent government regulations and or taxes on the industry This could impact their bottom line as well as curtail future expansion ET still holds a significant amount of debt and while it has largely accrued these liabilities in order to build out their infrastructure and acquire smaller companies its debt has risen at a greater rate than many of their peers This could hamper ET s growth in the future if the industry hits a particularly rough patch There is always the prospect of international turmoil causing a disruption to their business Last year when Russia and Saudi Arabia were at odds regarding oil production prices collapsed and threw a major wrench into the works of US producers The delta variant of the coronavirus could send countries back into lockdown stifling demand for oil and natural gas Critics have expressed concern that ET outlays too much money for capital expenditures It s boomer as fuck

broad thesis here is that this is simply a solid company that is continuing to grow They have a proven track record and continue to execute at an extremely high level much like Texas with prisoners Basically almost every analyst sees ET as being currently undervalued with plenty of wind in their sails They have strong buy recommendations across the board without a single analyst in the multiple sources I consulted recommending to sell This is despite being up just over 72 in the past six months After hitting 11 35 on June 16th the stock pulled back slightly and has started to consolidate Monday of this week reinforced my theory that there was still a small amount of selling that would occur but that the stock would find support around 10 50 It did exactly that fell in the morning to around 10 50 and then traded flat most of the day closing at 10 37 I think this represents a good entry point and will be looking to add to my position in the coming week especially if it dips further With the acquisition of ENBL natural gas prices at highs not seen since late 2018 overall bullish outlook for the sector and the strong prospect of a massive infrastructure bill set to pass I expect ET to continue to outperform analyst estimates and deliver strong quarterly results for the remainder of the year and into 2023 amp x200B How to play it Options are dirt cheap and weeklies are available July 16th 11 50 calls are currently between 04 05 A little further OTM at the 13 strike they re between 01 02 August 20th 11 calls are between 36 38 Further OTM at 13 they re 09 10 Even ITM calls are crazy inexpensive August 20th 10 calls are 76 83 Shares as always are the safer bet ET isn t going anywhere and the stock price looks like it s coiling for a breakout I m not a financial analyst and this is not financial advice on how to invest your money Do your own research and DD and please feel free to poke holes in my thesis and tell me where you think I ve missed the mark Positions 100 shares x30 July 16th 12c x50 July 16th 13 50c that I ll probably roll to August x40 August 20th 14c amp x200B Happy hunting

uplist to Nasdaq A transmission from the Burryologists , My last and first post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nkrbt7 gme is a rocket launch site 190 5star set up turned out pretty good Let s see how this one turns out It ll require some background but it s worth it In my last post on May 25 at 10 40am ET GME was 185 and I wrote gt I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch The key level to break out of the wedge is 190 which we re pretty much exactly at now Above 190 the path looks open to 300 2 weeks later GME hit 345 The fact that my last call was right doesn t mean I ll be right with this call but I hope it earns me your attention Do your own DD This is my 2 cents not advice Here s a summary Full DD below gt Over the last week a handful of geniuses in the Burryologists subreddit cracked a code from a Michael Burry tweet that hypes a cannabis stock called Kush Co that s about to uplist to Nasdaq via merger with Greenlane gt gt Right now Kushco trades at 1x sales 1x book which is as low as you ll see for a company that s EBITDA positive not in debt has good mgmt and tracking a rapidly growing industry like US cannabis Greenlane the company its about to merge with is similarly cheap Basically this is an epic Deep Value play combined with a near term Nasdaq catalyst gt gt Most US cannabis companies like Curaleaf Green Thumb etc are plant touching so they have to trade on a small Canadian exchange called the CSE and have almost 0 institutional investment Kushco and Greenlane aren t plant touching so post merger the combined entity will be added to Nasdaq Ancillary cannabis stocks like Kushco Greenlane GrowGen and Scotts Miracle Gro are the picks and shovels of the industry they re a bet on the space instead of a horse in the race gt gt Hedge funds can t buy Kushco yet but will be able to once it uplists to Nasdaq The agreement says the merger will happen in late Q2 or early Q3 which means any day now There s a shareholder vote this Thursday which is expected to approve of it so maybe it ll happen soon after that gt gt For years Kushco hasn t had access to serious capital since it hasn t been large enough to list on a major exchange then in late 2019 we had the vape crisis which ultimately was caused by unrelated black market vapes but still took a toll Now Kushco is outta debt and EBITDA positive and about to join a major exchange where hedge funds will be allowed to buy it It ll also be over 2x as large 170m today 360m after the deal which ll also mean more hedge funds will be able to buy it gt gt Valuation for its most comparable peers GrowGen and Scotts Miracle Grow are 5 6 times higher than Kushco s amp Greenlane s Since GrowGen joined Nasdaq in December 2019 it s up 10x With the scale and access to capital this merger will bring I think Kushco should be about to re rate Props to u Bernardsman and the other geniuses in the subreddit

makes it clear IF you understand US cannabis Background on US cannabis gt 99 of hedge funds amp mutual funds still aren t able to invest in plant touching US cannabis stocks since compliance departments think it could be considered money laundering as long as pot s Schedule 1 federally After Dems won the US Senate Georgia runoffs in January hedgies started jumping in which sent the whole US cannabis industry higher Then in February the whole industry sold off for no known reason turns out this was because of mass de risking through the hedge fund space following the collapse of Archegos Capital https www morningstar ca ca news 212284 cannabis investors see over 100 returns aspx The story of Archegos is that this guy Bill Hwang took on 100x leverage with multiple major banks causing 6 of them to lose over 10 billion and nearly blowing up the financial system After that many banks pulled back on their prime allowances to hedge funds and mutual funds forcing them to sell plant touching US cannabis stocks https www barrons com articles after building cannabis stake a mutual fund sells for compliance reasons 51620783073 The Safe Banking Act will change that but who knows when we get that maybe this fall maybe next year gt gt So now we have a situation where hedge funds want to get into US cannabis but can t and since Kushco has partnerships with a lot of the big players in US cannabis Kushco is about to give them another way to access the industry legally similar to GrowGen and Scotts Miracle Gro which both trade at expensive multiples gt gt Now to Kushco

merger with a similar ancillary company called Greenlane which is also near the top of the list of the cheapest US cannabis stocks How can Kushco join the Nasdaq before the Safe Banking Act Because Kushco is an ancillary cannabis company meaning it supports the US cannabis industry with vapes packaging other supplies but doesn t touch the plant After merging with Greenlane it ll be large enough for Nasdaq After getting capital starved on OTC pink sheets for years Kushco is about to merge with Greenlane and uplist to Nasdaq When it does hedge funds will have a new way to access the growing US cannabis market Seems to me a near term multi bagger is possible if not likely The two most similar ancillary cannabis companies on US exchanges are GrowGen and Scotts Miracle Grow which trade at

shareholder vote on it this Thursday which is expected to pass so in all likelihood it ll be very soon Merger arbitrage The merger spread slightly favors Kushco shareholders over Greenlane If the deal

DR Trucking will be the first viable business for autonomous vehicles TuSimple TSP currently has the best autonomous truck tech and is the closest to commercialization Recent News TuSimple Stock The Driverless Truck Stock That Counts NVIDIA and Cathie Wood as Investors https finance yahoo com m 979f72e4 7022 3f0e a9a5 e20306d3e48e tusimple stock the html TSP Stock Blasts Off After TuSimple Sends Self Driving Truck Across the U S https investorplace com hypergrowthinvesting 2021 06 tsp stock up after tusimple sends self driving truck across the us Why not Robotaxis Robotaxis are sexier and thus get all the media attention But commercialization of robotaxis currently poses several technical operational and business challenges Why not Robotaxis Technical Robotaxis are most profitable in downtown environments But those environments also pose the greatest challenges for an autonomous vehicle due to the large number of hard to predict agents No company has been able to solve those yet Pick up and drop offs are also technically very challenging because frankly most Uber Lyft pick up and drop offs in downtown environments are in illegal locations Human drivers can get away with that But a computer system cannot be programmed to perform illegal actions without the company being held responsible Why not Robotaxis Operational With Uber or Lyft the drivers do much more than just drive They purchase store clean fuel charge and maintain their vehicles With robotaxis all of this operational load falls to the robotaxi company Where are they going to store thousands of vehicles in downtown environments How are they going to charge them and perform all of the other operational tasks Even if this problem could be solved it means that robotaxis will scale much more slowly than Uber or Lyft did Why not Robotaxis Business The cost of robotaxis is currently extremely high due to the compute and sensor requirements Even if they perform perfectly it will take a long time before they are more profitable than vehicles with human drivers Further recent regulation in the US has shown that the public support is behind the drivers not the silicon valley companies Driving for Uber and Lyft has been a lifeline to people who lost their jobs during the pandemic So robotaxis are going to be viewed with hostility and likely backlash from the public and thus from governments Why Trucking Why Trucking Technical Highway driving though higher speed is much more structured than downtown environments In most ways it is easier as evidenced by current level 2 driver assistance systems that easily handle most highway driving It does however require much longer range perception We will return to that below Why Trucking Operational Trucks already have all of the operational infrastructure They are stored at depots They have dedicated staff for their cleaning maintenance fueling etc Making trucks autonomous can leverage all of this infrastructure Why Trucking Business There is currently a shortage of truck drivers Freight shippers want to ship faster and not need to wait for drivers to sleep Truck driving is not a fun or healthy job It keeps people away from their families And trucking is a 4T industry globally 1T in the US Given the long lifespan of trucks and their ability to run for millions of miles the cost of the autonomous compute and sensor system can be amortized much better than for robotaxis In short the stars are all aligned for autonomous trucks today Why TuSimple The players who started with robotaxis have built their entire tech stack around detailed but short range perception Trying to convert that tech stack to trucking poses more challenges than one might expect But since TuSimple has focused on trucking from the beginning 2015 they have built their stack to have 1000 meter perception more than 4x other companies TuSimple also has been building up partnerships with the rest of the international freight ecosystem since the beginning They have key partnerships with OEMs Tier 1s shipping companies and part manufacturers in the US Europe and Asia None of the other autonomous companies have that TuSimple is building their Autonomous Freight Network across the US in multiple phases Initially only corridors with favorable weather will be autonomous But as the technology improves to be able to handle heavy rain and snow

few weeks ago I began posting on AMD At the time the stock was trading in the mid 70 s Today as expected we crossed 90 but our trip is just getting STARTED The deal with TESLA was announced as well as the next AMAZING technologies in Computex including the stacked cache for Zen3 Fidelity FX Super Resolution the 6900 XTX Liquid Cooled etc There s a very simple reason why AMD will go past the MOON and MARS ENTERTAINMENT The world revolves around entertainment and in this new era this activity is mandatory to deal with Covid 19 the lack of international travel work from home etc TESLA adopting AMD for its new Model X and S is HUGE It will take a Navi23 and an APU two chips per car likely becoming an optional for all other vehicles in the future More automobile brands will follow as TESLA is leading the way in the industry amp x200B AMD is bringing chips for TESLA https preview redd it c3gl2sugl8871 jpg width 2243 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 01eb82ce10395b51276ace652df43f92e725c989 With autonomous driving gaming in a long trip will be mandatory But even without it the rest of the passengers can game either with their fellow companions or online from their car So yes the current automotive revolution will have AMD as a main supplier Then you have consumer processing which includes CPU s and GPU s where AMD is dominating mostly on the former The Zen3 architecture is a MONSTER Intel just cannot compete And with the stacked cache providing up to 15 more gaming performance that lead will continue on AMD s side On GPU s AMD s Navi31 is expected to be MCM multi chip module aiming to repeat AMD s success with Intel but now against NVIDIA Chiplets allow for economies of scale to thrive More silicon will less defects better binning cheaper it is an AMAZING IDEA Just add cache and the latency problem can be mitigated On the console gaming AMD is the undisputed KING They re in the PS4 PS4 Pro PS5 Xbox model and series X S Also in the Aya Neo and expected in Valve s next handheld which will be a MONSTER On Datacenter AMD is groundbreaking Epyc and the new offerings from GOOGLE for virtual machines is an INCREDIBLE deal AMAZON TENCENT ALIBABA AZURE Microsoft they are all buying chips from AMD More CORES means MORE power processing lower energy lower licensing costs and certainly better SECURITY as INTEL has been plagued by Spectre amp Meltdown issues AMD is now expected to go from 64 cores in EPYC to 96 and also 128 That s just ludicrous 128 CORES and 256 threads And X86 clients are THRILLED to buy more power in a more efficient chip amp x200B Google Cloud selecting AMD Milan Server Chips https preview redd it rk2caql3n8871 jpg width 2284 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 11e5e511ffe4a80275ae117eeb314217c2f0274a Deals with the US Department of Energy El Capitan Singapore and Germany all for public datacenters worth millions of dollars That s just the tip of the iceberg as private players are taking note of EPYC Last but certainly NOT least MOBILE AMD will power Samsung s S22 flagship phone It s GPU is expected to break records as engineering samples already have it beating MALI and Apple s options by double digits Samsung is delighted and Google also wants AMD chips for its phones amp x200B Samsung bringing AMD s 5nm RNDA2 technology on the Flagship GALAXY S22 https preview redd it 23dqr9a9m8871

How many companies are growing by 50 And that guidance was provided with the Q1 results in April which were exceeding expectations The raised the guidance from 37 to 50 and will certainly BEAT IT AMD is NOW a profitable company and it literally CANNOT keep its products on shelves as its clients are buying ALL THEIR CHIPS AMD s valuation is 110 billion while NVIDIA w slightly more revenue amp profit is 500 billion How is NVIDIA 5 times the value of AMD Just because of a stock split It is currently trading at 38 times earnings which if they grow by 50 in 6 months will certainly drop So yeah the stock is currently above 90 and aiming to reach its all time high of 99 which was reached a few months ago in January Analyst consensus of the stock is currently 106 54 https www tipranks com stocks amd forecast https www tipranks com stocks amd forecast which slightly better than an 18 upside which would take it to a mere 132 billion market cap If you ask me AMD should be at least HALF of NVIDIA s 500 billion market cap Lastly the Xilinx acquisition which will aim to create synergies among functions e g HR Procurement Engineering etc It will also increase AMD s share of the silicon purchasing world as TSMC will have AMD as its 2 client only second to Apple Xilinx cancelled its dividends as its shareholders approved the merger with AMD AMD may choose to bring dividends back after the merger yet in the meantime they announced a 4 Billion share buyback program They know their stock is trading CHEAP So yeah sorry to say it but I told you so On the positions question full disclosure YES I hold AMD stock I bought 25K back in 2013 when the stock was at 2 46 on January 18th 2013 a bit over 10150 stocks I saw the stock go up to 20 and sold half of it in 2018 Later I bought back a bit crazy ape mentality Today I stand with 7500 stocks Certainly worth a couple of Lambo s yet I drive a Nissan If you ask me my next car should be a TESLA with AMD chips yet I m not selling AMD WE ALREADY PASSED THE MOON we will pass MARS Tesla and also our Galaxy Samsung Join me together we will conquer the Universe Pack your bananas we re in for a journey

ago I began posting on AMD At the time the stock was trading in the mid 70 s Today as expected we crossed 90 price but our trip is just getting STARTED The deal with TESLA was announced as well as the next AMAZING technologies in Computex including the stacked cache for Zen3 Fidelity FX Super Resolution the 6900 XTX Liquid Cooled etc There s a very simple reason why AMD will go past the MOON and MARS ENTERTAINMENT The world revolves around entertainment and in this new era this activity is mandatory to deal with Covid 19 the lack of international travel work from home etc TESLA adopting AMD for its new Model X and S is HUGE It will take a Navi23 and an APU two chips per car likely becoming an optional for all other vehicles in the future More automobile brands will follow as TESLA is leading the way in the industry amp x200B TESLA selected AMD chips for its upcoming vehicles https preview redd it aekg7gm3u8871 jpg width 2243 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s c178f47df42b4159f92d1248ac9618a3f8440643 With autonomous driving gaming in a long trip will be mandatory But even without it the rest of the passengers can game either with their fellow companions or online from their car So yes the current automotive revolution will have AMD as a main supplier Then you have consumer processing which includes CPU s and GPU s where AMD is dominating mostly on the former The Zen3 architecture is a MONSTER Intel just cannot compete And with the stacked cache providing up to 15 more gaming performance that lead will continue on AMD s side On GPU s AMD s Navi31 is expected to be MCM multi chip module aiming to repeat AMD s success with Intel but now against NVIDIA Chiplets allow for economies of scale to thrive More silicon will less defects better binning cheaper it is an AMAZING IDEA Just add cache and the latency problem can be mitigated On the console gaming AMD is the undisputed KING They re in the PS4 PS4 Pro PS5 Xbox model and series X S Also in the Aya Neo and expected in Valve s next handheld which will be a MONSTER On Datacenter AMD is groundbreaking Epyc and the new offerings from GOOGLE for virtual machines is an INCREDIBLE deal AMAZON TENCENT ALIBABA AZURE Microsoft they are all buying chips from AMD More CORES means MORE power processing lower energy lower licensing costs and certainly better SECURITY as INTEL has been plagued by Spectre amp Meltdown issues AMD is now expected to go from 64 cores in EPYC to 96 and also 128 That s just ludicrous 128 CORES and 256 threads And X86 clients are THRILLED to buy more power in a more

are growing by 50 And that guidance was provided with the Q1 results in April which were exceeding expectations The raised the guidance from 37 to 50 and will certainly BEAT IT AMD is NOW a profitable company and it literally CANNOT keep its products on shelves as its clients are buying ALL THEIR CHIPS AMD s valuation is 110 billion while NVIDIA w slightly more revenue amp profit is 500 billion How is NVIDIA 5 times the value of AMD Just because of a stock split It is currently trading at 38 times earnings which if they grow by 50 in 6 months will certainly drop So yeah the stock is currently above 90 and aiming to reach its all time high of 99 which was reached a few months ago in January Analyst consensus of the stock is currently 106 54 https www tipranks com stocks amd forecast https www tipranks com stocks amd forecast which slightly better than an 18 upside which would take it to a mere 132 billion market cap If you ask me AMD should be at least HALF of NVIDIA s 500 billion market cap Lastly the Xilinx acquisition which will aim to create synergies among functions e g HR Procurement Engineering etc It will also increase AMD s share of the silicon purchasing world as TSMC will have AMD as its 2 client only second to Apple Xilinx cancelled its dividends as its shareholders approved the merger with AMD AMD may choose to bring dividends back after the merger yet in the meantime they announced a 4 Billion share buyback program They know their stock is trading CHEAP On the positions full disclosure YES I hold AMD stock I bought 25K back in 2013 when the stock was at 2 46 on January 18th 2013 a bit over 10150 stocks I saw the stock go up to 20 and sold half of it in 2018 Later I bought back a bit crazy ape mentality Today I stand with 7500 stocks Certainly worth a couple of Lambo s yet I drive a Nissan If you ask me my next car should be a TESLA with AMD chips yet I m not selling AMD WE ALREADY PASSED THE MOON we will pass MARS Tesla and also our Galaxy Samsung

7 22 27 PT 40 mid term PT from JPM easy 2x , amp x200B Want to know why you re nervous anxious and emotionally turbulent when you make that Meme stock YOLO Maybe it s because virtually none of the companies being spammed on this sub over the last month make any fucking money Go for it look up their last earnings report and look at how much money they shat down the drain That s why they have short interest in excess of 20 Trading them is a fucking shot in the dark sure it might go up based off retail buy pressure gamma ramp or a short getting margin called elsewhere in their account but if it does YOU GOT LUCKY amp x200B So why CLF Somehow CLF has a short interest of 20 yet FUCKING PRINTS MONEY no idea what the shorts are thinking here but they are about to get rekt this month amp x200B THE BULL THESIS CLF has a great macro outlook Steel prices have tripled in the past year with industry overheads remaining largely stable save for the price of Iron Ore which has also ran up significantly Fortunately CLF produces their own Iron Ore so they are literally shitting out money as they reap the benefits of vertical integration Steel prices https tradingeconomics com commodity steel are the highest they ve ever been nearly every single steel company is going to report their greatest quarter in history this summer But most importantly STEEL PRICES ARE GOING TO STAY HIGH Why Chinese steel accounts for 15 20 of the global export market and they ve all but stopped exporting they eliminated Tax rebate incentives for steel producers last month in a bid to keep supply grounded domestically for their own affordable infrastructure stimulus and carbon emissions goals and have been floating rumors of an export tax the past two weeks 15 of the worlds export tonnage drying up is HUGE the leftover demand will NEED to come from somewhere Additionally the 2022 Beijing olympics are around the corner and who remembers what china did in an effort to combat smog prior to the 2008 games They shuttered steel production in Beijing Hebei one of the largest steel producing provinces Less Chinese steel higher ex China prices Nations using infrastructure as stimulus post covid Bidens infrastructure bill is coming down the pipe China issued a 500 Billion package as well and they re being floated in parliaments across South America Asia and Europe as we speak Industry consolidation Competition and supply gluts are what eventually kill commodity runs but the US and European steel industries have consolidated into significantly fewer hands since the last steel bull run The current CLF is the product of the 2020 acquisitions of AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA taking two independent drivers off the table In addition to the boatload of macroeconomic tailwinds the steel industry writ large is experiencing there are also CLF specific advantages GOES CLF is the sole American producer of Grain Oriented Electric Steel GOES which is necessary for transformers generators and other grid elements necessary for the transition to renewables Vertically Integrated Discussed earlier CLF is equal parts Iron Ore Miner and Steel producer High short interest on the order of 20 I truly do not understand the shorts thesis AT ALL Yes CLF is leveraged due to recent acquisitions but they are printing money Literally printing it For perspective CLF is an 11 Billion company that is projected to do 4 Billion in EBITDA this year AMC is a 25 Billion company that did 0 77 Billion EBITDA in 2019 PRE Pandemic CLF s fair valuation relative to CURRENT industry peers based on forward EBITDA book value and managements forecasts on debt pay down would put CLF squarely in 30 40 share range That s not even counting continued sector growth over the coming year that s just fair value right now Fair value returns at 50 100 even BEFORE meme squeeze returns is a hell of a lot safer of a bet than UWMC BB AMC GME CLNE CLOV or whatever the hell else ill advised prayer play I ve seen here the past week amp x200B CLF Technicals we are currently sitting at the bottom of a 4 month long channel See Chart https www tradingview com x HAOPoPRh CLF is primed for an earnings run up towards the top of this channel from 21 to about 27 over the next month 20 50 100 200 EMA s look bullish AF MACD will crossover in the next day or 2 RSI is sitting at hovering around 50 exactly the same level as the 3 20 moonshot days we ve had over the last 4 months u kbbqking rates this as a strong BUY rating with the stock sitting at the bottom of this robust channel This is an asymmetrical trade limited downside with a stop loss below the channel and biiiiig upside Especially with call options JPM https www marketbeat com stocks NYSE CLF price target agrees with this BUY rating with a price target of 40 amp x200B TLDR CLF is pretty much the only WSB short interest play with limited fundamental downside they re shitting money and have enough macroeconomic tailwinds to entertain a supply chain logistics class for a semester amp x200B Positions or Ban CLF 7 21 21 25c 150 contracts for earnings run up CLF 10 21 21 30c 100 contracts CLF 1 21 22 40c 300 contracts If we stay down at the bottom of this

anymore,Again disclaimer for the 9 million idiots who joined WSB since the new year this is not a sq ze play and if you re looking for one you can head somewhere else What is Autohome Autohome is a Chinese holding company founded in the late 2000s that provides online platforms for dealers and people selling used cars Their websites are a medium for car sales used or new They also profit off of advertising financial services for these sales and offer data analytical tools for sales and marketing solutions to their automaker and dealer customers Their data products consist of automaker data products such as Intelligent R amp D Intelligent New Car Launch Intelligent Marketing and Intelligent Activities and end to end SaaS based services to dealers such as Intelligent Showroom Smart DCC direct call center Smart Call Out Smart Assistant Smart Sales and Smart Aftersales Their market cap sits just shy of 10 billion although I ll get more into their fundamentals in just a moment What s the case Well first off to give some context to the numbers I m about to throw out here s a quick look at Autohome s 1 year chart https imgur com 8JVneS7 and 5 year chart https imgur com 70tx8Ck Autohome recently released their first quarter results with some fairly significant highlights Net Revenues increasing to 281 1 million a 19 1 increase YoY Online marketplace and other revenues at 82 3 million a 74 increase YoY Their Data Products a large part of why their R amp D has increased heavily and caused present returns to be discounted in favor of future growth increased 64 9 YoY Their adjusted net income increased to 112 2 million a 13 amp increase YoY These numbers may not seem explosive but their growth in the industry is incredibly consistent Again they ve upped their R amp D costs for the sake of expanding a few things their Data Products their expansion into NEV or New Energy Vehicles a term used by the Chinese government for plug in electric vehicles and their continued development of their apps websites which Chairman of the board Quan Long fantastic name by the way discusses as important parts of the digital transformation taking place in the automotive industry Their product development is about to be upwards of 50 million per quarter as they continue to roll out initiatives such as AI Big data and Cloud capability and SaaS strategies Now you might ask why the stock is down so much in the context of the highs seen over the past 5 years and for the love of god I hate to say it but part of that was due to the spike you can see over January February Why you might ask Because people picked up that Autohome had a larger than average short position every news site began releasing lists of companies prime to be the next Gamestop and the stock jumped This happened to coincide with earnings and when earnings came out and people realized Autohome wasn t selling the Nintendo switch and Pokemon plushies to greasy middle aged white men the stock fell right back down to the previous range of hovering around 100 dollars per share This downward momentum put a nice stain on earnings and when Autohome released earnings recently in May missing consensus EPS by 1 cent along with Chinese car sales dropping to 2019 levels due to Covid and the steel and chip shortage the stock continued to fall down to where we see it today with a consensus price target of 96 05 Why I believe this is no longer a falling knife 2 year chart with moving averages https imgur com R6FczJ4 As we can see on the 2 year chart there s fairly substantial support around 60 65 dollars where the stock has bounced off of multiple times in the past few years Even after continually falling for months the current value of 65 69 sits well below the 50 100 200 day moving averages a pattern that has repeatedly indicated reversals in the past MACD 2 year chart https imgur com 2XHsxlP On our next image we can see that the MACD Moving Average Convergence Divergence has just crossed over the EMA exponential moving average with a divergence of 63 While this alone does not indicate a guaranteed reversal paired with other indicators such as the substantial divergence between the current stock price and the 50 100 200 moving averages above the MACD can be a great indicator of reversals RSI 2 year chart https imgur com LVbEhV2 As you can see here the RSI recently slumped all the way down to a 16 twice well below the consensus sub 30 RSI needed to classify a stock as oversold This week we ve begun to see it slowly pull upwards currently still sitting at just 34 An RSI this low in a market with sky high evaluations like we ve been seeing out of nearly every other company is a rare thing with very few stocks creeping under 30 recently Bear Case No DD is ever complete without a bit of realism so here are some potential downsides 1 The stock could simply keep falling Nobody ever said the market was fully rational and if Autohome slipped beneath the support at 60 65 we could see another drop in the near future 2 Automotive sales and the steel chip shortage could continue to impact automobile sales especially NEVs I don t think this is particularly likely as we ve seen many governments and companies launch into action over the past 6 months to combat these shortages and I think they ll get better rather than worse in the near future but it s always good to stay on top of things 3 Returns on capital have decreased from 21 to 14 over the past 5 years I believe this is primarily due to the emphasis Autohome has placed on R amp D in the digital transformation that Quan Long spoke about and will indicate higher potential future growth but it s still worth taking into account Positions or fuck off 20 shares yes my portfolio isn t that big I m getting there don t worry Options I currently do not own any options though I plan on purchasing them this week I d prefer not to say which options I ll be purchasing on this DD though I ll most likely buy ones with September expiration due to the high bid ask spread low volume open interest and low number of options available leaving these options fairly open for a potential P amp D something I m not interested in

com Inc OSTK has two separate business sectors that are of interest to investors Firstly and foremost it is an online retailer of home decor items and furniture such as rugs couches beds blankets curtains and etc as well as a jewelry dealer It operates in a similar fashion to Amazon with suppliers able to sell their home decor products and jewelry directly on the Overstock site while taking advantage of the Overstock shipping network Advertising services are also optionally provided by Overstock to its partners within the site To the extent that it operates in this industry it is a consumer discretionary stock in the internet retail and direct marketing business Its most similar competitor seems to be Wayfair W another online furniture retailer Overview Blockchain Subsidiaries tZero However Overstock also has a private subsidiary Medici Ventures which is in quite a different business Medici focuses on the application of blockchain technologies NOT the supposed currencies derived therefrom but the technology itself to the world of finance and the subsidiary in turn owns several different companies 19 by my count each of which deals with a different financial application of blockchain Chief among these is tZero which aims to create an online exchange of tokenized securities i e stocks options futures bonds etc represented in the form of blockchain tokens that are legally classified as securities to facilitate instant settlement of trades rather than the present system of t 2 days hence tZero This instant settlement is appealing to regulators who would like to resolve inefficiencies and clerical errors of the t 2 system but also allows for e g continuous access to markets 24 7 the ability to sell private equity as tokens to the public etc Overview Other Subsidiaries One could do a DD into each blockchain subsidiary independently if they so chose I will list the remaining companies and provide a short description of the focus of each It should be noted that most of these to my understanding are insignificant in terms of performance and resources and some are something closer to ideas than actual businesses Furthermore Medici may own a varying percent of each that I do not care to dig into due to the aforementioned fact tZero and perhaps Bitt are really the most important subsidiaries and are largely owned by Overstock Bitt Central bank digital currencies CBDCs Medici Land Governance Blockchain data storage systems relating to land governance land titles etc GrainChain Various farming software including blockchain smart contracts but also non blockchain software applications such as farm logistics applications Voatz Voting system with blockchain verifiable publicly accessible paper trail PeerNova Management data services idk FinClusive Digital blockchain based banking system focused on regions underserved by banking Netki Business compliance software ID validation software biometric data storage Minds Monetized anti censorship social media outlet Vincent Blockchain based wine futures and wine sales direct from wineries Symbiont Idk seems like tZero but for institutions I might not be smart enough or it may be bullshit Factom Blockchain data storage Votem Seems to be the same as Voatz but perhaps different marketing Vital Chain Blockchain data storage focused on birth and death records Chainstone Labs Seems kind of like Symbiont if it were made on a shitty Wordpress site and did not have a marketing team Profitability amp Solvency Overstock including subsidiaries and minority interest had been operating at a net loss since 2017 up until a year ago at an average of 122 7 m per quarter previously having net income of around 10m per quarter going back several years though I don t care to trace this all the way back to its inception in 1999 As of recently in Q3 2020 net income was 16 4m rising to 56m and 88 4m in the respective following quarters This is possibly as a result of pandemic induced online retail purchases and the development of the company therefrom EPS has risen consistently since Q3 2018 from then 8 98 to now 1 96 Gross profit is up 124 YoY Despite its years of losses the current solvency of the company is alright As of this quarter Debt equity 13 4 Debt Capital 11 8 Liabilities Assets 49 8 Altman Score Non Manufacturing 6 34 Financial Comparison to Wayfair Wayfair W is the most similar entity that I can identify to Overstock selling furniture and home decor items online since 2002 though it does not have any exposure to blockchain or tech in general It is similarly well known and indeed more popular and much larger than Overstock as a place to buy home furnishing goods Here I will compare various financials of Overstock to Wayfair in the format OSTK W I will also provide a judgement of better worse for each from the point of view of Overstock for the low IQ apes Net Income 88 4m 489 1m worse Net Profit Margin 3 08 3 20 worse Shares Outstanding 41 9m 98m better I guess Basic EPS 1 96 4 99 worse Quick Ratio 1 5 1 3 better Price as of today 97 54 308 40 N A Price YTD 103 3 36 7 better P E 45 8 66 7 better EV Sales 1 3 2 2 possibly better Total Assets 893 7m 4 8b N A Total Liabilities 444 8m 6 2b N A Total Liabilities Assets 49 130 much better Net Debt EBITDA 4 2 1 3 much better already more than enough to pay off net debt It is also important to note the overall trend in income of each company Both W and OSTK underwent the same period of continued losses during approximately the same time period However W started taking losses about a year earlier on than OSTK and in larger amounts in proportion to the fact that it is a larger company with more expenses Both companies have experienced a high level of growth in gross profit YoY with OSTK at 124 and W at 101 Overall it appears that Wayfair is a much larger company and perhaps for now a better value strictly in EPS terms but otherwise Overstock is in a much better position in terms of solvency and its ability to finance itself going forward has made greater increases in revenue better P E etc that suggest it has great potential relative to Wayfair in the future Performance of Medici amp tZero The performance advancements of the blockchain companies as a whole are not to be considered at length since there are so many of them and most of them do not seem to be making much progress or if they are it is not much publicized and thus outside of the scope of my DD writing effort threshold However there is something to be said for Medici as a whole and tZero in particular As it relatives to Medici Overstock has recently converted Medici into a limited partnership with a venture capital firm Pelion Venture Partners who will act as general partner in the arrangement while Overstock provided the vast majority of the financing Aside from increasing funding to the Medici partnership the idea is that this will allow Overstock to focus more on retail while Medici is managed by Pelion which has more experience in investing in and managing the technology sector And as for tZero tZero as of very recently had been something closer to a concept It had a website where you could trade like 3 tokenized securities but of course next to nobody used it However it has since then taken some tangible steps to advancing itself perhaps as a result of the advantages of the aforementioned partnership It is launching a new app on which such trades can be made More importantly it has partnered with Wazuzu Inc which creates the sort of tokenized securities tZero has aspired to create Wazuzu has agreed to make tZero the exclusive exchange of its securities from now on thus we should see the amount of tradable securities on tZero increase soon Conclusion Overstock is a solid retail business that has grown much in both revenues and valuation as of recently yet is still undervalued relative to its competitor Along with the retail business one gets the chance of either substantial growth or continued useless exposure to the attendant blockchain enterprises Most of these will probably come to nothing or at least are worth nothing at present but some of them and tZero in particular show some promise The investors of Overstock are not fickle and it has a sort of cult following among certain people who see great potential in it
