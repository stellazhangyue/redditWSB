people are perceiving Nio and why Nio is going to the moon from my first hand experience as most of the DDs on Nio are done with second hand info online , 1 Brand loyalty and the NIO COMMUNITY if you think tesla owners are cult followers you have yet to seen Nio owners Nio spent years and tons of money building and maintaining the Nio community that I have never seen any car manufacturer has done in the world They built and are still building luxurious Nio house that both serve as dealerships on the first floor AND a place for Nio owners to hang on the second floor all over China Instead of going to starbucks library sending their kids to day cares many Nio owners go to Nio house to spend their weekend or send their kids to Nio house to meet the kids of other Nio owners When you purchase a Nio car you also join a big family There are tons of well designed Nio houses like this one in China https preview redd it jtfwd9j80ha61 png width 750 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 63191752b59e6a5661087aaf45048221e6c6922f To give you autists an example how much Nio owners love their Nio cars and their community Nio community in Shenzhen rented a fucking plane to fly to Chengdu to watch the Nio day The pilot co pilot flight attendants and all passengers aboard are all Nio owners https preview redd it hvny4zba1ha61 jpg width 473 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s

constantly checks the app for owners feedbacks The fact that they don t just delete the negative posts right away but allows them to exist or even being upvoted to the front page and William Li himself would promise improvements shows their confidence and their determination on building this user centered brand reputation The Nio APP https preview redd it pcnoj06shha61 jpg width 591 amp

not recommend their family friends to buy a Nio it really is a cult amp x200B 2 Battery swap I saw a lot of retards here shitting on the battery swap and those people are dumb af First you need to understand that not every Chinese lives in a house like most Americans do and a lot of them don t have charger installed at home or a fixed parking spot to park their cars If they do have a fixed parking spot Nio cars have fast charging and CAN be charged at home just like Tesla For those who dont have this privilege do you think they d prefer to spend 5 10 mins to get their battery swapped on the way home once a week OR find a public charging station and sit there for 2 hours waiting for their cars to get fully charged Not to mention that all Nio cars share the same battery size meaning the battery are upgradable Say all the sudden you want to do a road trip not only you don t have to worry wasting time charging your battery along the way you can also rent a bigger size battery from Nio for a short time for longer range When solid state battery tech are mature old Nio models can just buy a new battery comparing to buying a new car It s truly future proof No other EVs can do those

in the Chinese EV market China for the past two decades are gradually transforming from producing cheap shit for quick money to building quality products like Huawei Xiaomi Oppo etc are doing However there still ARE tons of people who would choose an established foreign brand over Chinese brand simply becasue of the subpar quality of Chinese products in the past and it s an uphill battle for Chinese brands to gain the trust of Chinese consumers especially the new emerging Chinese middle class with crazy buying power Tesla on the other hand have a huge fan base in China I test drove Tesla model 3 Nio ES6 Xpeng P7 and Tesla model X My objective verdict is in terms of comfort and localization Nio and Xpeng are both fantstic cars better than Tesla in many aspects and great value whereas Teslas are better driver s car with interior and build quality felt much cheaper However due to the high price of Model S and Model X and Tesla being a pioneer of EV Tesla are viewed as a top brand in China Even though Model 3 and Y both are aimed at the lower end market in China and have relativly poor build quality and way worse localization than Xpeng and Nio the Tesla badge alone is worth a lot in many Chinese consumers eyes which is why Tesla are selling so well here and has higher demand by the day Processing img xomq27pa9ha61 With the relase of Nio ES8 ES6 EC6 and now ET7 Nio s strategy here is smart imo they are trying to eat up the lunch of BMW AUDI Merc and even Porsche instead of releasing lower end cars to compete with Tesla in price Because if say there is a a Nio ET3 with similar price as Tesla Model 3 40k USD in the market rn the majority of the Chinese buyers will take the Model 3 for the Tesla badge And in my experience Nio has done a great job stealing owners of high end German cars with their great service the Nio community and their great cars Two of my neighbors who used to drive Audi Q7 and BMW 7 series swtiched to Nio ES6 and bascially became Nio salesman saleswoman lol and that speaks for the quality of Nio products While there are many retards who are using the price of Tesla Model 3 Y to trash on Nio online Nio ES8 ES6 EC6 ET7 will sell well as the demand for luxurious EV is there in China and Nio is pretty much the only option I believe eventually Nio will release a 40k USD car in a year or two but I like their strategy now My

already know this but the majority of you don t so let me give you some info on why the Chinese gov is pushing EV and how they are doing it China is huge but the natural resources per capita is low especially oil We heavily rely on the oil import from Russia and the middle East and without them the the domestic oil supply is unsustainable Electricity however is another story Not only we have much greater coal reserve the Chinese gov are pushing clean energy like crazy hydro power wind power nuclear power etc the amount of hydro power generated by Chinese dams are more than every single country s entire grid except the US and India While charging stations in the west are privately owned Chinese goverment are literally pouring money into building all the infrastructure preparing a shift from ICE cars to EV When CPC are determined to do something they will get it done Meanwhile in mega cities like Beijing and Shanghai the waitlist for owning an ICE car is literally several years while you can buy and register an EV right away with government subsidies I think CPC will roll out more and more strict policies on owning ICE cars and eventually indirectly ban them Even if 1 percent of Chinese drivers choose to buy a Nio in the future that s still a HUGE number https preview redd it j0kmy2q7eha61 png width 624 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 9c51284b5bd30f44fc3e3b179b99c3f4ad76ddb0 amp x200B Processing img pdotyiewdha61 Overall I m really bullish on not just Nio but also Xpeng Li Auto BYD CATL etc and think Nio has a very bright future if things go right With the European expansion in the foreeable future great leadership under William Li great relationship between Nio and CATL and Nio and Nvidia great products and great service the cult of Nio community and increasingly and inevitably more Chinese customers swtiching to EV Nio has all the potential be the Huawei of Chinese auto manufacturer Buy Nio Xpeng BYD CATL stocks leaps as much as you can and diamond hand them it s going to be a wild ride but you will thank me in a few years with your multi baggers amp x200B TLDR NIO to the fucking moon

gloom about GME lately speculation about poor holiday sales complaints about the short squeeze not happening shortages in supply for the new consoles and even some treading out in the open So let me clarify to you retards some ignored reasons why GME is going to the moon Let s start out with a common misconception which I have seen debunked a few times but still seems to linger It seems that a lot of you retards just look at the chart of the stock price and think that Gamestops all time high was in the low 60 ies or high 50 ies WRONG Ok technically this is true but it is not important The all time high for Gamestop stock was 63 dollars per share back in 2007 The problem is that Gamestop had a lot more shares back then The all time high for the market cap of Gamestop is 9 86 billion The current market cap is 1 15 billion That means that if Gamestop grew just to the same size it was before with RCs new vision for the company the stock would increase 8 6 times to 150 Not only is the all time high probably a lot higher than some of you thought the market for gaming has grown significantly since then and it is still growing The gaming market has increased 2 5 times in size since 2007 and keeps growing each year Gamestop is also shifting its business from just selling games to selling very high margin items like collectibles PC parts and gaming equipment and signing deals for online sales with Microsoft Additionally e commerce companies especially ones in large and growing industries are generally valued a lot higher than brick and mortar shops That means that reaching the same size as old Gamestop did might entail a greater stock price Ok so we have established that there is a lot of potential for GME stock and for some of you autists that s enough to throw your life savings into it But I can already see my future DMs filled with https emojipedia org rainbow saying that the potential doesn t matter because gAmEsToP iS tHe NeW bLoCkBuStEr and they are going to either go bankrupt or get smaller and smaller over time until they aren t relevant anymore So lets make clear what the vision for Gamestop s future is By which I mean what certified genius Ryan Cohen wants for its future Cohen s vision can be summarized as a transition from a brick and mortar shop to an e commerce giant competing with Amazon He is famously obsessed with customer service and wants to make Gamestop the 1 stop for all things gaming Imagine a slick website where you can buy everything related to gaming gaming PC parts gaming collectibles etc Add in 24 7 customer service provided by people knowledgeable about the products Gamestop will be selling As well as fast shipping with a whopping 0 delivery fee because there are thousands of Gamestops all over the US where you can pick up your order All these things were hallmarks Cohens previous company and in articles like this one https www forbes com sites joanverdon 2020 01 26 ryan cohen started a company that took on amazon and sold it for 3 billion now hes thinking about whats next sh 655bf7165579 where he talks excessively about the importance of providing those features in an e commerce environment To finish off I would like to show you just how dedicated Cohen seems to be to making Gamestop an e commerce giant The article I linked above is from January 2020 about 6 months before Cohen made his first investment into Gamestop and is titled Ryan Cohen Started A Company That Took On Amazon And Sold It For 3 Billion Now He s Thinking About What s Next In the article Cohen says that he is still looking for ways to compete with Amazon and that he thinks they have Chinks in their armor that he seems to want to expose What I found the most interesting though was the following excerpt gt right now he is trying to figure out what the next something will be for him I look at almost everything that comes to me but I say no to 99 9 of it As Warren Buffet says the difference between successful and really successful people is really successful people say no all the time That means that after more than 2 years of searching and looking at different opportunities he decided that Gamestop was the basket he wanted to put all his eggs in In another article he said I relished the challenges of disrupting an entire industry and trying to delight customers to a degree that had never been achieved before and he has also said in yet another article when asked about the opportunities he sees for himself in the future I ve been an entrepreneur since my early teens and certainly haven t peaked at age 34 So genius Ryan Cohen is putting all his eggs into Gamestop which we have established has insane upward potential after more than 2 years of rejecting probably thousands of good opportunities and wants to disrupt an entire industry and clash with Amazon again Do you really think the s over at Melvin Capital are going to be able to stop him If not you better tank up on GME shares now that the share price is low or after the potential short term crash following the ICR conference Positions Yolo on GME shares with a target price of 400 to sell PS For all you illiterate retards out there here is a

Everyone knows millennials have it hard They are drowning in student loans which are not dischargeable under bankruptcy and are paid wages that have stagnated for decades Even for the lucky ones who

drowning those hit hardest by student loan debt never finished college their loan payment often replaces what would have been a mortgage Just as well since housing prices have increased 150 more than inflation since 1971 putting home ownership out of reach for most of the generation And while wages haven t kept up with rising home prices rents have come fairly close which means that almost half of those 18 34 are rent burdened spending more than 30 of their income on rent https www cnbc com 2018 08 09 millions of millennials are locked out of homeownership heres why html Not all millennials are so burdened with rent as a third of millennials live with their parents more in states with higher rents like New Jersey where almost 47 of millennials still live at home https www census gov library publications 2017 demo p20 579 html All of this means that a full two thirds of millennials have zero in retirement savings and 72 have less than 1000 dollars in savings of any kind Most of the generation is living paycheck to paycheck so lets hope the economy doesn t fall into recession anytime soon as The Next Recession Will Destroy Millennials https www theatlantic com ideas archive 2019 08 millennials are screwed recession 596728 Looking at the situation broadly as a generation millennials have had three major problems Education is now incredibly expensive Housing costs in particular have surged well over the inflation rate Wages have stagnated for decades The Root Causes of Millennials Woes While the issues facing millennials are discussed ad nauseum the root causes of these issues are rarely discussed and are not as fully understood as they should be The Demographic Upheaval Much of the stagnation in wages is rooted in the stunning and totally under appreciated demographic changes of the last half century Wages have stagnated in large part because of the massive labor supply shock caused by the population increase from the baby boom the integration of Asia into the global economy and the integration of Eastern Europe with the fall of the USSR In simple economic terms the price for labor is a function of supply and demand and the last fifty years has seen a massive increase in the supply of labor Economists from the Bank of International Settlements BIS Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan explain in Demographics Will Reverse Three Multi Decade Global Trends that Between the 1980s and the 2000s the largest ever positive labour supply shock occurred resulting from demographic trends and from the inclusion of China and eastern Europe into the World Trade Organization This led to a shift in manufacturing to Asia especially China a stagnation in real wages a collapse in the power of private sector trade unions increasing inequality within countries but less inequality between countries deflationary pressures and falling interest rates The Emergence of Free Floating Currencies While demographics are a large part of the issue the labor supply shock doesn t fully explain the stagnation in wages nor does it explain the increase in asset prices This is largely the result of a major change to the global monetary system that occurred in the early 1970s It was after this point that the link between productivity and wages broke down and when the costs for education and housing began to rise faster than inflation https imgur com a r8A4ZT9 https imgur com a r8A4ZT9 Between 1971 and 1973 the Bretton Woods system https en m wikipedia org wiki Bretton Woods system which had dictated currency exchange rates since the Second World War broke down Nations began to devalue their currencies for competitive advantage Many nations did this to boost exports or to stimulate their own economies For more on the mechanics of this see Why Did China Just Devalue the Yuan https www cassandracapital net post why did china just devalue the yuan and this was the reason for the start of the ever increasing U S trade deficit https imgur com a IrUUKCU https imgur com a IrUUKCU The trade deficit when combined with demographic changes in the massive labor force expansion explains much of the stagnation in wages in the developed world But the era of free floating currencies has had a much larger impact on the world than merely creating trade imbalances Looking at the Consumer Price Index CPI for the United States over the long term shows the immediate and sustained inflationary impact of the free floating monetary system Most people today are used to the roughly 2 annual inflation But before the current free floating monetary system such inflation only took place during wartime https imgur com a xYFcZwa https imgur com a xYFcZwa The new money from this constant 2 inflation enters the economy through the banking system with each new loan increasing the total money supply Because the new money enters the economy as a loan interest rate sensitive assets that people borrow to purchase like housing and education are the most impacted https imgur com a qkGRy5t https imgur com a qkGRy5t The Root of Rising of Inequality Interestingly this constant 2 inflation effectively functions as wealth tax but not on the wealthiest who are able to benefit by owning appreciating assets like stocks and real estate but rather on the those who cannot afford to hold much of their wealth in appreciating assets or who must pay higher costs for rent This constant inflation helps to explain much of the rising inequality in the United States as well as the rising costs for interest rate sensitive assets like education and housing As the renowned economist John Maynard Keynes explained By a continuing process of inflation governments can confiscate secretly and unobserved an important part of the wealth of their citizens By this method they not only confiscate but they confiscate arbitrarily and while the process impoverishes many it actually enriches some The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth Those to whom the system brings windfalls beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires become profiteers who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie whom the inflationism has impoverished not less than of the proletariat A recent paper by Mehdi El Herradi and Aur lien Leroy Monetary policy and the top one percent Evidence from a century of modern economic history lends empirical evidence to Keynes analysis Analyzing the relationship between monetary policy and income inequality between 1920 and 2015 across twelve advanced economies they note The last decades have been marked by a substantial rise in income and wealth inequality across the developed world Low income households in advanced economies have seen their wages stagnating while wealth has never been so concentrated since the dawn of the 20th century They conclude based on their analysis that The results obtained from both empirical methods indicate that loose monetary conditions strongly increase the top one percent s income and vice versa In fact following an expansionary monetary policy shock the share of national income held by the richest 1 percent increases by approximately 1 to 6 percentage points according to estimates from the Panel VAR and Local Projections LP This effect is statistically significant in the medium run and economically considerable We also demonstrate that the increase in the top 1 percent s share is arguably the result of higher asset prices Understanding the Root Causes If we are going to solve the issues facing millennials today we need to understand the root causes of their problems Demographics are about to shift strongly in the millennials favor with the retirement of the baby boomers But reform to the monetary system is urgently needed Not only because the system is now breaking down into currency wars https www cassandracapital net post the strength of the dollar is leading to a currency war and not just with china but because of the negative impact the current system has on inequality And of course while millennials have it hard we should keep in mind that the boomers have their own problems like the fact that Pension Funds Are Going To Be Destroyed in the Next Recession https www cassandracapital net post pension funds are going to be destroyed in the next recession

fan of chasing SPACs that have already run past 12 and with how hot the SPAC market is right now this is one of the few quality options near NAV The team The most important people here imo are Kenneth

runs a fund https www directional com that invests in various aviation businesses Outside of business he was Bill Clinton s personal pilot inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation the same group

a total of up to 18 months from the closing of this offering subject to our sponsor purchasing additional private placement warrants This means a shorter wait for a LOI DA If a target is not successfully signed within 6 months it s likely there will be a 6 month extension along with an additional unit purchase which increases NAV by another 10 cents to 10 20 The sponsors of this SPAC have

admit I originally dismissed this stock because of the terrible DD s previously posted about this OAC is a blank cheque company that will be merging with HIMS amp HERS A lot of the other DD s have mistakenly categorized HIMS as a company that specializes in selling erectile disfunction pills which ironically I found as a turn off and dismissed it completely However I decided to give this company a second look because of the recent price action on the stock and what I found was a sleeping giant in the making Yes it s true that they do sell boner pills but that s just one product among many others i e hair loss treatment birth control acne etc What caught my attention wasn t what they were selling but HOW they were selling it Take Amazon for example which was a company that sold books originally and expanded into other products as it grew What made Amazon successful wasn t what they were selling but HOW they were selling it HIMS is looking to position themselves as a Telehealth disruptor in the Healthcare space How they are unique from any other e commerce platform that simply sells medication is the fact that they have a unique network of physicians that will address consumer concerns For example a person that has concerns about their hair loss might be too self conscious to go into a doctor s office to get a prescription and then must take that prescription to get fulfilled at a pharmacy The whole process is embarrassing and intimidating and as a result the customer might just not seek a solution all together However with HIMS the customer can consult a doctor remotely get a prescription order his medication and have it delivered to him all through his phone and in the comfort of his own home This in a nutshell is what give HIMS their unique competitive advantage What really attracted me to HIMS were their financials The company has been in operation for 3 years and the company is almost generating net positive EBITDA and will be in the next year or two think about what happened to SNAP when they were finally able to turn a profit and the stock price blew up In their latest S4 Amendment it shows their Q3 results in 2020 vs their Q3 results in 2019 They were able to generate almost twice as much Revenue from 57 Million into 107 Million and was able to reduce their marketing expense from 49 million into 39 million at the same time Not only that but they were also able to increase their gross margins from 51 into 72 As a result of their increased revenue gross margins and decrease marketing expense they were able to improve their EBITDA by 49 Million Year over year in 2020 They will mostly likely be EBITDA positive in 2021 when they finish their merger with OAC Keep in mind that the company is only 3 years old and still have lots and lots of run room Their growth potential is exponential So far I have demonstrated that the company has an amazing business model and amazing financials but what about their social media presence The HIMS account has 99 9K followers and the HERS account has 100K followers for a total combined following of 199 9K followers Their closet competitor is Lemonaid Health and they only have a total combined following of 8 3K So clearly HIMS has a lot more social influence than their competitor and once again keep in mind the company is only 3 years old Having a strong social media influence is part of the reason why they were able to generate more revenue while spending less in marketing in the year of 2020 Most recently Kylie Jenner The world s youngest self made billionaire with 208m followers on Instagram posted an Instagram story of her buying HERS product and tagging Jennifer Lopez who is a primary business partner and investor of HIMS amp HERS Having strong social media influencers like Kylie Jenner and Jennifer Lopez allows HIMS amp HERS to bypass and save money on traditional marketing like billboards and magazines and allows the company to directly advertise to their primary target market a generation of users that prioritize their mental and physical health and prefer to conduct their business online So they have a great business model financials and social media presence but what about their management team and investors Andrew Dudum is the CEO of HIMS amp HERS but before that he was the co found of ATOMIC a company that specializes in start up The guy literately started a start up company that focuses on start ups This means he knows a thing or two about company valuations and reaching out to venture capitalist to generate funding and increase valuations As a result he was able to receive funding from notable investors such as Peter Theil the guy that invested in FB PLTR and many other blow out companies in the early stages Okay so the company has a great business model financials social media and leadership but how much can I expect on my return on investment The OAC merger gives HIMS a valuation of 1 6 Billion at 10 per share Currently OAC is trading at around 15 which gives HIMS an implied valuation that is greater than 2 Billion now However the CEO Andrew Dudum is suggesting the company has a potential to reach 20 Billion which is a 10X bagger from 15 to 150 per share in the future after the merger The merger with OAC is expected to be completed by the end of January afterwards the ticker symbol will start trading as HIMS Position 1K shares TLDR OAC Merging with HIMS The company has a great business model financials social media presence leadership team and future valuation Merger expected to be completed by end of month Edit proof of OAC position https imgur com gallery D3rn6ZS Edit 2 Adding for dramatic effect

of 610km that have better ranges than the Model X but is a cheaper car by around 3 000 Nio has also developed a battery system that doesn t require you to buy a brand new car every single time a new battery is released like other major EV manufacturers Their battery system allows you to park into their battery houses and a machine will swap out the almost dead battery within your car for a newer and fully charged battery They also have a battery charging option where you can fast charge your Nio car at home or at a station but the Battery Swapping system is a lot quicker and only uses around 5 10 minutes to fully replace the battery Nio also offers an option to swap out your current battery and rent or buy a bigger Nio sized battery Their battery is undoubtedly great quality as the provider of the battery CATL also provides the battery to Tesla s Audi s and many more car manufacturers The only downside is that they most likely aren t on the priority list of battery purchasers because companies like Tesla help develop new batteries but Nio only buys them This might be a slight downside to buying Nio because you never know if they will have batteries but since they re both under Chinese governments they can find a way During the Nio battery day they claimed that they will adopt a new CATL solid state battery which improves their battery life for their ev cars especially their newest car model the Nio ET7 a sedan unveiled yesterday during the Nio Day event Their new car will have a distance of 1000 kilometres with the new CATL battery Chances are this will be a far better car than Tesla s Sedan Models at a cheaper price This will attract many buyers within the biggest EV market which will drive the price of the stock up increasing your gains probability Another aspect of the Nio environment which definitively increase their overall production is their customers Nio customers are offered many Nio houses which is like a Private Club only for Nio car owners Many Chinese owners send their kids to these private clubs with them to talk with others and the quality of the cafes and the services in what some people would call a Nio cult is very high These houses look like modern day mansions to meet others and during the Nio day event a Nio community in Shenzhen flew everyone who was part of it to the Nio day event on a private plane Now that is what you call loyalty This loyalty would most likely translate to more sales and more customers purchasing their cars because existing customers would recommend this car to join such a fantastic community This would help them increase their sales targets if not surpass them The Nio community would act like a domino effect to increase sales and if this effect keeps occurring their stocks can definitely hit higher prices within a few months Nio has also produced an app that allows Nio owners to showcase their Pros and Cons of the Nio cars and executives and designers can take their ideas and implement them into new cars which makes the Nio ecosystem even friendlier and better Finally Nio during their presentation unveiled a new partnership for their A I driving system The partnership is with NVDA Nvidia Corporation This would make their cars more secure faster and smoother transitions within their A I screens and better sensors because Nvidia is a fairly powerful chip manufacturer and can allow Nio to analyze more information within a shorter time I e better turns snappier system This would make everything in the car better than it is now and allow for better self driving systems which would better their rating and their product visualization In conclusion in a growing EV market in China and everywhere else Nio is bound to increase their stock price especially with the attitude towards customers and their innovating technology They have cheaper prices than competitors and many investors in China and America are willing to pour billions of dollars into the company to develop better technologies industries and attention towards the EV market Evs are the future and Nio is most likely a future proof company as long as the CCP supports it Nio has a growing trend in stock price so hurry before it s too late to purchase shares of Nio Nio undoubtedly will hit over 65 dollars within the next two weeks because the Nio day news will be welcoming to all investors this is my opinion on nio so listen or not there it is good luck with ur gains u geniuses

write on this god forsaken subreddit it s safe to say that you guys are fans of squeezing the living shit out of short sellers right Well I have a stock for you that will accomplish just that Moreover I strongly believe it looks primed up for the oh so coveted Infinity Squeeze that we all strive to take a ride on This company is called Joyy trading under ticker YY YY is under attack from our favorite neighborhood short seller Carson Block of Muddy Waters You may remember him from the report he released on Luckin Coffee which wasn t his work and more recently the report on GSX which I agree with and is actually a complete fraud While I respect Carson he is dead wrong on YY and I can tell you with an extremely high degree of confidence that he used the bullshit short report to tank the stock and cover a short position he has been long underwater on I will get into the details in just a minute So WTF is YY YY or Joyy is an extremely popular video streaming platform that owns the apps YY Live Bigo Live and Huya which they spun out and sold to Tencent YY recently announced that they came to an agreement with Baidu to sell YY Live to them for 3 6 bn This would leave the company with Bigo Live as the remaining asset and a nice big fat cash balance of 7 1 bn At a market cap of 7 5 bn you are basically getting Bigo Live for free Bigo Live is growing revenues 130 per year and is basically the Only Fans of Asia Tik Tok is worth 20x sales and growing slower If we even give YY 1 5th the valuation this stock will quickly 3X from here Notice I didn t say just China because after they sell YY Live the company has no China exposure and is headquartered in Singapore Bigo Live is consistently in the Top 10 grossing apps on Google and Apple App Store globally YY management came out and refuted MWs fraud claims wholeheartedly saying the report contains errors unsubstantiated statements and misleading conclusions interpretations the company is open to cash verification and diligence to be conducted by competent third party advisers announced a 300 mln buyback and massive dividend FIND ME A FRAUD THAT PAYS ITS SHAREHOLDERS DIVIDENDS ILL WAIT Muddy Waters is stretching to make an insane call You re telling me that YY s core asset is completely fraudulent and they were able to trick Baidu AND Tencent due diligence teams into buying assets from them for EXTREMELY large sums of money AND trick GOOGLE AND APPLE TOO Come the fuck on We have spoken with countless former employees and competitors who all have said the company is totally legitimate You re telling me YY has planted ex executives who have no reason to lie with expert networks to make false claims Come the fuck on again Finally my MOST IMPORTANT POINT if you are a top grossing app on the Google or Apple App Store you are paying a tax of 30 to Google or Apple for all in app purchases Muddy waters is claiming 80 of the revenues are false and coming from round tripping bots of the company WHY WOULD A COMPANY COMMIT FRAUD BY PAYING THEMSELVES FAKE REVENUE ONLY TO GIVE AWAY 30 OF THIS REVENUE TO GOOGLE AND APPLE COME THE FUCK ON PEOPLE After the Muddy Waters hit job Snow Lake Capital s Ma Ziming revealed in an interview that he was awakened in the early morning to understand the situation and immediately increased his holdings of YY stock by 100 million USD Who is Snow Lake Capital you may ask Maybe you guys might remember the short report that Muddy Waters put out on Luckin Coffee This short report was not the work of Muddy Waters but in fact was the work of Ma Ziming s fund Snow Lake Capital and Muddy Waters simply released it on their behalf Which makes this 100 million buy of YY EVEN MORE JUICY https xueqiu com 3582153332 163835924 Zhu Xiaohu said in the circle of friends Muddy Waters only dared to short YY in the second half of the night Otherwise you will definitely get beaten up Funny enough Carson Block always releases short reports on Chinese stocks between 3 5am Shanghai time when it s a position that he covers up quickly Last thing I will leave you with is the 1 shareholder of YY is Lei Jun who is the founder of Xiaomi He is worth 25bn USD and a top 10 richest guy in China and owns close to 2Bn of YY stock He tried to BUY THE ENTIRE COMPANY All of YY at around 70 share a couple years ago He was the Chairman of the Board WHY WOULD AN INSIDER TAKE A FRAUD PRIVATE WHEN HE COULD SELL HIS STAKE TO IDIOT U S INVESTORS LIKE YOU This is what normal frauds would do INSTEAD YY is paying out dividends and buying back tons of stock from their according to Muddy Waters fake cash pile WAKE UP MARKET Muddy Waters wrote this report in February that s when it is dated and is now releasing it FOR THE FIRST TIME because they have been under water for months on the position and realize this is their chance to get out with Baidu about to buy the company They needed a quick hit job to cover their position and now they are out The next catalyst here is the Baidu deal When the deal formally closes expected to in Q1 of this year this will start squeezing really hard as the market somehow thinks a MW report will prevent Baidu from closing Those of you who think the deal is in question Baidu is already promoting integrating YY Live on its platforms to provide additional traffic thereby corroborating previous reports from Chinese media that the sale of the domestic business of YY Live to Baidu isn t in jeopardy due to short reports Conclusion We will get an infinity squeeze of epic proportion Thank me later
