CRWD, amp x200B Issa Falcon https preview redd it tpzydidd7b971 png width 1200 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 6a24de00dd4c4fce80aa9b87e2bd37fea63c6724 Hello I am an Ivy League Econ major who does not know how to talk to attractive women As I type these hallowed words I am wearing Sony XM 4s and bumping my 7 TeraByte folder of Playboi Carti leaks Please see below my thoughts on the cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike which trades on the Nasdaq as CRWD The Kaseya ransomware attack this weekend affected 17 countries and 200 businesses Cyberattacks are growing more and more frequent Surely you ve seen the new reports Cyberattacks are also growing more and more sophisticated so much so that they can even infiltrate American government agencies The 750B the Pentagon gets every year wasn t enough to prevent that The consequences include breaches of sensitive user data compromised trade secrets corporate espionage operational shut downs and millions lost to paying ransoms So clearly preventing these attacks is in the best interest of everyone from CEOs to Presidents to Winnie the Pooh looking ass dictators Clearly they need to spend more Cybersecurity products and services are going from nice to have to gotta get it status real fucking quick Business Model CrowdStrike is the first of its kind among cybersecurity companies Incumbents like Palo Alto Networks Symantec and even FireEye FireEye has a lot of respect in the public sector are all Dotcom era dinosaurs That s because CrowdStrike is a cloud native SaaS that leverages artificial intelligence AI to prevent attacks on endpoints and workloads on or off the network That enough buzzwords for you Forrester Gartner MIT and Google an early investor and many other reputable sources have called CrowdStrike leader in endpoint protection The Bull Case According to Grand View Research the global cyber security services market https www grandviewresearch com industry analysis cyber security service market utm source prnewswire amp utm medium referral amp utm campaign ICT 13 Apr 21 amp utm term cyber security service market amp utm content rd size is expected to reach USD 192 70 billion by 2028 I say the true opportunity is even bigger because they haven t factored in all out cyberwar between America and the evil trinity of Russia Iran China State backed cyberattacks are nothing new Remember North Korea and Sony back when the JamesFranco SethRogen masterpiece The Interview came out Or remember when Microsoft https blogs microsoft com on the issues 2020 09 10 cyberattacks us elections trump biden reported that foreign hackers were trying to compromise the 2020 elections Remember when China agreed to invest 400B https www nytimes com 2021 03 27 world middleeast china iran deal html in Iran s tech sector Want more proof Just look at the FBI s webpage https www fbi gov investigate cyber news for cyberattack press releases there s a fuckton Recent research https www computerweekly com news 252499042 Nation state cyber attacks double in three years estimates that state backed cyberattacks have doubled in the last three years And that s just the tip of the iceberg Geopolitical tensions continue will of course continue to heat up This is because the human race is just a bunch of glorified nuclear powered apes We will see stronger legislation mandating that businesses armor the fuck up We will see outsized and reactionary government spending on cybersecurity We will also likely see tax payer funded incentives and subsidies directed toward cybsersecurity firms Management When I worked in venture capital for a summer I realized just how important the management team is to potential investors And CrowdStrike lives up to all expectations in this area George Kurtz the CEO and Co Founder of CrowdStrike has a track record of CyberSecurity success His startup Foundstone was acquired by McAfee in 2004 after which he worked his way up the ranks to become the CTO of McAfee Clearly this guy knows what the fuck he s doing He s no sleazy salesman he s a princely technocrat The Chief Strategy Officer used to be the Executive Assistant Director of the FBI s Criminal Cyber Response and Services Branch I d bet my house that this white male has many white male friends in high places Friends who d gladly toss him a contract or two The rest of the C Suite are all cyber veterans even the CFO It s a who s who of hacker nerds who saw the light Financials Who the fuck cares Okay fine I care a little Here s an overview of Q1FY22 results Revenue increased 70 YoY which reflects 82 growth in subscription customers They have a net loss of 85M only because they are investing aggressively in growth R amp D And at the end of the day they have 1 7B cash on hand to weather any shitstorms The customer relationships are deep and broad Recurring revenue is over 1B Furthermore existing customers end up buying more and more products from CrowdStrike as time goes on 64 of customers have now adopted four or more CrowdStrike products into their subscription And it s not like companies who need to cut costs are going to get rid of their cybersecurity

for a cup and handle to retrace as much as 50 from their initial high before a blue sky breakout or in our case a trip to the moon As illustrated below this would be the most possible scenario in my opinion this would also trap bears causing even more buying pressure if the trend changes rapidly amp x200B GME could go as low as 172 173 before a breakout https preview redd it 740hh17yde971 png

behavior patterns and a group of individuals interacting with one another on a consistent basis form collective behavior patterns These behaviors are observable and quantifiable and they repeat themselves with statistical reliability in a sense technical analysis allow you get into the mind of the market As a method for projecting future price movement technical analysis as turned out to be

HYMC aka SCAM Please join me next week by curtailing some Wall Street executives summer vacation plans to Martha s Vineyard and the Nantucket This Company has an Institutional presence of 71 of common of the 50m O S The High lights in this putrid dumpster fire is Pending class action law suit from shareholders they cheated in 2013 coming up in July 2021 Warrant holders cheated so badly the Holders wrote a tell all book about the incident and grifting by the Company executives and are begging the SEC on National TV for help A 2021 June Registration of Shares the size of fill a Supermax Oil Tanker for an upcoming massive Capex dilution event Company announced in 3 2021 that its expected 2BILLION NPV wasn t going to happen because it s proprietary leaching method for extracting Gold that it had bet the farm on was a REALLY retarded idea and we re gonna have to dilute our shares like a traditional Pink sheet mining scam Below is some DD by a Meta Ape not me I am FULLY retarded but smart enough to see a scam amp opportunity for Puts on how WORTHLESS this Company is The deposit is low grade 0 28 gpt of which the leachability ranges from about 0 22 gpt for their oxide ore to 0 12 gpt in transitional ore and 0 06 gpt in sulfide ore If you put this in dollar terms the gross revenue value from the ore Au Ag is 18 for oxide 10 for transitional and 5 for sulfide That is almost nothing and the project depends upon huge materials movements to make it economical The original plan which is where their 2 billion NPV comes from involves ramping to 3 million tons per month 36 MTPA The mining cost at full production is supposed to be 3 60 t and the total cost mining processing G amp A 8 50 t In other words they make a margin on oxide sort of break even on transitional and can t touch sulfide at all Now lets look at reserves measured and indicated 8 million tons of oxide 38 million tons of transitional and 348 million tons of sulfide Almost all sulfide They have virtually no tonnage of profitable ore only about a year s worth based upon full production numbers Everything in this project is based upon doing something to raise the revenue potential of the sulfide ore to that of transitional or oxide ore Enter the proprietary two stage leach I understand the process and its objectives but that s not important here Bottom line is that they are counting on the double leach process to raise the recoverable value of sulfide ore to about 65 70 or raise its value from 5 t to 15 t so that it becomes profitable Now look at the attached article March 24 and especially the following It is anticipated that mining in the first four months of 2021 will be performed using the existing Hycroft fleet and a rental fleet moving approximately 1 5 Mt mth of ore and waste For the remainder of the year Hycroft intends to mine some 500 000 t of oxide and transitional ore and waste per month with a more cost effective mining fleet Diane R Garrett President amp Chief Executive Officer reflected on the results 2020 was an important year for Hycroft as the company continued to focus on the restart of the Hycroft Mine Throughout the year we advanced work on the proprietary two stage sulphide heap oxidation and leach process and made several important findings that will need to be addressed prior to our implementing the novel technology on a commercial scale There are some holy c p moments in there Economics require 3 million tons a month of ore They were operating at less than 1 2 capacity 1 5 Mt ore plus waste or lt 1 5 Mt ore and they are cutting this by 2 3 0 5 Mt per month They are squeaking out a tiny bit of production by eking out and depleting their very tiny amount of oxide and transitional material Worse what are important findings that need to be addressed These are supposed to be addressed in the feasibility study not by doing emergency studies on the side when you are supposed to be in production and it is shocking that the CEO talks about having to do work prior to implementation on a commercial scale when if fact they are are already supposed to be running on a commercial scale What they are saying is that the process does not work and that virtually their entire ore body ore has disappeared since there is no economical ore without the sulfide Put bluntly they are in deep c p and are scrambling madly to find a paddle to get themselves out of s t creek The result of the work to date has identified several items that were not considered or included in the original plan and design but are critical to the success of this process What the heck Items critical to the success of the project were not considered or included in the original plan and design Then what kind of plan or design is it If you actually look at the list of deficiencies it is shocking and identifying future work as being critical to success is exactly the same as saying that there is ZERO probability of success here and now with the existing operation since these things critical to success are currently missing The communications are saying in no uncertain terms that the project is collapsing due to having been built on an incompetent feasibility study and that the only hope of digging themselves out is by doing hail Mary investigations on the side to try to find a magic solution before they run out of money and ore If they had a clear path forward and that s a big if then the development path itself is at least a couple of years in the making A single leach experiment takes about 6 months or more so it s not like they are going to fire out a huge amount of data next quarter Their continued survival is a long shot They need to shut down and stop bleeding out shareholder s money by running something that is not and will not be profitable It would be a market slaughter but the responsible thing to do would be to go back to being an advanced exploration project Technical Report http www hycroftmining com wp content

Recovery Are Emerging Description Catalyst Paramount Resources is one of the oldest publicly traded oil and gas companies with over 2 million net acres of land in Canada The stock is trading at multi year lows and I believe has an expected return of between 200 and 300 in the next year The most important catalyst should happen very soon growth in Q2 19 from their new Wapiti field in Alberta Given the age of the company IPO in 1978 legacy field production is much lower than typical shale fields and requires much less capital to sustain With a lower declining base and new production from Wapiti Paramount s production should increase after a year of declining To oversimplify oil and gas stocks typically move higher when production is higher than expected With Paramount s stock near 20 year lows and production about to start growing after a year of declining the stock should have a strong tailwind towards realizing my price target of 20 share I believe downside is limited outside of macro oil price shocks given how low expectations are Business Description Paramount has production from three regions but for simplicity s sake only one of the regions matters to the upside valuation case The three regions are Grand Prairie where the crown jewel assets of Karr and Wapiti reside Kaybob Region will likely decline 15 20 per year and Central Alberta will likely decline 10 15 per year The most important region is Grand Prairie which is currently 1 3rd of production and consists of the Karr and Wapiti regions Wells here have payback periods of approximately 15 months making them amongst the top oil wells in North America Paramount has drilled over thirty wells at Karr and has seen consistent results The Wapiti region which is right next door to Karr just had their first wells turn online in April May when Keyera s gas processing facility came online The main growth driver for Paramount will be Karr and Wapiti History and Why the Stock is Mispriced Today s investment opportunity exists because of what transpired in the last two years In 2017 Paramount bought Apache s assets in Canada The crown jewel of Apache Canada was the Wapiti region in Alberta however production from Wapiti could not start growing until mid 2019 as Paramount had to wait for Keyera to finish building infrastructure in the region This meant that 2018 should be uneventful year with no growth Guidance in 2018 was set at flat production of 100kboepd However actual production came in at 86kboepd Paramount s stock fell as most oil and gas stocks do when guidance is reduced The bear thesis on POU is simple production went from 95kboepd in Q4 17 to 85kboepd in Q4 18 despite 600m of capex and management s initial promise of 100kboped of production Bears don t believe management s new 2019 guidance for growth to 85 90kboepd in Q4 19 with only 350m of capex These are the primary reasons why the stock is priced near 20 year lows today The bridge from 95kbodp in Q4 17 to 85kboepd Q4 18 is as follows 5kboepd less from an asset sale Resthaven land 5kboepd less from disappointing results in their new Duvernay land exploration region that didn t work guidance should have been set more conservatively 5kboepd less from various midstream and third party issues Expectations for 2019 production growth are therefore extremely low I believe Paramount s production will exit at nearly 100mboepd guidance is for 85 90 My simple math is as follows Karr Q4 18 production was 27kboepd This has been their best asset recently and production was kept flat in 2018 exit to exit because of midstream constraints The company expanded their infrastructure slightly in 2H 18 and I believe production could exit 2019 around 30kboepd Wapiti The company had zero production here in Q4 18 but began turning online wells in May April when the long awaited Keyera gas processing facility turned online The company will have over 20 wells drilled and completed this year and has guided to an average IP 365 of 1395 boepd If you multiple 20 by 1395 you get nearly 28kboepd of incremental production averaged over the whole year These wells start off at much higher rates initially and not all 20 wells will be turned online immediately I believe Wapiti could therefore exit 2019 producing 20kboepd Kaybob region This is a mature old field with a 20 decline rate The company is drilling a few new wells here and I think production will decline 5 from Q4 18 of 37kboepd to 35kboepd in Q4 19 Central Alberta This is another mature old and gas field with a 15 decline rate I think production will therefore go from 20kboepd in Q4 18 to 17kboepd in Q4 19 Summary Q4 19 estimate Karr at 30 Wapiti at 20 Kaybob at 35 and Central Alberta at 20 105kboepd of production versus guidance of 85 90 I believe 2019 guidance was set conservatively because a new investor relations team which arrived later in 2018 after initial guidance was set did not want to repeat the old team s mistakes from last year Why will Wapiti results be good Paramount turned online their first wells at Wapiti in the 2nd quarter and initial results should be released with Q2 earnings in August Production could not start until Keyera finished building its gas processing plant in the region which it did in the 2nd quarter of this year Various operators with consistently good well results surround Paramount s Wapiti region Below is a map to show proximity amp x200B Paramount s Wapiti type curve shows the wells have payback periods of 15 months and IRRs of 45 at 55 oil Here are neighboring well results that give me confidence in Paramount s Wapiti estimates Paramount s Karr region directly south of Wapiti and over 30 wells have been drilled here Average returns are 64 with 18 month payouts NuVista s Gold Creek acreage directly west of Wapiti with 40 IRRs Production in this region started in 2017 and so NuVista has plenty of well history underpinning its type curve Pipestone Energy s acreage directly north of Wapiti with 60 IRRs All IRRs referenced above assume a 55 WTI oil price Potential asset sales Given the age of the company Paramount has plenty of assets both oil and gas acreage and infrastructure that they could sell Some analysts believe they could sell their infrastructure at Karr Karr is currently Paramount s best land 64 IRRs referenced above and inventory life is substantial Below is my math on Karr s potential infrastructure value amp x200B Valuation Upside If Paramount exits 2019 at over 100kboepd I estimate they could produce between 110 and 120kboepd in 2020 At 55 oil WTI and 5 condensate differentials EBITDA would be 600m My EBITDA estimate is after paying their annual abandonment liability Subtracting debt of 800m and assuming 5x EBITDA equity value is over 2 2bn and 17 share Shares are at 6 8 today Downside If we take 2019 EBITDA consensus of 350m most sell side is bearish neutral on the stock and apply a low 4x multiple after subtracting 800m of debt the valuation target becomes 4 60 share Downside is therefore 30 I could imagine such downside scenario if Wapiti results are delayed for some reason infrastructure constraints or operational problems that have plagued Paramount in the past amp x200B Risks Abandonment liability Paramount has a 800m abandonment liability which it pays out 30m per year Recently in Alberta the government ruled that in bankruptcy the abandonment liability of an oil and gas company becomes senior to bank debt As such some investors are concerned that Paramount s large abandonment liability could cause its revolver size to be reduced and negatively impact the company s liquidity However Paramount s revolver does not mature until November of 2022 The company has drawn 800m on their 1 5bn revolver and as such have plenty of liquidity in the interim I think the company will have material free cash flow after 2020 and so the size of its revolver will become less relevant after 2022 Guidance in 2019 is reduced bears will point out that Paramount reduced guidance in 2018 and the company s track record of executing against guidance isn t good If for whatever reason Paramount reduces 2019 guidance because Wapiti wells are below type curve or infrastructure issues creep up again I think downside to the stock is 30 Please see my valuation section above Oil gas prices this risk is common to any oil and gas company One could hedge out these risks by shorting another oil and gas producer In the interest of full disclosure of potential conflicts I work for a company that currently has a long position in Paramount Resources The opinions presented here are my own and are based on my research alone and are not necessarily those of my employer There is no guarantee that the price targets I ve modeled will be reached and the share price could actually decrease depending on trading dynamics company announcements market conditions and other unknown factors Catalyst Market does the math

a relative success in oversaturated market SHEN has few major streams of revenue Access Local and Fiber Lease Cable Service Wireless External revenues and investments I won t go deep into the all of

even though they seemed important In the times when everything is priced in several years ahead it s really hard to find a company with solid fundamentals that is still going under the radar Shares outstanding 49 94 mil Market Cap 2 84 B P E 17 24 EPS 3 30 Divi yield 0 60 Avg volume 187K ROE 29 For a company in oversaturated market such as Telecommunications and controlled by giants such as T Mobile Verizon Viacom to keep such a great fundamentals is nothing but amazing How did they achieve it Simple while everyone was trying to dominate big cities and get the main piece of cake SHEN was focusing on expanding their influence in the rural areas Yes internet exists outside of the metropolis and even the folk in the country side want to be online so they can eat some popcorn watching you lose your life savings on AMC puts Let s sum up why these fundamentals are a good sign of a healthy company Anything with P E under 20 is almost a unicorn nowadays everything is being priced in several years ahead and on potential that might not be there yet while SHEN goes under the radar this entire time In Short SHEN does better in fundamentals than most of the Industry respective to the company size What this all mean In the most simplistic way with 52 Week 38 77 57 65 you can be certain that the company is not going away anytime soon they have been around for more than 100 years they are slowly expanding sure it s not Google it s not T Mobile but they are keeping it lowkey in the rural areas where there is still plenty of room to expand opposite to the big cities where you have to rival the giant companies The company is beating expectations on quarterly basis https preview redd it mooxgloo7g971 png width 331 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 02ee797165edab7b125aaaf7b3b7fb1717312ed2 Seeing a lot of green that s what I like Regarding the potential market cap and share price targets I believe the company just solely based on their fundamentals and stable revenue earnings streams could be worth much more However the average volume on the stock is barely 187K therefore it s been going under the radar for some time Why there seem to be no interest in the stock Even though it s only a speculation we are living in the time where everybody wants to get rich quickly on the most notorious stocks or invest in the to known giants that took control over their respective industries If you want something a growth stock you can always just buy some giant company in the sector or just buy some index fund That could be one of the reasons why it s hard to notice a company that had been around for a long time is growing in the rural areas expanding closing deals and makes sure there is a stable income revenue stream However that does not change the fact that the company has much more potential and could be undervalued FREE TENDIES SPECIAL DIVIDEND 18 75 share Now to the actual play To be honest I too haven t known about SHEN since this announcement I had couple of dividend paying stocks but this opportunity was too good to ignore SHEN is focusing more and more on their main revenue stream broadband and decided to sell of their Wireless assets and operations to T Mobile in an insane sale https finance yahoo com news shenandoah telecom declares special dividend 122122682 html The sale totaled 1 94 billion dollars which at the time was almost the amount similar to the company s market cap SHEN is giving away 936 6mil of this sale back to the shareholders making it 18 75 per share which is insane and will be payed out on August 2nd if you are a shareholder as of recorded date July 13th The rest of the proceeds they used to cover all of the debt and are expected more than 19 6mil to be reinvested back to the stock further pumping the price up Why is it such a big deal If you didn t just skim through the fundamentals you would have found out that the company s fair value is around 56 share What is it trading as of this moment 56 81 so even despite the news of crazy special dividend we are trading around the fair value of the company But but but the share price will always rebalance itself after the payout date Yes and no in some cases it doesn t have to but if you enter anywhere under the 60 in order for you to lose money on this play the stock would have dump below their 52 week low This is basically free guaranteed gain You don t have speculate if Richard Branson reaches the Space or if Elon finally delivers on the self driving system This is almost literally free win or as it is common to say it can t go tits up Just the fact that 19 6 mil is expected to be reinvested back That s 345k shares bought at the current price almost twice as much as your average daily volume So even if the stock dumped right after the Dividend payout you have guaranteed stock buybacks happening all while the fundamentals and future outlook for the company is still holding strong Yes yes but it s a dividend

market activity stocks shen dividend history https www nasdaq com market activity stocks shen dividend history Final Thoughts Special dividends does not occur that often they are here and there and can cause massive spike in the share price in the short amount of time while Especially if the pay out is literally almost 1 3 of the entire market cap I believe that any entry below 60 65 share is still amazing because in order for this to go tits up the stock would not only have to drop below it s 52 Week low 38 77 but also stay there all in while being fairly valued at 56 Moreover selling a big portion of their assets to T Mobile could make the company an acquisition target Since they are popular in rural parts of the country acquisition of SHEN could be an easy entry for any of the telecom giants to enter rural areas Which in turn could further skyrocket the price but that s purely a speculation I am planning on holding after the special dividend pay out with selling a small portion of the position on the dividend payout and holding rest for the longer term I would like to hear any opinions on this play any bull bear case is very welcome Any criticism is welcome let me know what you think TL DR Company paying out insane special dividend 18 75 share on August 2nd if you hold shares before July 13th while maintaining solid fundamentals Position 598 shares at 56 96

posted earlier today by u TheTendilorian https www reddit com u TheTendilorian I saw an opportunity to steal the show for myself Kidding u TheTendilorian https www reddit com u TheTendilorian did fantastic work and you can find their post on AMD financials rightttttttttt here https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments oe88ub amd su bae witness me h45ifrd context 3 AMD is easily my fav stock and I m perpetually bullish on it however there s a lot of catalysts that will have effects on AMD both negative and positive at all stages I m not passing this on as financial advice just my opinions Chip Shortage This one is the most significant situation in regards to semiconductors and the wider tech industry In many cases it helps the bullish argument since AMD and also NVDA https www nasdaq com market activity stocks nvda earnings but fuckem continues to exceed earnings estimates despite the rough environment The expansion of TSMC into America https www reuters com technology tsmc says construction has started arizona chip factory 2021 06 01 in my opinion is going to launch AMD into the fuckin stratosphere over the next couple of years Though still based in Taiwan TSMC is one of the biggest players in global semiconductor production As of March AMD was TSMC s number one customer in regard to purchasing 7nm wafers https www notebookcheck net AMD overtakes Apple as TSMC s main 7nm customer 528532 0 html Additionally let s talk about the economic giant we call China I m an International Relations student so this is right up my asshole alley While current President Biden has mentioned reversing some of the hardline policies of his predecessor President Trump however there has been little evidence of progress towards that goal Two weeks ago the Biden Administration blocked an attempt by a Chinese firm to purchase Korean chip manufacturer Magnachip https foreignpolicy com 2021 06 22 biden semiconductors south korea china trade war A small company sure but we can extrapolate this stance to assume that TSMC could be off limits to Chinese acquisition in the future if the US and Taiwan can come to a formal agreement Who knows how long this US China measuring contest will go on but the evidence suggests to me that it would not drastically affect the prices of semiconductor companies Being the massive pussy that I am though I m concerned about how an impending crash will impact overall liquidity and the supply and demand of semiconductor chips which computing technology consumes about 1 3 of https spectrum ieee org tech talk semiconductors devices how and when the chip shortage will end in 4 charts But obviously if we all lose our homes we would have bigger fish to fry than worrying about AMD share price Innovation I m an avid PC gamer I literally have nothing going on other than my Steam account and my Fidelity account This is not a cry for help IMO NVDA has the best net technology for GPUs However AMD offers more consumer friendly products I believe that AMD cards offer the best value per dollar paid Unless you re one of those idiots paying 5 grand for a graphics card I mean c mon you can watch Pornhub Premium without an RTX 3080 This catalyst is just going to be driven by overall consumer sentiment If people begin realizing that their value is better spent on AMD graphics cards that market share https www statista com statistics 754557 worldwide gpu shipments market share by vendor is gonna be gobbled the fuck up Oh and processors Yeah INTC is a piece of shit that I m not concerned with No source just facts Kidding here s some cool charts comparing processor performance https www tomshardware com features amd vs intel cpus I won t lie the new i9 5 1 GHz is an absolute beast but the difference is almost negligible compared to the Ryzens which are priced lower NVDA Stock Split 20 June 2021 Fuckin NVDA always raining on the AMD parade I m not angry just disappointed This stock split is actually pretty insignificant Does this change any of the fundamentals between the two Fuck no Am I looking forward to it Eh Is there a point to me including this section Kinda As u TheTendilorian https www reddit com u TheTendilorian said to me AMD is a bit of a late bloomer compared to NVDA which can be seen as the current titan of the GPU space I expect the price of NVDA post split 1 4 to be somewhere between 150 and 250 just based on previous prices and my exceptional arithmetic skills While this is still above AMD stock price I think it will be easier to perform comparative technical analysis between the two companies when the prices are closer Compare that with the fundamentals I wrote about earlier and you have got one bullish ass stock Price Outlook If I was Michael Burry and had enough coke and psilocybin I would tell you guys the price target a year from now But I m a broke college student with no coke and only a little shrooms so it s whatever Short term I m playing AMD calls pretty close to the chest Currently holding 7 9 95c and 8 20 100c I roll up or down depending on how the week has gone AMD has been trading sideways since the run up last June with a high of 99 23 and a solid floor around 72 73 For a quick swing of shares I try to enter anywhere under 80 and exit above let s call it 86 50 As of now I m looking out for an announcement stating the date of the Q2 earnings call I m guessing August and I m looking for AMD to continue its run and retest 95 before a post earnings dip I ve charted pivot points for our current trading range as follows 85 57 86 10 Psychological resistance at whole values between 87 and 93 93 55 95 ATH of 99 23 Mid term I don t fucking know get back to me if the market crashes If not 6 12months out 100 120 with a floor around 85 90 just based on how we ve been growing and the fact that resistance gt support As mentioned I m expecting a bit of a pullback soon since tech has been absolutely soaring the last two weeks but seeing 85 90 turn into support is not unreasonable in the near future Honestly I m much more uncertain about mid term compared to short or long time frames Long term NVDA levels I believe with all my heart that AMD is the better company and should be valued as such They are a company that continues to exceed expectations and make great connections in the computing industry For shares I would just buy and hold until I retire Mod who reviewed my post in its baby stages told me that buy and hold was a questionable term to use I ve heard the term investing passed around other subreddits but hell if I know what that means Bottom Line Me and my good pal Tendo heavily believe in this company as I m sure many others do No price target if I m going to take a 1 yr position Under 80 if I m going for a swing trade that will last one month or less So yeah that s about it Great DD u TheTendilorian https www reddit com u TheTendilorian AMD to the moon not a financial advisor blah blah blah Who wants to
