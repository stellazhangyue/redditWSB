yeeting money into this market Unsure what flair to use to best categorize this steaming pile of research I compiled what I want this post to be is a discussion of my little bit of research and whether or not my plan to invest is wise We begin at the beginning when I filled with infinite wisdom used the Finviz stock screener to find share prices that had gapped down 10 or more Why did you

out at me 1 Income top left corner this number is not negative Sick 2 Short Float top right corner ish this number is low I think this is the percentage of available shares being shorted or some shit 3 Target price below Short Float this number is green Green is good Dow Jones probably idfk I pretty much laid out the significance to me of those numbers in the list above if it seems too simple that is because it is and I am a fuckin idiot but I ll explain quickly why I think the low Short Float number is good This number leads me to believe that not a lot of folks are betting against the stock and that led me to believe further that the share price may come bouncing back up and prove to be a good investment for some quick cash Cool I got in my head that this is a good buy after looking a few not negative numbers I should go ahead and just jump in right No I must dig deeper Through Google I came to the SEC website with all the CRUS company filings I clicked on the latest filing which is an 8K In this document I found a whole bunch of shit I didn t understand Also some tables with numbers on them amp x200B Important looking red boxes look important https preview redd it

one year to another from 28 March 2020 to 27 March 2021 such as GAAP Net Income Cash and equivalents and Net sales to name a few I cannot stress this enough I don t know shit about fuck The numbers

believe that the company is good for the long term and finally I decided to take a position 5 shares at 75 Goddamn bold I know I plan to increase the size of my position over time as I free up capital In conclusion I wanted to present the analysis I did before deciding to take this position so I can discuss the analysis with strangers on the internet Based on what I am seeing this is a sound

of which 270B was spent on MA All or most of this growing annual budget goes to fund MA plans such as Clover for services they provide members The problem is there are too many visits and hospitalizations than are needed What if there was an innovative startup that used innovation pay doctors fixed fees per visit and technology Clover Assistant software with telehealth features such that federal government paid out LESS per member to such a company vs competition target outcome of Direct Contracting https www cms gov newsroom fact sheets direct contracting for HIGHER quality of care Great ability to capture market share from legacy insurers and help lower government spending more on this later a WIN WIN situation for insurer and the govt This is why Clover s business model is so fool proof TLDR Clover operates in a space that is majority funded by government and its unique business model helps it gain market share 2 Competition Now let s talk competition Competitors such as Humana United Health CVS Aetna have for years delivered medical insurance but hardly innovated in a way that was positive for federal spending They continued charging seniors on plan premiums while trying to receive as much funding as possible from the fed to grow their profits Why make the process more efficient when all we do to get paid is to broker insurance plans in a highly regulated industry Clover with its innovation is miles ahead of the competition by getting a nice head start started in 2014 while other insurers are just getting started with the innovation https medcitynews com 2021 02 mercy humana partner to expand access to virtual value based care and the Clover Assistant software will constantly help it become more efficient i e achieve better results for its members at a lower cost to CMS CLOV is also MORE HOLISTIC than TDOC in services while targeting a LOWER TAM i e only Seniors right now Only a matter of time that they expand beyond MA and offer plans for the general population TLDR Clover is disrupting competition through its use of technology 3 Software Now the bit about software This IS Clover s secret ingredient The development is led by an ex Googler Andrew Toy President at Clover Health to radically transform software used to treat seniors through massive digitization and interactive UI This in turn helps doctors improve outcomes for patients And they are giving it away for free Why would a physician not use software that helped him her improve the standard of care for their patients while being easy to use and access and FREE Imagine Marc Benioff giving away Salesforce for free to sales reps all over When this software becomes the standard of care because of the years of head start they have in this space Clover Health could eventually license this to the other insurers and health care providers i e additional sources of revenue TLDR The Clover Assistant software is the secret ingredient that helps the company deliver efficient care and achieve better outcomes 4 Growth Ok so we briefly spoke about licensing as an additional mode of revenue now let s focus on others 2 Current projections indicate 14 annual organic growth of MA population this growth is likely to go bonkers when Biden reduces the Medicare eligible age to 60 as promised https joebiden com fact sheet how joe biden would help you get health insurance coverage during the coronavirus crisis in his campaign Evergreen and ever growing TAM 3 Direct Contracting introduced by CMS is basically a risk sharing model that incentivizes insurers to make treatment of seniors more efficient and cost effective Insurers that can achieve a lower cost of treatment and fewer hospital visits for the same condition they are likely to be held in favor by CMS when allotting MA counties every year Now if you remember the bit about software Clover is in the best position to do this as long as doctors continue to use the Clover Assistant software to treat seniors This may sound like a risky bet but it really isn t 60 of Clover members see a PCP that uses the Clover Assistant software Clover s long term goal https investors cloverhealth com static files ed2bc09d cd96 4759 897e 862c2b250213 is to get to a 70 rate 4 End 2020 Clover offered MA plans in 34 counties but this will grow based on participation in more states as per the CMS Direct Contracting plan for 2021 https innovation cms gov media document gpdc model participant announcement TLDR Growth in MA membership direct contracting geographic expansion potential to license its software are all lucrative growth avenues 5 Customers Let s now put some light on the target demographic seniors Clover is promising them the lowest cost plans 0 premiums low no co pays which are highly flexible telehealth on Clover Assistant to their needs Why not In addition Clover is developing partnerships with Walmart and other retailers to market their plans which is likely to result in an ever growing customer and incentivized partner base 6 Media The media has lambasted this company quite vocally including on CNBC despite little of substance except that there was a short seller report and questions asked about the CEO To his credit Cramer recently invited Clover Health to Mad Money now when this interview happens it is likely to introduce the company to a pretty massive list of retail investors the buy and hold kind and when they realize how undervalued Clover is they will likely pick up a good portion of the float causing fewer and fewer shares to be available 7 Management If one reads through the exec incentive structure in SPAC prospectus https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1801170 000119312520316032 d69158d424b3 htm toc69158 24 they would soon realize that the CEO has most of his interest in the company tied to the stock he does not receive a salary More importantly both CEO and President performance based incentive plans do not kick in until CLOV reaches and maintains a volume weighted average price of 30 for a 90 day period Consider also Lee Shapiro who sits on the board of Clover Health is the former CFO of Livongo now part of TDOC ARK fav while Chelsea Clinton adds serious weight and is actively involved as a board member 8 Valuation SPAC merger docs value the company at 3 7B Currently because of the short seller report and the massive short interest in the company it is valued at 3B which is 4x 2021E sales With projected revenues for 2021 of 835M mid point and applying a 8x sales multiple Clover s valuation needs to be at least 6 7B market cap implying a 16 PT With expected 24 growth in 2021 and premium multiple for high growth companies note that the float is only 25 of shares outstanding I believe a 20 25 target is more in line with current valuations When medicare eligible age limit is lowered to 60 by Biden later this year or perhaps early next this PT will need to be re evaluated upward Also consider the fact that this company is NOT zero revenue now promising billions in 2025 and beyond it had sales of 670M in sales in 2020 and growing Consider also that the industry leader in the telehealth space TDOC and a Cathie Wood amp ARK fav currently trades at 16x sales Similar multiple for CLOV implies a 33 PT TLDR Whichever way you cut it CLOV is very undervalued right now Near term 25 30 PT and longer term has LMND like potential in healthcare insurance I am long CLOV because I believe that it is trying to solve a very hard and complex problem in healthcare It deserves a lot more credit and people rooting for it to succeed

before I start I wanted to say thank you so much for the love and support on my previous post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments n1so1m quick ta dd on clov as of 42921 I didn t know that it would garner that much of positive feedbacks and I m excited to write my TA posts as a series if time allows me to With that being said I do not plan to write these kind of posts for every trading session days since I would run out of things to say at one point My intention is to write these kind of posts for days where we see a significant gap up or gap down that reinforces the Elliott Wave Theory speculation I also want to remind you that if the closing price goes below the speculated bottom the entire theory will be invalidated I hope you all join me in this bumpy ride and enjoy it together Anyways let s get right to what I think about Friday s 4 30 21 price action Brief Summary As of 4 30 21 CLOV opened at 9 89 and closed at 9 85 with a previous closing price of 10 17 3 15 To simply put it today was a consolidation day based on the opening price and the closing price The volume didn t help with the stock s bullish sentiment either as Friday s volume was at 17 38 mil in contrast to Thursday s volume at 68 33 mil This means Friday s volume was cut down by more than 74 5 that s 3 4 of Thursday s total volume gone for today Now I have a few speculations as to why we experienced one of the lowest volumes on Friday ever since the CLOV hype began Continual market beatdown against smaller market caps causing a FUD Fear Uncertainty Doubt against retail investors which discouraged investors from purchasing stocks due to the fear of further market beatdown CLOV s chart on Friday EXACTLY mirrored the NASDAQ 100 chart and NASDAQ s relative volume was the LOWEST out of all three major stock market indices DOW NASDAQ and S amp P 500 Don t believe it Check out the images below Based on the images below it s clear to me that there is a positive correlation to the performance of market index versus CLOV individual stock on Friday This leads to a reasonable assumption that CLOV had a disappointing day NOT because of CLOV s getting dumped on per se but rather because the entire market especially NASDAQ performed poorly on Friday amp x200B CLOV s 5 min chart on Friday 4 30 21 https preview redd it 80g8hbo7tqw61 png width 1825 amp format png amp auto webp

ac30561676da97c754b0c5234956090ae9bd891d Fibonacci retracements With Friday s bearish price action it s good to see that we ve respected the 23 6 level as a major support rather than letting it become the new resistance level However Friday s price action doesn t necessarily indicate that Thursday s 4 29 21 price action was a bear trap Depending on the next Monday s overall market performance volume level and buying pressure I think we will be able to get a clearer picture as to whether we are going to use 23 6 level as a support to bounce off from or continue the downward trend Overall I do think that we will see 23 6 level being used as a support for CLOV to bounce off on as long as the overall market shows a reversal pattern on Monday Elliott Wave Theory Friday s price action although it was a minimal dip in the grand scheme of things does confirm that we are in wave 2 which is a corrective wave I originally speculated that we will see a healthy pullback to around 8 52 range but since the chart respected the 23 6 level as a support we may see a bounce earlier and perhaps move on to wave 3 That s a very good thing for all of us who want to see CLOV explode off to Mars But of course this is all contingent upon high volume level and high buying pressure We will have to continue to observe the price action and the daily chart to find further confirmations that indicate to wave 3 speculation amp x200B Friday s 5 min Chart Friday s 5 min chart https preview redd it 77zk7810uqw61 png width 1824 amp format png amp auto webp amp s aee8685305104aea32ca0c18b808d01ecb4c23ac VWAP Today I wanted to focus more on the VWAP which is an acronym for volume weighted average price Simply put it s a metric used for intraday charts to determine the buying pressure and selling pressure based on that day s volume and share price The rule of this metric is If the candle sticks are above the VWAP line it s a bullish sentiment and vice versa Based on that rule we can now look at the 5 min chart and see what s going on with the VWAP line which is colored blue Looking at the chart we can see that during the market opening we stayed above the VWAP line with a great start to the volume level This means that the buying pressure was greater than the selling pressure based on the volume However as the trading session went on the explanation provided from the brief summary section caused the volume level to dry up and die off And as the volume level went down you can see how the candle sticks moved below the VWAP line which means that the selling pressure was greater than the buying pressure RSI This is further reinforced by looking at Friday s RSI chart You can see that during the market opening RSI trended towards an overbought territory but as volume level died off RSI eventually corrected itself down to a neutral level consolidated a bit and headed over to an oversold level which is correlated to the 5 min price chart above Based on VWAP and RSI analysis it is reasonable to assume that CLOV will show a reversal as long as the volume level is high amp x200B Short Interest Fintel s short volume data for CLOV

74aacd60997173485700b1069fba9c1555a4493f Short Volume Let s take a look at CLOV s short volume as a bonus since people believe there s a potential for short squeeze According to a quick Google search it is widely accepted as a fact that 10 short interest ratio is considered high while 20 short interest ratio is considered extremely high Now take a look at all three of the short volume data on popular stocks like AMC GME and then CLOV And now take a look at CLOV s stock price history chart with its volume for each trading session days what do you see It s clear to me as day that shorts are shorting in PROPORTION to the amount of volume level for each trading session day Whether that day s volume level is extremely high or not they are shorting CLOV with an average shorting ratio percentage of 23 1 which is considered EXTREMELY HIGH from 4 19 to 4 30 To further add we can see that short volume ratio is pretty much similar across all three stocks Based on that analysis I will let you be the judge on whether we have a potential for short squeeze or not amp x200B Conclusion In conclusion CLOV s share price did NOT necessarily drop on Friday because people are dumping their shares We rather saw a slight drop in CLOV s share price on Friday because of market s poor overall performance that led to an extremely low volume level This led to shorts having a field day by shorting the stock even more as the short volume ratio is consistently at around 20 But we shouldn t invest in the stock based on the short squeeze potential alone We should invest in the stock because we believe in the company and the company s management That being said with 2 days of bearish days for the overall market I hope to see a green day for the market on Monday and see CLOV bounce off from the 9 66 support Thank you for reading and I look forward to throwing a champagne party with you all once we are at the moon Tl dr Today s low volume can be explained by the overall market performance so don t worry too much about the price action today BUY and HODL and watch this four petal leaf company go off to the moon with me Disclaimer This is not a financial advice I m simply a

01 Volume 16 446 Interest 7 039 Because we were generous on the naked sell and the conservativeness lets assume that 100 of these are naked contracts all between 11 00 and 15 00 with approximately 9 970 volume of these at 11 00 11 50 12 00 Respectively that is somewhere between 997 000 and 1 644 600 naked shares This is your gamma squeeze As the strike price comes to fruition towards the

expected to hit the market this year How to get in as a dirty retailer ,tldr we can make burgers like we make beer buy ANIC for and no ouch for cow amp x200B The issues with the livestock and fishing industries have been blowing up lately we are running out of fish and livestock is one of the leading causes of climate change The question remains how do we solve the problem Some say do less eat less but I d argue that this is anathema to humanity and obviously isn t going to work fast enough We can solve this problem like everything with technology Make something better and cheaper and the majority will follow amp x200B This technology exists lab grown clean meat and has been hitting the front page of reddit and international press almost daily at this point Particularly because of the recent Netflix fishing documentary and Bill Gates letter There is currently only one way to get in on the ride as a dirty retail investor If this interests you get ready for a deep dive amp x200B I ve been keeping an eye on and researching the lab grown meat industry for the last few years waiting for them to solve a technical and moral problem that was holding it back FBS Luckily this problem has largely been solved by each lab grown meat company individually who have each finished developing their own solutions Making Lab Grown Meat officially and rebranded as Clean Meat and Cruelty Free amp

com spreadsheets d 1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc edit usp sharing Using this spreadsheet we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker Obviously past performance isn t indicative of future success but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information If you re struggling to find a given stock click on the ticker symbol on the index page it should hyperlink you straight to the table If the above link isn t working for you refer to the link below amp nbsp Spreadsheet HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL OkosPQ CJqGrmMlsxp4o edit usp sharing amp nbsp Please note that scraping and compiling this data took hours If the sheet has helped you out in any way please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials It would mean alot to me Most websites also require you to pay for this data which I think is a load of shit amp nbsp Interesting Observations and Sample Plays Below I ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance If I missed anything feel free to bring it to my attention amp nbsp First and foremost expect extra volatility this week Many of the companies who report this week are young and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their true values Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies Be wary of solar plays Enphase got fucking rocked last week due to semiconductor shortages plaguing the sector so such price action may be seen across the other solar stocks as well That being said following Enphases drop many other solar stocks had sympathy drops so these shortages may be priced in Regardless unless you ve got some insider news look to avoid them for now This is kind of a no brainer but NKLA puts will print First and foremost the company is a fraid Second of all following of ALL of it s earnings reports NKLA has gone down every single time bar one where it went up 0 You read that right 0 was the most NKLA has risen following earnings Sell credit spreads or buy puts I ve got no faith in Trevor Milton PENN Reports the day before Draftkings They usually follow very similar price movement so you can use this to your advantage If PENN puts up good numbers and goes up you can almost guarentee that DKNG will do the same thing the following day when it reports Beyond Meat MOVES Similar to Enphase last week BYND almost always craters or rockets following an earnings report Personally I would avoid this ticker but the adrenaline junkies are more than welcome to run long strangles if they re within their personal risk tolerance There s an awesome amount of money to be made here amp nbsp Obviously since I gave data on over 60 fuckin companies theres plenty that I ve missed Dive in have a look around and have some fun with it Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes and get the best risk reward possible Feel free to share your findings too I d love to see what you guys come up with amp nbsp Conclusion We ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week meaning there s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles Use the spreadsheet https docs google com spreadsheets d 1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc edit usp sharing to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio and play accordingly If enough people found these useful I ll continue making them throughout the earnings season If the sheet has helped you out in any way please consider dropping an upvote or a comment and checking out my socials it would mean a lot to me Happy Trading Everybody
