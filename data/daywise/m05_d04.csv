, Introduction In a market crazed over the newest tech IPO or the next hedge fund backed SPAC a traditional retail IPO in October of 2020 went unnoticed The company failed to reach their target IPO price closed 12 99 with target of 13 share Even more with the seemingly never ending pandemic hitting the retail sector hard there is now a track record of shorts for the company However in just two quarters the price almost tripled currently trading 30 share which brings the question Is Academy Sports amp Outdoors Nasdaq ASO already a fish in shallow waters Or are investors too macro in their evaluations therefore failing to see ASO s true values Company Overview Academy Sports amp Outdoors ASO is a US retailer in sporting goods and outdoor recreational products Headquartered Katy Texas they currently have 259 retail stores spread across 16 50 states mostly in mid east east and southeast states of US To put it simply they are Dick s Sporting Goods with good twist of Bass Pro Shop ASO provides a wide range of products from team sports goods to fishing gear to firearms What separates them from the competitors and most retail chains is that they deploy a Localized Merchandising Strategy LMS means instead of top down approach when determining what to sell Academy Sports amp Outdoors design their product mixes of each store specifically towards the needs of the local population Despite the pandemic and lockdown restrictions making a considerable impact on the retail sector especially brick amp mortar stores ASO was able to successfully transition into eCommerce via omnichannel and the BOPIS Buy Online Pick up In Store system During H12020 digital sales grew 284 They maintained top line growth rate recording 5 69B in total revenue during 2020 a 17 8 increase from FY2019 ASO profited 308 8M in net income Academy Sports amp Outdoors success during 2020 can largely be accredited to their strong and well experienced management team CEO Kenneth Hicks took over the company in 2018 with solid retail experience from Foot Locker and JC Penney He immediately began eCommerce initiatives which we now know was a brilliant move Why the Shorts If the company is seemingly doing quite well why are investors holding short positions on it What is the reason behind the 26 45 short interest and will it really impact the performance of the company or the stock Being such a young company on the market it is truly hard to say whether the shorts are based on historical trends It seems like the main driver behind the pessimistic outlook on this stock is COVID 19 and its impact on the broader retail sector as well as the leveraged capital structure of the company However with its advanced omnichannel and pre established eCommerce platforms it is quite clear ASO is not your local fishermen s shop Capital Structure amp Shareholders Breakdown A quick look at Academy Sports amp Outdoors capital structure 64 4 Debt 35 6 Equity The gt 50 leveraged capital structure does pose some form of threat to the company s well being However looking at the trend in the previous two years the total debt percentage within ASO s capital decreased 2019 was the most leveraged year from the available filings with a total of 2 7B in debt representing 73 1 of the company s total capital structure The numbers alone are definitely red flags However if you look at how the percentage decreased to 64 4 at 2B in FY2020 it is clear just how strong ASO s financials are especially their cash flow Overall while a relatively highly leveraged capital structure is not the best ASO has the cash ability to pay back the debts and interests It is likely that the company is taking on debts because 1 they want to use it to expand their operations and 2 They have a strong confidence that they would be able to pay it all back Looking at ASO s shareholders breakdown we see only 10 of individual insider investors The largest shareholder is KKR amp Co one of the world s largest private equity firms Overall a large institutional holding shows the street s confidence amp acknowledgement of the stock However do keep in mind that there is a 26 45 short interest in the market right now Looking Long Overall I believe ASO shows potential at a hold buy for long positions despite the short float in the market they did not affect prices for the first two quarters anyways The following are three main theses behind a long investment in ASO Strong financial performance With the 4 annual filings released upon the IPO there is strong growth for both top line and bottom line accounts Through FY2017 20 we see 4 15 Revenue CAGR 28 97 Operating Income CAGR 16 8 EBITDA CAGR and 51 58 Net Income CAGR As displayed higher bottom line EBITDA Net income growth rate means profit margins are increasing at a faster pace than top line revenue This shows ASO s ability to greatly reduce expenses and enhance profitability with stable revenue growth We will see the same trend later in the comparable analysis as well ASO s value amp advantages becomes more evident the further we move down the income statement In addition to strong profitability ASO is also recording very solid Cash Flow Growth Through FY2017 20 they obtained a stunning 86 62 Operating Cashflow CAGR ending FY2020 with 1B in operating cashflow This is a strong figure even in the retail sector In comparison Sportsman s Warehouse and Hibbett Sports recorded 131 6M amp 170M in unlevered free cash flow respectively in the first half of 2020 Academy Sports amp Outdoors on the other hand obtained 692M in unlevered FCF during the same period This strong cash position is what allows ASO to continuously take on debt for scaling without worrying about interest rates or over leveraging Growing revenue with increasing profit margins and a tremendous ability to increase cashflow those two aspects are the financial cornerstones of any long position investment Localized merchandising strategy Omnichannel and Everyday Value The unique LMS approach of Academy Sports amp Outdoors is also a driver of investment that it differentiates the company from its competitors While other companies have also integrated elements of LMS into their operations no one except for ASO and potentially Dick s Sporting Goods has used this at scale This strategy allows ASO to provide more personal experience to customers and it also limits unnecessary shelving and carrying costs This provides everyday value to the consumers which increases returning customers and frequency of visits The omnichannel and eCommerce operations will also become key contributors for future growth of the company based on market trends The company s smooth transition into online sales since pandemic is the result of previous preparation made in 2018 when Hicks took over as CEO Continuous developments on these platforms will further expand ASO s competitive advantage Overall LMS and omnichannel eCommerce are strong value adding aspects of ASO that will harbour the company s future success This can be seen now by the inventory turnover rate a defining ratio in the retail sector which increased from 3 0X to 3 8X through FY2019 20 Growing demand for outdoor activities with lifting lockdown restrictions The last thesis is quite a short and simple one overall growth in market demand for outdoor activities especially after pandemic lockdowns will contribute to the performance of ASO The restrictive society we have been living in for more than a year now has created strong demands for the return of sports and other activities More specifically growing interest in outdoor activities will be enhanced for a period after the lockdowns are lifted a catalyst to be discussed later From ASO s investor presentation hunting and fishing are the two biggest growers with 13 amp 9 increase in participation respectively To match the growth ASO gained 389 bps in market share from 2014 19 If this trend continuous ASO will become an even more relevant competitor in the market with higher revenue and profits Macro Market Trends Obviously the main macro market variable that is influencing ASO and the entire retail sector and the economy in general is the COVID 19 pandemic In fact as previously mentioned the lockdowns impact on the industry is a driving factor on why ASO has so many shorts in the market right now However the pandemic catalyst aside there are several trends that will contribute to ASO s performance post pandemic Expected Increase of Participation Among Post Pandemic Activities As we can see in figure 3 1 outdoor individual sports have the highest demand among post pandemic exercising options Most of survey respondents expect them to participate in more outdoor activities once the lockdowns are lifted Despite COVID 19 interests for outdoor activities have been growing for years Overall Growth in Interests for Outdoor Activities Camping is probably the most popular and therefore more representative outdoor activity As seen in Figure 3 2 the camping equipment market has seen some solid expansion from 2007 19 Although the data is not available for post 2019 years during pandemic we can expect this growth to sustain eCommerce eCommerce has been a huge revenue and margin driver in the retail sector and that includes the sporting goods industry COVID 19 has given the consumers a preview of what shopping could be like in the future which is heavily reliant on logistics and online platforms This trend will contribute to ASO as the company could be considered a market leader when it comes to online sales in the sporting goods industry Financials and Valuations When it comes to the fair valuation of Academy Sports amp Outdoors ASO I did not use an intrinsic method through building a Discounted Cash Flow model This is because since the company is so new on the market there is not enough historical data available to make the right assumptions and adjustments to the variables included in a DCF Instead I evaluated the company using a basic comparable analysis The companies included in the comparable universe are Dick s Sporting Goods DKS Hibbett Sports Inc HBB Foot Locker FL Columbia Sportswear Company COLM and Sportsman s Warehouse Holdings SPWH In the comp universe used in the fair valuation of ASO As mentioned before ASO s advantages values become more evident as we look at multiples that are further down the income statement The EV Revenue and EBITDA are mostly around the mean and median of the universe However once we get down to the EBIT and especially EPS multiples we can see ASO is significantly undervalued compared to similar companies When I converted the universe multiples into implied values at different levels averaged them out calculated the implied equity value then divided by shares outstanding we arrive at the implied price share Based on the numbers presented we can see a bullish target price for ASO is around 45 and a more moderate conservative valuation would put price around 32 33 share This means in the bullish cased there would be a 50 return on your investment based on current prices of 30 share in the more conservative situation there is an 8 9 return These prices are relatively consistent with the target prices on the street amp x200B Catalysts To finish off this analysis on ASO there are a few key catalysts to keep in mind Easing lockdown restrictions As vaccines roll out lockdowns will be lifted and in person shopping will resume This will naturally cannibalize a portion of online revenue earned throughout the pandemic however it should still contribute to total revenue of the company Much like untapping a water balloon the first few months of normal life will likely spike physical retail sales This especially affects sporting goods as sporting events will return during the same time thus highly increasing demand for related products Dick s Sporting Goods Pulling from Firearms As more unfortunate gun violence incidents happen in the US pressure for stricter gun control is not only applied to the legislative bodies but also business as well For decades Dick s Sporting Goods have been providing firearms to their customers however they have been pulling away from the market at a relatively quick pace This creates a catalyst for ASO because they are still selling firearms consistently without increasing inventory The absence of a big competitor like Dick s Sporting Goods will create opportunities for ASO in this specific market Cyclical Consumer Products Spikes in Summer Months Outdoor sporting goods are very cyclical products that mostly revolve around the spring amp summer months Therefore filings for Q2 amp Q3 will likely be very strong driving stock prices upwards This means if investors are looking to leverage this catalyst now would be a good time to invest In the End Buy Hold or Sell Overall I think Academy Sports amp Outdoors ASO is currently undervalued However since the company went public recently there is not enough data to do a full intrinsic valuation for the stock Nevertheless my final recommendation is on track with the street s opinions On WSJ 9 9 analysts rate the stock at a buy and Morningstar Equity reports gives ASO a 3 star rating buy hold based on quantitative analysis I think ASO hold great potential therefore Buy for long term value investment Hold for conservative operations Buy at lt 30 10 share for short term gains Credit to KevW0220 original post can be found here https info utradea com idea

then you re not missing much but it does loosely tie into my analysis of Academy Sports Outdoors Intro There s a chance you haven t heard of Academy Sports if you re not from the Southern United States and that s ok The business is simple Academy Sports operates as a sporting goods and outdoor recreational products retailer similarly to Dick s Sporting Goods Bass Pro Shops Cabela s and Sportsman s Warehouse In terms of business model there s not much more to it than that except for 1 key difference compared to Dick s and some other competitors Academy Sports sells guns and ammunition I ll be using some comparisons to these company s in the analysis below Notes 1 The reason I m putting this write up together today is because of recent action on behalf of the major shareholders I will go more into detail on that below 2 ASO was intially publicly offered at the beginning of October 2020 I typically stay away from IPOs in general but took a look at the company and decided to do a deeper dive Metrics 1 ROIC as of today is 12 48 This has improved year over year since 2019 the company was private before this so financial statements only go back so far and doubled from 2020 to 2021 While Sportsman s Warehouse has had double digit ROIC over the last few years as well it s more sporadic and up or down with some negative returns mixed in quarterly as well Dick s is the steadier of the 2 comparisons maintaining that 10 ROIC over the last few years GuruFocus 2 D E ratio is currently at about 71 The good news however is that because ASO exists largely in the Southern United States they did not bleed as much during the Lockdown Era Depending upon the state stores were kept open and selling while competitors had to close their doors and take on more leverage to survive This is reflected further in ASO s financial statements showing that virtually all of their existing debt is long term Their current cash position outweighs their short term debt substantially Side note their cash position has been at least doubling every year for the last 3 years 3 P E amp PEG ratios are 8 91 and 21 respectively The PEG ratio is based on Finviz s EPS Next 5 years expectations but since I m a fan of extrapolating out a shorter amount of time from the most recent data as possible a safer PEG ratio to assume is 8 91 11 05 Next year s EPS growth expectations which would be 80 instead Again this is the low end EPS growth expectations for ASO Admittedly the previous year was a great boon for outdoor and sporting goods retailers so instead if you d like to take a larger sample size of the last 5 years EPS growth it would be 8 91 32 7 or 27 PEG ratio For a quick comparison Dick s expected EPS for next year is an 8 growth and with a P E of 15 77 that yields a PEG ratio of 1 9 But I didn t need to calculate that to tell you that Dick s is largely done expanding and growing 4 Cash flow from Operations has skyrocketed over the last few years but it s important to note an anomaly A large change in payables occurred from 2020 to 2021 which significantly impacted ASO s change in working capital If removing it from the equation to help get a better understanding of their cash flow operations they still nearly tripled cash flow from continuing operations Net income from continuing operations over the last few years has grown at an incredible rate too Yahoo Finance Gross profit in general has followed a similar escalation path 5 The outside influence of the guns amp ammunition industry while not a strict mathematical metric should also be considered Academy Sports described by one of my Texas born friends is an institution Currently there is an on going ammo shortage that s affecting the industry that is expected to grow at a rate of at least 6 a year through the next 5 years Mordor Intelligence The sports gun market is growing and many competitors simply do not offer to fill that market niche So what s the catch Well I talked about the Guns I talked about the Money What about the Lawyers Academy Sports is largely owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts or KKR amp Co Inc for short As of this morning they own roughly 65 of Academy Sports making them the majority decision makers for the company I want to be clear this is both good and bad Such a large position of ownership controlling the decisions for ASO will almost always benefit KKR moreso than other shareholders On the other hand KKR invested in ASO in 2011 and have helped establish the company as a quickly growing and successful retailer The two are intertwined in a way that is mutually beneficial to each other but not as much for shareholders Fortunately this will change over time Academy Sports Outdoors announced after market on May 3rd that KKR will be issuing an additional 14 million shares of stock For context that accounts for roughly 1 3 of the current share float so this will dilute the shares fairly significantly The upside to this is two fold 1 Starting today shares should start trading a discounted enticing price 2 ASO also agreed to buyback as much as 100 million shares worth of the offering thus reducing the dilution and adding to shareholder wealth Subjective analysis I like ASO and I like its prospects It has the growth potential that Dick s no longer has their management team has helped been guided by KKR to profitability and it fills a market niche that some other competitors do not fill It s important to note that the unraveling of KKR s shares will continue to happen over time which will simultaneously frustrate shareholders but also spread ownership to a more reasonable degree across the Institutional spectrum Their new focus on ecommerce has helped strengthen their bottom line and it s already started to pay dividends without considerable store growth In a recent report management had stated that 2021 won t be a time of store openings due to the inability to properly scout locations although it was stated that 2022 should see 8 10 new openings This is the slow growth mentality that I m all for This will likely be a multi year hold for me but it could just be the next big thing in Outdoor Sports amp Recreation

link isn t working for you refer to the link below amp nbsp Spreadsheet HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc edit usp sharing amp nbsp Please note that scraping and compiling this data took hours If the sheet has helped you out in any way please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials It would mean alot to me Most websites also require you to pay for this data which I think is a load of shit amp nbsp Interesting Observations and Sample Plays Below I ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance If I missed anything feel free to bring it to my attention amp nbsp First and foremost expect extra volatility this week Many of the companies who report this week are young and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their true values Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies Be wary of solar plays Enphase got fucking rocked last week due to semiconductor shortages plaguing the sector so such price action may be seen across the other solar stocks as well That being said following Enphases drop many other solar stocks had sympathy drops so these shortages may be priced in Regardless unless you ve got some insider news look to avoid them for now This is kind of a no brainer but NKLA puts will print First and foremost the company is a fraud Second of all following of ALL of it s earnings reports NKLA has gone down every single time bar one where it went up 0 You read that right 0 was the most NKLA has risen following earnings Sell credit spreads or buy puts I ve got no faith in Trevor Milton PENN Reports the day before Draftkings They usually follow very similar price movement so you can use this to your advantage If PENN puts up good numbers and goes up you can almost guarentee that DKNG will do the same thing the following day when it reports Beyond Meat MOVES Similar to Enphase last week BYND almost always craters or rockets following an earnings report Personally I would avoid this ticker but the adrenaline junkies are more than welcome to run long strangles if they re within their personal risk tolerance There s an awesome amount of money to be made here amp nbsp Obviously since I gave data on over 60 fuckin companies theres plenty that I ve missed Dive in have a look around and have some fun with it Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes and get the best risk reward possible Feel free to share your findings too I d love to see what you guys come up with amp nbsp Conclusion We ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week meaning there s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles Use the spreadsheet https docs google com spreadsheets d 1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc edit usp sharing to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio and play accordingly If enough people found these useful I ll continue making them throughout the earnings season If the sheet has helped you out in any way please consider dropping an upvote or a comment it would mean a lot to me Happy Trading Everybody

patent applications filed daily the data is invaluable as it can give its viewer real time insight into industry trends and company R amp D investments I recently built a dashboard tracking data on patent applications and approvals One component of the dashboard which I m particularly proud of is a visualization that maps patents granted to public companies over the last 4 years based on the text contained within their abstracts Dots are colored by patent date and the map is easily filterable by a company or by keyword You can play around with the visualization here https www reddit com

patients and industries above is easily replicable and can give the viewer key insights into technological movements not yet recognized by the greater public Patent Approvals amp Share Price I was curious to see if there was a relationship between patent approvals and stock price movement For a preliminary analysis I ran simple regressions between these two variables for several tech focused industries One example is shown below I found no clear relationship between patent approvals and stock price change for Software companies in recent years Across the board I found there is very little to be gained by simply looking at a company s patent approval counts Patent approvals and share price https preview redd it wr3iycvfr4x61 png width 784 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b5909dcae4aef69121fea6dd93bebb8c45634f42 One of the possible explanations is the wide variation in each patent s value A patent that gives a defensible advantage in a quickly growing technological field is incredibly valuable while many other patents never effect a company s operations at all Another dynamic is that it can take several years for a patent holder to pursue monetization of an approved patent A company s lagged patent profile may be a better indicator of the value of their intellectual property rather than recent grants Conclusion I ll likely be doing some more analysis of patent data in coming weeks and will be sure to report back with any noteworthy findings I hope you enjoyed the write up and let me know below if you have any thoughts feedback or suggestions

impacting NIO s growth The current chip shortage will retard vehicle production and deliveries in Q2 With weekly checks on the spot price of the auto chips do not expect continued vehicle margin improvements in Q2 In fact I choreograph for a small decline in vehicle margin in Q2 contingent on the chip situation The positive tailwinds for NIO are concentrated in the second half of 2021 as the chip situation ameliorates Multiple long term partnerships including Metro AG and Sinopec infrastructure agreements and the NeoPark project will improve margins for both vehicle and subscription services NIO will likely continue to outperform luxury brands including Audi BMW and Mercedes in the Chinese market enjoying the combination of branding cost and continued EV subsidies Taken together NIO will continue its triple digit improvements in revenue and high double digit earnings growth Through this we realize that the determining factor in NIO s success is no longer a question of vehicle sales or production Following in TSLA s footsteps with the blessing of the government in swap tech and with a clear market niche in the mind of management simplifies our job considerably In fact during the earnings call William explicitly remarks that paraphrasing The NIO brand will not be for the mass market This significantly improves our valuation metrics and margin assumptions going forward Away from the mass market razor thin margin I began with Ferrari NYSE RACE as a template for long term COGS and Margin assumptions NIO isn t Ferrari it will never be I did not just copy paste margin assumptions Ferrari s COGS is stable around 47 52 of revenue SG amp A at 10 5 9 long term and R amp D at 20 My assumptions for NIO go a bit lower proxying for competitor brands like Benz BMW and Audi therefore COGS trends towards 65 60 SG amp A toward 10 9 5 and R amp D around the same The argument for COGS not being higher is management guidance for high take rates involving subscription services Management has emphasized NIO not just being a car company but also a service lifestyle company We intend to directly our gains from the margin towards better products better tech and better service This is the core issue currently at the heart of NIO and I encourage you all to discuss and find out the future It s not selling vehicles it s building swap stations Valuation short mid and long term In the short term noting NIO s presence in a highly competitive market with a past history of uncertainty we assign a Terminal EPS of 20 and a discount rate of 10 giving us a valuation of 50 85 fair price and appreciation potential of 33 96 amp x200B short term valuation 3 6 months https preview redd it 19w94w3ex5x61 png width 662 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3c0df610c6d49b517dc47e63c09ee82b192d75e0 Midterm In the midterm we expect NIO s EU expansion Swap station deals and chip issues all to be resolved Quoting Graham Dodd we disregard negative earnings as a quantitative measure of financial health and only use it as a qualitative measure of company performance NIO has made significant improvements in EPS and will likely continue to do so Altering the probability weighing of our Bull Bear and Base cases to favor strong performance in Luxury EV markets also justifies a higher Terminal EPS valuation and a lower risk At 28x terminal EPS 55 30 15 Bull Base Bear distribution and 9 5 discount rate we have a mid term appreciation potential of 95 78 amp x200B Mid term valuation 12 20 months https preview redd it kphod07fy5x61 png width 663 amp format

sprawl markets Tesla has its place in countries with similar suburban housing as the US but markets in Pan Asia and EU with poor access to personal charging options are better suited for battery swapping In the future NIO may support both Supercharging and Swap capabilities lowering downtime overall in either case NIO s unique presentation and positioning NIO houses lol will ensure strong brand stickiness and continuously improving margins from services as take rate improves Therefore with a terminal EPS multiplier of 35 and discount rate of 9 we have an appreciation potential of 151

continue to invest in Clover Health regardless of short interest or meme relevance or anything that has actually seemed to make people interested in this stock But then it doesn t surprise me that people flock to this stock for meme hype more than anything because looking into Direct Contracting for myself I realize how boring this shit can appear on the surface Especially if you aren t familiar with the language of healthcare which for the life of me is so interesting to armchair philosophize about how it got to be the way it is that I have to berate myself from tangenting on it But that s beside the point In this DD I want to focus on the forward looking plan of clover with direct contracting regardless of the Biden medicare age catalyst where it s coming from and just what the purpose of the program is in the first place I want to do it all in simple terms too I assume most of us aren t experts on this stuff although not including people dumping literally a million dollars into CLOV you whales may look down on me as the tender nemo fish that I am I ll also be including some of my own speculative opinions on it and I m using the same unnamed healthcare billing source I ve used in my past DD here https www reddit com r CLOV comments lxgdfv on clov and doubt or why i will continue buying and here https www reddit com r CLOV comments m2x9dv excoriating vivek garipalli or why i will WHY IS DIRECT CONTRACTING SIGNIFICANT So far as most of us CLOV possessed apes are aware Direct Contracting is the government program that should give Clover access to 200 000 more patients and when they got approved for Direct Contracting Vanguard bought 18 of the float https investors cloverhealth com static files 7afa14c7 a614 4017 8b29 d4fd59772317 the day of the leak However those 200 000 patients seem somewhat variable to me at least management wasn t totally clear last earnings call so I deciding to look into what it is about Direct Contracting that prompted one of the most astute investment firms to buy such a large chunk of the float In the end I believe it has to do with how the CMS incentivizes change and how Clover Health seeks to take advantage by aligning themselves with the aims of the CMS The Clover wiki here https www reddit com r CLOV wiki index is great for explaining how Clover is disrupting healthcare but I want to emphasize that the CMS is actually totally in line with this mission and it s not just CLOV spinning its wheels trying to enact disruption on its own Which is a hella good thing btw If you want to make up your own mind about all this stuff I ll link the places I m getting the info below SOURCES CMS page on Direct Contracting https innovation cms gov innovation models gpdc model https innovation cms gov innovation models gpdc model most of this DD will be summarizing this page and some of the links it provides as most probably have noticed it s tedious getting through CMS Direct Contracting Fact Sheet https www cms gov newsroom fact sheets direct contracting https www cms gov newsroom fact sheets direct contracting useful and more bite sized info on the topic A podcast I found useful https thehcbiz com 156 direct contracting overview gail zahtz https thehcbiz com 156 direct contracting overview gail zahtz Basically just talking about the force of Direct Contracting on healthcare WHAT IS DIRECT CONTRACTING Global and Professional Direct Contracting is a program created by the CMS Innovation Center as an alternative payment structure to offer risk sharing benefits to providers building on what was learned from ACO models in the past five years I believe Clover stands out because they not only will be sharing the risk but because of Clover Assistant they will be literally collaborating on the risk making them perfectly designed for MSSP and similar programs the CMS is trying to aggressively push towards against FFS Did you get that If you did no need to read further If you didn t my fellow small fish CLOVtards that is what this DD is for amp x200B Breaking It Down Let s start by clarifying some language When you see Global and Professional Direct Contracting Global and Professional are not empty or generic buzz words They denote specific things in terms of healthcare terminology Professional refers to the Doctor or the Physician The Doctor is the professional of healthcare They re the pro players getting stuff done Global I initially thought meant International IT DOES NOT DO NOT BE SMOOTH BRAIN APE LIKE ME Global refers to a payment structure that involves an insurer or Medicare paying a global rate to a specific organization for taking care of a patient This is the essence of what the CMS is doing to push past Fee for Service but it can be a little complicated so I ll give an example below Capitation Example Capitation is an example of a global AND Professional contracting structure 2 birds 1 stone baby Respect the layered density here Capitation is where medicare pays a doctor a specific monthly fee for certain patients they ve been assigned Assigned is the literal term used where each doctor is assigned responsibility for a certain group of patients by medicare or the insurer This means THE RISK OF THE PATIENT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE PHYSICIAN Why Because now the physician doesn t get reimbursed for the service costs of the patient instead they are paid each month a flat rate So if the patient s health is poorly managed and incurs a lot of extra fees The Doctor now takes a financial hit That is the essence of a global payment plan Paying a global fee from a top down perspective and allowing all the gritty details to work themselves out under a payment structure that inherently incentivizes cost saving measures and improved care This concept is being spread across multiple structures in healthcare including medicare advantage you may have noticed To clarify FFS Fee For Service is simply that the doctor provides a service and charges a fee for doing that service which the insurer or medicare normally pays at least partially Direct Contracting is the program opposed to this aggressively trying to enact risk sharing measures like capitation Although the CMS is trying to move away from FFS it s not so simple FFS is nice and reliable for doctors as it involves no risk for them They can simply provide their services and get paid for those services Side note FFS actually does incur some risk for the Doctor but that risk has been explained to me as dumbassery or rather insidiousness as what some insurance have tried to do is use bureaucratic means to avoid paying for services whenever they can This is part of the ongoing issue involving physician insurer tension which I think Clover also is poised to address very well also Back to FFS though The problem with FFS is it incentivizes quantity over quality The more services a doctor provides the more they get paid regardless of how it actually affects the patient Both CLOV wiki and the CMS DCE page explain this well What FFS peeps will tell you is they are actually well regulated and there are many preventative measures in place However these measures are extensive and legalistic making them convoluted and difficult to stay on top of But when you realize all these elaborate legalistic measures are in place because the underlying payment structure is flawed that is when you start to see why some of this stuff is so innovative and why moving away from FFS altogether is reasonable The next term to address is ACO ACO stands for Accountable Care Organization It s a global payment structure but it s not just physicians who participate An ACO can span hospitals doctor groups specialists etc And when these groups partner up with medicare or an insurance company they engage in something like MSSP which stands for Medicare Shared Savings Program I ll explain with an example The idea is this The ACO let s say it s just one hospital for simplicity is responsible for a group of patients Medicare says to the hospital last year the population you covered cost around 400 per member per month So one person costs 400 a month on average that medicare has to pay to the hospital Entering an ACO agreement Medicare or an insurer says We will pay you a flat rate of 400 a month per member and if you can get the cost below that we will split the savings So if the hospital is able to reduce costs to 390 5 goes to the hospital and 5 goes to the insurer Obviously spanning that across 10 000 patients you earned an extra 50 000 for your doctors So by taking on risk again that risk being the population could exceed the target price of 400 you were rewarded by reducing cost Clover Assistant is Perfect for This Direct contracting will build on this model And I think Clover is almost perfectly built for this Where an insurer such as United Health will engage an ACO and contract efficiently on their side to then allow a hospital to do its own thing and cut costs where it can Clover Health is actually set up to collaborate on cost saving by offering the Clover Assistant to help ensure the population is well managed and both parties can share in the savings It s absolutely a win win and it s set up so both the doctor and Clover share in the savings Think of this especially if you re a smaller doctor group You re told you have to cut costs but you re not some hospital that has the resources to track that on a grand scale and implement systematic changes How can you also participate Well Clover Assistant gathers data across a much larger group of patients tracking their data and uses machine learning to provide actionable data Now even a smaller doctor group without extensive patient data can maximize their savings and the health of their population HOW THE CMS INCENTIVIZES CHANGE This is super important in my mind and is one of the main reasons I m really bullish on CLOV in the relatively near term CMS talks a lot about how Direct Contracting allows providers to take on risk and receive rewards The rewards part is what I m most interested in Back in 2015 some doctors were still using paper for patient reports and diagnoses The CMS was like Aye that s not efficient it adds burden to the system and most of ya ll write like shit Fuck you So to incentivize doctors to use electronic medical records they said If you use electronic medical records and include a certain degree of detail we will pay 16 000 to EACH doctor who meets our requirement Now you may be unaware of this but usually doctor s want money And 16 000 is an exorbitant amount So everyone gets on board of course and starts using electronic records Now the next year comes around and this time medicare says we will still reward you for using electronic records but now only 7 500 per doctor and also the list of requirements a doctor has to fulfill gets longer Of course everyone agrees because they re already doing the majority of the requirements from last year The following year the rewards diminish and the list of requirements lengthens and now in 2021 the reward is literally 0 and everyone uses electronic health records and the system is more efficient This is what happens if you collaborate with the CMS on where they re trying to push for specific changes that benefit the system long term They reward you well especially in the beginning and as you get more efficient and the system improves those rewards get more strict Personally I think that is absolutely perfect for a growth company like Clover Health If you re trying to get off the ground with growth outside your established states the CMS is the road to that They can get you on track for growth and reward your efforts to improve the space significant especially in the beginning which is when you need it most as a growth company Because Clover is newer it can be more flexible in its alignment with the CMS while many much larger companies United Health and Humana are going to find it more difficult to shift from FFS as that is a fairly rooted position Listen to the podcast I linked in the beginning the CMS is moving swiftly and despite some outcry that they are moving too fast they continue to go ahead with their geo model which eliminates FFS altogether in select regions That is what I think will be the great underlying wave that will allow them to expand and take market share from much larger insurers Conclusion This is a changing time in healthcare and I frankly believe Clover is positioned incredibly well to take advantage of it This stock is more than just a couple of catalysts or a pump and dump And I m pretty excited about it
