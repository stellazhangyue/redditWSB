lot here so I d like to give back and hopefully add some value to this sub I think it s worth spending a little time laying out my thoughts on why I m investing in GME as an active early stage VC and hopefully my insights can help people not paperhand before the real gains are made I ll try to provide new insights that I haven t seen on this subreddit yet Full disclaimer this is my personal money I m investing Positions are 678 shares at a 39 81 average as a starter and looking to open a more significant position in the next few months once a few questions have been answered for me on things I m looking to see which I ll discuss below Obligatory rockets If a few things happen this goes to the moon regardless of a short squeeze I ll explain why below First a quick overview at how most VC s do due diligence How VC s Invest When we do due diligence on early stage investments our Fund is a pre seed and seed Fund with a few Series A deals there s a few things we look for especially when evaluating growth companies in tech are as follows 1 What s the market size There are three types of market sizes investors look at TAM SAM and SOM Feel free to look up how sizing these markets works if you aren t familiar this is a long post so I won t waste people s time The important thing to remember here is that the larger the TAM the more room for growth and competition and the more interest there is to invest in a space This is very important for GME and we will come back to why later 2 What s the CAGR Compound Annual Growth Rate Basically is the market expanding or shrinking and how fast Again google this if not familiar 3 Experience of the management team have they actually been there before and demonstrated an ability to scale and exit a company in this space 4 Unit economics do the numbers make sense as this company grows Is it actually going to be profitable Every firm looks at these different We look at CAC LTV ratios and doubling time with tech companies The TLDR of this is how much money does it cost me to get a new customer how long will they be my customer before they leave how much money will they spend while they are my customer and how fast can I double the money I spent on advertising to get that new customer There are a lot more things that obviously go into determining whether something is a good investment or not but if there are red flags in any of these core areas a tech company is almost always uninvestable Now onto why after recent developments I think GME is shaping up to be one of the most attractive investment opportunities that investors have seen in these markets in years but why many of you will miss out on the majority of the gains long term 1 and 2 Market size and CAGR As a gamer myself in spare time and a tech investor this is a market that hasn t even scratched the surface of how large it will get Gaming is a market worth hundreds of billions with an explosive CAGR as more young people grow up with gaming being a socially accepted activity and in many people s lives the center of their social experience Most of you are familiar with this already so nothing more to be said here Now the question in the past was is Gamestop capable of growing their share of this market Until Ryan Cohen the answer was no and this is why the share price went down to where it was Again you all know this But this leads to the second point of why it is now an attractive option 2 Ryan Cohen Not from an excited about a memeing CEO perspective but from the most important thing to institutional investors does he have a proven track record scaling and exiting profitable e commerce businesses Yes he does Again you all know all this and it is how the stock price got to here today Everyone is sitting waiting and watching to see if there is a short squeeze myself included and there is a lot of hype and excitement But this is leading everyone to miss the forest for the trees because of the 4th point GME s Unit Economics have the potential to be best in industry yet shares are priced at an extreme discount to revenues currently I d encourage everyone to check out this article talking about how companies with strong growth are normally priced by tech investors by one of the A16z partner https a16z com 2020 08 17 role of entry multiples in valuations https a16z com 2020 08 17 role of entry multiples in valuations The article is titled why entry multiples don t matter and helps entrepreneurs understand how valuations of companies can make sense for tech investors The short of it is for all the WSBers who can t read if you have more growth you get a higher multiple because you will have the potential to produce far more dividends faster especially in high margin tech companies So what is fascinating about GME If I was presented a new company that had just driven it s e commerce revenues 300 YoY operating in a several hundred billion TAM backed by investors and management who had grown a company in the same vertical to hundreds of millions in annual subscription revenue and with a strong balance sheet and distribution footprint and a widely recognized brand 20x topline revenue in the early stages would be considered a steal to invest at Instead GME is priced at a 2 8B market cap less than half of annual revenues This is an unheard of valuation for a growth company to be trading at a discount So why is GME underpriced and why did so many people myself included not see or continue to not see this opportunity until now If it s such a good opportunity why are shares so cheap Most investors are looking at the legacy Gamestop business that has existed for the past decade instead of treating GME like a new startup CHEWY for Gaming If Ryan Cohen can transform GME into a subscription based membership model where in exchange for your monthly fee you have a one stop shop to all things gaming discounted you have a company that could easily be valued at a 10 30x multiple on top line revenues However because most investors outside of this subreddit still view it as a traditional brick and mortar play vs a subscription focused tech company with omnichannel growth strategies they think a bubble is forming and are shorting it instead of buying in So why am I not all in yet but why am I excited The most important thing yet to be understood is what does the customer value proposition look like under the new direction Ryan Cohen takes GME Most large investors will be waiting to see how over the next year the balance sheet is strengthened for growth what new revenue models can be implemented and to see if there has been a true pivot from brick and mortar This is a company that if management can execute on correctly most large institutional investors will be clamoring to get a significant stake in and grow it because the gaming market is here to stay and grow Bear arguments that digital game sales will hurt GME miss the entire point of the pivot Ryan understands this and wants to instead bring the whole gaming experience in house everything you buy you want to buy from GME because you re part of their membership program again think Costco Those programs are insanely profitable and if the unit economics show that to investors as the company pivots the valuation will soar immediately as people realize it s Amazon Prime not Blockbuster However it is yet to be seen if they can execute on this vision which is why I am not all in yet There is still long term risk which is why this stock is still low Not a lot but there is some Maybe the company doesn t grow Maybe they reject Ryan s vision But here s the bottom line If a shift to digital first does occur and GME becomes a subscription first omnichannel gaming company the market cap will conservatively be 10x topline revenues Let s say that stays flat next year at 5B This market cap matching industry standards should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be 50B I know this sounds insane But if Ryan can complete the transformation he is hoping for this is a very conservative valuation A 50B market cap would be 800 a share right now Again this assumes Zero topline revenue growth If revenue begins to grow again 10x will be unrealistic and the multiples will get far higher This is why the short squeeze is distracting many In 5 years if you diamond hands this company the fair value of shares can range from 800 2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation TLDR this company if Ryan does what we believe he will may be one of the most undervalued companies this subreddit has ever discovered Even if you take profits in a short squeeze don t forget to keep shares for a long position because opportunities like this rarely come around I imagine the short squeeze will allow them to issue more shares to strengthen the balance sheet and the company has a fantastic launch pad to start from with the size of it s existing customer base brand awareness and revenue If it becomes clear that GME will be executing on Ryan s vision even at a 10B market cap this will be a steal and I will open a full position then I am waiting to expand my position to see what happens with the pivot as this all goes out the window if GME rejects his strategy As always due your own DD but I have learned a lot about options from this sub and hopefully this helps a few people

GMT 06 00By Connor Smith GameStop stock continues to soar amid interest from retail investors one analyst called rabid Now the stock now has the attention of a notable activist short seller Citron Research s Andrew Left wrote in a Tuesday post on Twitter that he plans to host a livestream discussing five reasons those buying GameStop ticker GME stock at recent levels are the suckers at this poker game Stock back to 20 fast he wrote We understand short interest better than you and will explain Left did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Barron s asking him to expand on his thoughts as well clarify whether he s taken a short position himself But around the time of Left s post GameStop stock pared back from a 45 52 intraday high The stock closed up 11 to 39 36 On Tuesday 74 6 million GameStop shares were traded the stock s fifth highest volume on record according to Dow Jones Market Data Last Wednesday set a record volume for the stock when 144 5 million shares were traded GameStop shares doubled last week following news that three former Chewy executives including co founder Ryan Cohen were joining the company s board Cohen s RC Ventures has a 13 stake in GameStop and has urged the company to close more stores and embrace e commerce The day of the announcement the company pulled out of a planned appearance by executives at last week s ICR investment conference A GameStop spokesman had pointed Barron s to the conference for commentary on the company s long term plans GameStop representatives haven t returned repeated requests seeking comment in the week since After the pop last week Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter pointed to the stock s massive short interest recently at 138 of shares available for trading according to FactSet data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data Short selling analytics firm S3 Partners which adjusts its short interest calculations estimated short interest of about 58 earlier this month Such bearish bets have left the stock primed for a short squeeze a short term event where short sellers bid up shares rushing to cover their positions Pachter said such short sellers were squeezed by rabid retail investors He didn t think the pop would last and has a 16 price target on the stock Left s post signaled he ll discuss the technical factors related to short selling at play during his stream set for 11 30 a m on Wednesday In recent weeks Barron s has outlined a long term bearish case The company is struggling amid broader shifts to free to play games and digital downloads both of which cut out physical game sales Despite new consoles from Sony SNE and Microsoft MSFT that were forecast to drive stronger sales in the broader games industry GameStop said last week its sales were down 3 1 from last year during the nine week holiday period The company pointed to store closures limited console supply and the impact of Covid 19 But comparable sales which strip out the effect of store closures were only up 4 8 from a rough 2019 holiday period Many of the most popular games like League of Legends and Fortnite are free to download and play Instead publishers offer in game cosmetic items directly in their online store For those games GameStop is often limited to acting as a middleman selling gift cards for in game points And as more players opt to download games directly on their consoles it s the gatekeepers of such systems Sony Nintendo NTDOY and Microsoft that stand to benefit Meanwhile PC game distribution is a crowded space Valve s popular Steam online store is facing some competition from platforms offered by Fortnite maker Epic Games CD Projekt CDR Poland and Electronic Arts EA It s unclear how an old school retailer like GameStop can make sustainable headway in this already competitive landscape Amazon com AMZN and Google parent Alphabet GOOGL are also leveraging their cloud infrastructure to offer cloud gaming streaming services akin to Netflix Adoption hasn t yet been disruptive to the broader industry Microsoft another major cloud player and Sony have such services that are backed by their libraries of in house content GameStop has a profit sharing deal with Microsoft for its Xbox Game Pass but Credit Suisse analyst Seth Sigman noted at the time that he was skeptical that such a deal would offset the decline of physical game sales Add it all up and it s clear GameStop will need to execute a radical turnaround plan to stay relevant Write to Connor Smith at connor smith barrons com mailto connor smith barrons com END Dow Jones Newswires January 19 2021

investment advice and only serves to provides commentary on of the financial markets and a mosaic theory on what is happening and what will come with respect to GME Pre amble For those that did not read my earlier post a link is below it provides most of underlying commentary on what has been going on with GME with this post filling in some additional details It s unfortunately a long read and for most of you that attended the The Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Can t Read Good and Who Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too I wish you the best of luck assuming you failed out Legacy of WSB GME Short Squeeze https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kzftk2 legacy of wsb gme short squeeze Unfortunately for Jim Cramer Jimbo I didn t bring him up in previous post because I admire him or watch his show It s because the man himself is going to help describe what happened today with GME Cue up the video or a read the transcript below I honestly find Jimbo annoying as fuck and I don t want to force and of you actually listen or look at him Video https www youtube com watch v gMShFx5rThI Transcript https slate com culture 2007 03 will cramer s crazy confession destroy his career html Before I actually get into some of Jimbo s self admitted tricks of the trade and how they are being applied to GME I need tell you a quick story about a lovely little real estate holding company called Global Links traded over the counter and an investor by the name of Robert Simpson Simpson s win was so big he was interviewed on Bloomberg News on 14Mar2007 along with the CEO of Overstock com remember that company from my last post that hit 669 days on the Threshold Security List Well Simpson s big trade was spending 5 000 to acquire 100 of the company he actually acquired 111 or 1 282 050 shares the really cool part of this trade was that despite owning over 100 of the company the trading volume over the next 2 days was 50 million shares Transcript Phantom Shares Failed Trades and Naked Shorts https www sec gov comments s7 08 08 s70808 145 htm The only other quick primer you folks need to digest the below is a quick understanding of market manipulation As per the ever so useless folks at the SEC directly from their website market manipulation is when someone artificially affects the supply or demand for a security for example causing stock prices to rise or to fall dramatically Market manipulation may involve techniques including Spreading false or misleading information about a company Engaging in a series of transactions to make a security appear more actively traded and Rigging quotes prices or trades to make it look like there is more or less demand for a security than is the case Market Manipulation Again a big thanks to the Eight Pound Six Ounce Newborn Baby Jimbo don t even know a word yet reference to Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby because it pains me to think of that bald 65 year asshole Let s review the Institutional short s toolkit and then figure out what is going on with our beloved Gamestop 1 Flooding the offer side of the board Any of you folks with level 2 data seen those fun price walls 2 Short Down Ladder Short A will open a new short position and sell a share at 40 and short B will buy that share to cover an existing position and the open a new short at 39 and so on 3 Media Assault I am sure we have all seen the fun tweet from Citron today and all desperately tried to get out of our positions Any of you read business articles are immediately scroll to bottom to see if there a disclaimer noting

worse https www wired com 2007 12 confessions of 2 https www wired com 2007 12 confessions of 2 Trading Day in Review What everyone needs to consider is that despite the shorts sparing no expense the share price is still going up and the shorts are getting deeper and deeper under water every day and will only become more and more desperate Their backs are against the wall and they need to fight to the death to survive Closing out positions would result in long drawn out Tesla Style squeeze and would still likely result in the bankruptcy of these funds Their only chance pushing GME into bankruptcy very unlikely with Cohen and Co taking over the board What some of you are starting to clue into and discuss openly is the visibility of market manipulation I don t really care what Citron will say tomorrow but if there is a Q amp A someone really should ask how the short s can postpone the close off requirements on Threshold Securities near indefinitely or when they try and describe short interest maybe ask their thoughts about the legality of front running trades One of the sparsest sections of my original post was on the short interest I don t have access to the Ortex data and I will rely on others posts for this data Remember Robert Simpson from the pre amble who acquired 100 of the shares in Global Links and yet had his shares traded 50 times over the next 2 days SEC enforcement has historically been extremely weak and the actual short interest could be much higher then what is reported Normal market price discover is simple economics the price is established based on where supply and demand meet More buying pressure the price goes up and more selling pressure the price goes down All things being equal how many people increased their positions on the dips today How many sold How many were forced to sell some of your position after your margin was pulled The market price action is that the currently described by the below historical volume daily high and daily low can be viewed at https finance yahoo com quote GME history https finance yahoo com quote GME history a The current float is small and shrinking Retail is going long and we want to keep buying and I want to retire in the coming weeks Please sir may I have some more b Volume is unreasonably high every share in the company has turned over 5x in the last 4 trading sessions If you did deeper into timing short attacks you will learn that doing it upon earnings press releases or news announcements helps to mask the associated volume increase If you refer to my original post you will know that shorting a stock creates a synthetic share if they Shorts try a hastily exit the price will quickly start jumping up c Volatility is increasing If you look at the daily history what do you notice about the range between the high and low Citron announced a webinar tomorrow on how to remove the shit stains from their dress pants Hint it involves depressing the GME stock price so they can stop defecating in risk management meetings Volatility will only continue to get worse and its all due to the actual float Shrinking The Cake is a Lie Portal reference If retail investors maintain demand and don t get disheartened volume will continue to contract and the shorts are going to dig themselves into a deeper and deep hole until they are no longer solvent This is exciting I am Jacked to the Tits as we are going to witness the biggest redistribution of wealth in our lifetimes Thanks again for the your assistance explaining what is wrong with the markets Jimbo I am still hoping there is a journalist with some integrity that might push out the real story on the GME play Minimum price target of 1 000 stands because fuck you Jimbo you friends dug themselves into a hole that they cant mathematically get out of without material market manipulation Fuck you Pay Me

Well here s a fairly precise not too technical guide as to who the fuck these roaches are so that the average retard on r wsb with IQ in the ve range can understand Listen english isn t my first or my second language i tried my best suck it up if it ain t good enough Citron Research is a shady as fuck stock commentary website operated by Mr Andrew Left Now a bit on this autist In short Andrew s a in long he s a self proclaimed activist short seller He was married to Ms Andrea Left her username checked out His internet newsletter has been running for 17 years now and apparently has 50 cases in the company s favor since 2001 do the math and you find out that he can fuckin time travel Now there s a lot of stock commentary websites newsletters tv shows and podcasts Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy Well dear autists the self proclaimed activist we re talking about here who sees himself as a messiah against corporate fraud and market manipulation is reported by NYTimes as follows He can make a killing in a bear market while everyone else on Wall Street suffers His methods of investment are rather questionable and has come under much of the financial world s scrutiny Now fellow autists this part is very important This is his strategy Reported by NYTimes once again After he places a bet against the price of a stock he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company s value often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse This is entirely legal as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries Keep in mind we are talking about a man that shorted Tesla stock in 2018 and got mad when it didn t go his way So mad that he sued Tesla and Papa Elon for stock manipulation Source https www cnbc com 2018 09 06 short seller andrew left files class action lawsuit against tesla and elon musk html SERIOUSLY THIS DUDE FUCKING SHORTED TESLA AT 177 ITS AT 844 20 TODAY If this wasn t enough wait to hear the companies in his ambitious track record Since all of you lack basic correlation skills to connect the dots let me do it for you fucking losers What is he doing with GME Are we not seeing the same pattern here He is publicly short on GME and is tweeting it He is known for this kind of manipulation When he noticed the price had crossed the 43 wall he made it public that he is short GME He could ve scheduled the meeting immediately but no He scheduled it a day later now this is perfect for the because he is literally buying time Buying time when alot of GME holders are in with their life savings on r wsb 24 HOURS IS ENOUGH TIME TO SOW THE SEEDS OF DOUBT AND CAUSE PARANOIA TO PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIFE ON LINE BUT WHAT ARE WE GONA DO WE ARE GOING TO FUCKING HOLD TO MARS Diamond hand the fuck out of this stock autists NOW Is the time SCANDAL 1 Here s a notable event on this aucstivist In 2016 this was banned from the Hong Kong stock market for 5 years over a 2012 report on the firm China Evergrande Group as a result of releasing a report containing false and or misleading claims about the above mentioned company Forced to pay a little over 720 000 as fines on the profits and legal expenses He s on his last string in HK after his warning he could end up in jail for violating once again Source https www scmp com business article 2038381 hong kong bans short seller andrew left market five years SCANDAL 2 This guy is what he swore to destroy at this point wait till you read this Jumia Technologies JMIA NYSE is an online e commerce platform founded out of Nigeria in 2012 They gained a fair amount of traction and went public in Apr 2019 It was received very well and rose from around 25 at opening to 41 within a matter of a few weeks Everything was well until Shitron Research adopted a short position and saw nothing of its potentials The report came in accusing Jumia of fraud torpedo ing the company downwards It dropped till approx 2 80 BUT GUESS WHAT SURPRISE SHITRON AND ANDICKREW said they re LONG ON THE STOCK AND THERE S NO WAY THEY RE SHORTING AGAIN This man capitalized on the drop of an e commerce startup out of Nigeria and is now currently benefitting from the uprise JMIA sits at 45 56 as of now Source https www theafricareport com 45712 jumia short seller andrew left changes his mind now buying the shares Now these are just 2 scandals that I pointed out because no one on r wsb seems to be aware of this Now i m pretty sure if you ve been active on the sub you ve seen the COLOSSAL failures this company has made I ll attach it right here JUST GO AND SEE THIS ITS IMPORTANT TO GET A PROPER VIEW https imgur com a QvKVC9V Apart from this another IMPORTANT info would be that the live stream where he claimed he is going to expose the top 5 reasons why he s GME short right now would PROBABLY be live on his TWITTER CitronResearch Hope to see everyone there and I CANNOT WAIT TO PROVE this self proclaimed activist WRONG NOW RETARDS KEEP READING BECAUSE this is not possible without everyone holding tight and buying more We will be hit badly again the boomer investors cannot take Citron s cock out of their mouths so we expect a sell off DO NOT GIVE THE BEARS A CHANCE TO BUY Today could even be a red day BUT FEAR NOT We will hopefully emerge victorious I AM SO PROUD OF EVERY LAST AUTIST ON HERE TL DR Citron s been doing this for a long time The stocks they short do go down only because boomer investors suck

biotech company focused on discovering developing and delivering new innovative medicine for rare diseases Their CEO is John Crowley a Harvard MBA amp Naval Academy grad with a mission to help kids around the world You know he has the right work ethic and more importantly the right motivation to see this through because his own kid suffers from one of the rare diseases he is looking to treat in the near future Pompe disease Their current revenue generating star is a drug called Galafold a pill meant to treat a rare disease called Fabry disease This disease affects approximately 1 in 40000

read through because this is a potentially undiscovered gem that is about to rock the world of rare diseases and quite literally do God s work in helping kids around the world Pompe disease Amicus is currently on track to publish results from the Phase 3 clinical trial of their Pompe disease treatment within the next weeks as their study concludes this month https www clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT03729362 term NCT03729362 amp draw 2 amp rank 1 This drug trial has previously been fast tracked by the FDA https ir amicusrx com news releases news release details us fda grants breakthrough therapy designation btd amicus gaa and the drug AT GAA https pompediseasenews com atb200 at2221 has been given the BTD Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the agency which is one of the most promising votes of confidence from the country s leading healthy agency Currently estimates show there are up to 12 000 patients suffering from Pompe disease worldwide and the current treatment cost for Pompe is 300000 yes you read that right with a drug offered by another bio company called BioMarin If approved Amicus AT GAA drug will be the most efficient treatment method for Pompe in the US and potentially worldwide Now I have no idea of how they might be pricing this novel drug however even if they undercut their competitors by 50 which is really unheard of that puts the cost for the treatment at 150000 meaning an initial potential revenue of 1 8 billion worldwide not counting the newly added cases of Pompe in the population yearly The company has recently initiated a rolling FDA submission https pompediseasenews com 2020 12 02 amicus begins rolling fda submission of late onset pompe disease lopd therapy at gaa seeking US approval for their drug meaning that they will start submitting important parts of their application as they go rather than submitting the entire application at once What this means for you my dear autist is that good news will start trickling in as early as next month gently rolling upwards into a phallic crescendo of green colors aimed for interstellar space by the end of this year Batten disease Amicus is in their Phase 2 trial https clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT02725580 for this treatment scheduled for completion in November this year What s important to know here is that the incidence rate for this disease varies around the world and from my research I can estimate it on the lower end of that variation to 1 in 100000 people Their treatment for Batten disease is a gene therapy treatment and what s even MORE important to know here is that a similar gene therapy treatment is known to cost more than 2 million https battendiseasenews com 2019 12 10 gene therapy takes center stage at 2019 nord summit Yes you also read that fucking right With about 1300 people being born with this disease every year that means a potential revenue of 2 6 billion Now of course not everyone in every country will afford this depending on their medical insurance coverage but still that s an insane amount of money And the paramount factor here is that this is a fucking terrible disease with devastating effects on the sick patients and on their families We re all lucky to have these people working on fixing it There are about 6000 rare diseases affecting people around the world and Amicus is destined to be a spearhead company

tailwinds this booming segment of stock market traders has reshaped market behavior As a result forums for financial discussion and inspiration have exploded in growth as well WallStreetBets r WSB is one of the most popular with over 1 65m followers as of January 15 2020 Quiver Quantitative has been scraping discussion on WallStreetBets for several months and tracking how often different tickers are mentioned every day The graph below visualizes yesterday s discussion on the forum Size represents the number of times a ticker has been mentioned whereas color brightness represents the

N8SrW5JbHnD7dC07g3gn51 A quick look at the above graph shows that many of the companies listed have experienced parabolic stock growth and volatility over the last several months This begs the question Has r WSB discussion been a leading indicator for stock performance To test this question we backtested a simple strategy that buys and holds the 5 stocks that were most discussed on WallStreetBets in the previous week We ran this backtest using data from 2020 The graph below shows the portfolio holdings by week click for full size image Tesla Apple AMD Nio and Microsoft were among the stocks that most frequently cracked the weekly top five most mentioned tickers Over the last year this simple strategy was up over 61 with especially strong returns in the last quarter of 2020 The WallStreetBets Portfolio was more volatile than the S amp P 500 but outperformed even during the downturn at the start of the year To take a look at the relationship between WallStreetBets discussion and market activity at a stock level we ve picked 4 stocks that were among the most popular on r WSB in the last 120 days and examined them to determine if there is a correlation between r WSB discussion and share price and volume Palantir Technologies Inc NASDAQ PLTR Big data analytics company Palantir Technologies Inc had its highly anticipated IPO on September 30 2020 trading at 8 20 Shortly after on October 14 the discussion volume of PLTR tripled to nine counts as well as achieving a 4 65 gain on the day r WSB count and share price activity continue to share a positive correlation coefficient of 0 592 as the stock reached a 52 week high of 33 05 on November 27 2020 Note A value of greater than 0 7 is considered a strong correlation Anything between 0 5 and 0 7 is a moderate correlation and anything less than 0 4 is considered a weak or no correlation r WSB counts and PLTR volume for the same dates recorded a correlation coefficient of 0 803 This could indicate a large amount of individual investor interest driving the recent valuation of Palantir which features a low proportion of institutional ownership at 14 41 3Q20 compared to the industry average PLTR received three downgrades from investment banks between October and December 2020 but added a price target increase to 30 00 from 18 00 by Jeffries on January 11 2021 well above its current price of 25 64 Risks still linger as 2Q20 to 3Q20 EBITDA losses increased by 83 to an 848 1m loss and as of now positive investor sentiment continues to support an uptrend GameStop Corp NYSE GME GameStop Corp has experienced financial stress in recent years as the retail trends which had worked in its favor continue to decline globally Total Liabilities climbed 12 18 to 2 26bn from 2Q20 to 3Q20 Before May 5 2020 r WSB activity on GME had been dormant averaging 3 83 counts daily YTD Shortly following this several threads on r WSB began to speculate on a GME recovery due to increased gaming activity and a large existing short position of 57 million shares at the time r WSB counts would be amplified after an investment from activist investor and founder of Chewy NYSE CHWY Ryan Cohen Since May 5 2020 GME has rallied 755 33 and r WSB discussion counts averaged 55 34 a day making a positive correlation coefficient at 0 688 The r WSB counts and stock volume also shared a correlation coefficient of 0 628 This was exemplified on November 30 2020 when stock volume spiked by 31 3m and discussion counts followed suit at 227 for the day The mainly optimistic speculation of a GME recovery in May on r WSB contrasted with most major media outlets at the time which appeared to focus on store closures due to the COVID 19 outbreak The rally and enthusiasm behind GME since that time was in stark contrast to many other corporations 630 of which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 marking a 10 year high Advanced Micro Devices Inc NYSE AMD On January 4 2021 Advanced Micro Devices surpassed long time competitor Intel in 1Q21 in desktop CPU sales and additionally had record revenue of 2 8bn in 3Q20 representing 164 of growth from the same period five years ago These factors have been reflected in its valuation as the stock hit a 52 week high of 99 23 on January 11 2021 When we look at the r WSB discussion counts and compare them to the share price we encounter a unique occurrence When evaluating these figures from August 8 2018 to the present the correlation is 0 187 however when we look at just the past 100 days the same metric it s 0 238 The graphs and table below illustrate how in almost three months share price correlation slumped while price continued increasing In further analysis the r WSB discussion counts for the past 100 days averaged 29 6 higher than the previous 400 day previous average of just 20 7 Nevertheless the correlation with the share price declined This occurred because once a stock reached a high enough market valuation the influence r WSJ has on its price is reduced because it is weighted more Visualized in the graph the volume can be seen maintaining similar levels to the previous period The dip in overall volume can be deceptive due to the share price increasing substantially climbing 1 600 in a rally over the past year as of January 11 2021 NIO Limited NYSE NIO To substantiate the previous claim regarding AMD we tested this on several other companies with similar scenarios to it statically one notable company being Chinese auto manufacture NIO Limited NYSE NIO The table shows how as the company grows in valuation correlation declines To further illustrate the theory the graph below depicts how r WSB count begins to deviate stock price growth on September 20 2020 and again on November 30 2020 Summary There is no universal method of finding actionable insights when analyzing r WSB but discussion on the forum can serve as a useful estimation of retail interest Companies that have had exponential growth with help from forums such as r WSBs are more likely to become transition to an organic growth phase with more institutional investors and less volume Keeping an eye on rising companies on r WSBs could help identify an opportunity that many may have overlooked

market surged by 4 7 to a record 19 6 Spurred by zero commission trading and COVID tailwinds this booming segment of stock market traders has reshaped market behavior I ve been scraping discussion on

discussion and market activity at a stock level I ve picked a couple stocks that were among the most popular on WSB in the last 120 days and examined them to determine if there is a correlation between WSB discussion and share price and volume Palantir Technologies Inc NASDAQ PLTR Big data analytics company Palantir Technologies Inc had its highly anticipated IPO on September 30 2020 trading at 8 20 Shortly after on October 14 the discussion volume of PLTR tripled to nine counts as well as achieving a 4 65 gain on the day WSB count and share price activity continue to share a positive correlation coefficient of 0 592 as the stock reached a 52 week high of 33 05 on November 27 2020 Note A value of greater than 0 7 is considered a strong correlation Anything between 0 5 and 0 7 is a moderate correlation and anything less than 0 4 is considered a weak or no correlation amp x200B Palantir Price vs WSB https preview redd it f8p41x1jkic61 png width 1122 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 2090f0fba5f9ee39cf7f3ed21932d31d6a0e1264 WSB counts and PLTR volume for the same dates recorded a correlation coefficient of 0 803 This could indicate a large amount of individual investor interest driving the recent valuation of Palantir which features a low proportion of institutional ownership at 14 41 3Q20 compared to the industry average amp x200B Palantir Volume vs WSB https

December 2020 but added a price target increase to 30 00 from 18 00 by Jeffries on January 11 2021 well above its current price of 25 64 Risks still linger as 2Q20 to 3Q20 EBITDA losses increased by 83 to an 848 1m loss and as of now positive investor sentiment continues to support an uptrend GameStop Corp NYSE GME GameStop Corp has experienced financial stress in recent years as the retail trends which had worked in its favor continue to decline globally Total Liabilities climbed 12 18 to 2 26B from 2Q20 to 3Q20 Before May 5 2020 WSB activity on GME had been dormant averaging 3 83 counts daily YTD Shortly following this several threads on WSB began to speculate on a GME recovery due to increased gaming activity and a large existing short position of 57 million shares at the time WSB counts would be amplified after an investment from activist investor and founder of Chewy NYSE CHWY Ryan Cohen Since May 5 2020 GME has rallied 755 33 and WSB discussion counts averaged 55 34

discussion counts followed suit at 227 for the day amp x200B GME Volume vs WSB https preview redd it 3d3xn8dokic61 png width 1356 amp format png amp auto webp amp s af618e9f2ea29d71d69d86dc1884a44ec42bbf24 The mainly optimistic speculation of a GME recovery in May on WSB contrasted with most major media outlets at the time which appeared to focus on store closures due to the COVID 19 outbreak The rally and enthusiasm behind GME since that time was in stark contrast to many other corporations 630 of which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 marking a 10 year high Summary There is no universal method of finding actionable insights when analyzing WSB but discussion on the forum can serve as a useful estimation of retail interest Companies that have had exponential growth with help from forums such as WSB are more likely to become transition to an organic growth phase with more institutional investors and less volume Keeping an eye on rising companies on WSB could help identify an opportunity that many may have overlooked

out of its wedge between 20 30 I wanted to showcase a company with some very strong near term catalyst coming Vista Outdoor is the largest ammo maker in America with the acquisition of Remington s ammunition As some of you know ammo prices have gone exponential over the past year with ammo prices going up 2 3x in some cases and continuing to climb high Currently about 60 of VSTOs revenue is driven by ammunition they own Federal American Eagle Remington acquired in Nov and Speer VSTO currently has about 40 of the entire US ammunition market Of the other major players Hornady is private and Winchester is a smaller business segment of Olin amp x200B https preview redd it sjw0cwkg8fc61 png width 831 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 477744759d8941e9b2b1b693ec0c800ef0af24fb So why does this matter VSO share price had been falling since 2016 because of the Trump win in 2016 as a result pricing on ammo and firearms dropped significantly from 2017 2019 This all changed with Covid 19 and the election of Joe Biden While there is no data on firearms sales due to prohibition on a national registry for firearms background checks serves as a good correlation for the number of guns sold as the majority of gun sales go through a background check The number is up 60 YOY in 2020 from 2019 The FBI completed 39 7 million background checks in 2020 this means at least 40 million guns were sold in 2020 it could be higher as you could buy two guns with one background check https preview redd it c1izzcvkafc61 png width 720 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 69ef284674000d6b7a477e1fdc11c69e6847f0c0 This has led to unprecedented demand for ammo Ammo demand increased by 150 alone just in H1 2020 https www nssf org first time gun buyers grow to nearly 5 million in 2020 hilite 27139 27 2C 27percent 27 2C 27ammunition 27 https www nssf org first time gun buyers grow to nearly 5 million in 2020 hilite 27139 27 2C 27percent 27 2C 27ammunition 27 Due to massive shortages ammo prices have literally been shooting up to the moon For example quality hallow point 9mm ammo could be had for about USD0 35 round back in late 2019 https www sgammo com catalog pistol ammo sale 9mm luger ammo https www sgammo com catalog pistol ammo sale 9mm luger ammo today the same ammo costs upwards of USD1 4 round today up nearly 4x in a year Manufacturers are facing unprecedented backorders VSTO has mentioned in earning calls that they have USD1 billion in backorder for ammunition which would take 3 4 years to fill even if demand falls back to pre covid levels This means simply insane growth and margins that will come through over the next several years Now we get to valuations the company is sitting on around 2 1 2 3 billion in normalized sales about 60 from ammo growing at 30 on a YoY basis which is still lagging because the Remington acquisition took place in November Net Income for the company was USD60 million in the Sep quarter and is expected to be a blow out in the Dec quarter I am expecting somewhere around 80 100 million If current trends hold for the next 4 quarters the company will deliver around 400 500 million of Net Income The company currently has a market cap of USD1 6 billion which would give it a forward PE of 3x During the Obama years the stock was trading at 11x PE and that was before you added about 8 million new gun owners with more expected in the next 12 months This stock will easily be in the 40 50 in the next few months and 60 70 in a year and the Q4 earnings in Feb 4 will be a key catalyst Now lets talk about risks People are obviously worried that there could be a ban on the sale of ammo This would be shot down pretty quick by Scotus I invite you to read Jackson v City of SF from the 9th Circuit Court one of the least second amendment friendly lower courts https casetext com case jackson v city of sf https casetext com case jackson v city of sf The Second Amendment protects arms weapons and firearms it does not explicitly protect ammunition Nevertheless without bullets the right to bear arms would be meaningless A regulation eliminating a person s ability to obtain or use ammunition could thereby make it impossible to use firearms for their core purpose Cf Heller holding that the District s requirement as applied to respondent s handgun that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self defense and is hence unconstitutional Thus the right to possess firearms for protection implies a corresponding right to obtain the bullets necessary to use them Cf Ezell holding that the right to possess firearms implied a corresponding right to have access to firing ranges in order to train to be proficient with such firearms As you can see unless the democrats somehow stack SCOTUS and overturn Heller ammunition is protected under the second amendment and will continue to be sold for the foreseeable future Moreso there are likely over 400 million firearms in America that is a lot of ammunition which is a consumable which will likely be bought in the coming years for those firearms Call Option on Chaos Alternative to the VIX So again you guys are all convinced you ll make 10x from calls on GME PLTR and BB so why bother with this stuff that s maybe a 2 4x Well we are all in the game of robots and momentum retail circle jerking each other TSLA and NIO and we are hoping Palantir and squeezing shorts GME this big bubble could come to a horrendous end if we start seeing real violence showing up in the streets Yes the right winged militias and antifa are just punching each other right now marching around with rifles and plate carriers and largely LARPING but it doesn t take much for things to escalate There are lots of Trump voters who feel like the election is stolen and the body politics is getting more and more polarized If a black swan event were to happen expect ammo price to simply go even more vertical The real political VIX is in the price of ammo and the largest maker of ammo is VSTO I had been trying to come up with a way to find VIX proxies as rolling OTM VIX calls has a massive carry cost I think VSTO is essentially a low carry free VIX call right now which allows you to take on more risks with other parts of your portfolio TLDR start

fueling rocket , Hello beginner friends TL DR at the bottom With an all time high Google trend rating set this week it s obvious GME has garnered the attention of basically all of Reddit getting placed on the frontpage and r all amp x200B https preview redd it 8vlh55bfojc61 png width 2043 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 84ae660961df97c71c7243924f8ad5d9753b1f33 It s quite clear to me and probably everyone here beforehand that this is really starting to pick up steam outside r wallstreetbets Most of you longer holders probably roll your eyes at the ever increasing autistic and retarded comments and questions appearing in the daily thread like gt i just bought at 44 when 2 sell gt gt gonna take out 10k margin to buy gt gt omg i bought at the high and now its 36 im gonna selll gt gt too late to buy Oh boy Let s go through a beginners Q amp A WTF IS HAPPENING IM FROM r ALL PLS HELP I WANT MONEYYYYY I could fill up this entire thread with a long answer but is here is VERY MAJORLY dumbed down version for retards to understand Gamestop GME is hated by big money companies companies want GME to die Investors say n o GME has solid foundation big money investors continue to buy stock GME catches on r wallstreetbets as a meme stock r wallstreetbets realize that GME is no meme stock at all Ryan Cohen https en wikipedia org wiki Ryan Cohen founder of multi billionaire company Chewy https en wikipedia org wiki Chewy company INVESTS HEAVILY into GME then becomes a fucking BOARD MEMBER and brings his buddies in to save GME from dying everyone on r wallstreetbets has week long erections and continues to pour money into GME up to this day So a lot of people have been buying and HOLDING GME stock in hopes of the company s future prospects and or a SHORT SQUEEZE what is a short squeeze https www youtube com watch v FMRyWZ6CXqM TOO LATE 2 BUY Absolutely not regardless if you re short term few days weeks or long term few months years it is looking like a pretty good time to jump in OMG IT DROPPED 4 I HAVE TO SELL Stop If you re SPENDING MONEY on GME you should understand it WILL HAVE BIG FLUCTUATIONS If you re the type of person to write this comment please educate yourself and read this excellent analysis on the GME stock itself https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kz7ygv gme dd one dd to rule them one dd to find them tldr dont sell holy shit u fucking retard just hold and you have the potential of selling at ludicrous prices later IM GONNA TAKE OUT ROBINHOOD MARGIN TO BUY MORE HUEHUEHU IM GREEDY AF Shorters big bad companies can borrow your margin stock to dig themselves out of the real bad hole they re in If you buy with cash they cannot You are literally working against yourself and the entire community if you buy stocks on margin WHEN IS SHORT SQUEEZE HOW DO I TIME IT PRICE TARGET Nobody knows for sure All we know companies that are shorting GME stock are losing b i g m o n e y as GME stock continues to stay this high and they ll thwart and prevent it as best as they can before they eventually give in Historically big short squeezes last anywhere from a full day to a full week Please refer to the VW Squeeze https moxreports com vw infinity squeeze and or the TSLA Squeeze https cdn discordapp com attachments 147768239357820929 801235457153302599 bbfbe8f8d0 png These things don t happen within a few minutes people you have time Price targets in the short term are very tricky to pin down Here s a very well done analysis https www gmedd com wp content uploads 2021 01 GMEdd GameStopValuation 20Jan21 pdf of potential LONG TERM estimates by our friend u Uberkikz11 As for short term squeeze price target Most of the retard sentiment here is hoping for a squeeze anywhere from 300 to 1000 again very hard to pin down amp x200B Alright now that you re caught up to speed let s go through some COMMON MISCONEPTIONS ABOUT GME Gamestop has added 6k new jobs up for listing Debunked https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l00o7e gamestop posts thousands of new jobs gjqy92q utm source reddit amp utm medium web2x amp context 3 HOWEVER they are adding a few particular jobs that weren t there before https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments komelh gme careers as a reflection of their roadmap meaning while they aren t hiring 7k new people they re adding positions that make this new transformation that much more sexy WE CONTROL THE MARKET Yeah WSB is definitely quite a sizeable chunk and probably owns just under 10 of GME shares now https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments k6jjm3 wsb owns 58 of gme gme survey update but you have to remember there is big money involved GME is owned by a lot of institutions that have way more power than WSB does https www nasdaq com market activity stocks gme institutional holdings I know I know autist together stronk but let s not too ahead of ourselves and pretend we can make GME blast off on a moments notice We DO have power just stop being mega autistic about it GME GONNA HIT 1000 LIKE VOLKSWAGEN AND ITS GONNA HAPPEN TOMORROW You know I was leaning towards GME squeezing VW esque for a fair bit as well although I was skeptical https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kyn0nz should you buy gme shortsqueezes and the However I m really convinced this is going to take a fair bit more time weeks to months for anything resembling a squeeze With more data coming in GME really does seem like it s being set up for a TSLA esque squeeze https cdn discordapp com attachments 147768239357820929 801235457153302599 bbfbe8f8d0 png and hell tbh I m hoping that it does do that instead I mean look at that shit SET LIMIT ORDERS OR DON T Tons of speculation on whether if setting limit high limit orders 420 69 694 20 actually makes it so your broker can lower that shit and kind of forcibly sell your stock I don t know about you but personally I m watching this shit constantly so I m not setting limits at all but I m actually not too sure which advice is good to follow maybe it depends on the broker as well Will edit please correct me if you have the answer amp x200B amp x200B Thank you beginner for reading this far however your work may not be over You could YOLO your life savings or I HIGHLY SUGGEST you could continue reading up on the DD Analysis done here on r wallstreetbets I know reddit search is retarded so here is a

sub we ve been causing more gamma squeeze events on stocks GME last week BB Monday Gamma is an option term What it means in this context is the amount of stock someone short the options would need to buy or sell to hedge their position as price moves For WSB popular stocks I believe that about 2 3 3 4 of all options were sold by dealers to you degenerates which means that the dealer is now short gamma which is not a superhero movie involving dwarves That means that as prices move dealers have to madly buy or sell stocks in the direction of the price movement so as not to lose money because option dealers market makers ALWAYS win almost This means that in some situations moving over a gamma ramp price where there s a lot of gamma may be many times easier than in areas without a lot of gamma This in turn makes a gamma squeeze where dealers are forced to buy or sell stock so as to not lose money similar to short squeeze which is when shorts are forced to buy causing yet more buying so as to not lose more money In most cases gamma is not a meaningful effect on a stock close to zero But it can be a big deal In BB s case I think as much as 2 3 of the stock bought on Monday was dealers and the weak rally today is evidence of that no gamma ramp GME is similar passed a huge gamma ramp to get to the 30s last week with dealers doing 2 3 of the buying now kind of in between several gamma ramps with dead zones 36 38 and 31 34 Looking at gamma can help you guys understand what price actions are possible It s a giant lever that can go against you or for you If price is slightly above a gamma ramp it s bearish because small amounts of selling can crash the price quickly If the price is slightly below a gamma ramp it s bullish because small buying can cause the price to run up the ramp while your downside is insulated by little forced selling by the dealers Note that when you buy NEW options from dealers they just do the trade you do initially buy a put they sell stock Buy a call they buy stock But from there price moves cause them to match the stock price movement they remove some of their short when price goes up and they sold you a put and they enlarge their long when the price goes up and they sold you a call Make sense Thought not work on your reading comprehension guys if you are trading complex derivatives with your life savings Keep in mind that in a lot of cases there s no meaningful gamma and no price action will occur I prepared today gamma outlooks on some of the most mentioned stocks GME BB PLTR ICLN TSLA TLRY NIO Note that this tool http www tradingvolatility net http www tradingvolatility net assumes that calls are long gamma for dealers and puts are short gamma I think when you guys engage a stock it s more like 3 4 of all gamma is short gamma put or call Thetagang shows up and gives them some long gamma Current popular stock gamma landscapes IMGUR has been a bit wonky lately hopefully its loading https imgur com a 1IrWNln https imgur com a 1IrWNln Gamma is only relevant relative to float Big gamma matters more on small stocks You will form your own opinions and trade accordingly and if this sub lately is any indication you ll read ALL information as UBER BULLISH for the stock you YOLOed on But here are my interpretations coldly reading the data GME Relevance Very high Big swings could cause MM s to buy sell 1 3 of floating shares easily Reading Bearish with bearish trend but possibility of strong bull case on good bid There is a LOT of gamma ramp and looking at the picture we are more on top of the gamma than on bottom of the gamma It turns out that the bears favor the on top position w regards to gamma People have added a lot of bearish bets in the past few days in the form of puts under this price which are fuel for the fire down and can be seen in the graph as put positions A lot more gamma ramp on net below than above Bulls should be secure if this stock can get to the low 40s and stay there If it starts moving down it will run fast and then slow down at 36 37 then slow down again at 31 32 33 Good news is that because of all this new put vol the price action will be less naturally down in the base case as dealers dump their hedges as time goes forward pushing price up gradually BB Relevance High Big swings could cause MMs to buy sell 1 3 of floating shares Reading Bearish with bullish trend This was arguably bearish yesterday because we were at the top of a ramp Since then peopl ehave establsihed a lot of new positions beginning to form a bullish ramp Bad news can send this back to 10 quickly but not much lower quickly Accumulation of new calls should start to make moving up a possibility though if people keep buying PLTR Relevance Moderate Float is theoretically a billion shares and swings could make MMs buy sell perhaps 1 4 to 1 5 of that Reading Slightly bullish There s a sharp ramp down but also up and a strong buying trend will move this up and there s large block of gamma at 30 ICLN Relevance Low Why Because this is an ETF that can be made destroyed by issuer on demand Reading Actually a little bullish This is so much gamma ahead of price that it will cause a couple hundred million dollars of clean energy buying on a decent day I know weird TSLA As usual a gamma monster hard to read 750m float shares Relevance Lowish Not that much gamma compared to float Reading Bullish Most of the gamma is above current price TLRY Huge OI on this one 136m shares avail Nearby gamma is something like 50m Relevance High to very high Maybe 1 3 or shares could turnover in some situations Reading A bit bullish Kind of in the middle of it all Stock could move up fast on good buying pressure and get to low 20s on gamma NIO Relevance Moderate to almost moderate It s something like 20 of float near price in hedging obligations in aggressive cases Reading Bullish Gamma mostly above current price amp x200B My relevant positions No positions on most of these Short GME on puts Long term holder of TSLA shares Long BBBY on calls but didn t do the gamma chart of it here It s at the bottom of a gamma ramp https imgur com a u4ZVzMw https imgur com a
