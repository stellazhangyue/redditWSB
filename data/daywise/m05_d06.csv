void and darkness was upon the face of the deep And the Spirit of u zjz moved upon the face of the waters 1 3 And u zjz said Let there be light and there was light 1 4 And u zjz saw the light that it was good and u zjz divided the light from the darkness 1 5 And u zjz called the light Day and the darkness he called Night And the evening and the morning were the first day 1 6 And u zjz said Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters 1 7 And u zjz made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so 1 8 And u zjz called the firmament Heaven And the evening and the morning were the second day 1 9 And u zjz said Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so 1 10 And u zjz called the dry land Earth and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas and u zjz saw that it was good 1 11 And u zjz said Let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so 1 12 And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and u zjz saw that it was good 1 13 And the evening and the morning were the third day 1 14 And u zjz said Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years 1 15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so 1 16 And u zjz made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also 1 17 And u zjz set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth 1 18 And to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and u zjz saw that it was good 1 19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day 1 20 And u zjz said Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven 1 21 And u zjz created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind and u zjz saw that it was good 1 22 And u zjz blessed them saying Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth 1 23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day 1 24 And u zjz said Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so 1 25 And u zjz made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and u zjz saw that it was good 1 26 And u zjz said Let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth 1 27 So u zjz created man in his own image in the image of u zjz created he him male and female created he them 1 28 And u zjz blessed them and u zjz said unto them Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth 1 29 And u zjz said Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat 1 30 And to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life I have given every green herb for meat and it was so 1 31 And u zjz saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good And the evening and the morning were the sixth day 2 1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them 2 2 And on the seventh day u zjz ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made 2 3 And u zjz blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which u zjz created and made 2 4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the LORD u zjz made the earth and the heavens 2 5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the LORD u zjz had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground 2 6 But there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground 2 7 And the LORD u zjz formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul 2 8 And the LORD u zjz planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed 2 9 And out of the ground made the LORD u zjz to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil 2 10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became into four heads 2 11 The name of the first is Pison that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah where there is gold 2 12 And the gold of that land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone 2 13 And the name of the second river is Gihon the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia 2 14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria And the fourth river is Euphrates 2 15 And the LORD u zjz took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it 2 16 And the LORD u zjz commanded the man saying Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat 2 17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die 2 18 And the LORD u zjz said It is not good that the man should be alone I will make him an help meet for him 2 19 And out of the ground the LORD u zjz formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof 2 20 And Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him 2 21 And the LORD u zjz caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof 2 22 And the rib which the LORD u zjz had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man 2 23 And Adam said This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called Woman because she was taken out of Man 2 24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh 2 25 And they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed 3 1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD u zjz had made And he said unto the woman Yea hath u zjz said Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden 3 2 And the woman said unto the serpent We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden 3 3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden u zjz hath said Ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die 3 4 And the serpent said unto the woman Ye shall not surely die 3 5 For u zjz doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as u zjzs knowing good and evil 3 6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat 3 7 And the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons 3 8 And they heard the voice of the LORD u zjz walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD u zjz amongst the trees of the garden 3 9 And the LORD u zjz called unto Adam and said unto him Where art thou 3 10 And he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself 3 11 And he said Who told thee that thou wast naked Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat 3 12 And the man said The woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat 3 13 And the LORD u zjz said unto the woman What is this that thou hast done And the woman said The serpent beguiled me and I did eat 3 14 And the LORD u zjz said unto the serpent Because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life 3 15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel 3 16 Unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee 3 17 And unto Adam he said Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life 3 18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field 3 19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return 3 20 And Adam called his wife s name Eve because she was the mother of all living 3 21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD u zjz make coats of skins and clothed them 3 22 And the LORD u zjz said Behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever 3 23 Therefore the LORD u zjz sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken 3 24 So he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life 4 1 And Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bare Cain and said I have gotten a man from the LORD 4 2 And she again bare his brother Abel And Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground 4 3 And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD 4 4 And Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering 4 5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect And Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell 4 6 And the LORD said unto Cain Why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen 4 7 If thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door And unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him 4 8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him 4 9 And the LORD said unto Cain Where is Abel thy brother And he said I know not Am I my brother s keeper 4 10 And he said What hast thou done the voice of thy brother s blood crieth unto me from the ground 4 11 And now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother s blood from thy hand 4 12 When thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth 4 13 And Cain said unto the LORD My punishment is greater than I can bear 4 14 Behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall I be hid and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me 4 15 And the LORD said unto him Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold And the LORD set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him 4 16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden 4 17 And Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare Enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch 4 18 And unto Enoch was born Irad and Irad begat Mehujael and Mehujael begat Methusael and Methusael begat Lamech 4 19 And Lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was Adah and the name of the other Zillah 4 20 And Adah bare Jabal he was the father of such as dwell in tents and of such as have cattle 4 21 And his brother s name was Jubal he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ 4 22 And Zillah she also bare Tubal cain an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron and the sister of Tubal cain was Naamah 4 23 And Lamech said unto his wives Adah and Zillah Hear my voice ye wives of Lamech hearken unto my speech for I have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt 4 24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold 4 25 And Adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name Seth For u zjz said she hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew 4 26 And to Seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name Enos then began men to call upon the name of the LORD amp x200B In other news I hate GME nerds and I love Martin Shkreli and u OPINION IS UNPOPULAR

he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years 6 4 There were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of u zjz came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown 6 5 And u zjz saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually 6 6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart 6 7 And the LORD said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that I have made them 6 8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD 6 9 These are the

thee will I establish my covenant and thou shalt come into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wives with thee 6 19 And of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be male and female 6 20 Of fowls after their kind and of cattle after their kind of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive 6 21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them 6 22 Thus did Noah according to all that u zjz commanded him so did he 7 1 And the LORD said unto Noah Come thou and all thy house into the ark for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation 7 2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and his female 7 3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth 7 4 For yet seven days and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth 7 5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him 7 6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth 7 7 And Noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood 7 8 Of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth 7 9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark the male and the female as u zjz had commanded Noah 7 10 And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth 7 11 In the six hundredth year of Noah s life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened 7 12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights 7 13 In the selfsame day entered Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth the sons of Noah and Noah s wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark 7 14 They and every beast after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind every bird of every sort 7 15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life 7 16 And they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as u zjz had commanded him and the LORD shut him in 7 17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth 7 18 And the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters 7 19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered 7 20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were covered 7 21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl and of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and every man 7 22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life of all that was in the dry land died 7 23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and Noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark 7 24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days 8 1 And u zjz remembered Noah and every living thing and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and u zjz made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters asswaged 8 2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained 8 3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated 8 4 And the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of Ararat 8 5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seen 8 6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made 8 7 And he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth 8 8 Also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground 8 9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark 8 10 And he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark 8 11 And the dove came in to him in the evening and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth 8 12 And he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove which returned not again unto him any more 8 13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dry 8 14 And in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth dried 8 15 And u zjz spake unto Noah saying 8 16 Go forth of the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee 8 17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth 8 18 And Noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him 8 19 Every beast every creeping thing and every fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the ark 8 20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar 8 21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour and the LORD said in his heart I will not again curse the ground any more for man s sake for the imagination of man s heart is evil from his youth neither will I again smite any more every thing living as I have done 8 22 While the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease

and replenish the earth 9 2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered 9 3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb have I given you all things 9 4 But flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat 9 5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require at the hand of every beast will I require it and at the hand of man at the hand of every man s brother will I require the life of man 9 6 Whoso sheddeth man s blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of u zjz made he man 9 7 And you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein 9 8 And u zjz spake unto Noah and to his sons with him saying 9 9 And I behold I establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you 9 10 And with every living creature that is with you of the fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth 9 11 And I will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth 9 12 And u zjz said This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations 9 13 I do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth 9 14 And it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud 9 15 And I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh 9 16 And the bow shall be in the cloud and I will look upon it that I may remember the everlasting covenant between u zjz and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth 9 17 And u zjz said unto Noah This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth 9 18 And the sons of Noah that went forth of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth and Ham is the father of Canaan 9 19 These are the three sons of Noah and of them was the whole earth overspread 9 20 And Noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a vineyard 9 21 And he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent 9 22 And Ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren without 9 23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their father s nakedness 9 24 And Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him 9 25 And he said Cursed be Canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren 9 26 And he said Blessed be the LORD u zjz of Shem and Canaan shall be his servant 9 27 u zjz shall enlarge Japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem and Canaan shall be his servant 9 28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years 9 29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years and he died 10 1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah Shem Ham and Japheth and unto them were sons born after the flood 10 2 The sons of Japheth Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras 10 3 And the sons of Gomer Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah 10 4 And the sons of Javan Elishah and Tarshish Kittim and Dodanim 10 5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands every one after his tongue after their families in their nations 10 6 And the sons of Ham Cush and Mizraim and Phut and Canaan 10 7 And the sons of Cush Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabtechah and the sons of Raamah Sheba and Dedan 10 8 And Cush begat Nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth 10 9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD wherefore it is said Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD 10 10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh in the land of Shinar 10 11 Out of that land went forth Asshur and builded Nineveh and the city Rehoboth and Calah 10 12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah the same is a great city 10 13 And Mizraim begat Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim 10 14 And Pathrusim and Casluhim out of whom came Philistim and Caphtorim 10 15 And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn and Heth 10 16 And the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgasite 10 17 And the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite 10 18 And the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad 10 19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as thou comest to Gerar unto Gaza as thou goest unto Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboim even unto Lasha 10 20 These are the sons of Ham after their families after their tongues in their countries and in their nations 10 21 Unto Shem also the father of all the children of Eber the brother of Japheth the elder even to him were children born 10 22 The children of Shem Elam and Asshur and Arphaxad and Lud and Aram 10 23 And the children of Aram Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash 10 24 And Arphaxad begat Salah and Salah begat Eber 10 25 And unto Eber were born two sons the name of one was Peleg for in his days was the earth divided and his brother s name was Joktan 10 26 And Joktan begat Almodad and Sheleph and Hazar maveth and Jerah 10 27 And Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah 10 28 And Obal and Abimael and Sheba 10 29 And Ophir and Havilah and Jobab all these were the sons of Joktan 10 30 And their dwelling was from Mesha as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east 10 31 These are the sons of Shem after their families after their tongues in their lands after their nations 10 32 These are the families of the sons of Noah after their generations in their nations and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood 11 1 And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech 11 2 And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and they dwelt there 11 3 And they said one to another Go to let us make brick and burn them throughly And they had brick for stone and slime had they for morter 11 4 And they said Go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth 11 5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded 11 6 And the LORD said Behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do 11 7 Go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another s speech 11 8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city 11 9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth 11 10 These are the generations of Shem Shem was an hundred years old and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood 11 11 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years and begat sons and daughters 11 12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years and begat Salah 11 13 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters 11 14 And Salah lived thirty years and begat Eber 11 15 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters 11 16 And Eber lived four and thirty years and begat Peleg 11 17 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters 11 18 And Peleg lived thirty years and begat Reu 11 19 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years and begat sons and daughters 11 20 And Reu lived two and thirty years and begat Serug 11 21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters 11 22 And Serug lived thirty years and begat Nahor 11 23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years and begat sons and daughters 11 24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years and begat Terah 11 25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years and begat sons and daughters 11 26 And Terah lived seventy years and begat Abram Nahor and Haran 11 27 Now these are the generations of Terah Terah begat Abram Nahor and Haran and Haran begat Lot 11 28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity in Ur of the Chaldees 11 29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives the name of Abram s wife was Sarai and the name of Nahor s wife Milcah the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah 11 30 But Sarai was barren she had no child 11 31 And Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran his son s son and Sarai his daughter in law his son Abram s wife and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees to go into the land of Canaan and they came unto Haran and dwelt there 11 32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years and Terah died in Haran 12 1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father s house unto a land that I will shew thee 12 2 And I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing 12 3 And I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed 12 4 So Abram departed as the LORD had spoken unto him and Lot went with him and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran 12 5 And Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother s son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in Haran and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan and into the land of Canaan they came 12 6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem unto the plain of Moreh And the Canaanite was then in the land 12 7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram and said Unto thy seed will I give this land and there builded he an altar unto the LORD who appeared unto him 12 8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent having Bethel on the west and Hai on the east and there he builded an altar unto the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD 12 9 And Abram journeyed going on still toward the south 12 10 And there was a famine in the land and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the land 12 11 And it came to pass when he was come near to enter into Egypt that he said unto Sarai his wife Behold now I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon 12 12 Therefore it shall come to pass when the Egyptians shall see thee that they shall say This is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee alive 12 13 Say I pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee 12 14 And it came to pass that when Abram was come into Egypt the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair 12 15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her and commended her before Pharaoh and the woman was taken into Pharaoh s house 12 16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses and camels 12 17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram s wife 12 18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said What is this that thou hast done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife 12 19 Why saidst thou She is my sister so I might have taken her to me to wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way 12 20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all that he had 13 1 And Abram went up out of Egypt he and his wife and all that he had and Lot with him into the south 13 2 And Abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold 13 3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between Bethel and Hai 13 4 Unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and there Abram called on the name of the LORD 13 5 And Lot also which went with Abram had flocks and herds and tents 13 6 And the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together 13 7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram s cattle and the herdmen of Lot s cattle and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land 13 8 And Abram said unto Lot Let there be no strife I pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethren 13 9 Is not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me if thou wilt take the left hand then I will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then I will go to the left 13 10 And Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan that it was well watered every where before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the garden of the LORD like the land of Egypt as thou comest unto Zoar 13 11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan and Lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other 13 12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward Sodom 13 13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly 13 14 And the LORD said unto Abram after that Lot was separated from him Lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward 13 15 For all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed for ever 13 16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered 13 17 Arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee 13 18 Then Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre which is in Hebron and built there an altar unto the LORD

Overview I d say the majority of you apes are unaware but American relic GM just released its earnings this morning and bullish doesn t even begin to describe the results While the financial figures were encouraging with strong increases in margins carrying a lower than expected revenue to beat EPS expectations it was the qualitative unveilings that I believe were of the most significance here in terms of our ability to start to imagine the GM that we will have ten years from now amp x200B Numbers Like I mentioned above I m not going to dive hugely into the numbers here but I will provide an overview of some factors that I found interesting important Despite narrowly failing to meet revenue expectations recording 32 47 billion vs the expected 32 67 billion GM managed to knock analysts earnings per share estimates out of the park generating 2 25 share against the predicted 1 04 This is largely in thanks to really positive improvements in margins across the board with Q1 2021 vs Q4 2020 figures as follows Gross margin 11 22 up from 7 96 Operating margin 10 09 up from 7 38 Net margin 9 31 up from 7 59 According to CEO Mary Barra these margin improvements were put down to a strong performance in GM s finance product segment a segment with lower overheads than manufacturing etc the leverage of virtual engineering programs and other software solutions to refine engineering and prototype manufacturing processes and strong sales figures for GM s higher margin SUVs and Pickups Perhaps most importantly here GM maintains its initial guidance for this year and is confident that it will not be further impacted by the semiconductor shortage that has seen the auto sector reeling lately They predict EBIT of 10 11 billion for this year strongly beating annual EBIT from 2018 through to 2020 despite the prolonged semiconductor shortage s impact on manufacturing Also of note but to a lesser extent is that the company has reduced its total liabilities marginally improved its cash position and reduced its interest costs all while increasing its total inventory amp x200B Words Put it simply GM appears to be positioning itself at the leading edge of mainstream America s EV adoption and will be a powerhouse in the EV industry globally for decades to come Tesla makes incredible products and probably deserves the hype but GM has the scale infrastructure and history to truly make its rollout impactful The company is quickly positioning itself as vertically integrated after having invested heavily in battery research design and manufacturing capabilities GM s scientists have developed battery technology that can deliver 450 miles per full charge and performance of 0 60mph in 3 seconds while allowing for flexible design considerations that can be adapted for the needs of each vehicle These statistics will only improve GM s scientists and engineers were able to quickly adapt to the semiconductor shortage by developing new workarounds involving less rare semis or to find new solutions to old problems which in some cases have subverted the need to use semis in these cases In my opinion this is indicative of a high performing engineering crew who promise to continue to be adaptable as the company moves forward into new ground In regards to upcoming models which are scheduled for release in 2022 23 Barra states The initial interest has been overwhelming especially from commercial and government customers We gave a small number of them a sneak peek at the interior and exterior design They said it exceeded their high expectations with zero emissions long range pickup capability innovative storage and strong value along with a powerful design Keyword here is government The Biden administration pledged in January to replace the entire US federal government s vehicle fleet with EVs https www reuters com article us usa biden autos idUSKBN29U2LW https www reuters com article us usa biden autos idUSKBN29U2LW While there is no guarantee of agreement in place that GM will be the company that meets this demand the replacement fleet will consist of 650 000 EVs at a possible cost of over 20 billion Obviously the administration will want to spend this money domestically and GM will be a front runner for these contracts If GM even takes in 20 of this amount they will be able to significantly reduce long term debt thereby reducing operating costs moving forward and increasing margins accelerate their investments into new ventures or simply add the profit to their books Other bullish signs include GM s Cruise venture which is set to deploy 4 000 autonomous taxis to Dubai by 2030 GM is developing 2 EV models for Honda which will be produced in North America This means GM will be paid to manufacture vehicles sold at Honda s expense Brightdrop their electric delivery company which is at the forefront of operations ready to address a 6 billion market by 2030 amp x200B Discounted cash flow model Here is a link to a DCF model which I ve been maintaining for GM I use 2021 EBIT guidance and GM s Q4 2020 guidance for future growth in the years moving forward I assume an improvement in gross margin over past years but lower than the impressive Q1 2021 figures Applying a 5 discount rate the model returns a per share price target of 117 24 and applying a 6 discount rate we see an 82 47 target Hope some of y all find this useful Please drop some feedback or corrections if I ve gone wrong here and I ll look at making amendments to this DD or the model GO GET IT

investor Repost, Many of the investors here might be wondering why SOS is so low if it s such a great company I ll offer my perspective on why we re seeing the price at 4 right now instead of the 40 we re all expecting I ll start by saying that I have been in both SOS and MARA since January so I m able to offer a perspective on the stock s behavior from back when it was in the 2 s through the rally to 15 and to the 4 s range that we see now First if you guys haven t noticed recently every time SOS has had positive PR the response is massively suppressed We see the stock wanting to surge on many occasions but in the end the news does not permeate into mainstream and the run is blunted In fact the last good news that actually sent SOS upwards into a bull run was installation of the first set of rigs and receipt of the 2nd set of rigs The stock went from 4 to 15 in 2 days After this the hit pieces came out and the institutions dumped in corrupt coordination I confirmed from SOS SEC filings that the biggest stakeholders in SOS at the time Hudson Bay Master Fund Intracoastal Capital Anson East Master Fund and L1 Global sold a total of 23 8 million shares during the rally to 15 The only fund that has a major position in SOS right now is L1 global with 2 5 million shares amp x200B EVER SINCE THE SELLOFF No good news has been able to take off into a bull run When SOS installed the 2nd set of rigs when they announced their digital asset exchange NFT and big data business etc A few weeks ago when they announced the digital asset exchange and super computer news the stock went from 6 50 to 8 in premarket and in a few minutes after market open the stock was dumped and ended up closing at 6 20 Then we had the surge from the rally on April 7 where the stock went from an intraday low of 4 20 to 6 20 in after hours The next day we traded as high as 6 50 and again the stock was clobbered soon after and closed in the mid 5 s Then there was the announcement of expansion into the US Stock jumped from 5 20 to 5 80 in the morning and sold off below 5 in the afternoon The days always start the same you ll see it jump 1 2 instantly not slowly during the day instantly and then we see massive suppression The initial jumps that we do see remind me a lot of the February run into double digits amp x200B So what does this mean For me this means that there is nothing wrong with the company in fact on the contrary the amount of manipulation could be a sign that institutions really want to load up on this because they like it However they have not loaded up yet and the more good news that comes out before they ve jumped in the worse it is for them I saw almost the same thing with BCoin in the past few months Since November many institutions have been wanting to buy BCoin however many of them missed the boat after the rally in December and were left dumbfounded They didn t want to enter at 40k they wanted to enter at 20k pre rally prices So what did we see in January Janet Yellen talking massive shit about bcoin The same institutions that were pumping bcoin and inadvertently pumped it to 40k said we could see retracement to 20k and that it needed a massive correction And we saw hitpiece after hitpiece forcing bcoin from the ATH of 42 down to 29k At that point it didn t go down much lower What happened after A TON of companies loaded up at 30k Two months later BCoin is at 60k The same companies that were talking shit were the ones that loaded up amp x200B So how low will the institutions drive SOS before deciding to jump in I think they will base their entry off of technicals similar to what they did with BCoin The 30k support was too strong and that ended up being the entry for them even though they wanted it back to 20k I think 4 s is the same for SOS The support at 4 is currently too strong In the meantime the institutions will continue to drive the price down until they feel they can t anymore The discussions of SOS are very reminiscent of the discussions around MARA back in January My entry into MARA was in the 15 20 range My PT for MARA was 60 in the next few months But at the time there was so much FUD and crap talk about MARA going back down to 3 I was scared and worried because MARA had just gone from 26 to 18 in almost a week Admittedly I almost paper handed but I held Look at MARA now I recently sold at 40 and put my profits in SOS I believe that SOS has more upside and more overall potential than MARA even though I believe MARA is a great stock and can go to 100 What s in store for SOS Will we see 6 again Will some of you finally be able to break even or make 10 Don t settle for crumbs with this stock I believe SOS is capable of 20 in the next few weeks 40 in a few months and 70 by end of year At the time of the first rally to 15 88 the only news that SOS had was that it installed 5000 miners Ever since the company has made some incredible announcements Now compared to January SOS is in the public spotlight more than ever Many people are waiting for entry into SOS not just institutions but they are waiting for the right bullish flag Those people might make some money on SOS but they will miss the initial POP of 50 100 The first rally to 15 almost gave me a heart attack The next rally is going to make 15 look like a joke Do not settle for crumbs with SOS You guys are holding a gem As a TSLA investor in 2014 I paper handed it for 50 gains and recent MARA investor gt 100 gain and as someone who invests in penny stocks I know a 10 20x bagger when I see one This is one Disclaimer These

soslimited htm on July 21 2020 In that they attached their SOS Project Investment Cooperation Agreement https www sec gov Archives edgar data 0001346610 000121390020018158 ea0124355ex99 1 soslimited htm with Qingdao West Coast New District Management Committee See here According to Article 6 Rights and Obligations of Party B SOS Limited Paragraph 1 2 It is promised that the operating life of SOS headquarters project in Qingdao West Coast New District will be no less than 10 years under normal circumstances After the project is officially put into operation the operating income in the first full tax year will be no less than 1 5 billion yuan 229M the total annual tax payment will be no less than 100 million yuan 15 3M the operating income in the second year will be 3 5 billion yuan 534M the tax revenue will be no less than 200 million yuan 30 5M the operating income in the third year will reach 5 billion yuan 763M the tax revenue will be no less than 300 million yuan 45 8M and the accumulated operating income in five years will be no less than 30 billion yuan 4 58B and the total tax payment is not less than 1 5 billion yuan 229M To summarize SOS must have an operating income of 229M minimum in its 1st full year 2022 534M minimum in its 2nd full year 2023 763M minimum in its 3rd full year 2024 4 580M minimum in it s first 5 years combined 2022 2026 That would be an average MINIMUM operating income of 916M per year in SOS s first 5 years of full operation which starts in 2022 Note that operating income is not the same as revenue Revenue is the total amount of income generated by a company for the sale of its goods or services BEFORE any expenses are deducted Operating income is the sum total of a company s profit AFTER subtracting its regular recurring costs and expenses Thus revenue is innately MUCH GREATER than operating income Depending on SOS s profit margins their net revenue numbers should be assumed to be MUCH GREATER than the operating income numbers shown above Correct me if I m wrong but it appears SOS must profit an average of nearly 1 billion per year in the next 5 years or they are in breach of this contract SOS would not willingly sign this contract if they were not supremely confident they could meet these minimum operating income figures And people ask me why I m bullish SOS LONG TERM The cooperation agreement also includes free office

Release The Booming SOS Company is Located on the West Coast of Qingdao https service sosyun com sos en news list html Edit It s important to note that this agreement was signed about 6 months BEFORE SOS announced their desired expansion into the Digital Asset and Decentralized Finance De Fi industries This means 1 of 2 things either they already had plans to enter these industries 6 months prior to announcing such OR they didn t even figure these new revenue streams into their projected operating income calculations It is my belief that SOS was planning to exceed the minimum operating incomes outlined above with ONLY their core businesses of emergency rescue data mining marketing and insurance With the newly added revenue streams from digital assets and De Fi business I believe SOS will greatly surpass the minimum operating incomes outlined in their agreement with Qingdao West Coast New District Part 2 As per SOS SEC Form 6 K https www sec gov Archives edgar data 0001346610

at Virtra Inc VTSI This post is about Virtra Inc VTSI and I have tweeted a few times before on the company Disclosure I am simply sharing some of my research and please do not take my tweets posts on it as a recommendation to buy or sell its stock I am not your financial advisor and you should do your own due diligence I first became aware of VTSI when I was asked by a group of shareholders to consider the company in late 2019 for an activist position in an entity I control However the volume in the stock was so low that I took a pass on that approach I did dig deep into the company however What I found was a company with by far the best product in their market advanced simulators for police and military training with unbelievable realism The best product but at a premium price Watch some videos https www virtra com https www virtra com https www youtube com watch v 78WkQPPSenc https www youtube com watch v 78WkQPPSenc Watch this one for an intense scenario https www youtube com watch v xI5dt6sIjlY https www youtube com watch v xI5dt6sIjlY VTSI s simulators are top quality virtual reality and help train officers for numerous challenging scenarios De escalation is a big part of the training program Can you think of a better time for this level of training for police forces around the country Officer training on VTSI simulators would have eliminated many of the high profile cases in the media this past year How about preventing Taser and Gun mix ups like one that killed Daunte Wright in Minnesota in April VTSI training helps you with that https www youtube com watch v JJOgriBpXis https www youtube com watch v JJOgriBpXis These simulators should be mandatory for every police department in my opinion Despite the costs of the VTSI system the police departments military save money in other ways Training with live rounds costs over 25 cents per shot versus less than 1 cent on their simulator There is a man power savings too in the training as one of the police captains describes in the third YouTube videos listed above I also found that the VTSI sales team is awful Their efforts to sell to police departments throughout the country has a weak approach They attend conventions which are non existent in this Covid environment and take orders and that is about it The head of sales acts semi retired and the sales force is not properly incentivized to follow up on leads or seek out new customers Lot of room for improvement there and why I was asked to take an activist position Nevertheless VTSI has grown revenues every year for over a decade because the product is so good that word spread from one police department to another on the great features and training Since I started looking into it I would buy the stock in the mid to low 3 s and then sell in the mid 4 s and did this a number of times throughout 2020 However the backlog kept rising and the narrative from the Company on Q3 earnings was they were getting more access to install their simulators from less Covid restrictive states I concluded that Q4 was going to be well above the couple analyst estimates out there and shifted to just accumulating the stock in the 3 s never got that much for me since it was still illiquid then and holding until Q4 numbers were released If you remember I tweeted this right before earnings T OConnell https twitter com T OConnell I think VTSI https twitter com search q 24VTSI should have pretty good earnings tonight after close Their backlog of orders is high if you listen to past conf calls I have a small long from the mid 3 s Not a super liquid stock 2 21 PM Mar 29 2021 Twitter Web App Well VTSI had blow out numbers with 21 cents share for Q4 versus a 4 cent estimate The stock traded from the 4 s to over 14 pre market and a 10 17 high in the regular session the next day on over 166 million shares A huge move and I sold most of my shares in the 8 s I was a little surprised the stock did not act better late in the day and it finished well off its highs I was further surprised when the following morning VTSI announced they used their shelf and sold 3 million shares at 6 share in a registered direct offering Why was I surprised I knew the company had filed the shelf in June of 2020 and I even asked them about the need for it back then considering their cash position no debt cash flow positive and no substantial need for working capital I was told the shelf was only going to be used if they found an acquisition or if they won an exceptionally large contract from the military where they needed the working capital The shelf filing said essentially the same thing From my early due diligence and from ongoing blurbs from the CEO on several conference calls where very few were tuned in there were indications the company was chasing a very large military contract It did not seem to come to fruition though and I thought it was probably pie in the sky Government contracts are more about connections and having a product that tests well rather than having good salespeople I also have tracked VTSI s government wins on this site and others https www fpds gov ezsearch search do q Virtra amp amp s FPDS GOV amp amp templateName 1 5 1 amp amp indexName awardfull amp amp sortBy SIGNED DATE amp amp desc Y https www fpds gov ezsearch search do q Virtra amp amp s FPDS GOV amp amp templateName 1 5 1 amp amp indexName awardfull amp amp sortBy SIGNED DATE amp amp desc Y As you can see they win some decent contracts from the U S Marshalls Customs and Border Protection and a few other government agencies Few hundred thousand dollars worth or lower here and there Nice contracts but nothing super large and I did not see anything super large they could even win for bidding What would not be easily discovered by me though is if they were a subcontractor on a massive military contract bid on by a major defense contractor It is also interesting to note that in the fall of 2020 VTSI added John Givens to the Board John is on the Board of the National Center for Simulation which is an association of defense companies He has very deep military connections in this simulation training arena In further digging after the Q4 earnings were released I HAVE BECOME CERTAIN VTSI IS THE SUBCONTRACTOR TO SUPPLY RECOIL KITS TO THE MILITARY AS PART OF A WINNING BID FROM A MAJOR DEFENSE CONTRACTOR In conversations with people knowledgeable in the space the feedback I have received is that VTSI s portion would be estimated at 30 100 million HELLO I know this sounds like a wide range but let us just say it s on the low end and how impactful that is for the company Realize they did just over 19 million in sales for ALL of 2020 and none of this military contract has been realized yet I also know that getting this contract will open the doors to future military contracts What are recoil kits When you fire simulated laser rounds you want your weapon to respond like a real live fire and even be able to mimic a jam and other possible events That means you want the gun to recoil in the exact same way as it would a live round VTSI sells simulation systems but they also manufacture recoil kits for almost every type of gun used in law enforcement and the military Recoil kits can convert guns for simulation purposes in just a few minutes VTSI has been running one low volume shift at their headquarters in Arizona to manufacture these recoil kits for many years I have discovered that VTSI was posting ads for jobs starting in February for running their CNC machines on a second shift Those CNC machines are used to make recoil kits This would clearly indicate the need to make MANY more recoil kits than previously and building inventory of them I also listened to the Q4 call again at the instruction of VTSI IR who told me to read between the lines after I had pushed back at them right after the offering on why the need to dilute shareholders and raise 18 million to sit in the bank at 0 interest Listening again I heard CEO Bob Ferris briefly and subtly allude to being a subcontractor on some government contract and something to the effect of there are sensitivities that preclude us from giving details right now but stay tuned I missed this the first time I heard it live as Bob is one of the most boring monotonous speakers you will find and most of what he says drones together He is an engineer by trade and pioneer in virtual reality so that might explain it to some degree CEO Bob Ferris is extremely conservative owns about 4 of the stock has never sold ANY of his shares and would not dilute himself unless there was the need for the cash VTSI has a clean balance sheet with 24 million in cash post offering no debt an already large backlog before this military contract and an enterprise value of JUST 38 million with the stock at 5 90 Remember the offering was at 6 share After selling most of my shares the day after Q4 earnings March 30th I began accumulating again in the 6 s and added heavy as it went into the 4 s I believe VTSI stock will be at least 15 20 share this year as the details of this contract become clear The 2021 Q1 earnings call will be in the next two weeks and it s possible these developments start to come to light then amp x200B Source https www twitlonger com show n 1srm9rn https www twitlonger com

Regardless this is my last one as earnings are finally going to be here on Monday So before I begin I would like us to give a moment of silence for our Rocket bag holder friends Requiescat in pace you poor apes If you need some help for your shell shock or someone to blame I direct you to the CEO of UWMC He may or may not have taken Rocket to the back and beat the living out of it Took a shotgun to their kneecaps Bent Rocket over his knee and given it a spanking Let us be clear that this dude just Arminius d Of Teutoburg Forest Rocket Dan Gilbert probably called up Varus and delivered a Jay

Million These are being serviced directly by UWMC so they have a lot of flexibility on them They relaunched it on March 17th and are already making it a better offering Lowered their FHA minimum score to 620 on Government Loans among a few other changes ARMS are back 5 7 and 10 year rates They can save 5 8th of a rate at the 7 year ARM Sharp pricing Adds options to brokers 7 Tear one is good for refinance candidates according to the CEO Prime Jumbo 30 Year Released These ones are not going to be serviced by UWMC but will instead be sold on Their offering better pricing than their portfolio prime jumbo However guidelines and matrix are slightly tighter o But the portfolio prime jumbo regular program is going to have over 2 billion in May alone They are the only ones who have a product where they retain their jumbos Ultimate Submissions Using 6 8 of these will Goanna cut 3 5 off the CTC process and also shave 1 day off your processor touch UWMC Estimated Loan Volume for Q1 and Estimated forward guidance for Q2 UWMC had closed Loan volume of 54 7 Billion in Q4 2020 with a gain margin of 3 05 o RKT barely met expectations which it had set for closed loan volume and missed revenue and EPS estimates which is unacceptable considering that every other mortgage company Redwood Trust LDI that has reported has beat it out of the park LDI beat EPS by 73 03 and beat Revenue by 30 38 for example They also announced a special dividend of 69 and announced they are looking to set a dividend of 8 cents a quarter starting in Q2 of 2021 o RKT gain on sale margin reduced from 2 57 to 1 93 on their partner network for Q1 2021 Please note that this is not the wholesale channel completely as their two primary partnership types are marketing and influencer This represents a 24 9 decrease in gain on sale margin from Q4 2020 or 249 Basis Points o LDI s partner channel gain on sale margin decreased from 2 58 to 1 85 That is a 28 2 or 282 Basis Point Decrease o LDI s Partner Channel is through the whole sale channel and through Joint Venture s with Home Builders However the actual volume remains unmoved Rate locks decreased from last quarter It stood at 9 645 last quarter but only 8 688 this quarter While Loan Originations only increased from 7 730 101 to 8 051 362 We can assume this was largely off their Joint Venture with Home Builders UWMC is expecting Closed Loan Volume of between 52 and 57 Billion for Q1 2021 o On CNBC their CEO stated they were right in the middle however the April bump in refinance activity and purchase activity as rates eased down back under 3 likely gave them the boost they needed o Reopening the spigot on Jumbo Loans and FHA loans while ensuring a fantastic Q2 will help raise closed loan volume for Q1 2021 as Jumbo only accounted for 583 299 in 2020 but 3 570 520 for 2019 They are increasing their capacity and driving more wholesale brokerage business to them as a percentage of that wholesale broker s business by expanding their Jumbo Offerings and increasing capacity while making them more attractive You should see strong tailwinds for Q2 2021 which has been talked about by UWMC s CEO o Reopening the spigot on FHA loans will create a lot of closed loan volume as FY 2019 was 13 151 943 but FY 2020 was only 8 619 874 They are increasing their capacity and driving more wholesale brokerage business to them as a percentage of that wholesale broker s business by expanding their FHA Offerings and increasing capacity while making them more attractive You should see strong tailwinds for Q2 2021 which has been talked about by UWM s CEO Capacity and options for wholesale mortgage brokers are opening The CEO of UWMC has been very big on this and we can start seeing the fruits of this in Q2 2021 I don t expect closed loan volume for any of the new offerings from the last week or this week to impact Q1 2021 but I do expect closed loan volume to be impacted very positively for Q2 2021 UWMC is expecting a gain margin of 200 220 BPS or 2 2 20 o However a 24 9 decrease in gain on sale margin means a 2 29 Gain on Sale margin Which means a 9 Basis Point beat If like LDI there is margin expansion due to UWMC s tech then this could mean even more of a margin gain o A 28 2 gain on sale margin decrease leads to a 2 19 gain on sale margin for Q1 2021 However please note that UWMC s tech could lead to margin expansion o I believe UWMC will fall roughly to 2 50 2 60 but we will see on the 10th After Market I do not mind a margin hit for market share gain so long as that market share gain is sustainable OR the market share gain leads to revenue that offsets the gain on sale margin If LDI had no or little marketing expenses it would have had higher net income than Q4 2020 Rocket s marketing expenses totaled 320 Million They have such high marketing expenses because they are retail whereas UWMC is wholly wholesale and thus their marketing costs are much much less Rocket got clobbered on their wholesale channel after UWMC s ultimatum The Wholesale Channel was one of their main growth drivers especially in the purchase channel where they are exceptionally weak 11 percent refinance but only 3 percent of the purchase volume in the US o The Partner Network for Q1 2021 only provided 40 7B in originations Please remember that this is not just wholesale but wholesale comprises a portion Last Quarter the Partner Channel provided 37 9B in originations That was a 7 3 increase which is negligible when you consider that they probably only grew from their referral channel and from the increased percentage of their business that those who did not sign the addendum from UWMC gave You cannot have that when your direct to consumer channel decreased from 67 8B to 65B Especially when your retail channel is the higher margin channel Net revenue obviously decreased in their partner network from Q4 2020 I cannot reiterate how bad this is for Rocket considering their aggressive growth was coming from this area Especially since the broker channel surpassed 20 percent this year according to AMCs for the first time since 2008 It s indicating to me that UWMC has won the broker war here to be quite blunt especially since UWMC s CEO keeps reiterating that he has over 10 000 Brokerages partnered with him RKT gave disappointing Q2 guidance with a significant decrease in closed loan volume of between 82 5 Billion and 87 5 Billion Gain on sale margins of 2 65 to 2 95 o Quite frankly considering UWMC has stated that Q2 is going to be very very good I am concerned for Rocket especially since there is a government program coming online this summer that will help low credit score and low income people refinance which UWMC is taking advantage of Furthermore the wholesale broker channel is increasing and more and more housing inventory is coming online Lastly home prices are increasing If UWMC has a revenue beat and closed loan volume beat like LDI or even meets Q1 on the higher end and guides upward for Q2 that means that Rocket is likely capped on the wholesale channel and thus in the purchase segment and that UJWMC is gaining ground My Thoughts Going into Earnings Quite frankly I am positively inclined Which makes you all think I am a moron most likely Well in a vacuum yes it would be a moronic play However the market s priced UWMC to fail partly because it is a mortgage company partly because of the uncertainty with Rocket and partly because it does not believe UWMC can beat expectations Let us first look at P E Ratio Rocket had a P E of roughly 13 13 5 whereas UWMC has a P E ratio of 6 27 if the 1 22 FY 2020 is right Financial Services company have a P E Ratio of 8 10 While Rocket is the number 1 mortgage lender with some arguing it was even worthy of tech valuation UWMC is the number 1 mortgage lender in the wholesale space However the market was looking for Rocket to completely outperform like other stocks and for guidance to be spectacular much like other companies The Market is looking at UWMC like it is going to fail as it is falling below even the most conservative ratio for a financial services company and has been trending downward in the leadup to earnings Another bearish sign from the market is the short interest of UWMC compared to RKT RKT s short interest is 7 87 since April 15 April 30th SI data should be released any day now For UWMC it is 13 10 of the float and I am guessing it is going to show an increase on the 30th Volume for UWMC is also significantly low from its average Which leads me to my next point I believe in war you must strike fast and strike hard which UWMC did However markets do not like uncertainty and the ultimatum that UJWMC gave introduced a lot of uncertainty However UWMC has made a lot of positive noises before Rocket s earnings and so I was comfortable that they were winning the wholesale mortgage market war I also quite thoroughly enjoyed their share raising moves and their willingness to raise capacity I did not really see that with Rocket However Rocket had its buyback program whereas UWMC did not have that to fall to and it led to a negative feedback loop for UWMC where people gave up short selling occurred and there were not really any buybacks that UWMC could do as opposed to RKT to halt the bleeding Ultimately RKT s earnings even led to a sympathy bleeding on UWMC in the After Hours UWMC is down 1 79 to 7 66 after RKT s earnings even though these two companies are diametrically opposed and the success of one boded ill for the other The first positive thing is that analysts earnings are primed to be blown out of the water for Q1 and FY 2021 as well as FY 2022 Q1 2021 has analysts expecting 42 or 47 depending on where you look but I think that is a bit low Especially when compared to Redwood Trust and LDI I m positively inclined here Furthermore LDI used 200 Million to give a 69 Special Dividend but the stock was trading over 20 22 dollars at the time and its announcement of a Q2 dividend announcement of 8 cents a share was unappealing considering the share price At the current share price of 18 11 LDI would give a 1 7 annual dividend At the current share price LoanDepot is giving a 3 81 special dividend Compare that to UWMC which is offering a dividend yield of 5 22 and who has announced that they were looking at a special dividend increased dividend or even buybacks in Q4 2020 to reward shareholders if there was excess cash After LDI and RKT both issued a special dividend I feel UWMC will have no choice but to do so and a special dividend of 200 Million to Class A shares equates to 4 dollars roughly Even if Class D shares were involved a 40 cent special dividend to both Class D and A shares would only cost 640 million However I believe that the owner wants to keep as much money in the company as possible because he wants to invest it in the company which is why Class D shares do not have a dividend but Class A shares do If you are still unconvinced I believe a timely look at RKT s special dividend is in order as they issued the special dividend to only Class A shares Public shares and not owner shares and not the Class D shares that Dan Gilbert owns This structure also allows an outsized special dividend I have 7 50 call Options with an average premium of 1 20 This would cost 123 million if issued to only Class A shares In a vacuum to profit I would only need a special dividend of 1 20 though this will not be in a vacuum A special dividend that large would force people to cover if they are shorting for one and this special dividend would be issued under the auspices of Russell inclusion in late June A strong Q1 and a very strong Q2 Guidance Furthermore as the normal dividend is announced the share price would elevate by that amount before falling after the ex dividend date If the share price instead falls or remains flat I can exercise my shares and take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity Mortgage Servicing Rights alone can service the dividend 41 5 Million per year and the interest on the bonds 80 Million while also allowing the company to further invest or allocate to bond principal The Senior Notes are themselves easily repaid Ultimately I have 4525 shares of UWMC that I have been continuously adding to and I have 25 7 5 Calls for May 21 at an average of 1 20 that I have also been adding to including the last 2 days for both calls and shares I am looking to add a call and perhaps a tad more shares to UWMC Yes I am aware of IV Crush and of Theta Decay The theta decay stands at 1 9 which is acceptable to me and I believe considering the confluence of events the positive noises that the CEO has made for Q2 2021 the short interest and the strong downward pressure on UWMC indicating the market believes the company will completely miss earnings as well as the overt indication and peer pressure to issue a special dividend will ensure that the IV will remain elevated after earnings I would not advise this for the faint of hearts or if you have a kid on the way and life savings to burn but this is one of the few times where buying calls from theta gang might mean they cry and you fly upward With that said be aware of IV Crush and be aware that I have allocated 3 127 and might up this to 3 200 roughly considering Rocket s earnings I have nearly 40 000 in UWMC so this is by no means a majority position Furthermore I am somewhat cushioned as this is not a weekly To be clear this is a YOLO but a conservative one sans the options I also have money in my bank so it is not like this will render me homeless I am not a financial advisor Do what you will with this information I look forward to the earnings call on the 11th

be a DD ish discussion my first re women s involvement in retail trading I welcome all comments from all genders and identities Full disclosure I am NOT a financial advisor nor an expert I am a mere crayon loving Lady Ape who seeks to take care of my wife boyfriend the same as everyone else Well but I graduated law school at 22 After a few years practicing and a bad neuro vascular condition I quit that and about then my best Kevin turned me on to programming Python is my new best friend the past 18 months So the boyfriend still mentors me but I am looking for a wife currently When AMC moons I shall propose damnit Very off topic I have been here Reddit since 2014 but r WSB https www reddit com r WSB only since 2020 I began asking myself the question Self why are so many of my female friends afraid to engage in retail investing To be fair many of my female friends have money invested in some fashion either due to their job 401K IRA etc or their husband boyfriend But when I mention downloading any trading platform and teaching them and they always seem interested initally ultimately NO TAKERS I started investing in GME thanks to one of my male friends last year I made a little money to play with Now to this day 99 of the people I discuss investing with are MALE I love my dudes but I plan to have a wife AND a boyfriend and I need to know why so many other females in the world aren t engaged in retail investing I can see the number is going up overall but after doing some DD on the topic I came to the conclusion many woman are just more afraid to risk their limited funds i e inheritance stimulus check the extra 100 from your paycheck etc engaging in retail investing The reasons for this are many but if you are a fellow Lady Ape or just another ape who feels their 2 cents is worth adding into the pot please comment on these statements and conclusions made and drawn by these big name sites in the articles on the most recent research on this topic I want to know why you a female identifying individual reading this on Reddit or a male who also has some input here agree or disagree with the things the research is saying Also if you are a Lady Ape generally why did you start investing and in what Or why haven t you started yet though you re clearly on r WSB https www reddit com r WSB reading this post Okay getting down to the meat of things here s what I was able to find most recent numbers wise on this topic quoted text is in bold all sources are listed following the material s referenced from said source s In May 2019 the CFA Group did a piece which focused on the gap between men and women who invest in the stock market whether through individual stocks funds or exchange traded funds ETFs A greater percentage of men invest in equities than women This represents the true retail gender investment gap Since equities outperform all other asset classes over the long term by not investing in these assets women are at a disadvantage But That s the bad news The good news is that women are narrowing this investment gap and will soon close it When it comes to women and men there are five distinct financial gaps of which only two constitute investment gaps Many articles conflate all five perhaps because it makes the situation look especially bad and draws attention to an important social problem The Wage Gap Working women around the world make less money than working men on average The Wealth Gap Since working women make less money than working men on average they tend to have less wealth The Retirement Needs Gap Women live longer than men The Retail Investing Gap Finally Historically about 60 of US men invested in stocks compared with only 40 of women According to a 2017 Gallup survey this 20 percentage point gap has shrunk and is narrowing fast From 2001 to 2008 65 of men and 59 of women owned stocks Following the global financial crisis GFC from 2009 to 2017 56 of men and 52 of women were investing in equities So the gap has narrowed to only four percentage points The Institutional Investing Gap Funds and ETFs have predominantly been run by men According to the most recent US data from Morningstar fewer than 10 of money managers are women They concluded By 2025 there will be no meaningful gender gap in stock market participation in the United States Why do we believe this For three principal reasons The financial industry is shifting to products that women are more interested in new technology is making it easier for women to invest and the institutional investing gap will begin to close They gave the following research to support these conclusions Based on Rich Thinking global interviews over three quarters of women prefer to invest in stocks and funds that reflect their core values In 2015 78 of women said they were interested in retail investing Only two years later that number had climbed to 84 In 2015 62 of men said they were interested Two years later that had risen to 67 This sustainability gap skews the other way Women lead men with the difference growing from 15 to 17 percentage points from 2015 to 2017 Female Friendly technology platforms women love to share And technology especially mobile technology is helping them share and helping them invest The global Sentiment is shifting and the institutional investing gap is about to narrow Female focused investment communities and forums are sprouting up everywhere A prime example is Launch With GS Goldman Sachs s commitment to invest 500 million in women led companies and investment managers A few other things noted here were that Female angel investors are increasing in number As more and more women become institutional money managers across all asset classes we expect female retail investors will be more willing to invest with women at the helm especially since female fund managers may generate higher returns Concluding The investing gap will close much sooner than anticipated https blogs cfainstitute org investor 2019 05 22 the equality equation three reasons why the gender investing gap is closing https blogs cfainstitute org investor 2019 05 22 the equality equation three reasons why the gender investing gap is closing In December 2020 Financial Times looked at this too finding Women are signing up to investment platforms at faster rates than men Investors have registered on platforms in record numbers since March and trading volumes have remained heightened since the market sell off earlier this year Women are under represented on investment platforms but as new and younger customers sign up they are making up a larger chunk of that base The article went on to state how sites such as EToro a DIY trading platform reported a 366 rise in the number of new women investors since the beginning of the year compared with a 248 increase for men Also Nutmeg a UK online wealth manager said customer sign ups are up nearly one third in 2020 Women ordinarily make up 36 of its investors but this year the female share of new customers rose to 40 Additionally Bux a European investment platform said female customers signing up to its share trading app BuxZero grew six fold over the year to date compared with fourfold growth for men They mentioned that women s emphasis on financial security can lead them to hold excess cash and lower returns later in life And Though women own 40 of the world s wealth in real terms they represent a far lower proportion of those engaged with the stock market or wealth managers Other points they made included Customers of retail investment platforms and wealth management firms are typically heavily skewed towards men on eToro the approximate breakdown is 85 male to 15 female Some 70 of Interactive Investor s customers are men and the customer base of Hargreaves Lansdown the UK s largest investment platform is two thirds male Female investors are unfairly stereotyped as more risk averse and uninformed than men advisers say In reality their financial strategies tend to reflect their goals and a desire to keep cash safe prioritizing long term financial stability So in essence they are saying that there are fewer women investing overall but there is also a major increase in the amount of women signing up more and more with mobile and online retail trading platforms Further that when women invest they tend to be more conservative and take less risk which can in the long term produce greater returns than many of the investment strategies i e riskier ones taken by males on the same platform They continue Women may be more likely to hold cash than men but as interest rates on cash savings and yields on lower risk investments such as bonds have declined investment has become more attractive with more women seeing it as imperative to keep up with inflation Women are interested in investing they re just short on time especially mothers said Becky O Connor head of pensions and savings at Interactive Investor They re time poor so rarely does investing make the top of the priority list So they are pointing out that women actually tend to hold more cash than men yet due to other demands of life faced more often by women than men aka childcare house chores soccer mom etc they overall have less time to invest READ to learn how to invest wisely as a little guy to be able to take the time to listen to live streams of pertinent folks to be able to spend time watching the tickets for various stocks cryptocurrencies etc Continuing Another catalyst has been the emergence of low cost user friendly investment platforms challenging the older investment providers which traditionally catered to a heavily male client base The new providers appeal to millennials and Gen Z customers they account for most of eToro s sign ups this year while more than half of new customers at Barclays Smart Investor this year were under 44 They concluded New accounts opened by women in that group grew at a faster rate than men These new platforms have created a business out of making investment simpler and quicker stripping out jargon and putting a priority on ease of use The issue of convenience is really important said Ms O Connor Ms Hechler Fayd herbe said Women are really looking for advice that is extremely practical They like to go straight to the point https www ft com content 36d9d064 d259 4d45 a637 fe2114c630e1 https www ft com content 36d9d064 d259 4d45 a637 fe2114c630e1 Specifically in regards to Forex trading in March 2020 Forex stated that There are far more male than female professional traders in the Forex industry and the data we have from Forex brokers shows that men are strongly overrepresented sp among the client base of retail traders Publicly available data presented by CitiFX in January 2014 showed that more than 80 of retail traders worldwide were male although this fell to less than 60 in Europe If you look at the names of contributors to trading chat forums you can easily see that men are the dominant participants They discuss why there is a gender disparity in trading specifically in the Forex industry stating As a profession even if you allow for the probability of historically discriminatory hiring practices in the industry trading of all types attracts far more men than women This could either mean that it is something that women are less interested in doing or it might mean that men rate their own chance of success higher than women do In the article a 2001 academic study is referenced where they analyzed stock accounts from over 35 000 households at a discount brokerage in the United States over a 6 year period The study found that men made 45 more trades than women This suggested that the men were more over confident than the women and as such over traded more However as the net returns were the same this implies that the men performed better than the women at stock selection Interestingly it seems that these two effects were of a similar magnitude and so they canceled each other out Financial Skills a trading company that trains junior traders on real time market simulation software found that their male trainees lost on average about 35 more over the course of their first year of trading compared to their female trainees The firm found that men broke house rules more often than women did and entered a significantly higher volume of trades which they believed accounted for the differential The latter point is interesting and evidentially significant within our debate because it mirrors the evidence of male over trading which was present in the 2001 study The conclusions they draw from this later in the article discuss that while there are fewer women who trade overall compared to men the ones who do generally make safer trades which result in higher returns This is a sentiment echoed in the other articles and studies I found as well Specifically they stated Recent research published by the University of Leicester in 2016 The Role of Hormones in the Financial Markets found not only that female traders tended to outperform male traders but that in a sample the best and worst performers at any given time were more likely to be male than female This suggests that men tend to trade in a riskier way than women The study also found that professional trading desks in the City of London were approximately 95 male and 5 female and that their total returns would be improved if the gender ratio among staff was made more equal The study also went on to speculate that market crashes would be less severe if trading desks were more equally balanced by gender but without producing any direct evidence of this The conclusion they drew at the end was The most important lesson to be learned is that the primary root causes of unprofitable trading are overconfidence and indecision It is great to have confidence that you will become a profitable trader but you need to be realistic about the fact that you will almost certainly have to work through a period of hard struggle to get there https www dailyforex com forex articles 2018 07 do women men trade differently 100605 https www dailyforex com forex articles 2018 07 do women men trade differently 100605 I also looked into what Robinhood had to say about this as they were the app a male friend of mine first introduced me to a little over a year ago which I used to buy GME i e the purchase that started it all for this here lady ape They conducted a survey to learn more about women s attitudes fears behaviors and goals toward investing They published the findings in October 2020 They found almost half of the women surveyed 45 have a favorable view of investing but there are still barriers that prevent some from participating in the markets They went on to state The overwhelming majority of women we surveyed 73 have made a financial resolution to save more which points to women wanting to be thoughtful and strategic about their finances However only 16 have made a resolution to invest more Investing can be a powerful tool for building and accumulating wealth over time and achieving financial goals They looked at the reasons why women weren t looking to invest more finding A strong majority of women surveyed 86 would worry about losing money if they were to invest 52 of female respondents haven t invested because they don t feel they make enough money to invest Women respondents also don t feel comfortable investing large amounts of money 56 of them Moreover 29 of women surveyed say their concerns about investing would keep them from investing at all Additionally Almost half of the women we surveyed haven t invested because they don t know where to start Similarly 43 of women haven t invested because they think they don t understand the stock market Nearly half of the women said they don t believe they have what it takes to be a strong investor Only 28 of women feel empowered to invest and 33 of women are confident in their ability to invest their money Some findings of Robinhood included that While many women are interested in investing and view it favorably fewer are getting direct experience investing 3 out 5 of women we surveyed 60 have never invested in individual stocks mutual funds options bonds cryptocurrencies or ETFs Also that Men are more comfortable trading knowledge and discussing their finances with others than the women we surveyed Men are more likely than women to talk about finances with their immediate family extended family best friends and partners Robinhood concluded We believe women s hesitation to participate and level of confidence reflects larger systemic issues that have been at play for decades the gender pay gap different cultural expectations and the perception that investing tools and resources aren t made or accessible for women https blog robinhood com news 2020 10 22 the state of women investors today https blog robinhood com news 2020 10 22 the state of women investors today Finally I reviewed an article from Investitopia from January 2021 There they pointed out at the beginning how Janet Yellen was at the time positioned to be the first female secretary of the Treasury she currently holds this position as of the time of posting And we all know how that s gone so far need I say more can you tell I like ellipses They emphasize just like the other sources how female retail investors remain a minority They reference a study by Cerulli Associates and Phoenix Marketing which found that only 28 of women own stocks compared to 44 of men and only 28 of women want to manage their own investments compared to 38 of men according to The Wall Street Journal They mention how In addition to the lower percentages of women who are active investors UBS data showed that women were still not taking charge of their financial decisions within their own households going into the pandemic In order to increase the number of female retail investors many platforms such as Robinhood The Charles Schwab Corporation SCHW Fidelity and Ellevest are all trying to attract more female investors and see them as a major compnent of future growth The article states On one side of the spectrum for companies like Robinhood that have built their businesses around gamification of trading attracting female customers would mean tweaking their approach The business model that Robinhood has right now is completely predicated on trading and that caters toward a more male demographic they would have to change their business model Larry Tabb head of market structure research at Bloomberg Intelligence told The Wall Street Journal To attract female clients they would have to include long term investing strategies and wealth building Some platforms such as Ellevest are actively tailoring and marketing their offerings to women Regarding Ellevest the writer states Launched in 2014 Ellevest has been looking to address these core differences between male and female investors Last year the firm launched Ellevest Money membership offering its clients more workshops coaching and investing options that include gender differences in pay gaps career breaks and longer lifespans Other platforms have similar things as Ellevest they mention Charles Schwab and Fidelity Specifically they mention Fidelity Investment data that shows about 67 of women say they are more engaged in managing their money since the start of the pandemic The article concludes stating While many of the financial tools and educational resources have existed for years the COVID 19 pandemic may provide the urgency for female investors to take advantage of them and become savvier more active market participants and planners for their financial future https www investopedia com wanted more female investors 5095994 https www investopedia com wanted more female investors 5095994 So if you are a woman what got you

to one of my male friends last year I made a little money to play with Now to this day 99 of the people I discuss investing with are MALE I love my dudes but I plan to have a wife AND a boyfriend and I need to know why so many other females in the world aren t engaged in retail investing I began asking myself the question Self why are so many of my female friends afraid to engage in retail investing To be fair many of my female friends have money invested in some fashion either due to their job 401K IRA etc or their husband boyfriend But when I mention downloading any cryptocurrency trading platform and teaching them and they always seem interested initally ultimately NO TAKERS I started investing in GME thanks to one of my male friends last year I made a little money to play with Now to this day 99 of the people I discuss investing with are MALE I love my dudes but I plan to have a wife AND a boyfriend and I need to know why so many other females in the world aren t engaged in retail investing I can see the number is going up overall but after doing some DD on the topic I came to the conclusion many woman are just more afraid to risk their limited funds i e inheritance stimulus check the extra 100 from your paycheck etc engaging in retail investing The reasons for this are many but if you are a fellow Lady Ape or just another ape who feels their 2 cents is worth adding into the pot please comment on these statements and conclusions made and drawn by these big name sites in the articles on the most recent research on this topic I want to know why you a female identifying individual reading this on Reddit or a male who also has some input here agree or disagree with the things the research is saying Also if you are a Lady Ape generally why did you start investing and in what Or why haven t you started yet though you re clearly on r WSB reading this post Okay getting down to the meat of things here s what I was able to find most recent numbers wise on this topic quoted text is in bold all sources are listed following the material s referenced from said source s In May 2019 the CFA Group did a piece which focused on the gap between men and women who invest in the stock market They basically said more men are engaged in retail trading than women They concluded By 2025 there will be no meaningful gender gap in stock market participation in the United States Why do we believe this For three principal reasons The financial industry is shifting to products that women are more interested in new technology is making it easier for women to invest and the institutional investing gap will begin to close Concluding The investing gap will close much sooner than anticipated https blogs cfainstitute org investor 2019 05 22 the equality equation three reasons why the gender investing gap is closing https blogs cfainstitute org investor 2019 05 22 the equality equation three reasons why the gender investing gap is closing In December 2020 Financial Times looked at this too finding Women are signing up to investment platforms at faster rates than men Investors have registered on platforms in record numbers since March and trading volumes have remained heightened since the market sell off earlier this year Yea Well where are all the women I know Not on these platforms that s where So in essence they are saying that there are fewer women investing overall but there is also a major increase in the amount of women signing up more and more with mobile and online retail trading platforms Further that when women invest they tend to be more conservative and take less risk which can in the long term produce greater returns than many of the investment strategies i e riskier ones taken by males on the same platform So they pointed out that women actually tend to hold more cash than men yet due to other demands of life faced more often by women than men aka childcare house chores soccer mom etc they overall have less time to invest READ to learn how to invest wisely as a little guy to be able to take the time to listen to live streams of pertinent folks to be able to spend time watching the tickets for various stocks cryptocurrency etc They concluded New accounts opened by women in that group grew at a faster rate than men These new platforms have created a business out of making investment simpler and quicker stripping out jargon and putting a priority on ease of use The issue of convenience is really important said Ms O Connor Ms Hechler Fayd herbe said Women are really looking for advice that is extremely practical They like to go straight to the point https www ft com content 36d9d064 d259 4d45 a637 fe2114c630e1 https www ft com content 36d9d064 d259 4d45 a637 fe2114c630e1 Forex drew this conclusion The most important lesson to be learned is that the primary root causes of unprofitable trading are overconfidence and indecision It is great to have confidence that you will become a profitable trader but you need to be realistic about the fact that you will almost certainly have to work through a period of hard struggle to get there https www dailyforex com forex articles 2018 07 do women men trade differently 100605 https www dailyforex com forex articles 2018 07 do women men trade differently 100605 I also looked into what Robinhood had to say about this as they were the app a male friend of mine first introduced me to a little over a year ago which I used to buy GME i e the purchase that started it all for this here lady ape They conducted a survey to learn more about women s attitudes fears behaviors and goals toward investing They published the findings in October 2020 They found almost half of the women surveyed 45 have a favorable view of investing but there are still barriers that prevent some from participating in the markets amp x200B Almost half of the women we surveyed haven t invested because they don t know where to start https blog robinhood com news 2020 10 22 the state of women investors today https blog robinhood com news 2020 10 22 the state of women investors today amp x200B Finally I reviewed an article from Investitopia from January 2021 There they pointed out at the beginning how Janet Yellen was at the time positioned to be the first female secretary of the Treasury she currently holds this position as of the time of posting And we all know how that s gone so far need I say more can you tell I like ellipses They emphasize just like the other sources how female retail investors remain a minority They reference a study by CerullAssociates and Phoenix Marketing which found that only 28 of women own stocks compared to 44 of men and only 28 of women want to manage their own investments compared to 38 of men according to The Wall Street Journal Specifically they mention Fidelity Investment data that shows about 67 of women say they are more engaged in managing their money since the start of the pandemic The article concludes stating While many of the financial tools and educational resources have existed for years the COVID 19 pandemic may provide the urgency for female investors to take advantage of them and become savvier more active market participants and planners for their financial future https www investopedia com wanted more female investors 5095994 https www investopedia com wanted more female

recovery social media and e commerce all in the yet to be disrupted fashion industry worth over 2 2 trillion worldwide The pandemic shipping woes extreme weather in the southern states and misunderstanding of the product has presented a decent entry point POSH is a great long term play that may also have solid short term upside We were overwhelmed by how supportive and positive the Posh community is I surfed on social media for at least 10 hours reading users comments I honestly felt like I was on the Peloton Facebook Page the energy from both communities are similarly powerful It makes us think that the shorts are making a mistake Poshmark s short interest is 25 and they are hard to borrow at most brokerages https fintel io ss us posh https fintel io ss us posh Poshmark is a risky play The POSH chart is ugly and it has yet to find a bottom This may fall further Poshmark is in its infantile stages and needs to prove itself They need to execute on their international expansion and continue to keep their sellers and buyers happy while attracting new users If they succeed and the stars align then this is a 5 bagger in 3 years If not then enjoy your tax write offs Poshmark a Recovery Social Media E commerce Short Squeeze and Becky Play all in one Poshmark is the biggest social marketplace that combines the human connection of a physical shopping experience with the scale reach ease and selection benefits of Ecommerce Their mission is to put people at the heart of commerce allowing everyone to thrive and their vision is to make buying and selling simple social and fun As e commerce has taken off in recent years human interactions have been stripped out of the shopping experience Consumers need human interactions combined with social discovery to find the right products to fit their needs Poshmark brings this element to shopping they are disrupting e commerce with social commerce However Covid 19 has presented a headwind against Posh s business which will soon turn into a tailwind Referencing the chart below you ll see that the pandemic has pulled ecommerce sales 2 years forward due to social distancing and lockdowns The pandemic has increased sales for the majority of ecommerce businesses but Poshmark remains one of the few exceptions People have been locked inside for over a year with little need for new wardrobes However the reopening of the economy will result in a boost of clothing sales Soon people will be dressing for weddings dinners work parties and other social gatherings that evaporated over a year ago POSH CEO Manish Chandra explained during last earning s call that POSH is already seeing an increase in activity in states reopening like FL versus states like New York POSH Gtrends amp The Pandemic If you refer to the chart above you will notice the sudden drop in google searches for POSH which occurred in March of 2020 just as the pandemic hit Judging by the Gtrends chart above Posh is still below pre pandemic levels but the headwind that covid has caused will soon turn into a tailwind as more individuals are open to shop online and will be more likely to use Poshmark when the economy fully reopens If you scroll on reddit you will see many users echoing similar words about a slowdown in sales POSHMARK has 25 Short Interest Whoever is Shorting Is Making a Mistake Bears have argued that high seller fees make the marketplace susceptible to competition but its growth numbers speak differently Also when you add up all the fees Ebay has they are just as expensive as POSH POSH is just transparent about their fee structure which sellers soon find out I have already explained why their 20 take rate has allowed them to invest more money in customer service and software giving them an NPS score superior to their competitors POSH also stated in its recent S1 filing that they are open to reducing their 20 take rate Their business is so scalable that they will be able to amortize their costs across new users without spending any additional money Additionally although POSH spends almost half their total revenue on marketing and ad spend they still turn a profit And now that they have fallen over 60 from their all time highs bears think it s a good idea to short I thought shorts were supposed to be the smart money To put both this extremely low share left to borrow count and high borrow fee in perspective I have included AMC s metrics also from Fintel s website AMC has a short interest of 12 21 Posmark s short interest is over 100 higher Than AMC s AMC has over 7x the short share availability for borrow And AMC Borrow Fee Rate is only 1 73 compared to Poshmark s 3 2 The more difficult it is to borrow the stock the higher the fee Firms also increase borrow fees on shorts they deem risky If the retail community catches on to this there might be an opportunity for a squeeze Poshmark and International Expansion Poshmark is in three countries POSH launched in the United States in 2011 in Canada in 2019 and just last month POSH launched in Australia Judging by their Linkedin jobs they re preparing for the U K https www linkedin com jobs view director of international expansion uk at poshmark 2341557540 originalSubdomain uk https www linkedin com jobs view director of international expansion uk at poshmark 2341557540 originalSubdomain uk Poshmark s expansion will be seamless as they carry no inventory they won t need to build any manufacturing sites or logistic teams all sales are done on a peer to peer level Competitors like ThredUp hold inventory and require distribution centers which makes it impossible for them to scale at the same level as Poshmark Also the fact that European nations generally value fashion and sustainability more than the western world gives me further confidence in Poshmark s expansion TL DR POSH https twitter com search q 24POSH amp src cashtag click currently has a short interest of 25 According to Fintel POSH https twitter com search q 24POSH amp src cashtag click has 85 000 shares left to borrow with a short borrow fee of 3 28 Analysts like the stock POSH https twitter com search q 24POSH amp src cashtag click has a median price target of 67 5 suggesting a 70 6 upside from current levels JMP Securities Ronald Josey ranked 31 out of 7 407 analysts on Tip Ranks gave POSH a PT of 85 suggesting a 115 upside Lowest PT on POSH is 52 31 upside Looking at the tape its fair to assume that POSH https twitter com search q 24POSH amp src cashtag click has a lot of negative momentum and MAY CONTINUE TO FALL FOR A BIT I think buying below 35 per share could be a 5 bagger in 3 years if the stars align and a broader macro correction doesn t occur Note from the sharer please read the DD in it s full

nature of the uranium market security of supply means that when price insensitive utilities see prices rising they get squeezed This is not priced in and when this sector runs it has historically provided 20x returns Background Nuclear provides 20 of the electricity for the United States and 50 of its clean energy Greta Thornberry probably gets steamy enough thinking about Uranium to run her own reactor The market cap of all uranium miners is roughly 20 billion For reference with 20 billion you could buy all of the companies that provide fuel for over 50 of the US clean energy and 11 of electricity generated worldwide or you could buy 1 of the following 3 of tesla all of Quantumscape half of Palantir 1 5 of Zoom or 1 3 of the market cap of the unsayable barking corn These could all disappear tomorrow and it wouldn t have too drastic of an impact but you cant just get rid of 11 of electricity worldwide without drastic consequences Nuclear isn t going anywhere anytime soon in fact it looks like it is heating up China and India are making investments into nuclear China is building 11 reactors India 7 the EU is looking to change its taxonomy to include nuclear as ESG friendly America under Trump recently formed the Nuclear Fuel Working group to build up reserves of Uranium and Biden looks set to continue the path being the first democrat in 40 years to support nuclear Carbon neutral cant happen without nuclear solar and wind have Capacity Factors of roughly 20 30 while nuclear has a 90 CF It is beginning to show with many countries extending the licenses to operate of nuclear plants by 20 30 years Sleepy s green new plan talks about advanced reactors likely Small Modular Reactors SMR s that could be very standardized reducing the risk of problems for educational purposes nuclear reactors don t explode they operate with high pressure temperature water that creates hydrogen via hydrolysis which can create a Hindenburg like explosion The Uranium is 3 5 enriched enough to keep the fission process moving but not enough to create a real explosion All of the waste ever generated via uranium would fit on a football field stacked about 10ft tall Nuclear is built into the infrastructure of today and currently there is no substitute for Uranium Talk of thorium tokamaks and fast breeders only 3 out of 444 current nuclear reactors is all well and good but it is not where we are today and for the next decade as building these things is no fast matter the average build time of a reactor is 109 months You all might be retarded but you re not dumb I don t want

year For the innumerate among us that s a 50m lb year deficit that needs to come from somewhere Where does this come from After Fukushima in 2011 Japan started to shut down nuclear reactors and had lots of inventory that they needed to sell flooding the market We can also re enrich the tail assays of spent fuel rather than storing and disposing of it With excess capacity on the market the opportunity cost of underfeeding is lowered and more enrichers started to do this enrichers have caps on the amount of enriching they can do As mining and enriching of natural uranium increases more enrichers will have to switch their facilities over and underfeeding will decrease Utilities also contracted many years in advance at high prices that made sense for the miners during the previous bull cycle these contracts are beginning to expire These and more factors caused uranium prices to plummet to the current level of 30 lb on the spot market At these levels it does not make sense for many mines to operate and thus the 50m lb year deficit Obviously this cannot continue indefinitely or the lights will go out At some point the cost of uranium must go up to incentivize miners to begin mining again The average incremental price to mine uranium is around 60 lb so it is safe to assume that they will not begin mining again until they get contracts for around this price depending on the mine and the Capex necessary to get it out of care and maintenance Uranium cannot be procured immediately and is done years in advance During the last bull cycle many utilities signed contracts for 5 years These contracts are beginning to fall off leaving a lot of uncovered demand for utilities in the future They have not been worried about it thus far carry traders have been buying in the spot and selling over the next year or two to these utilities who are happy not signing long term contracts while the price has been falling When the tide turns you can expect fuel buyers to again begin signing long term contracts to ensure security of supply Once prices start rising the stampede of fuel buyers looking to sign long term contracts to secure supply will begin It is human nature in addition to the fact that it is a fireable offense to not be able to procure Uranium for your reactor while it is not a fireable offense to grossly overpay as long as others are doing the same Security of supply is very important in this industry China recently paid almost half a billion dollars for a 49 equity stake in a Kazakhistan based miner They will still have to pay the market price for the Uranium but they get first dibs on almost half of the Uranium mined The utilities are highly price insensitive it is much more costly to have a multi billion dollar nuclear reactor go offline than pay higher prices for Uranium which make up about 3 of the cost to run the reactor to put it into perspective When the first utilities begin signing these contracts the others will quickly follow suit The price of uranium went from 10 lb in 2003 to over 130 lb in 2008 Over the next several years as uncovered demand begins to start showing up the utilities will realize that almost a decade of underpaying for Uranium is now going to come knocking 60 lb is the floor price capital markets could easily propel the price way higher https preview redd it fnpyafs577x61 png width 708 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0d4852f8b8347c666df779887cdcd8bf6c4e527a Catalysts So when will excess inventories be drawn down Brandon Munro of Bannerman had the following to say about uranium major Kazatomprom s purchases from the spot market to fulfill obligations what is interesting about Kazatomprom s news is not that they need to buy from spot but rather that they have started purchasing so early Other Uranium miners are purchasing from the spot market as well If miners thought there was plenty of supply they would run down their inventories and repurchase at a later date This is not the case and is very revealing Denison recently purchased 2 5m lbs of uranium that required 17 different contracts with 12 counterparties not very indicative of the oversupply we have had in prior years I and all the experts I have been listening to believe that the spot market is getting thin This is crucial when fuel buyers start to see the spot market as thin is when the feedback loop begins But no one wants to be the first mouse to eat the cheese Vimy Resources CEO sums up his conversations with fuel buyers by saying We d rather be the last guy in at 65 than the first guy in at 50 no one wants to be the price maker the first guy going in at above the odds But no one minds being the last guy because You re the hero you secured the supply We are playing a game of musical chairs the music is gonna stop and everyone is just going to grab a chair and pay what they have to Mike Alkin says paraphrasing again They don t get rewarded if they save the rate payers money and they don t get penalized if they have to pay up as long as the peers are doing it They just have different incentives The supply will propel it to 50 lb to continue production 60 lb to undertake new exploration production and capital markets can take it much higher A capital market vessel is that could also act as a catalyst is Sprott Asset Management Sprott is entering into an agreement with Uranium Participation Corp to form the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust It is expected to begin trading on American markets in the second half of 2021 currently there is the Uranium Participation Corp which does this poorly and not on American markets The fund will begin buying and holding physical Uranium similar to GLD holding gold putting further pressure on supply levels Remember how Denison had to have 17 different transactions to purchase 2 5m lbs Sprotts gold trust is 4 6b and its silver trust is 2 4b It will market to all of its commodities holders even a market cap of 1 10 or 1 5 of these funds could be a serious catalyst towards causing utilities to sign long term contracts This happens right around the time that the uranium contracting cycle begins When hedge funds sense blood in the water they will join the frenzy as well there is speculation that the funds are already building their positions Commodities are a good place to be during times of inflation and it appears as though inflation is coming as Jpow keeps the money printer running and lets inflation heat up This could be a good hedge against high growth tech stocks amp x200B https preview redd it 0a6bd57777x61 png width 852 amp

guidance fully funded wapiti acceleration and 77 million non core disposition 874915536 html Sales volumes averaged 80 540 Boe d 43 liquids in the first quarter of 2021 well ahead of the Company s first half 2021 production guidance of 74 000 Boe d to 76 000 Boe d 43 liquids due to significant outperformance at Karr as well as higher than expected field reliability corporately Sales volumes at Karr averaged 33 230 Boe d 55 liquids in the quarter compared to 26 914 Boe d 56 liquids in the fourth quarter of 2020 This increase was driven by strong performance from the six well 3 10 pad that was brought onstream in February and the five well 5 16 West pad that was brought onstream in the fourth quarter of 2020 as well as workovers on the 16 4 pad that were completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 Paramount achieved an important milestone at Karr with first quarter exit sales volumes exceeding targeted plateau production of 40 000 Boe d for the first time and March sales volumes averaging 39 938 Boe d 53 liquids Paramount estimates that 12 to 16 new wells per year will be required to maintain plateau production At plateau production of 40 000 Boe d annual asset level free cash flow at Karr would be 260 million to 290 million 2 Sales volumes at Wapiti averaged 14 107 Boe d 62 liquids in the quarter compared to 10 764 Boe d 64 liquids in the fourth quarter of 2020 The 31 increase in sales volumes was primarily due to new well production from the 5 3 West pad that was brought onstream partway through the fourth quarter First quarter capital spending totaled 59 3 million which was focused on drilling and completion activities at Karr and Wapiti Description Catalyst Paramount Resources is one of the oldest publicly traded oil and gas companies with over 2 million net acres of land in Canada The stock is trading at multi year lows and I believe has an expected return of between 200 and 300 in the next year The most important catalyst should happen very soon growth in Q2 19 from their new Wapiti field in Alberta Given the age of the company IPO in 1978 legacy field production is much lower than typical shale fields and requires much less capital to sustain With a lower declining base and new production from Wapiti Paramount s production should increase after a year of declining To oversimplify oil and gas stocks typically move higher when production is higher than expected With Paramount s stock near 20 year lows and production about to start growing after a year of declining the stock should have a strong tailwind towards realizing my price target of 20 share I believe downside is limited outside of macro oil price shocks given how low expectations are Business Description Paramount has production from three regions but for simplicity s sake only one of the regions matters to the upside valuation case The three regions are Grand Prairie where the crown jewel assets of Karr and Wapiti reside Kaybob Region will likely decline 15 20 per year and Central Alberta will likely decline 10 15 per year The most important region is Grand Prairie which is currently 1 3rd of production and consists of the Karr and Wapiti regions Wells here have payback periods of approximately 15 months making them amongst the top oil wells in North America Paramount has drilled over thirty wells at Karr and has seen consistent results The Wapiti region which is right next door to Karr just had their first wells turn online in April May when Keyera s gas processing facility came online The main growth driver for Paramount will be Karr and Wapiti History and Why the Stock is Mispriced Today s investment opportunity exists because of what transpired in the last two years In 2017 Paramount bought Apache s assets in Canada The crown jewel of Apache Canada was the Wapiti region in Alberta however production from Wapiti could not start growing until mid 2019 as Paramount had to wait for Keyera to finish building infrastructure in the region This meant that 2018 should be uneventful year with no growth Guidance in 2018 was set at flat production of 100kboepd However actual production came in at 86kboepd Paramount s stock fell as most oil and gas stocks do when guidance is reduced The bear thesis on POU is simple production went from 95kboepd in Q4 17 to 85kboepd in Q4 18 despite 600m of capex and management s initial promise of 100kboped of production Bears don t believe management s new 2019 guidance for growth to 85 90kboepd in Q4 19 with only 350m of capex These are the primary reasons why the stock is priced near 20 year lows today The bridge from 95kbodp in Q4 17 to 85kboepd Q4 18 is as follows 5kboepd less from an asset sale Resthaven land 5kboepd less from disappointing results in their new Duvernay land exploration region that didn t work guidance should have been set more conservatively 5kboepd less from various midstream and third party issues Expectations for 2019 production growth are therefore extremely low I believe Paramount s production will exit at nearly 100mboepd guidance is for 85 90 My simple math is as follows Karr Q4 18 production was 27kboepd This has been their best asset recently and production was kept flat in 2018 exit to exit because of midstream constraints The company expanded their infrastructure slightly in 2H 18 and I believe production could exit 2019 around 30kboepd Wapiti The company had zero production here in Q4 18 but began turning online wells in May April when the long awaited Keyera gas processing facility turned online The company will have over 20 wells drilled and completed this year and has guided to an average IP 365 of 1395 boepd If you multiple 20 by 1395 you get nearly 28kboepd of incremental production averaged over the whole year These wells start off at much higher rates initially and not all 20 wells will be turned online immediately I believe Wapiti could therefore exit 2019 producing 20kboepd Kaybob region This is a mature old field with a 20 decline rate The company is drilling a few new wells here and I think production will decline 5 from Q4 18 of 37kboepd to 35kboepd in Q4 19 Central Alberta This is another mature old and gas field with a 15 decline rate I think production will therefore go from 20kboepd in Q4 18 to 17kboepd in Q4 19 Summary Q4 19 estimate Karr at 30 Wapiti at 20 Kaybob at 35 and Central Alberta at 20 105kboepd of production versus guidance of 85 90 I believe 2019 guidance was set conservatively because a new investor relations team which arrived later in 2018 after initial guidance was set did not want to repeat the old team s mistakes from last year Why will Wapiti results be good Paramount turned online their first wells at Wapiti in the 2nd quarter and initial results should be released with Q2 earnings in August Production could not start until Keyera finished building its gas processing plant in the region which it did in the 2nd quarter of this year Various operators with consistently good well results surround Paramount s Wapiti region Below is a map to show proximity Paramount s Wapiti type curve shows the wells have payback periods of 15 months and IRRs of 45 at 55 oil Here are neighboring well results that give me confidence in Paramount s Wapiti estimates Paramount s Karr region directly south of Wapiti and over 30 wells have been drilled here Average returns are 64 with 18 month payouts NuVista s Gold Creek acreage directly west of Wapiti with 40 IRRs Production in this region started in 2017 and so NuVista has plenty of well history underpinning its type curve Pipestone Energy s acreage directly north of Wapiti with 60 IRRs All IRRs referenced above assume a 55 WTI oil price Potential asset sales Given the age of the company Paramount has plenty of assets both oil and gas acreage and infrastructure that they could sell Some analysts believe they could sell their infrastructure at Karr Karr is currently Paramount s best land 64 IRRs referenced above and inventory life is substantial Below is my math on Karr s potential infrastructure value Valuation Upside If Paramount exits 2019 at over 100kboepd estimated they could produce between 110 and 120kboepd in 2020 At 55 oil WTI and 5 condensate differentials EBITDA would be 600m My EBITDA estimate is after paying their annual abandonment liability Subtracting debt of 800m and assuming 5x EBITDA equity value is over 2 2bn and 17 share Downside If we take 2019 EBITDA consensus of 350m most sell side is bearish neutral on the stock and apply a low 4x multiple after subtracting 800m of debt the valuation target becomes 4 60 share Downside is therefore 30 I could imagine such downside scenario if Wapiti results are delayed for some reason infrastructure constraints or operational problems that have plagued Paramount in the past Risks Abandonment liability Paramount has a 800m abandonment liability which it pays out 30m per year Recently in Alberta the government ruled that in bankruptcy the abandonment liability of an oil and gas company becomes senior to bank debt As such some investors are concerned that Paramount s large abandonment liability could cause its revolver size to be reduced and negatively impact the company s liquidity However Paramount s revolver does not mature until November of 2022 The company has drawn 800m on their 1 5bn revolver and as such have plenty of liquidity in the interim I think the company will have material free cash flow after 2020 and so the size of its revolver will become less relevant after 2022 Guidance in 2019 is reduced bears will point out that Paramount reduced guidance in 2018 and the company s track record of executing against guidance isn t good If for whatever reason Paramount reduces 2019 guidance because Wapiti wells are below type curve or infrastructure issues creep up again I think downside to the stock is 30 Please see my valuation section above Oil gas prices this risk is common to any oil and gas company One could hedge out these risks by shorting another oil and gas producer In the interest of full disclosure of potential conflicts I work for a company that currently has a long position in Paramount Resources The opinions presented here are my own and are based on my research alone and are not necessarily those of my employer There is no guarantee that the price targets I ve modeled will be reached and the share price could actually decrease depending on trading dynamics company announcements market conditions and other unknown factors Catalyst Market does the math

gambling in 2020 before the pandemic and have been looking for high potential long term plays peaked at 1 million after starting with 1k u SIR JACK A LOT is a big inspiration show us the loss porn dude Today I will cover ASTS AST Space Mobile https npa corp com wp content uploads AST SpaceMobile Investor Presentation Public 12 15 20 pdf The company will provide 5G capabilities to regular cellphones from space they target the 5 billion phones moving in and out of coverage every day or in monetary terms 1T in TAM Why should you care The recent market hit to high growth speculative plays has not spared ASTS This has put the stock at a relatively attractive valuation at approximately 1 2B cheaper than for PIPE investors who bought in at 1 4B The company represents the most asymmetric risk reward play on the market right now It will either 20x 100x or go bust Let me explain if they get only 1 of their TAM which is 10B then at a cheap assuming about 80 net margin thanks to their 90 EBITDA margin P E ratio of 12x telecom industry average is 30x according to Damodaran http pages stern nyu edu adamodar New Home Page datafile pedata html it gives the company a 96B market capitalization representing an 80x opportunity Alright 100x if everything goes well right Yes let me tell you why I and many others some incredible DD from other investors like u apan man think that the company will succeed Because this is a highly speculative play and will give you a VC like risk reward exposure I analyzed it like a VC using the BMC desirability feasibility and viability Desirability Targeted Segment Their satellites will offer services to large telecom companies which will help telecom companies expand their subscriber base and have a unique competitive advantage against other carriers Think of AST s satellites like 5G towers in space Of the currently 5B existing end users the company has 800M subscribers under exclusivity agreements with companies like Vodafone AT amp T Rakuten Telefonica Ooredoo Telstra and others To put this a bit into perspective the only other company really trying to achieve that is Lynk https lynk global but they have only 10M in funding compared to 464M for ASTS and currently do not have any commercial agreements Customer Relationships amp Channels All the customer relationship services as well as sales efforts are done by the carriers Basically AST provides the 5G capability and the carrier offers it to its subscribers moving in and out of coverage This is a good reason why the future cost structure of ASTS is so attractive Value Proposition Designed to eliminate coverage gaps and enable billions of people globally to stay connected through their mobile phones Imagine watching hot tub streams on the plane Feasibility Key Partners In the value chain AST designs integrates and tests the satellites while their subsidiary Nanoavionics builds the main components They will use any available launch services such as SpaceX Blue Origin GK Launch Services Ariane etc The fact that they have a wide array of choices available greatly reduces successful launch risks Moreover the main reason why the space based applications industry will absolutely explode in the coming years is the ever decreasing launch costs price to send a kg of payload in space https www futuretimeline net data trends images rocket launch costs trend jpg Regarding financial and strategic partners the company has received funding from Vodafone Rakuten American Tower and Samsung in previous rounds as well as in the PIPE 12 month lock up Key Activities AST will design and integrate the satellites The company s CEO Abel Avellan is also a big believer in creating huge barriers to entry they patent a lot of the key elements of their business model Of course their biggest focus is getting the service up and running by 2023 Abel is also working on new wireless carrier agreements To give you an idea on average 1 telecom adds around 200M subscribers Future agreements won t be mutually exclusive like with Vodafone so they can add as many carriers as they want Key Resources Talent technology and funding Abel Avellan is not much of a salesman but he is a genius he seeded AST and was the main contributor to a lot of the technologies that enable the 5G satellites to work As mentioned previously they managed to attract funding from Vodafone American Tower and Rakuten Vodafone spent nearly 18 months doing due diligence on AST s technology and has concluded that it works For further funding ASTS is participating in the 9B 5G rural fund for America http licensing fcc gov cgi bin ws exe prod ib forms reports related filing hts f key 441408 amp f number SATPDR2020041300034 They currently have the support of 7 senators bipartisan and AT amp T In my opinion there is the potential for AST to get about 1B in non dilutive funding from the government which would significantly accelerate the company s plan for global coverage Viability Revenue Streams Revenues come from an agreement with telecom providers basically comes in the form of a monthly subscription fee The end user is seamlessly connected from towers on the ground to AST satellites Cost Structure Because the satellites are in LEO orbit they will need to be changed every 5 7 years The company is working on a way to repair extend the lifetime of existing satellites Now let s talk about an important topic Risk Risk Tech nichal nology risks Launch delays for BW3 final full size prototype might increase costs especially as they are not the main ride on the launch vehicle This is a risk in the short term as the launch is scheduled for Q4 2021 Technology does not work While I think this has been largely minimized after the successful launch of BW1 there are some smarter people that believe it is both effective and amazing The company does not get licenses to operate the frequencies in target countries Abel and the Board of Directors are very well connected and they have the support of huge telecom companies like Vodafone Commercial risks End users do not see value in extended coverage from their current carriers Difficult to see why that would be the case Telecom companies do not see value in AST s offering AST Space Mobile has already a lot of agreements in place that suggests otherwise From a risk perspective technical and technological risks are quite high and are the big reason why the stock has not priced in the potential upside The company could literally go to 0 or close to it if they can sell some of their techs patents etc However I believe the company offers a unique risk reward ratio that is difficult to find on the market The long term play Shares shares shares The short term play The stock has been severely beaten down and could regain some momentum in the coming weeks Furthermore the stock has a relatively small float and could be very explosive on any news such as new carrier agreements analyst coverage etc Abel Avellan has mentioned that they are in the process of signing a new 500M subscribers agreement and the silent period ends this Friday TL DR ASTS is the most asymmetric play on the market right either 100x or 0x in a few years Disclosure 35 000 shares Edit While we may see movement on catalysts after the silent period ends this is mainly a long term 2 3 years investment into a very asymmetric opportunity Edit2 Thanks for all the feedback so far I added a Risk section

relatively new Retard I am going to list out a handful of things that even though I had done a fair amount of research before opening up a trading account It was not nearly enough and below are things that I in hindsight I wish I would have read somewhere or seen advice on More often than not when you read news on a company and expect the price to soar because of that news That news is probably already reflected in the price for that stock The best example of this is DKNG The news for this company in Q1 has been fucking outstanding New partnerships and or exclusive partnerships with almost every major sports organization New states legalizing Sportsbooks Cathie Wood buying a large number of shares for her portfolios Fantastic YoY growth Purchasing or expanding their media footprint At face value all of this news should have them trading at least 40 higher than what they were at for Jan 1 But it isn t it is trading at about 15 higher than what it was then As I mentioned more often than not all of that news is factored into the stock days if not weeks before any public announcement or article publishing that Take your fucking profits and cut your fucking losses The best advice I have ever heard is to set your profit loss orders 20 for profit and 16 for loss Set it and forget it Period Or if you are comfortable taking any profit at all take your 5 and exit Whatever you are best for your financial situation and portfolio Or if you are long on the stock don t even look at the daily trend for it If you know your entry and you know where you want to exit The same thing set it and forget it Looking at the daily will only cause stress Trust me I fucking know RKT is my example of that I currently have 25 shares in RKT on an AVG entry of 22 8 But I should ve my fucking profit when it peaked at 43 in March Pocked my gains and entered back in after it dropped and averaged out But no I held I held hoping their Q1 earnings would drive it higher than what it was in March Guess what It fucking didn t It dropped to a little over 19 per share today I am long on RKT as they are going to be an absolute juggernaut for the next 5 years in their industry BUT I should ve taken my profits and re entered I m retarded You re retarded We re all fucking dipshits and if you think you re not then you re probably the biggest dipshit in here Now that is out of the way Don t invest in a stock company if you don t understand what the fuck they are actually doing MVIS is that example for me Read pages and pages of honestly still very good DD But it might have well of been written in hieroglyphs because I didn t and don t understand a god damn word of it Something about LIDAR and some beep boop shit that is going to enable robots and cars to detect shit I don t know I don t understand it But invested and closed a position in a different great company because it was trending in the cesspool of mouth breathers Entered at 22 and cut my losses at 16 per share YTD because of what I threw at it It is my most significant loss and I am sure they are a great company with a giant upside in the future but I don t understand it and won t be opening another position on it unless my low functioning brain can eventually process what they are doing probably not going to happen Oh well it taught me a great lesson Trying to play earnings is risky to say the least Again RKT is a great example of that Honestly their earnings report was overall very good and they only slightly missed their projections But because they did miss it it has fallen around 20 Also even if the company beats its earnings projection it may the stock may not increase a whole lot If any and for some odd fucking reason it could even go drop Look at AMD that ticker confuses me almost as much as DKNG AMD is a great long stock as well but good luck trying to predict what the fuck is actually going to do before or after earnings I mean shit really even daily Do you own god damn DD Read every DD post on here and take it with a grain of salt More often than not the DD is pretty well written and researched but it is almost always written by someone who has a large number of shares or portfolio in that It s like listening to a Wendy s employee tell you that they have the best fries and no other fries compared to theirs Well yeah mother fucker you work there and have a vested interest in trying to convince me of how great your fries are If you Figure out your own goals with your portfolio Whether that s you being a daily trader and closing and opening positions daily or picking your stocks to go long in Or split your portfolio in half and do both Up to you but you need to know what you are trying to achieve with it and have a clear path laid out of doing so If you are able to put everything you can into a Roth IRA it is exempt from capital gains tax You can put a maximum of 6 000 in it per year Do that before you put any money anywhere else You have to have it longer than 5 years before you should even think about withdrawing any money out of But really you shouldn t withdraw anything out of it ever Have an individual account with fuck around money or to have access for a rainy day or emergency funds or whatever You will pay capital gains tax on it yearly but that just is what it is ETF s are boring as fuck and not sexy but they keep your portfolio balanced and are really just less risky as you are investing in a wide variety of stocks that you might not be able to afford individually Take TQQQ for example For most investors especially as they are starting off you won t have 700 or so readily available to throw at tickers like TSLA or NVDA But you can invest in shares with them by purchasing ETFs that already have shares on them Paper trading is an underutilized resource It allows you to experiment in investing without legitimately risking anything financially Do it Do it even if you ve been trading for a while It is an excellent technique for perfecting or just training yourself on the market Finally you re not DeepFuckingValue He researched for months if not years and followed GME as in depth as he could and read pretty much everything readily available on them Researched Board members followed market trends and ultimately he had fuck around money where he could throw a significant amount of money at it Everything obviously worked out in his favor but it could have just as easily not GME could have very easily gone bankrupt as there were a lot of really intelligent people who thought they could and cited them and their business model as very similar to Blockbuster Chances are you are not going to do the amount of research on any stock with as much as he did for GME Don t pretend you will and don t lie to yourself saying you will I joined here in January and have learned so much But again I m a fucking idiot and so are you amp x200B If you have any advice you wish you would ve been told when you first started Please add it

Voltaire s prediction in 1729 that Paper Money Eventually Returns To Its Intrinsic Value ZERO Like Matt Piepenburg Voltaire knew he would be right because history has 100s of examples of governments and central banks destroying the currency Biden Yellen don t really need to do much since the dollar is already down 90 since 1913 INFLATION IS HERE So far the 10s of trillions of printed money has not translated into inflation in official consumer prices But we are now seeing major inflation in commodity prices If we just look at food commodity prices they are up 54 since July 2020 And if we look at general commodity prices up 89 since April 2020 they are telling us that hyperinflation is not far away It would lead to a highly destructive deflationary depression after a short lived hyperinflationary period as central banks apply the only trick they know UNLIMITED MONEY PRINTING But this time the world will finally discover that printed money has low value DOW GOLD RATIO All of the above is history Even though gold has yielded an excellent return it is what happens to the Dow Gold ratio in the future that determines if investors should stay with stocks or hold gold Gold bottomed at 250 in 1999 as the ratio peaked at 45 The ratio subsequently fell to 5 in 2011 and corrected from there to 22 5 in 2018 Since 2018 the Dow Gold downtrend has resumed The indicator of The MACD turned down in 2019 for the first time since the 1999 top This is a very strong sign that Dow Gold has now resumed the long term downtrend If we then look at the long term picture of the Dow Gold ratio it gives us a very good idea of where we are heading The initial target is a ratio of 1 to 1 as in 1980 when the Dow was 850 and gold 850 REDDIT ATTACK SILVER MARKET The ultimate insurance against a total destruction of your wealth is obviously physical gold and silver stored outside the financial system Digital currency might be a good speculative investment and might also work as a payment method if central banks don t ban it But it has nothing to do with real wealth preservation Silver is normally the leading indicator for the precious metals Following the spectacular short squeeze in Gamestop by the Reddit group Wallstreetbets there is now speculation that the same could happen with silver Yes everything is possible But remember that in the gold and silver markets against the Reddit players there will be The BIS Bank of International Settlement The Fed ECB and other central banks Plus the bullion banks So a lot of fire power to beat compared to the Gamestop opposition SILVER THE INVESTMENT OF THE DECADE The silver market is one of the most toxic of all Heavily manipulated and with bullion banks now being 700 million oz of silver short on Comex and with no liquidity in London as Alasdair Macleod has pointed out Still even if not in the next month or two silver will win this game in the medium and long term as the dosage of paper silver shorts is much too big to survive a short squeeze I would not be surprised to see the 1980 and 2011 50 high to be taken out in 2021 So silver will lead the metals and the gold silver ratio now at 67 will initially reach 30 like The long term target is likely to be a lot lower probably 15 or below Expect 2021 to be the year when investors wake up to the fact that gold is actually the best wealth protection you can hold and silver the investment of the decade WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS The printed 8 trillion at 15 per hour Biden s new minimum wage equals 60 million man hours But in the modern MMT Money Market Theory paradigm you don t need to work for the money Whatever the world needs central banks and governments can just create out of nothing That is until the music stops And Biden or Harris are the likely conductors who will preside over the music stopping and the whole edifice collapsing The wise will obviously find a chair already now because when the music stops there will be no chairs free and all hell will break loose By that time debt will not just be in the trillions or 30 of trillions No the printing will have reached and EUR 100 trillions as not only most collapsing debt will need to be bought by central banks but also derivatives which probably amount to several trillions or more In addition medical care social security and unfunded pensions will probably exceed several hundred trillions usd globally and add to the demise of the financial system Could I be wrong Maybe A close friend gave me once a T shirt with the inscription I AM NOT ALWAYS RIGHT But I am never wrong The gift must have been a subtle hint Hmmm Still in my imho I don t believe that any orderly reset will change the inevitable course of events So as far as I am concerned it is not IF but WHEN But as I see risk at an extreme now is the time to prepare Precious metals will clearly not solve all our problems as the world economy implodes But it is better to hold the only money that has survived in history In virtually every period of crisis in history gold and silver has been a surety addendum from mr Egon von greyerz

amp format png amp auto webp amp s 7f2048fe8bbad98cc93e86d4e5bdd147e0fc3d72 Dear Mr Gensler Oh wrinkliest of all apes I know you ve been thrown in the deep end but we apes have faith in you We believe you will do your best to protect us So after watching all the hearings sometimes 3 4 times and reading all the testimonies only once though because they didn t have a TLDR section I have constructed a draft action plan for you When you talked about protecting the backbone that is the support structure for the USA it made me emotional I felt it That s who we apes are we are your backbone We are the young moms and pops we are the gamers we are the lost generations we are the people who make the world work and we believe in you Take our strength and be the Vanguard and lead us into battle This a blueprint Just some ideas I have jotted down from a basic ape who has been through this whole experience battle by battle read every DD laughed at every meme studied every theory and by the way I m not the only one who has done that because as you read this Mr Gensler another two apes are reading this that has been through the exact same journey as me Figuratively she is my sister and he is my brother I ve tried to look at the position from both sides to understand it because I needed to check I was fighting on the right side and I truly believe I am So here is a 13 action blueprint we love the number 13 almost as much as 420 and 69 in case you hadn t guessed that you can use for inspiration on how to dismantle it and then put it all back properly A Blueprint to Protect the Retail Investors 1 Action Increasing the decimal trading value by 2 points x100 to allow more trades to be executed on public exchanges The national Best Bid and Offer should be based on 100ths of a Cent Result More trades can be executed in Lit Public Exchanges increasing Liquidity Result Retail Investors will get access to better pricing that is very similar to everyone else Ape Sell stonk at 402 6969 not just 402 69 2 Action Do Not Allow Payment for Order Flow PFOF Result PFOF prevents the best execution removing it will help to ensure but won t guarantee that the best execution for retail investors is maintained Result The actual cost of trading will be more transparent instead of being hidden behind a secretive fee deal between the exchange and broker Ape Kenny can t pay Vlad to turn a blind eye when he steals Bananas from Apes 3 Action Order execution for Retail Accounts should not be allowed to be routed outside of a Lit exchange Result Greater Transparency of the volume created by Retail Investors Result Much harder to manipulate price direction by allowing specific orders to be processed in a Lit Exchange and other orders to be processed in Dark Pools Ape Apes drown in dark pools 4 Action Eliminate Priority Order Types There should not exist order types for a particular organisation that effectively prioritise their BUY SELL orders over Retail traders Orders should be timestamped and executed according to the timestamp only Result This will help prevent High Frequency Traders from profiting from the benefits provided from their access to infrastructure and order types by placing orders ahead of Retail Investor Orders eg Trading Infront by jumping ahead in the Order Queue Result This will mean that all the tools of the trading playing field are available to all members regardless of their size and infrastructure Ape Kenny can t push to the front of the queue to pick the best Bananas he has to wait in line 5 Action Short Selling transactions should not be allowed to take place unless an actual share can be located BEFORE the sale If a share is marked as already Lent Shorted then it cannot be lent again Result This will prevent stock from being short sold more than 100 of the available float Ape Ape can t eat plastic Banana Sell real Bananas only 6 Action Short Sellers that short a stock more than 5 should have to file a report with the SEC just like they do when buying more than 5 of a stock If they have shorted a stock then the margin account at the DTC should account for the repurchase of the shorted shares at market price Result Greater Transparency Result This should limit the squeeze exposure a single organisation has with a single stock Therefore limiting their margin exposure and hopefully reducing the risk of being unable to buy the stock if the stock price rises dramatically Ape Kenny needs to go to tell King Gary if he sells lots of Bananas 7 Action Cease the Failure to Deliver FTD facility Suppose a stockbroker is reporting an FTD then the DTCC should use the funds set aside in the brokers deposit account to buy the stock at market price after hours to nullify the FTD Result It s more difficult to use advanced obfuscation techniques that utilise the FTD system eg Hiding Naked Shorts in FTD System Ape If Kenny loses the Banana he borrowed from Ape he must buy ape a new Banana 8 Action Reduce the Settlement time for transactions to the end of the same day Use T EOD not T 2 T 5 T 13 or even the T 21 that is permitted in some circumstances still to Market Makers like Citadel Result Reduced amount of funding needed to cover margin and leverage accounts Result Difficult to use advanced obfuscation techniques that utilise the T n system e g Resetting repayment dates and schedules on borrowed shares Ape Pay for your bananas on the day you bought them Apes know tomorrow never comes 9 Action Clearly define the US Regulations for Retailer Investor Rights State that by laws cannot be created by brokers that remove a Retail Investors fundamental privileges For example if US Regulations state a purchaser of record is allowed to proxy vote then the Retailer has the right to vote Regardless of any Terms and Conditions that may have been agreed to by the Retailer Investor If the Broker can t provide the US Regulations basic standards they shouldn t be licensed to service the Retailer Market Result Retailers will have supreme confidence in US Regulations for Retailer Investor Rights as a fundamental code of conduct between brokers that is ultimately reinforced by US regulations Result Improved confidence will bring greater investment from the growing Retail Investor Market and provide a real alternative to foreign investment markets or digital assets Ape If Uncle Sam says Ape gets a vote then Ape gets the vote even if Vlad says No 10 Action Investigate Problem stocks Regularly Initiating a total systematic recall for stocks whose basic statistics reveal that more than 100 of the companies issued shares exist in the market place via Re hypothecation The market capital value should be used to determine which company stocks take priority Result Less chance of companies being shorted over 100 Result Provides an opportunity to dispose of vast amounts of outstanding FTDs that have been created by Financial Terroriststs rehypothecating over 85 of all short sold companies for decades that is currently slowly eating away the fundamental security of US Stock Market Apes Gary must force Kenny to dispose of his Toxic Waste properly 11 Action Increase Fine amount so they are a deterrent to using the technique not a cost of business Result High Frequency Traders will be forced to be played by the rules of the market more often Result Bad Practice and Bad Actors should be reduced Ape If Kenny steals a Banana he must repay two Bananas back 12 Action Standard Retailers should only be able to purchase stocks with Cash until they have levelled up or proved their knowledge and understanding of the risks involved in margin accounts leverage shorting etc Result Greater Educational Standards and Methods to increase general retailer knowledge Result If a broker proves they are not providing adequate training and testing of knowledge before unlocking more advanced features they will lose their ability to trade directly with the Retail Investor Market Ape Ape can only buy bananas until they get wrinkles If Vlad doesn t teach Ape how to be wrinkly then he can t be a Banana Seller 13 Action If a broker provides advanced stock trading methods directly to Retail Investors such as margin accounts and derivatives each account holder must have access to 24 7 online chat telephone customer support Result If the education system fails the retailer investor then the ape should be able to contact a representative of the company in a reasonable time otherwise they lose their license to trade directly with the Retail Investors Ape If apes lose bananas then they can get help to prevent hurting themselves Rest in Peace Alex Kearns

nature of the uranium market security of supply means that when price insensitive utilities see prices rising they get squeezed This is not priced in and when this sector runs it has historically provided 20x returns Background Nuclear provides 20 of the electricity for the United States and 50 of its clean energy Greta Thornberry probably gets steamy enough thinking about Uranium to run her own reactor The market cap of all uranium miners is roughly 20 billion For reference with 20 billion you could buy all of the companies that provide fuel for over 50 of the US clean energy and 11 of electricity generated worldwide or you could buy 1 of the following 3 of tesla all of Quantumscape half of Palantir 1 5 of Zoom or 1 3 of the market cap of the unsayable barking corn These could all disappear tomorrow and it wouldn t have too drastic of an impact but you cant just get rid of 11 of electricity worldwide without drastic consequences Nuclear isn t going anywhere anytime soon in fact it looks like it is heating up China and India are making investments into nuclear China is building 11 reactors India 7 the EU is looking to change its taxonomy to include nuclear as a certain group friendly automod blocks me if i say the word America under Trump recently formed the Nuclear Fuel Working group to build up reserves of Uranium and Biden looks set to continue the path being the first democrat in 40 years to support nuclear Carbon neutral cant happen without nuclear solar and wind have Capacity Factors of roughly 20 30 while nuclear has a 90 CF It is beginning to show with many countries extending the licenses to operate of nuclear plants by 20 30 years Sleepy s green new plan talks about advanced reactors likely Small Modular Reactors SMR s that could be very standardized reducing the risk of problems for educational purposes nuclear reactors don t explode they operate with high pressure temperature water that creates hydrogen via hydrolysis which can create a Hindenburg like explosion The Uranium is 3 5 enriched enough to keep the fission process moving but not enough to create a real explosion All of the waste ever generated via uranium would fit on a football field stacked about 10ft tall Nuclear is built into the infrastructure of today and currently there is no substitute for Uranium Talk of thorium tokamaks and fast breeders only 3 out of 444 current nuclear reactors is all well and good but it is not where we are today and for the next decade as building these things is no fast matter the average build time of a reactor is 109 months You all might be retarded but you re not dumb I don t want to see any talk about how nuclear is bad for the environment in the comments amp x200B Processing img idt5a5g9ukx61 Excerpt from American Jobs Plan Fact Sheet amp x200B Processing img klxyr2naukx61 Structural supply deficit We use roughly 180m lbs of uranium per year and we mine around 130m lbs per year For the innumerate among us that s a 50m lb year deficit that needs to come from somewhere Where does this come from After Fukushima in 2011 Japan started to shut down nuclear reactors and had lots of inventory that they needed to sell flooding the market We can also re enrich the tail assays of spent fuel rather than storing and disposing of it With excess capacity on the market the opportunity cost of underfeeding is lowered and more enrichers started to do this enrichers have caps on the amount of enriching they can do As mining and enriching of natural uranium increases more enrichers will have to switch their facilities over and underfeeding will decrease Utilities also contracted many years in advance at high prices that made sense for the miners during the previous bull cycle these contracts are beginning to expire These and more factors caused uranium prices to plummet to the current level of 30 lb on the spot market At these levels it does not make sense for many mines to operate and thus the 50m lb year deficit Obviously this cannot continue indefinitely or the lights will go out At some point the cost of uranium must go up to incentivize miners to begin mining again The average incremental price to mine uranium is around 60 lb so it is safe to assume that they will not begin mining again until they get contracts for around this price depending on the mine and the Capex necessary to get it out of care and maintenance Uranium cannot be procured immediately and is done years in advance During the last bull cycle many utilities signed contracts for 5 years These contracts are beginning to fall off leaving a lot of uncovered demand for utilities in the future They have not been worried about it thus far carry traders have been buying in the spot and selling over the next year or two to these utilities who are happy not signing long term contracts while the price has been falling When the tide turns you can expect fuel buyers to again begin signing long term contracts to ensure security of supply Once prices start rising the stampede of fuel buyers looking to sign long term contracts to secure supply will begin It is human nature in addition to the fact that it is a fireable offense to not be able to procure Uranium for your reactor while it is not a fireable offense to grossly overpay as long as others are doing the same Security of supply is very important in this industry China recently paid almost half a billion dollars for a 49 equity stake in a Kazakhistan based miner They will still have to pay the market price for the Uranium but they get first dibs on almost half of the Uranium mined The utilities are highly price insensitive it is much more costly to have a multi billion dollar nuclear reactor go offline than pay higher prices for Uranium which make up about 3 of the cost to run the reactor to put it into perspective When the first utilities begin signing these contracts the others will quickly follow suit The price of uranium went from 10 lb in 2003 to over 130 lb in 2008 Over the next several years as uncovered demand begins to start showing up the utilities will realize that almost a decade of underpaying for Uranium is now going to come knocking 60 lb is the floor price capital markets could easily propel the price way higher amp x200B Processing img mifcc0xbukx61 Catalysts So when will excess inventories be drawn down Brandon Munro of Bannerman had the following to say about uranium major Kazatomprom s purchases from the spot market to fulfill obligations what is interesting about Kazatomprom s news is not that they need to buy from spot but rather that they have started purchasing so early Other Uranium miners are purchasing from the spot market as well If miners thought there was plenty of supply they would run down their inventories and repurchase at a later date This is not the case and is very revealing Denison recently purchased 2 5m lbs of uranium that required 17 different contracts with 12 counterparties not very indicative of the oversupply we have had in prior years I and all the experts I have been listening to believe that the spot market is getting thin This is crucial when fuel buyers start to see the spot market as thin is when the feedback loop begins But no one wants to be the first mouse to eat the cheese Vimy Resources CEO sums up his conversations with fuel buyers by saying We d rather be the last guy in at 65 than the first guy in at 50 no one wants to be the price maker the first guy going in at above the odds But no one minds being the last guy because You re the hero you secured the supply We are playing a game of musical chairs the music is gonna stop and everyone is just going to grab a chair and pay what they have to Mike Alkin says paraphrasing again They don t get rewarded if they save the rate payers money and they don t get penalized if they have to pay up as long as the peers are doing it They just have different incentives The supply will propel it to 50 lb to continue production 60 lb to undertake new exploration production and capital markets can take it much higher A capital market vessel is that could also act as a catalyst is Sprott Asset Management Sprott is entering into an agreement with Uranium Participation Corp to form the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust It is expected to begin trading on American markets in the second half of 2021 currently there is the Uranium Participation Corp which does this poorly and not on American markets The fund will begin buying and holding physical Uranium similar to GLD holding gold putting further pressure on supply levels Remember how Denison had to have 17 different transactions to purchase 2 5m lbs Sprotts gold trust is 4 6b and its silver trust is 2 4b It will market to all of its commodities holders even a market cap of 1 10 or 1 5 of these funds could be a serious catalyst towards causing utilities to sign long term contracts This happens right around the time that the uranium contracting cycle begins When hedge funds sense blood in the water they will join the frenzy as well there is speculation that the funds are already building their positions Commodities are a good place to be during times of inflation and it appears as though inflation is coming as Jpow keeps the money printer running and lets inflation heat up This could be a good hedge against high growth
