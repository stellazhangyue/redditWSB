investor who likes stocks Do your due diligence before purchasing shares and make sure you invest what you can afford to throw away without feeling guilty about it Hello ladies and gentlemen Here in this immaculate sophisticate and intellectual universe called the Internet all the great scholars know the name Roblox For the unintelligent who doesn t know it s a platform for content creators to make great games for everyone to enjoy Some of the popular games include Natural Disaster Survival Phantom Forces Work at a Pizza Place Speed Run 4 and much more In November 2020 Roblox announced that they would make an Initial Public Offering on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol RBLX Unfortunately they temporarily suspended the plans because they wanted to work with our advisors to see how we can make improvements to its market debut When we thought Roblox would debut in February we get horrific news Roblox delayed IPO for a second time following SEC scrutiny What a tragedy Thankfully they ve now announced a new date March this time through a Direct Listing Finally Digging through their financials it seems that Roblox the meme that came and went isn t what I first thought and I would like to share that with you today The following information was submitted to the SEC as an S 1 Registration Statement Form on November 19 2020 You can find the archive here https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1315098 000119312520298230 d87104ds1 htm INDEX In 2019 revenue was 488 2 million a 56 increase from 312 8 million the year before In 2020 revenue was 588 7 million a 68 increase from 349 9 million a year ago Bookings also grew In 2019 it was 694 3 million a 39 increase from 499 0 million in 2018 In 2020 it was 1 24 billion a 171 increase from 458 0 million in 2019 Net loss was at 97 2 million in 2018 and 86 million in 2019 Furthermore it continued to decrease in 2019 to 46 3 million before an increase to 204 million in 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities was 101 million in 2018 to 99 2 million in 2019 Surprisingly in 2020 it grew to 345 3 million from 62 6 million in 2019 Free cash flow was 35 million in 2018 and 14 5 million in 2019 Additionally it was 6 million in 2019 and 292 6 million in 2020 Based on the information it s clear that Roblox has been investing within its operations Net loss was at 204 million in 2020 However revenue has stayed consistent and bookings have dramatically increased They are not doing anything reckless they are just pumping money into their business to improve the user experience or fund R amp D for future products Their Growth Strategies located on page 7 indicates that they are continually investing in the Roblox Platform including significant investments in high fidelity avatars more realistic experiences 3D spatial audio technology and other social features Page 13 talks about shares The number of shares that would be outstanding when the offer was going to be in place was 477 792 658 for Class A and 57 287 302 shares of Class B common stock Furthermore Class A common stock s weighted average price was 2 98 per share while the weighted average price for Class B common stock was 3 41 per share So based on this information we can calculate the market cap of Roblox 477 792 658 x 2 98 1 42 billion 1 423 822 120 84 57 287 302 x 3 41 195 3 million 195 349 699 82 Total 1 62 billion Est 1 619 171 820 66 The best way to think of Roblox is that it s the YouTube of Steam Steam is a digital distribution service that provides a platform for game developers and third party publishers to sell and promote their games to a vast customer pool while simultaneously profiting by taking a small commission from developers Roblox is very similar it s a digital distribution service for game developers to publish their game environment to a vast customer pool However they profit from Robux sales subscriptions and ads just like YouTube What sets Roblox apart from Steam is that they have a built in development kit that s easy to use Anyone who has some free time can go to Roblox Studio put together a game and release it within a couple of hours without waiting for approval or other complicated steps The limit is the developer s imagination While you can argue that a person can pick up Unity learn the concepts make a game and release it on Steam Roblox Studios is simple and as basic as it gets You don t need to wait for approval you don t need to get into Steam Greenlight to get potential customers to get onto the platform you make a game and get many friends to join you I think Roblox has some good potential Their business model is very different from many video game distributors or publisher platforms It has more ties to YouTube SoundCloud and Twitch than Steam GOG Epic Game Store etc It doesn t have to compete with them and that s their strength in my opinion They are doing something that more popular digital distribution platforms cannot do right now Thank you for reading Any corrections or mistakes let me know I m not a financial advisor I m just a regular investor who likes stocks Do your due diligence before purchasing shares and make sure you invest what you can afford to throw away without feeling guilty about it

last post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lma1ev illegal tactics and dtccprime broker complicity I hypothesize that if naked shorting is present in GME prime brokers and the DTCC which is privately owned by the prime brokers would need to be complicit in it which adds another dimension to whether the retail shutdown 1 28 to stop the squeeze was done for nefarious reasons On the question of whether DTCC was right to shut down trading on 1 28 based on collateral requirements I m not an expert on this subject but I ve seen many compelling arguments against it including how did they arrive at the 3 billion number for Robinhood and why were they able to get negotiated from 3 billion to 700 million per following DTCC s special requirements and why was cash customers restricted vs just margin And why was selling allowed but not buying why not shut off both Another interest point is that the DTCC has often been implicated and accused of enabling naked short selling over the

exists in GameStop the nature of naked shorting means it s not easy to prove There have been hundreds of lawsuits for naked shorting that are often settled out of court because it s difficult to prove If you re an investor in the trade you ve probably noticed that in the past three weeks GME has had a lot of strange things happen to the stock including seeing a precipitous drop in price starting 2 1 and onwards while short interest supposedly dropped These things all make sense if you consider naked shorting occurred In the case of GameStop there are several very strong signs indicators that naked shorting has occurred I will list some of the indicators that Naked Shorting occurred in GameStop below 1 One indicator is GME s extremely high number of Fail to Delivers www wherearetheshares com http www wherearetheshares com which are one of the top in the stock market over a sustained period of time The website www wherearetheshares com http www wherearetheshares com shows extraordinarily high FTIDs extending from 2020 to years back Michael Burry tweeted that in May 2020 when he lent out his GME it took weeks for his brokers to locate the shares https web archive org web 20210130030954 https twitter com michaeljburry lang en https web archive org web 20210130030954 https twitter com michaeljburry lang en FTIDs can happen for a number of reasons but to have this high number of FTIDs over a sustained period of time is highly unusual and a stock with a high number of FTIDs is one potential indicator that counterfeit shares are in circulation and naked shorting occured 2 Short Interest in GME has been extremely high at numbers significantly over 100 of float As of January 15th short interest was 226 https imgur com fN4fVQl https imgur com fN4fVQl of the entire float While it is theoretically possible for short interest to be over 100 with brokers repeatedly leading to each other short interest this high at 226 of the total float is highly unusual and an indicator of naked shorting occured which is a far more feasible scenario because naked shorting enables short interest to rise quickly as you do not need to determine the shares exist before you short 3 Institutions alone have held a staggering 177 of float as of 1 31 according to Bloomberg Terminal https i redd it c44cmb67mtf61 png https i redd it c44cmb67mtf61 png which is highly unusual and could be a strong sign that GME is rampant with counterfeit shares Another interesting datapoint is Fidelity s calculation of retail ownership is only 0 1 float https imgur com a FtSOiCW https imgur com a FtSOiCW which is highly unusual and unlikely to be true any potential indications that counterfeit shares are in play because number of shares to ownership potentially cannot be conclusively determined Another thing worth mentioning is that there seemed to be surprisingly strong price resistance throughout the week of January 25th despite strong buy pressure that saw 100 increases from 26th to 28th with 28th being the day the short squeeze was likely going to happen given the price momentum on that day The squeeze was prevented on Thursday 28th due to market shutdown On Friday 29th the price was surprisingly resistant and there was a price battle that ended at 320 which supposedly would force options to expire and purchase within the next two business days with the anticipation of buy pressure from these options expiring Then on Monday 2 1 there was a momentous price drop and that drop continued through the week Given the continued high short interest and retail interest to force shorts into a short squeeze the price drop made little sense especially because short interest remained high and even if shorts had covered there should ve been an upward price pressure What makes the most sense to me is that the price drop was facilitated by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares in a short down ladder described below Short A will sell a counterfeit share at 10 Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position Short B will then offer a short counterfeit share at 9 Short A will hit that offer or short B will come down and hit Short A s 9 bid Short A buys the share for 9 covering his open 10 short and booking a 1 profit By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral If there happens to be significant long buying then the shorts draw from their reserve of strategic fails to deliver and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand Source http counterfeitingstock com CounterfeitingStock html http counterfeitingstock com CounterfeitingStock html In an ordinary scenario with short interest dropping and shorts needing to buy back to cover the price is anticipated to go up As of 2 1 with GME s reported short interest declining with price also dropping there are signs pointing to shorts artificially covering or lowering their short interest via the generation of synthetic longs using options to cover which is in regulation of Reg SHO this assertion is supported by the high numbers of FTIDs GME has consistently reported And on a wider the indicators that naked shorting occur lay in the clues of consistently high FTIDs one of highest in the stock market over period of years indications that far more GME stock exist then should exist Bloomberg terminal showing 177 institutional ownership of float the excessively high over 200 I short interest numbers and odd and continued price drops from 2 1 onwards particularly which were in my opinion a result of short down ladder attacks done with the aid of counterfeit synthetic shares amplified with panic selling once price fell past a certain threshold Many are aware of the recent findings of shorts using ETFs holding GME to hide FTIDs which also adds to the argument of naked shorting I will recap it here to be complete Another interesting trend noticed with GME is that there have been efforts to try and hide temporarily cover the FTIDs in GameStop It was identified that certain ETFs that hold GME like XRT went down as GME price spiked XRT went on the FTID threshold list on 1 29 and has remained there until this day while this is also the same day that shorts supposedly covered most of their short positions and GME s price spike started to drop which lends credence to the theory that shorts used the GME shares from XRT to artificially cover their failed short positions so GME would come off the threshold list and to give the impression the short squeeze case was over If you look at XRT it is now 180 shorted As explained by u meta cognizant https www reddit com u meta cognizant This is a form of naked shorting GME through XRT Naked shorting ETFs is generally acceptable due to arbitrage but if one goes long on the remainder of the holdings not many in XRT one can naked short GME without doing any arbitrage on the ETF This when coupled with synthetic longs via options gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven t takes GME off the threshold security list when it shouldn t be and provides the ability to naked short GME again source https i imgur com 9roWGHT png https i imgur com 9roWGHT png

the sun amp x200B In every market bubble you always hear the same language the same rationalizations the same absurd arguments These people think they are offering some new unique insight in reality all they offer are the same manic rationalizations that existed in every other bubble market in history Let s address the primary two bull rationalizations today before we set into the bear thesis amp x200B 1 Interest rates are low Nowhere for money to go except stocks When you really drill down into it this is some bizarre logic It s essentially saying you are forced to make more risky bets if less risky bets are less profitable In other words it s a manifestation of the greedy FOMO mindset that occurs precisely during bubbles Ultimately these bull aren t even arguing that we aren t in a bubble They are arguing we are in a bubble but that the bubble is JUSTIFIED The obvious counter is that holding cash is neither impossible nor even undesirable in a low interest rate environment What s the worst that can happen if I sit on a pure cash portfolio I lose 2 per year Not good of course but not the end of the world either What s the worst that can happen if I dump all my money into stocks at all time highs and the market crashes I lose 50 of my funds in as little as a month Ouch The idea that I m forced to risk losing a huge percentage of my capital because losing 2 a year is simply impossible to endure is the sort of logic that can only arise under a euphoric bubble mindset Of course the premise that these bulls are relying on is that the market simply won t crash or that they will be prescient enough to calmly hop out of the market once a crash becomes obvious But the whole point is that the crash is never obvious especially to permabulls They see a dip and they buy it They see a deeper dip what a great opportunity so they buy more And before they realize the dip isn t simply a dip they are already fucked Tale as old as time The funny thing is this argument can be used to justify almost any investment no matter how irrational Why hold cash when bonds pay more Why buy bonds when index funds pay more Why buy index funds when SPACS pay more Why buy SPACS when flipping cocaine pays more After all if you assume that holding cash is simply impossible since it loses to inflation what sort of high risk investment can you not justify What s most interesting is that this argument isn t even new The ridiculously low interest rates set by the Fed in the past were precisely what sowed the seeds for the massive housing bubble that led to the 2008 crash The Fed is ultimately a bubble creator something even WSB is well aware of amp x200B 2 If you sit out this rally you will end up behind even if you are right This is perhaps the most popular argument of permabulls They argue that if you sat out the last 10 months something this is essentially a straw man argument except in reference to perma bears then you would have missed out on massive gains And therefore the implicit argument is you can NEVER sit out If you carefully analyze this argument you will realize it is literally nothing more than FOMO to the extreme It s Fear Of Missing Out disguised as macroeconomic theory I have to stay in the market perpetually I can never sit out because if I do I will MISS OUT on gains And you better stay in the market with me otherwise you will miss out too dummy First of all I will admit this is a good argument against people who are legitimately perma bears People who do sit out a market in fear for months and months do actually miss out on substantial gains But not everyone signalling the warning signs of a bubble are perma bears There are clear historical signals of an irrational bubble and those who pay attention to such signals are not missing out they are simply protecting their wealth against irrational greed An intelligent investor is neither a bull nor a bear They adapt to the market And when an intelligent investor adapts and becomes a bear in a raging bull market you can be sure there will be no shortage of bulls attacking them as a stupid perma bear The bulls think they will get wise before the crash hurts them but their greed is precisely what will prevent that scenario from playing out amp x200B Let s take a look at some of the signs we are in the greatest bubble in history Major Indicators of the Great Bubble 1 MASSIVE retail investment Worldwide What are some signs of bubbles historically Well a sure metric is when you get massive public interest and investment in the market Do we have that today CHECK on fucking steroids We ve got people who can t change a fucking tire on their 2008 Civic downloading Robinhood and gambling options on margin Like WTF The 80 IQ mongoloid who was washing dishes at Papa Johns last Tuesday do they even have dishes I don t fucking know is now buying leveraged call options on a fucking electric vehicle company in fucking China or some shit Are you kidding me Do we need any more evidence that the top is rapidly approaching Not to mention the entire short squeeze fiasco which got international coverage and just threw some nitroglycerin into the speculative fire Now everyone from my grandmother to some farmer in Bangladesh is downloading Robinhood to buy calls on fucking SNDL or whatever the fuck Past US market bubbles were largely restricted to the US population It was mostly Americans buying American stocks during the dotcom boom But wild irrational bubble speculation has been globalized Now almost anybody in the world can dump their hard earned rupees into Tesla at a 1 300 PE ratio What s that noise Is that some greedy billionaire goblin audibly salivating in the distance The Max Pain theory which is ironically popular among permabulls argues that the market will do whatever hurts the maximum numbers of investors This is of course bullshit but it s food for thought if you buy into this type of voodoo Processing img nua93719rji61 2 Ridiculously speculative investments AKA SPACs CCIV is worth 15 billion dollars And it owns literally nothing No deal is in place no announced deal figures have been offered obviously the SPAC has no earnings or revenue to speak of just 15 billion dollars dumped on pure rumors and hopium I can think of no stronger manifestation of irrational greed What is a SPAC at the end of the day A rich guy steps up and says give me your money and I ll decide what I ll do with it in a few months And a million retards step up and say SOUNDS GREAT TAKE MY MONEY Tell me this SPAC shit isn t exactly like the dotcom boom when literally anything with a com in its name was worth millions overnight because the internet was the hot new thing There is no way this SPAC mania lasts and lots of people will be hurt in the end Processing img e8rgdlm9rji61 3 Options volume absolutely exploding Options are becoming the vehicle of choice for investors AKA gamblers in the current market Stock represents actual ownership of a company the foundation of the actual market But what kind of boomer wants to actually invest in a profitable company long term I just want to get insane leverage and dump my gamble on the next bigger sucker The question I sometimes ask is how much of this market growth is really a manifestation of market makers delta hedging this insane options volume You know like derivative CDO s leveraging worthless mortgages back in 2008 It s something to think about I ll just leave this chart here since it makes the case for me This is neither natural nor sustainable Processing img 46kgamdarji61 4 Greater Fool logic I ll just quote investopedia since I m getting lazy here The greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities whether or not they are overvalued by selling them for a profit at a later date This is because there will always be someone i e a bigger or greater fool who is willing to pay a higher price If acting in accordance with the greater fool theory an investor will purchase questionably priced securities without any regard to their quality If the theory holds the investor will still be able to quickly sell them off to another greater fool who could also be hoping to flip them quickly Unfortunately speculative bubbles burst eventually leading to a rapid depreciation in share prices The greater fool theory breaks down in other circumstances as well including economic recessions and depressions In 2008 when investors purchased faulty mortgage backed securities it was difficult to find buyers when the market collapsed Basically none of you mouthbreathers are doing fundamental analysis on the shit you buy Nobody here cares about fair or instrinsic value This is talking about you https preview

level For noobies who don t know what this means the Buffett Indicator takes total market valuation and divides it by US GDP A very high Buffett Indicator suggests an overvalued market and could have been used to predict past bubbles such as the dotcom boom There are two arguments against the Buffett Indicator as a useful metric The first argument is that GDP is a backward indicator and therefore doesn t account for future growth While this is true it misses the entire point The point is that future growth estimations can be faulty and lend themselves to irrational greed during bubbles The point is to tie market valuations to some real world metric which is necessarily backward looking The other argument against the Buffett Indicator which holds more weight is that US stocks consist of global companies and therefore aren t adequately represented by US GDP I will say these people have a good point but they are also missing several nuances within GDP and market valuations which are too complicated to address in this already fucking huge post Suffice it to say the Buffett Indicator still has something useful to say about market valuation and can t simply be discarded Processing img 3ts0u0pbrji61 6 Valuations divorced from reality During every major bubble people like to come up with new fancy ways of evaluating the worth of a company Back in the dotcom boom companies that obviously had zero revenue or sales were valued in terms of eyes That is the value of the company was based on how many visits they had to their website This internet thing was a New Paradigm and so obviously we needed New Metrics to determine how valuable these companies were Needless to say the vast majority of these companies many of them worth millions were simply worth nothing and went bankrupt overnight Take your pick of favorite meme stonk that has some bizarre rationalization for its absurd valuation I like to pick on Tesla personally because trolling its angry cultlike followers is simply good fun Processing img pemz089crji61 7 Fed Manipulation Most bubbles have been created by Federal Reserve control of currency and interest rates This market is no different They create a bubble and when the bubble pops they hop in to create a new bigger bubble until that pops and so on It s like a fucking meth addict taking bigger and bigger hits until they see fucking leprechauns burrowing under thier house The catch is interest rates can t drop below zero I mean they can But who wants to be Japan for the rest of history Alright I ve written enough already and I won t write a whole thesis on Fed action and its consequences for now global markets I ll just leave this pic here Processing img d5xsln7drji61 TL DR SHIT IS FUCKED SON Play the game of chicken as long as you want

so far and I hope you all can make a good judgement on any strategy if any This is me doing my thing and just DD sharing my outlook to see how wrong or right I am later I m complete bullish I only

to pronounce the stock you believe in Vuzix Corporation VUZI ticker That s not boo as in Voozie it s view as in Viewzee Viewzix Vuzix You know how to say it so what is it Oohh Oohh Aahh Aahh Smart glasses You can think of Google glasses but not a failure Google glasses were a little ahead of themselves and Vuzix took the horns and hooked the market since late 2020 Please see the 6 Mth Chart of

you need to do is search Vuzix on any media box and you ll find the presentation that I will only speak of I m not good with visuals but I m good with seeing the vision and future of this technology and the grip that Vuzix is showing thru their continual raving reviews from wear house to med house usage educational usage remote training sports training etc This is real live results The real shit Not speculation Hands free and micro view and whatever high tech jazz they throw in there that I can t speak of Me have no chippie but only banana Is there competition There is but Vuzix has patents and proven model The market itself is just now presenting itself back to the market Every top search for augmented reality glasses will have Vuzix mentioned They have stormed on to the scene since October really You say why would I invest in Vuzix if Google couldn t make it work with their augmented reality glasses The answer is simple They were a little ahead of themselves and now they are outpaced and outclassed It s not those ugly things you didn t want to be caught wearing thing anymore Covid changed the world and the type of augmented reality was coming anyways Now it seems to have even more relevance and acceleration on the remote training aspect But if they didn t pass the mustard then why would Vuzix pass the mustard now Time has passed to get smaller chips and advance better visions functions etc Five G Five G and Five G Micro chip advancements are a big help and a company that knows why G Glasses wasn t a success seems to be proving itself on a regular basis Nobody wore those big ugly G glasses before so why would they wear the VUZi glasses now They have pretty good models for production forces and hands free work for sure They are smaller and more productive than G s back in the short day ago They don t look ugly and the newer and upcoming models are going to blend in like regular shades They already have pretty nice blending pairs now Think of a smart phone thru your shades in the real near now With Five G this has potential to expand to a very wide horizon of possibilities Imagine a doctor getting live vital readings on a critical patient from his desk thru the eyes of the medic on the street You think that won t save lives Well this stock ain t for you then This is already assisting in surgeries and nursing care How does it effect everyday life and not just industries I envision this taking to the next level with 5G and virtual shopping as you re walking down the streets of NEW YORK CITY lt lt lt lt Let s get him Any city that has a 5G net that we will all have Sorry suburbanites you may need to come to a town near you to get the real potential I m sure you can use them effectively staring in to the stars somehow too in the near future so you might not be totally left out on the recreation side of these These glasses will be the augmented directory as your walking down the streets Need to know where to get those sour bumballs that you can never find anymore Tearjerkers Ya Where the heck did you go My pucker is worse that some the puckering I read on WSB Only that gum can do it Well I see the future where these glasses will show me where to go and how much they are without me having to look at my phone once I can see purchases thru taps on glasses as well Talk about premium contactless purchases and true window shopping Step up to the shop window and get an augmented view of the contents Go in if you want order to have delivered if you don t want We all know those drones will be following you home soon too Might as well be bringing my goodies with it Oh yeah Bullish drone stocks too Recently I have felt some confirmation in my early entry to this stock I know I don t have a ton in it but I started with little only a few months ago I m going to keep investing and call striking and rolling into stocks on every win This one has been a win the whole way in my portfolio With I had a real YOLO on it but i m not done buying either Cathie on that boat thingie just bought 290K Shares as well She beat my DD but that damn WSB rule is to blame The stock is at it s all time highs and it s only rating has it pegged at 30 This is the only initiation rating I have seen to date All announcements are usually agreements sales advances in industries etc Take what you will THis is not my estimate but I can t disagree for the

Only in December I think did I make my reddit account so that I can OFFICIALLY be part of the absolute retardation I am a fan of space and as such I am ecstatic for Astra s merger with H O L About Astra Private small launch space company that wants to offer frequent launches of small sats Founded in 2016 by Chris Kemp and Adam London The team this is important Chris Kemp CEO Founder Chairman

in Engineering and Industrial Management from California Polytechnic University San Luis Obispo Goals Reshape how the space industry works starting with getting into space enable a wave of innovation in low Earth orbit and improve life on our planet through greater connectivity and more regular observation State of the Sector Dedicated smallsat launches are becoming more popular Huge projected upside for the smallsat industry Small sats have the following benefits Missions play a key and compelling role in space based scientific and engineering programs Greatly reduced time to obtain science and technology results Missions tend to be flexible and can be extremely responsive to new opportunities or technological needs Shorter development times reduce overall costs and can provide budgetary options for companies governments ahem NASA with constrained space programs What stands out prominently is the professional vitality and community involvement small missions can offer Researchers who might have waited a lifetime to analyze data are stimulated freshened and sharpened when given the opportunity to conduct high priority high quality science in a shorter period In turn these programs afford undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to participate in and experience the complex and organic nature of science from proposal to development to analysis to publication What s the future looking like for commercial privatized aerospace Government space programs are highly constrained Not much room to push the envelope and innovate Can t afford much failure Tiny tiny error margins Many big time aerospace companies charge them hella money because You d be nothing without us SpaceX Comes around and says We can and will push the envelope and innovate for you in order to make launches cheaper and access to space easier all at a discount Makes the competition look like poopoo Proved that privatized and independent companies can be stupid successful in aerospace Commercial Privatized entities can do many launches Short term for HOL ASTR Set to merge with HOL in Q2 of 2021 Astra will begin delivering customer payloads this summer and begin monthly launches by the end of this year Possibility of failure Possibility of big monies Long term for HOL ASTR As previously stated they want to change the way the industry works Will help make space become extremely accessible Can catastrophically fail as with many companies Summary and final thoughts I am very long on the stock The executive team is star studded in terms of qualifications and past experiences I am a huge proponent of making space more accessible I like the stock

want to begin this DD with a disclaimer I am not a financial advisor The words following this are merely my own thoughts and should only be consumed for entertainment purposes only Invest and trade securities at your own risk 2 What They Do 1 DoorDash is a food delivery commodity business that works to give consumers and merchants an avenue and one stop shop to place orders and receive food Door dash makes money from three revenue streams 1 The first revenue stream is collected through the fee it charges customers to place orders through their app and website This fee varies by location and time of day of the order but is generally 5 to 8 dollars per order 2 The second stream of revenue is from the commission that DoorDash takes for every order which is paid by the restaurant Door Dash s commissions on restaurant orders are about 20 per order which is among the highest in the industry Grubhub in contrast takes roughly 13 5 commission per order 3 Their final stream of revenue comes from advertisements What I mean by this is that restaurants pay door dash to appear at the top of the search results on the website and their app platform 3 Industry Outlook DoorDash is not the only food commodity delivery service that is good at throwing money into the furnace However they are by far the most efficient at it and despite this fact they are the most euphorically valued company in the space compared to Uber Eats Grubhub and other local miscellaneous food and commodity delivery platforms For instance in 2019 DASHs revenue was 885 000 000 dollars whereas grubhub s revenue was 1 312 billion Dash posted a net loss of 616 000 000 whereas grubhub posted a loss of 6 283 000 2018 is the same story with DASH bringing in revenue of 291 000 000 and posting a loss of 210 000 000 whereas grub hub brought in 1B in revenue and actually posted a net profit of roughly 81 5million One thing we can take away from grubhub s positive earnings in 2018 is that profit margins in this industry are going to be SLIM at best until a new delivery paradigm such as autonomous drone delivery services and logistics can be profitably utilized However I will talk about those prospects shortly 4 Financials 1 It is not new information knowing that DoorDash is a money incinerator But just how much money is DASH losing every year To give the an unbiased picture I am going to summarize the positives and negatives of their financials 2 The Positives 1 From 2018 to 2019 DASHs gross profit increased from just 63 million in 2018 to 362 million in 2019 showing a 574 YoY increase Their TTM gross profit in 2020 is estimated at 1 145 billion This is a 316 increase from their 2019 gross profit Their overall revenue is also increasing as they posted a revenue of 291 000 000 in 2018 885 000 000 in 2019 and a TTM estimated revenue of approximately 2 214B in 2020 the exact numbers will be made clear on their earnings which I talk about later 3 The Negatives 1 DASHs gross profit increases YoY seem to be bullish on the surface but when you consider the fact that the black swan event COVID 19 played a huge role in boosting their earnings this year it does not bode well for their future growth The decreasing YoY profit percentage is not only indicative of growth and profit slowing as they expand their business but their profit can be expected to decrease looking forward as the extended closings of restaurants due to COVID is creating a demand backlog for patronage for in house meals and services 2 Also despite multiplying their gross profit five fold from 2018 and 2019 and three fold from 2019 to 2020 DASH still has no clear path to profitability as they posted net losses of 210 million in 2018 616 million in 2019 and TTM losses of an estimated 268 million in 2020 3 DASH spent an estimate of 270 million dollars on research and development from 2018 to September 30 2020 But what is DASH a non technological company researching and developing NOTHING DOOR DASH is actually most likely investing this money into OTHER companies that are developing the technology for autonomous and drone delivery meaning that the increased revenue stream from subscribing leasing or buying drone and autonomous technologies from these companies must outweigh the prices they pay for them Considering the logistics of fully autonomous drone delivery and the legislation surrounding such technologies the fruits of these investments and developments may not be seen for the next 5 10 years at the EARLIEST 1 Upcoming Earnings DASH is expected to post earnings on February 25 2021 after market close Their expected earnings are expected to be 0 75 cents per share 2 Lock Up Expiry 1 Per their IPO DOORDASH issued 33 000 000 class A common stock shares and raised approximately 3 27 Billion in proceeds after paying underwriting fees and commissions Each share was offered at a price of 102 dollars per share 2 This next bit is important Prior to the IPO there were 284 656 521 existing shares held by insiders The average price of those shares were 8 73 This means that even if the price is at 128 by March 9 which is barely above the 127 50 share price needed for the early lock up expiry to be valid insiders will be able to sell off their 20 shares at 1600 ROI However this is not the full story 3 33 000 000 plus 284 656 521 will equal the total outstanding float of 317 656 521 shares 4 The above outstanding float DOES NOT include the following 1 34 554 510 shares issuable upon the exercise of options to purchase class A common stock with an average exercise price of 2 41 per share 2 20 021 420 shares of class A common stock subject to RSUs Restricted Stock Units outstanding prior to September 30 2020 3 14 003 990 shares of Class A common stock subject to RSUs granted AFTER September 30 2020 10 379 000 of which are granted to the CEO Mr Tony Xu that vest when DASH hits certain stock price goals 4 105 330 shares of class A common stock issued upon the exercise of warrants average price of 1 492 per share 5 39 722 785 shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under their equity compensation plans 6 Totaling a whopping 108 408 035 possible more shares that can enter the float If we subtract the RSUs and shares reserved for future issuance we get 34 659 840 shares that will enter the total outstanding float possibly in a short period when stock options and warrants are exercised and redeemed for class A common stock 5 Conditions of the Lock Up Expiry 1 such date is at least 90 days after December 9 2020 2 such date occurs after they have publicly furnished at least one earnings release on Form 8 K or filed at least one periodic report with the SEC 3 on such date and for 5 out of any 10 consecutive trading days ending on such date the last reported closing price of our Class A common stock is at least 25 greater than 102 4 Such a date occurs in an open trading window and there are at least five trading days remaining in the open trading window 5 WTF IS A TRADING WINDOW 6 ANSWER Trading windows are set in a company s insider trading policies The SEC has no specific rules about the opening and closing of trading windows These stipulations vary from company to company and can be found in each company s Insider Trading Policy document In general they typically open a couple days AFTER a big announcement or event like an earnings report or an acquisition or a declaration of bankruptcy etc 7 I could not for the life of me find DASHs Insider Trading Policy but if we assume that their open trading window occurs on the second full day of trading after their earning report that would put the opening of the window on March 1 2020 Trading Window times can vary between 2 to 6 weeks long so their window will encompass the lock up expiry 8 Also there is no need to rush or calculate the day of the lock up because We will announce both the Early Lock Up Expiration Date and the Final Lock Up Expiration Date through a press release or Form 8 K at least two full trading days before it is effective This is straight from the prospectus 6 Amount of new shares eligible for sale after lockup expiry 1 95 709 974 shares of Class A common stock held by former holders of their redeemable convertible preferred stock 2 6 262 890 shares of class A common stock held by members of their board of directors and members of their management team 3 11 889 744 shares of class A common stock held by all other holders 4 Total number of new shares available for trading after early lock up 113 862 608 This means that upon early lock up expiration the amount of tradable shares on the open market will increase to 146 862 608 shares This is nearly 4 5 times the amount of shares that are currently trading on the market with most of those shares being held by insiders and early investors looking to collect on their investment which will translate to major selling volume 3 Competitors The biggest company that most reflects DASH is GrubHub Uber is a car hailing service that tried to pass itself off as an emerging technology company that was developing autonomous driving technology but that has been shown to be a stretch of the imagination However Uber still trades at about 8x sales multiple GRUB trades at about 4x sales multiple DASH is trading at 30x sales multiple However some justifications for this price are that DASH has higher market share than Uber or GRUB and deserve a premium for their dominance in industry but this just can not be true Food commodity delivery is not an industry in which there is much differentiation The leading factor for consumer choice over which app to open is entirely dependent on which company is offering the cheapest price for delivery This includes the prices that restaurants have to pay in order to use their services DASH has some of the highest commission rates in the country for food delivery platforms If they cannot compete in this arena they will quickly lose market share to businesses that are willing to take lower commission for more traffic through their site In an industry with hardly any real MOAT from any competitor companies will devolve into a race to see who can remain solvent longer than another as commissions to restaurants and prices to consumers drops which will of course make these businesses even more unprofitable 4 Price Target Bearish Conservative Bullish 1 Bearish 1 DASH begins to lose the race to the bottom as their highest in industry commissions to restaurants cause them to lose market share disproportionately A bearish estimate of 3x sales would put DASH at about 6 5B market cap or 21 a share 2 Conservative 1 DASH bites the bullet and begins slashing prices which results in decreasing profitability but they maintain an even split of market share between big competitors putting them at the industry average of 5 6x sales multiple or 12B valuation for approximately 40 a share 3 Bullish 1 DASH stops paying 5 million dollars to advertise donating 1 million dollars to charity and starts thinking critically and regain market share by slashing research and development as they wait for other companies to invent drones for them since they clearly aren t going to do it themselves and slash prices harder than competitors to reclaim far greater market share Having twice the market share of their competitors could put them at a generous 12x sales multiple or 24B valuation for a share price of 80 per share 5 Positions I have been slowly building my positions in DASH beginning this past week and will continue to monitor the run up prior to earnings and take advantage of IV by selling ITM Call Credit Spreads and using a portion of that money to buy Far OTM puts My current positions are 14 Call Credit Spreads 185 190 March 19 2021 1x 160P May 21 2021 4x 140P May 21 2021 6 Conclusion Major selling pressure upon the release of the shares after lock up as well as the 4 fold increase of shares that will be tradeable on the float will contribute to heavy selling pressure If the lock up does not occur that means the price is below 127 50 and I already reach max profit on the spreads and major gains on the puts I will continue to add positions especially as it continues to touch the heavy resistance in the 220s 1 Citations 1 Revenue streams https vator tv

listing reasons on my convictions on going in when I get the money Hello all this is my first DD post here I ve been lurking around here watching yall degenerates since about the latter half of 2020 Only in December I think did I make my reddit account so that I can OFFICIALLY be part of the absolute retardation I am a fan of space and as such I am ecstatic for Astra s merger with H O L About Astra Private small launch space company that wants to offer frequent launches of small sats Founded in 2016 by Chris Kemp and Adam London The team this is important Chris Kemp CEO Founder Chairman Previously served Chief Technical Officer of NASA Founded OpenStack free open standard cloud computing platform mostly deployed as infrastructure as a service in both public and private clouds where

S in Engineering and Industrial Management from California Polytechnic University San Luis Obispo Goals Reshape how the space industry works starting with getting into space enable a wave of innovation in low Earth orbit and improve life on our planet through greater connectivity and more regular observation State of the Sector Dedicated smallsat launches are becoming more popular Huge projected upside for the smallsat industry Small sats have the following benefits Missions play a key and compelling role in space based scientific and engineering programs Greatly reduced time to obtain science and technology results Missions tend to be flexible and can be extremely responsive to new opportunities or technological needs Shorter development times reduce overall costs and can provide budgetary options for companies governments ahem NASA with constrained space programs What stands out prominently is the professional vitality and community involvement small missions can offer Researchers who might have waited a lifetime to analyze data are stimulated freshened and sharpened when given the opportunity to conduct high priority high quality science in a shorter period In turn these programs afford undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to participate in and experience the complex and organic nature of science from proposal to development to analysis to publication What s the future looking like for commercial privatized aerospace Government space programs are highly constrained Not much room to push the envelope and innovate Can t afford much failure Tiny tiny error margins Many big time aerospace companies charge them hella money because You d be nothing without us SpaceX Comes around and says We can and will push the envelope and innovate for you in order to make launches cheaper and access to space easier all at a discount Makes the competition look like poopoo Proved that privatized and independent companies can be stupid successful in aerospace Commercial Privatized entities can do many launches Short term for H O L ASTR Set to merge with H O L in Q2 of 2021 Astra will begin delivering customer payloads this summer and begin monthly launches by the end of this year Possibility of failure Possibility of big monies Long term for H O L ASTR As previously stated they want to change the way the industry works Will help make space become extremely accessible Can catastrophically fail as with many companies Summary and final thoughts I am very long on the stock The executive team is star studded in terms of qualifications and past experiences I am a huge proponent of making space more accessible I like the stock TLDR huge upside for the company going forward I like this stock

expected value underdog play ,TLDR INTC options are much cheaper and have a higher ROI than competitors options Intel is having a stronger price action of late relative to competitors and IV in INTC should be higher than is currently priced Last week I exposed my view that Intel is an undervalued company and a very attractive short medium long term investment In the interest of brevity I will not reiterate those points go to my profile if you wish to read my thesis Today I simply want to point out a somewhat hidden but obvious attribute of INTC s short term option play amp x200B INTC options 65 strike expiring February 26th 1 week of gametime are the move The main reason for the 65 strike is that the volume and open interest is high so transacting these contracts is easy and the ask bid gap is very small in this case 37 36 amp x200B Last price for this option contract was at 36 100 36 per option contract As of market close and after hours INTC shares are trading at 63 06 or 3 08 way from being in the money Given the current hype in the semiconductor industry justified and for more than one reason and given Intel s market performance of late in combination with the several catalysts which I outlined in my previous post I find beating this option contract a more than 50 probability To illustrate the absolute value of INTC relative to its competitors I will take a target price of 67 by Friday 2 in the money and my current position of 50 contracts For every dollar above 65 my contracts are worth 5k so at 67 they would be worth 10k Assuming Monday you are able to buy at its last sold price of 36 per option contract it would cost you 36 50 1800 The ROI for this hypothetical play would be 555 10 000 1 800 To reach 67 from the current price it would require a 6 24 increase in INTC stock price Reiterating 3 08 up to be in the money and 6 24 up for ROI of 555 Now I would like to show you the price return potential for other companies in the space Fan favorite AMD closed trading at 89 48 per share Applying the same parameters to AMD a 3 08 increase in AMDs stock next week would bring it to 92 25 Options for 92 closed last price at 78 per contract and options at 92 5 at 63 average them both to get a fair value for what an option price at 92 25 would be and it comes to 70 per option contract This makes AMD weekly options 94 4 more expensive than INTCs To get 50 of these it would cost you 3500 and to finalize the comparison an increase of 6 24 would bring AMD to 95 Assuming you could get the hypothetical 92 25 contracts you would have 13750 and an ROI of 393 amp x200B Sparing you from going through the same process with the other examples I will just summarize feel free to check and correct my math Micron 3 08 upward move contracts lt 90 they would be more expensive I am using 95 strike but its actually lower 94 4 to be precise with an ROI at a 6 24 upwards move of 244 TSM 3 08 upward move contracts last price would be at around 83 volume and open interest is lower so last price is more divergent than ask bid and would likely be higher than 83 with an ROI at a 6 24 move of 518 Also looks attractive but the ask bid gap is quite high and low volume open interest I wont even do the example for NVDA because implied volatility is so high for these ranges the ROI example would be really low Other semiconductor companies have the problem of having low volume as well but I am sure there are others out there and you may even finda better deal amp x200B Now before you call me stupid I understand the reason why the INTC contracts are much cheaper than these other The IV Implied volatility is lower The premiums are lower because the contract writers don t expect as big of swings in INTC as they do others My thesis is though that the market makers for these contracts are incorrectly modeling the IV of INTC stock lower than it should be Much the same way they were with Micron a couple weeks ago amp x200B This week INTC closed up 1 6 Micron was up 1 95 AMD down 4 8 and TSM down 3 6 This week as we know most of the markets had a small correction As I had expected INTC outperformed its competition as well as the broad markets The week before this one INTC closed up 4 and YTD INTC is up 26 2 Given the combination of factors surrounding the semiconductor scene and Intel specifically I find that the implied upward volatility on INTC should be higher and that in not too long it will increase as it has done the past few weeks although still very low The main reason why INTC contracts are so cheap relative to competitors in the industry is a simple question of supply and demand These more memetic and loved stocks options are more sought after by retail and on top of the real volatility premium another demand heavy premium accrues Intel being hated in this sub for example has kept option premiums much lower than they would be if it was a fan favorite Similar things happen in sports betting A favorite with a lot of demand will often move the lines beyond the house spread and sometimes produce an edge for an underdog Intel is the underdog of this story and an underdog with very high expected value You might hate Intel but this could still be the play for you so long as you believe the semiconductor scene is bound to profit these weeks The Milwaukee Bucks are not favorites to win the championship this year odds at 750 They probably wont win the championship and I don t see much value in that bet at the moment but if someone was selling me Bucks futures at 5000 Id snag them up This is the analogy I will use for the current Intel option market I am a degenerate There is no shame in coming out as one in this sub a family of autistic degenerates from all over the world I like to gamble and so do you but more than gamble I like to make money I like to win and I do win I have 50 65 INTC contracts expiring the coming Friday 500 contracts at 80 strike for April 16 as well as 1700 shares long I believe in this play in the short term and long term For the short term a long shot bet but not nearly as much as the option writers have them This is deep fucking value

below Now that we got the specials out of the way I d like to comment and toss out some advice to anyone who would take it involving the recent GME phenomena I like you retards like I still like the stock I hope this reaches some people here but I still expect downvotes due to the zealots on this sub and the nature of this post First of all stay in your Wendy s drive through lane eat your 4 Pcs of tendies and don t ask for extra sauce We went up against big money and we lost as virtually every retard who has ever challenged the institution We had the solid DD we had the momentum we had the uncoordinated cohesion we were right about the squoze and we still lost During this rollercoaster I was constantly thinking how are we gonna get screwd How are the hedgefunds going to get out of this And I naively but logiICALLY thought there was no easy out for them They shorted stock stock goes up they need to return borrowed stock I deduced that past 1000 share their would be broader government intervention as if they were actually going to allow GME stock to be worth thousands of dollars per share as if the corrupt system would allow their handlers to be become bankrupt And they restricted buying at 480 it was really that simple for them RH will take the fall the s e c will have their dick in their hands and the d t c c is having a big ol ball knowing that the average investor has no idea they existed before a week ago Always remember they did this shit in broad daylight with an international spotlight you cant even comprehend what these people plot behind closed doors We are less than pawns in their chess game We have seen it time and again in 2008 only one banker was sentenced to jail One Not even mentioning the amount of suicides anguish and financial ruin we the bagholders will always be left to contend with So what I m trying to tell you is we are already in the 1984 Orwellian endgame and don t even realize it yet We have already lost we lost the second we entered the casino doors We tried to win a game where string pullers own the dealer the other players police department the gambling regulatory board the chips the table and the tacky red velvet carpet we slinked are cobbled shoes on We are only allowed to win occasionally to give the illusion that the game is fair So how do you win Collect the crumbs when the big boys leave the table and do as they do have a stake in their steak so to speak In their own self preservation you will be shielded at some level Its disgusting to even type something like this out and I wish I could say that bad people in the end get what s coming to them But as far as life on Earth goes good people get fucked and bad people get away with it The vice versa of course happens Two have no allegiance to any stratagem group values I love you guys but for every post out there there is someone looking at the reverse angle to fuck your position In other words oh boy here it cums fuck diamond handing fuck paperhanding fuck HODL fuck FOMO you need to do what s best for YOU Today Paper hands who came in to make a quick buck are rolling in the dough right now posting their gain porn Us diamond hands are burnt crispier than my grandmas dementia nuggies Tomorrow Palantards will see their will rewarded and will get fuck We started this fight we were the pillars we made the logical and smart choice of holding as selling before RHs manipulation price would have been scraps compared to the squeeze It didn t matter Life is unfairer than we thought I still believe that most of us in this reddit were in this together for the majority of this wild ride but it wasn t enough We are drops nay a drop in the bucket in the financial market our only strength is the ability to start trends but soon after that it becomes out of our control And if the day comes were we have enough power this subreddit will no longer exist in its current state So don t fall to groupthink here we are together in the same way as my wife even though her boyfriend likes to come over and make funny noises in the guest room with her think of this sub as a group of retard mercenaries if our interests align lets work together and share our stories of wealth and loss if not we ll lurk in the shadow and twist our mustaches but in the end its our lives and our money no ones ever going to bail us out we re not getting our money back and we give our extra tendies to actual special needs people Id rather be a paperhand on the beach then a diamond hand drowning out in the shore and I think you d agree Loyalty to yourself not in an evil way learn to take your money and walk into the sunset and don t look back because no ones coming for you nor do they really care i e congrats and fuck you TLDR you ll never win against big money have loyalty to yourself act as an independent operator and dont fall to groupthink even if we are all united it doesn t change the outcome Note Im still holding but its a mostly sunk cost fallacy at this point Who knows technically GME has a great opportunity to pivot in the next couple years and a tinier squeeze might still happen but the damage is done imo I believe the that we have been cheated out of one of the biggest transfers of wealth to the common man in all of history 50GME 89 AVG

turned 18 I was looking into how to begin owning stocks amp profiting from the market This was during the time where owning fractional shares was being made available for retail investors Platforms like Acorns Stash amp RobinHood were becoming huge This post focuses on the consumer trust amp goodwill I hold between Stash amp RobinHood between their features amp company issues After some time doing research I chose Stash as my preferred platform to invest with so yes I do have some bias in the matter but I m not here to try amp force a referral link or promoted post on you I simply have witnessed a lot of the practices between RobinHood amp Stash amp want to inform amp educate you as to which I believe is better They function in very similar ways both have 0 Commission Free Trading Both are Structured for Beginner Investors Both use Fractional Shares allowing users to invest however much they want amp still hold some shares of a company However there are very strong differences to consider with each of these platforms An initial red flag for me when researching RobinHood was they really wanted to push the Free aspects of the platform as well all know nothing is completely free Stash however requires a monthly fee which is an instant drawback for most investors but they re basic account starts at 1 amp the other two account plans being at 3 amp 9 Even though most people would not use Stash solely on this ground this gave me more security as I was knowing that I was a paid customer amp likely to be treated somewhat better amp that I know the fees amp there was nothing hidden in terms of cost RobinHood makes money off of its users by charging them higher prices then the typical market value for shares They re unusually high payment for the order flow attracted an SEC investigation amp in December 2020 they were fined 65 Million for that business practice This choice alone shows RobinHoods namesake amp mission statement of being a tool to take money from the rich amp give to the poor to be a complete lie since they were charging typically beginner retail investors premium rates for buy orders In 2020 RobinHood also underwent a hack to their network amp users From what I can gather an estimated 2 000 accounts were hacked amp users are currently suing the company for that security breach One MAJOR issue I saw with RobinHood was in the beginning of the COVID outbreak in the U S at the time I had been comfortably using Stash for about 2 years my holdings in Tesla amp Disney had more then doubled amp nearly tripled my account value Then when the lockdowns hit there was a stock market crash as most of us witnessed where many companies plummeted in price RobinHood users however were left locked out of the platform amp unable to trade using their accounts because of a simple but completely idiotic glitch in the system They forget to use a correct amp adjust the calendar for the leap year so when February 29th hit but they re systems were registering March 1st the entire platform broke down for 3 entire days this was a during a time of record high volatility in the market where there was not only lots of money being lost but the opportunity for lots of money to be made too amp RobinHood users were all but locked out of their accounts because the company used the wrong calendar Now on to the GameStop GME situation During the WSB Reddit pumping up GameStonk price hundreds amp hundreds of dollars many people were using RobinHood for that effort During that time RobinHood halted all Buy orders on companies like GME or AMC Effectively barring users from trading on the platform amp making money when there was the opportunity for lots amp lots of money to be made This decision was to protect the assets amp bets of large Hedge funds amp Capital Investment firms like Citadel or Melvin which I won t even get into their relationship with RobinHood right now This was the most blatant event to back up many peoples understanding that RobinHood is not there to take from the rich amp give to the poor It s major company decisions have been to protect the capital interests of ultra rich people on Wall Street This choice has drawn in political attention from senators on both sides of the aisle RobinHood is now under congressional investigation for the series of decisions made during the GME spree Yes Stash does have its issues too I m not disputing that I do get annoyed by things like the trading windows on the platform or the monthly fee I pay of 1 but the benefits such as the trust amp security of the company far outweigh any cons for me During the GameStop trading spree I was perfectly able to go on Stash amp invest in AMC where companies like RobinHood were restricting that Stash also gives all users a Stock Back Debt Card which is one of my favorite features where if I make a purchase at Target or Amazon I get 1 or more sometimes back on my purchase in TGT or AMZN stock Because of this I have money diversified all over the market in small amounts just for making purchases amp getting stock back with the debt card Another favorite feature of stash is there SRI initiative or Socially Responsible Investing which focuses on letting users invest in companies amp funds like Solar or Clean Water stocks This is something that no other platform that I know of has within there trading Thank you for reading please feel free to comment Again I have to disclose I am an no way a professional or expert investor this is merely my opinion on the companies from what I ve seen amp witnessed

stocks Currently has less than 600 watchers on StockTwits and traded just 1 million shares on Weds 17 02 2021 The stock is currently trading at 0 35c and I believe it has the potential to grow substantially from this price Everyone loves a low float stock because once they get the volume they fly high and this stock is definitely one of those low float stock and has only 15 4 million shares outstanding Spectrum Global Solutions is the holding company for next generation technology companies specialising in telecommunications across the globe They currently have 5 holdings and are looking to add another company after announcing a definitive agreement to merge with High Wire Networks This is huge news And hardly anyone knows about it I believe this stock is very under valued and once it

amp Management Team https www highwirenetworks com about https www highwirenetworks com about Conclusion Spectrum Global Solutions is an excellent company with a great subsidiaries portfolio Merging with High Wire Networks is a massive bonus for the company and will increase its value 10 fold Spectrum Global Solutions has a global presence that allows and will continue to allow them to reach global markets and clients Their potential for growth is limitless Their stock for investors at the moment is very attractive with the low outstanding shares and float With volume this stock will increase dramatically in my opinion Although their revenue is something that needs improvement as I mentioned with the global presence this is something that can be achieved This merger will bring a new board of management that can steer this company in the right direction to achieve those revenue targets High Wire Networks is a fantastic company that is well established and is producing revenue of 18 million dollars annually and has just been awarded a 2 8 million dollars contract to add to its current revenue The board of management will take over the management of Spectrum Global Solutions and rebrand the company As High Wire Networks is in the Cyber Security business cybersecurity has a 66 billion dollar market size thus giving the company a lot of room to grow https www globenewswire

strong these companies look and with the merger this will definitely push them a long way in the right direction to achieving this goal with ease Therefore I believe this ticker is a strong buy at 0

industry and I can tell you firsthand that the streaming wars are very real The subscribers won over today will pay dividends for years to come as they pony up cash month after month for that sweet sweet content Several contenders have emerged in the past two years Discovery 5 Disney 8 13 w Hulu Paramount 6 w ads 10 w o Peacock 5 w ads 10 w o DAMN that s a lot of pluses but more on that later The war for subscribers is being fought viciously and urgently as these constantly merging media conglomerates muscle for rank and everybody wants a piece of the cake which is your money obviously Speaking of money how much do you spend for your streaming services Here are some figures from Forbes on March 29th 2019 8 months before the advent of Disney Hulu along with all the other new services The average American subscriber watches 3 4 services For each one they pay an average 8 53 per month That would total a monthly bill of 29 29 dollars for 3 4 services Fuck bro I pay 40 a month for Netflix 14 HBO Max 15 and Showtime 11 And I m sorry I m a basic bitch but I miss the office so I guess that s 50 now Damn 600 a year Does that sound right to you Me either lol Seems kinda inflated so I guess a few have got to go or maybe merge with each other Some interesting facts below Most licensing deals for network shows on Netflix and Hulu https www theverge com 2019 5 14 18623037 disney hulu netflix warnermedia att friends the office this is us streaming are ending within 2 years Sony Pictures has no streaming service for its content NBC still owns stake in Hulu valued at 15 Billion MGM has put itself on sale for approx 5 5 Billion AT amp T HBO Max debt at 160 Billion ViacomCBS merger layoffs in 2020 A LOT of pluses in these names Okay the pluses notice how Disney Hulu just kind of fits together In my opinion that plus was meant to bridge the gap between the Disney brand and the freshly acquired Hulu and I believe that Discovery and Paramount the 2 smallest fish in the pond by market cap are hoping to join forces with be acquired by larger players in the streaming space And without further ado major media conglomerates by market cap Apple 2 18T Amazon 1 64T Disney 333 37B Netflix 239 26B NBC 238 65B AT amp T 206 65B Sony 145 70B ViacomCBS 38 7B Discovery 22 4B As Netflix and Disney Hulu lose network content to HBO Max NBC and ViacomCBS they will slowly lose subscribers as well Smaller companies will need to merge to remain competitive and provide better content offerings to their subscriber bases I predict that NBC will sell it s Hulu stake 15B to Disney in order to purchase Discovery 22 4B mirroring Disney s ownership of National Geographic With Sony s continued focus on video games and total lack of a streaming platform I believe they would be well served to accept an offer for their studio and content my guess would be from Apple Their new streaming service is hurting for content and owning Sony Pictures and their portfolio of content would give them some necessary clout For MGM my guess is either Netflix or Amazon as buyers And finally the cream of the crap ViacomCBS CBS is an OG one of the original Big 3 Networks and the smallest behind Disney s ABC and Comcast s NBC Now it sits at a piddling 38 7 Billion market cap to their 200 Billion market caps And it s subscriber counts aren t looking great either Data below from CNBC on February 18th 2021 Netflix 200 million subscribers Peacock 33 million sign ups HBO Max 37 7 million subscribers Hulu 39 million subscribers Paramount combined with Showtime 18 million subscribers Obviously Paramount originally CBS All Access is still in its infancy but what if it s too late to gain the necessary viewership it realistically needs to be profitable What if it needs a benefactor a Hulu to its Disney if you will Having streamlined during its recent merger in 2020 ViacomCBS is about as airtight as it can be just sweet sweet content MTV Comedy Central Paramount Nickelodeon CBS Showtime BET and half of The CW It would be Hollywood sacrilege for 2 of the Big 3 Networks to be owned by the same company so that rules out Disney and NBC as buyers With that consideration I believe the most obvious contender for a merger opportunity with ViacomCBS would be AT amp T HBO Max which just so happens to own the other half of The CW And their combined market caps would be right around 240 Billion even with Netflix and NBC HBO and Comedy Central have strong stand up comedy synergies to compete with Netflix and Nickelodeon would be a strong addition to HBO Max s already robust animated offerings of Cartoon Network Adult Swim and Boomerang to compete with Disney Hulu Now how would AT amp T merging with ViacomCBS solve the company s tremendous debt problem I have no idea maybe something with streamlining Help me out here TLDR The streaming space is overcrowded and smaller companies are about to be ground up into pure content for more established players ViacomCBS is the crown jewel but could AT amp T even scrounge up the scratch to seal the deal

,So I ve been thinking about it and it seems like the very last fucking thing that the SmArT mOneY dickheads want to happen is for something like that 0 1 FTT to be implemented If you were watching the hearing you probably noticed that as soon as this tax was mentioned that was instantly the focus from Citadel Melvin and Robinhood I mean I m generally against adding more taxes but am I right in thinking that it could actually fuck over HFT entirely Think about it When the average retail investor makes a trade unless we re talking about a big ass YOLO or something you re usually looking at a few hundred to a few thousand dollars in value being traded right 0 1 is ONE dollar for every thousand 1k per 1m A single solitary penny on each 100 If you re a fairly active retail investor and not like doing this as your primary income you might make a few trades per day and you re generally looking to get some decent value out of every trade HFT does the opposite High Frequency Trade for the uninitiated is automated trading governed by AI and algorithms that can spot a market move in an instant and take advantage of it no matter how small When I say small I mean fucking small On average a HFT bot is making one twentieth of a penny per trade But even if the profits are so small per trade these bots are trading so goddamn fast that it generates insane total profits considering the amount of profit per trade Of course when I say fast I mean really fucking goddamn fast and it s only getting faster The SEC authorized automated trading in 1998 and about a year after that trades were being completed automatically in a few seconds per trade Mind blowing shit at the time By 2010 the time per trade was measured in milliseconds or thousandths of seconds This is the timescale you re used to seeing internet latency aka ping time or lag measured in like it takes 20ms for an electronic signal travelling at the speed of light to get from me to NYC Anyway these trades kept getting faster These days it takes about one hundredth of a microsecond for an HFT bot to execute a trade That s 0 00000001 seconds A hundredth of a thousandth of a thousandth of a second There is nothing this timescale can be compared to that would make sense to the human brain it s literally unimaginably fast So figure this 0 0005 on average being made per trade at the assumed maximum rate of once every 0 00000001 seconds This isn t likely to happen in any kind of sustained fashion but just to get a sense of what we re dealing with lets assume perfect conditions and it s making these trades as fast as it can That s a maximum potential of 50 000 per second also assuming it s exactly 50 50 buys and sells On top of all that these HFT bots make up for about half of all trading volume every single day Now let s get back on topic the tax The US actually does already have a tax like this it s just so small you don t even notice it Fucking small about 2 cents per 1 000 traded or 0 002 Yep the suggestion is to take the tax we already have and multiply it by 50 This tax is excised on both ends of the trade remember this it ll be important in a minute Turning that to up to 0 1 is still peanuts for us guys that make a few to a few dozen trades a day Hell it probably wouldn t make an appreciable difference to any actual humans trading period regardless of how much money they re throwing around What it does impact to a catastrophic degree is HFT As described above a tiny profit on a single trade half a tenth of a penny can churn out huge sums of money when you can do that 10 million times per second Currently HFTs generally follow a few criteria Share price under 50 low volatility beta lt 1 5ish and a market cap over 50bn Lets run our previous example that got us to 50k in profits in a single second making 0 0005 profit per trade assuming 50 share price and at current FTT rate of 002 that 50k in profits is going to carry 10k in tax along with it Now multiply that tax figure by 50 to get what it would be under a 0 1 rate 500k in taxes on 50k in profits because the actual amount that you traded in that time frame 50 a share x 10m trades is 500m churned in a single second There would be absolutely no way for HFT to exist at this tax rate at least under current strategies But if you re not generating tiny profits as fast as you can then what even is the point That s the whole game in HFT Yet it s the exact thing that s punished the hardest with higher FTT rates Does it seem like I ve got any of this wrong I mean it s possible I m no professional just some dumb money retard trying to make sense of shit The other thing is running HFT is pretty fuckin expensive Not just in the computer hardware to do it but you need to have the fastest connection possible and ideally a location as close as possible to the exchange to make it work it s best Check on how expensive office space is in a short proximity to the NYSE This is why access to HFT is generally restricted to the largest institutions because they can afford all of the above and once they have it established it s basically an infinite money pipe As long as it s trading and the bots are running they re making money All this brings me to the point I m most interested in Let s say the 0 1 FTT actually passes I doubt it ever will but what if Some people say that HFT benefits the market by closing up B A spreads and increasing liquidity Personally I say it sounds like bullshit being pushed by HFTers as an excuse to hang on to their money faucets What would or could actually happen if HFT dies out What other impacts could the 0 1 FTT have that I might have missed

loa1xn the ultimate dd on trch wprice targets https www reddit com user Mr Delmont comments loa1xn the ultimate dd on trch wprice targets I ve worked pretty hard over the past week to collect and ensure all of this information is correct I would appreciate your input or maybe get this DD trending so that the community here can collectively provide input and then each of you decide for yourselves what you want to do with the information We see a lot of tickers get thrown around on Reddit StockTwits Discord Twitch YouTube TikTok Twitter you get the point Everyone who has at least one thumb and a brokerage account wants to share what they claim to be the best stock ever that hasn t been found yet and really it s just the same tickers that we ve seen since March 2020 and the person has been holding a bag this whole time That being said I am very skeptical of what I hear basically believing none of it I do my own research my own screening etc However if the person can provide some solid information that will get my attention I will listen and then dive down the DD rabbit hole fucking Alice in r wallstreetbets https www reddit com r wallstreetbets style So let us begin The ticker is TRCH and I m sure some of you have seen it already I m betting some of you have a few hundred or thousand shares Good Now if you re unsure of why you bought it or if you have never heard of this ticker before let me break it down for you TRCH recently did an offering which scares a lot of traders but shouldn t depending on the circumstances Lately we ve seen the opposite effect occur during offerings where the stock runs higher rather than having a huge dip from panicking traders who sell as soon as they see the SEC filing TRCH did an offering because they had to in order to get to the level of cash they needed Thats because they have HUGE plans and it starts with them merging with Meta Meta is also HUGE Some of Meta s customers and partners include Sony Airbus Panasonic Boeing Mazda ThermoFisher Scientific but most importantly for TRCH Samsung Why do we care about Samsung And why do we care about TRCH when they re just an energy resource company that is apparently selling off all of their assets Just shut up and listen Metamaterial OTC MMATF announced the signing of a definite agreement for a business combination with Torchlight Energy TRCH back in December Okay so if Meta is an OTC how are they so huge Well because to understand a companies value and potential value we have to look at not only their financials but also the leadership and direction they are taking their company There are a lot of successful and cash heavy companies that aren t publicly traded And stocks rise in value based on forward looking speculation I mean look at TSLA Meta is the real deal and are in a bunch of different markets They have billion dollar potential because they re in all of the RIGHT markets We re talking markets like EV LED Solar GlucoWise Holography Lithography MRI and others They have 89 filed patents 54 granted across 28 patent families 21 granted 5 registered trademarks and proprietary custom manufacturing processes and trade secrets developed over 10 years with multi million dollar investments Just check out the new investor presentation Fuck it if you ve read this far I ll just share some info from the presentation for you right now In the presentation there is mention of a biosensor This smartphone attached biosensor under development uses nonmaterial for molecular fingerprint detection in a range of applications such as COVID 19 and others and Daily use biosensor with sensitivity and performance enhanced using nano material to meet rising demand for point of care testing and then quotes a market potential of 10 B That B is for Billion Global Biosensors Market is expected to reach USD 41 29 billion by 2027 They want a huge piece of the pie and this is just one emerging sector they are in If they are projecting 10 billion market potential and TRCH market cap isn t even 500 million BOOM IMO the offering on TRCH was the chance to buy but if you didn t get in then Monday would be the time to get in because they have been trading much lower the past two days following a couple hit pieces by SeekingAlpha By the way the people who wrote the hit pieces on TRCH you guessed it they are shorting it More on them in a moment Just always remember SeekingAlpha is garbage They TRCH regularly have a huge short percentage was 32 short interest on February 10 and today the short volume ratio was 26 which means that a WHOLE LOT OF SHORTS ARE GONNA LEARN Shorts have had fun and they ve been getting cocky the past couple days That s about to change come Monday February 22nd Lets examine the shorts shall we White Diamond Research yup they re the guys who wrote the SeekingAlpha hit pieces This group is the biggest bear group I know and the sad part they re absolutely terrible at it They claim a 90 success rate and 3rd party verification but how they came to making that statement I have no idea Just look at what they have shorted RIOT they went bearish and took a short position at 2 41 and RIOT was trading on Friday at a peak of 77 80 That is over a 3 200 increase Someone call an ambulance but not for me They took a short position on GP in December when it was trading at 18 33 and it was trading today at over 30 oof They took a short position on CLSK in October when it was trading at 10 75 and just like all the other short positions they take they wrote hit pieces on CLSK and gave it a 3 price target which would have been a 77 decrease in value from the level they took their position What is CLSK trading at now They are at 34 at this moment and were over 42 earlier this week That s 14X the bull shit price target they gave back in October That s a 1 400 difference They also shorted MVIS when it was trading at 2 02 in August 2020 Considering MVIS is trading at 20 13 at this very moment and peaked at 24 18 this week I d say it is safe to say that White Diamond Research Group should consider changing their name to We Don t Research Group I know that was a terrible attempt at making a joke I m not that funny But I know how to do DD What we can derive from their actual track record when shorting literally any stock is that White Diamond Research sucks so good at what they do that if you invest in anything they short you re almost guaranteed to double triple maybe even 35x your money Makes you wonder if they re trying to play some reverse psychology here and scoop up shares for themselves with really cheap fire sales The merger is less than three weeks away March 12 and yet 48 have already voted in favor of it I m sure by now that number has increased as this is based off of a tweet by the CEO a few days ago So yeah the CEO tweeted this and said he was looking forward to March 12th But does what the insiders tweet really matter Absolutely and we have all seen how CEO s with an active presence on twitter has been good for a plethora of other publicly traded companies So yes it absolutely does matter especially if they put their money where their mouth is So lets take a look at insider ownership and if there has been an increase or decrease Well first up is Greg McCabe Director at TRCH He recently bought 1 630 434 shares of his own company At the time it was worth 749 999 64 and since then the offering has closed and evidently he is still holding every single last one of his shares Diamond Hands Greg is going to give White Diamond Paper Hands Research Group a run for their money Overall insider ownership transactions have increased by 20 43 according to FinViz showing a lot of buying and nobody selling TRCH also will be giving a special dividend which will also attract bigger fish Why else do current investors have a reason to hold Because when the merger goes through on March 12 Torchlight is expected to sell off its oil and gas assets by June 30 2021 What is that worth 33 463 330 and this would become a one time payment to shareholders Meta also recently acquired Interglass a Swiss Lens Manufacturer We can understand the reason why and the potential when we read from one of their recent filings META will invest and expand its capabilities in design development and manufacturing of metaFUSION TradeMarked products for smart eyewear This highly integrated solution combines embedded metamaterial and functional film elements with precision cast corrective lenses which are required by over 50 of potential users in the market So basically META is in every emerging market but they re still OTC which means merging with TRCH is basically the missing piece Then after the merger I am sure many of META s wonderful partners will have great PR lined up Considering the amount of shorts and Paper Hands White Diamond Research Group betting against TRCH I m betting there will be a massive squeeze I see TRCH running up all the way to merger starting next week after the market has found its correction which I believe was finally this past Friday As of today TRCH is undervalued has a catalyst merger is cash heavy debt free and the merger is with META which puts them in emerging markets My analysis is that this merger will drive the price up beginning next week all the way through and after the merger is complete shorts will all get squeezed and based on being cash heavy in emerging markets and forward speculation this stock will be a 20 stock in a few months I think it s possible we see 8 10 by March 12th and depending on how epic the short squeeze is and how many people find this company it could go parabolic to 30 before settling around 22 If all of this isn t enough to convince you that TRCH is going to run hard and fast with organic continuation for months afterwards let me fill you in on a bonus piece of information Remember how I said I would write more on TSLA Yeah so apparently TRCH is working with TSLA Don t believe me Do some DD of your own and look up this address 1 Research Drive Dartmouth Nova Scotia B2Y 4M9 Canada I took a long position as of Friday morning I have been skeptical until I did weeks of research and watched the stock run up and then come back down after it got a small pump from Atlas That is another good sign If veterans founders of the Discord group Atlas are all long in TRCH I d say that is a good indication that this could really run up to 20 30 in the next couple months and 12 within the next 3 weeks which is a 400 increase from its closing price on Friday If it goes parabolic and reaches 30 that s a 1 000 increase This stock also has the behavior of a parabolic runner and I m thinking it will perform more like RIOT over the course of the next year It will run up to 20 within a couple months and as their emerging market technology is PR d it will continue to run up every few weeks making higher highs and higher lows each time

The future of farming is dire and AppHarvest APPH will be one of the top companies providing sustainable solutions to agriculture WSB TLDR uhh diamond hands this stock its not going to the moon overnight its going outside the solar system slowly but surely As the human population continues to grow and climate change continues changing the planet farmers face rising costs and our environment faces more pollution as a result Because of increasing food production to meet population growth topsoil is degrading at an alarming rate Experts believe that most of the world s topsoil will be infertile in 60 years To continue fertilizing topsoil farmers will have to rely significantly more on pesticides and fertilizers to protect their crops The runoff from these chemicals already have lasting effects causing ocean dead zones algal blooms and reductions in bee populations To ensure global long term food security several start ups are creating vertical indoor farms where methods such as hydroponics aquaponics and aeroponics are used to grow plants at a far lower resource cost Water can be recycled water and fertilizer usage is dramatically reduced and pesticides are no longer needed Much less land is needed as well and soil degradation would have no effect on these farms as soil is not used in them These farms can also be placed wherever from cities and suburbs to rural areas traditionally used for traditional farming This flexibility allows vertical indoor farms to drastically simplify the food supply chain Rather than import olives from Spain to Cleveland Ohio in the winter an indoor farm outside Akron can grow them and deliver them much more easily As the human population continues to grow reducing the ecological footprint of farming through vertical indoor farming will be necessary in creating a sustainable future However like most new innovations there are some downsides to the practice and obstacles that must be overcome to scale the practice up successfully As one can imagine there are very expensive capital costs in constructing a vertical indoor farm Although there are several notable automated indoor farms such as the Techno Farm Keihanna plant in Japan most are not automated in order to mitigate up front costs These farms can then face intensive operating costs due to labor and maintenance of a controlled environment Many farms use LEDs to grow crops and coupled with the power used to control the indoor environment the electricity cost can be substantial The indoor farming industry is very new compared to the history of agriculture which is almost 12 000 years long Because of this many scientists start ups are still researching ways to grow new crops in the most efficient manner possible inside Currently most indoor farms only produce leafy green crops such as lettuce As good as lettuce is indoor crop yields must diversify to increase demand of these farms One startup AppHarvest seems to be one of the best current investments in this industry for the reasons listed below Started up in 2020 so most capital technology used in farms is more advanced than those in older farms Uses mostly natural light instead of LEDs to grow plants reducing electricity usage immensely Based in Appalachia Kentucky so most costs would be lower than those that other startups face AeroFarms based in New Jersey and Gotham Greens in New York City Kentucky is within a day s drive of 70 percent of the U S population In a region impacted severely by the decline in coal use so region could revitalize with AppHarvest s growth First harvest yielded tomatoes a new crop in the indoor farming industry Producing a fruit at such a large scale is revolutionary for vertical indoor farming amp x200B This isn t a get rich quick stock but I believe that given the long term outlook of food security investing now in a revolutionizing vertical indoor farming company will have immense payoffs long term From a bearish perspective indoor farming may not become the norm but it will be used substantially at least in countercyclical farming to simplify supply chains and reduce emissions from crop distribution Like I said this is my first DD so I d love to hear back and discuss other companies investments in vertical indoor farming amp x200B Sources https www foodnavigator usa com Article 2021 01 19 AppHarvest

according to a median forecast of market research firm FnGuide The quarterly results reflect a quick recovery of steel demand amid short supplies in the United States and Europe and a hike in steel

Looking ahead Kim Hyun wook an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp said Posco could enjoy the effects of a price hike of its steel products noting a spike in raw material costs could lead to an increase in Posco s steel prices A spike in raw material costs can weigh on Posco but the company can increase prices of its steel products amid strong demand which could help improve the steelmakers

chairman of the Guild of Bumiputra Contractors Bhd said that steel in particular had increased in price by nearly 40 in the last six weeks up to nearly RM3 000 a tonne He urged the government to interfere by controlling the prices of these products and penalising suppliers who take part in unethical price manipulation This was echoed by the Master Builders Association of Malaysia who said price increases are particularly damaging to smaller stakeholders who may not have predicted the cost of adhering to Covid 19 standard operating procedures like testing workers and operating with a limited workforce The government should implement strict control over prices of construction materials to prevent cartels and monopolies taking advantage of these it said It further suggested that it

market worried about weakening steel margins and the COVID 19 outbreak in China while anticipating improved steel demand after the Lunar New Year holidays next month What China s possible steel export rebate cuts mean for businesses around the world A key topic reverberating around the Asian steel market over the past month has been the possibility of China reducing steel export rebates to 9 from the current 13 or possibly axing them altogether Market chatter on this topic has grown increasingly louder with industry sources in China hearing more and more details about these plans from late January onward This is likely in line with China s ongoing drive to reduce steel capacity and cutting the rebates would force steelmakers to concentrate on domestic markets and not produce excessively to service overseas markets a Chinese trader told Fastmarkets The cutting or removal of export rebates would be extremely impactful without an export rebate of 13 or even a reduced rate of 9 would mean a general increase in steel prices It would mean Chinese mills will no longer play such a major role in steel seaborne markets leaving a supply gap for other steelmakers to fill WHO IS THE LARGEST ONE IN THE WORLD MT This would likely boost spot prices This is indeed good news for steelmakers around the world because this would mean that Chinese export prices will no longer be among the lowest in the world and would reduce the competitive pressure on suppliers in the Asia Pacific region such as Japan South Korea Taiwan Vietnam and India There is more granular detail to be found in the various ferrous markets depending on demand and supply fundamentals as well as how big a part China plays in these markets Steel Demand Steel Dynamics Chief Executive Market Millett says he s

DTCC, TLDR Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan are Melvin s main Prime Brokers All three firms privately own and sit on the board of the DTCC If naked shorting occurred in GME there s good reason to believe the three named prime brokers and the DTCC may have shut down 1 28 for nefarious reasons beyond the sudden and potentially arbitrary collateral requirements stated If you ve read my last post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lma1ev illegal tactics and dtccprime broker complicity I hypothesize that if naked shorting is present in GME prime brokers and the DTCC which is privately owned by the prime brokers would need to be complicit in it which adds another dimension to whether the retail shutdown 1 28 to stop the squeeze was done for nefarious reasons On the question of whether DTCC was right to shut down trading on 1 28 based on collateral requirements I m not an expert on this subject but I ve seen many compelling arguments against it including how did they arrive at the 3 billion number for Robinhood and why were they able to get negotiated from 3 billion to 700 million per following DTCC s special requirements and why was cash customers restricted vs just margin And why was selling allowed but not buying why not shut off both Another interest point is that the DTCC has often been implicated and accused of enabling naked short selling over the years and that the DTCC is privately owned by Prime Brokers Banks One question posed to me by a reporter was who are the prime brokers involved So I decided to do some digging and found this disclosure form https reports adviserinfo sec gov reports ADV 173228 PDF 173228 pdf https reports adviserinfo sec gov reports ADV 173228 PDF 173228 pdf which shows that Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan are Melvin Capital s three largest prime brokers based on assets held under custodianship As a reminder if these prime brokers did allow naked shorting and the short squeeze had occurred pushing prices to thousands per share the hedge funds would likely not be able to pay that and prime brokers would be left holding the bag to cover which would also suggest they would be disincentivized to margin call All three firms own and sit on the board of DTCC https www dtcc com about leadership board https www dtcc com about leadership board Note that National Financial Services Fidelity is also a prime broker they use but only 6 million in assets under custodianship as compared to a 1 16 billion each for Goldman Sach and Morgan Stanley and 265 million for JP Morgan at the time of the disclosure snapshot 03 2020 I found this to be an interesting data point and wanted to share with the board Note the same Goldman Sachs that has been repeatedly implicated in naked shorting cases Source https www sec gov news pressrelease 2016 9 html https www sec gov news pressrelease 2016 9 html and given nothing but slap on the wrists for enforcement Also the same Goldman that accidentally leaked it s own emails while defending a naked shorting lawsuit that implicated itself and other banks in participating in naked shorting including quotes like We are NOT borrowing negatives I have made that clear from the beginning Why would we want to borrow them We want to fail them and stock is trading at negative rebate with non paying customers naked short In one email Goldman Sachs tells a client We will let you fail FTID trade a stock without locating it and an email from a Goldman Sachs hedge fund client who remarked that when wanting to short an impossible name and fully expecting not to receive it he would then be shocked to learn that Goldman s representative could get it for us Source https web archive org web 20201028054857 https www rollingstone com

it relates to selling order flow and RH making making 40 of their total revenue from it there s also a relationship between Robinhood and Goldman Sachs who they would do well to have on their good side ahead of the IPO The thesis of whether there were more nefarious reasons to the 1 28 shut down which short squeeze was set to occur and when Interactive Brokers CEO projected price would ve been in the thousands https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lmagzp today interactive brokers ceo admits that without https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lmagzp today interactive brokers ceo admits that without is tied to whether or not naked shorting occurred in GME because if it did then the Prime Brokers involved and DTCC would likely have been complicit they would likely be holding the bag if a short squeeze did occur as well as blow back for allowing naked shorting As long documented by counterfeitingstock com the short hedge funds the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp DTCC make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated The counterfeiting of shares is done by participating prime brokers or the DTC which is owned by the prime brokers A number of lawsuits that involve naked shorting have named about ten of the prime brokers as defendants including Goldman Sachs Bear Stearns Citigroup Merrill Lynch UBS Morgan Stanley and others The DTCC has also been named in a number of lawsuits that allege stock counterfeiting Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses Potential target companies are identified analyzed and prioritized The attack is planned to its most minute detail The plan consists of taking a large short position then crushing the stock price and if possible putting the company into bankruptcy Source http counterfeitingstock com CS2 0 CounterfeitingStock html http counterfeitingstock com CS2 0 CounterfeitingStock html A former economist who worked in operations at the DTCC Susanne Trimbath even came out in this insightful article https www thekomisarscoop com 2020 03 how phantom shares on wall street threaten u s companies and investors and blew the whistle on naked shorting being allowed to happen within the DTCC I highly recommend you read the full article Just to highlight one part of it Timbath says The Securities and Exchange Act of 1933 specifically gave the clearing house the right to require that shares and securities be delivered for settlement It allows them to punish those who don t deliver by refusing to have them in the system The DTCC has for years ignored that Source https www thekomisarscoop com 2020 03 how phantom shares on wall street threaten u s companies and investors https www thekomisarscoop com 2020 03 how phantom shares on wall

of lawsuits for naked shorting that are often settled out of court because of that but if you re an investor in the trade you ve probably noticed that in the past three weeks GME has had a lot of strange things happen to the stock including seeing a precipitous drop in price starting 2 1 and onwards while short interest supposedly dropped These things all make sense if you consider naked shorting occurred In the case of GameStop there are several very strong signs indicators that naked shorting has occurred I will list some of the indicators that Naked Shorting occurred in GameStop below 1 One indicator is GME s extremely high number of Fail to Delivers www wherearetheshares com http www wherearetheshares com which are one of the top in the stock market over a sustained period of time The website www wherearetheshares com http www wherearetheshares com shows extraordinarily high FTIDs extending from 2020 to years back Michael Burry tweeted that in May 2020 when he lent out his GME it took weeks for his brokers to locate the shares https web archive org web 20210130030954 https twitter com michaeljburry lang en https web archive org web 20210130030954 https twitter com michaeljburry lang en FTIDs can happen for a number of reasons but to have this high number of FTIDs over a sustained period of time is highly unusual and a stock with a high number of FTIDs is one potential indicator that counterfeit shares are in circulation and naked shorting occured 2 Short Interest in GME has been extremely high at numbers significantly over 100 of float As of January 15th short interest was 226 https imgur com fN4fVQl https imgur com fN4fVQl of the entire float While it is theoretically possible for short interest to be over 100 with brokers repeatedly leading to each other short interest this high at 226 of the total float is highly unusual and an indicator of naked shorting occured which is a far more feasible scenario because naked shorting enables short interest to rise quickly as you do not need to determine the shares exist before you short 3 Institutions alone have held a staggering 177 of float as of 1 31 according to Bloomberg Terminal https i redd it c44cmb67mtf61 png https i redd it c44cmb67mtf61 png which is highly unusual and could be a strong sign that GME is rampant with counterfeit shares Another interesting datapoint is Fidelity s calculation of retail ownership is only 0 1 float https imgur com a FtSOiCW https imgur com a FtSOiCW which is highly unusual and unlikely to be true any potential indications that counterfeit shares are in play because number of shares to ownership potentially cannot be conclusively determined On Monday 2 1 there was a momentous price drop and that drop continued through the week Given the continued high short interest and retail interest to force shorts into a short squeeze the price drop made little sense especially because short interest remained high and even if shorts had covered there should ve been an upward price pressure What makes the most sense to me is that the price drop was facilitated by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares in a short down ladder described below Short A will sell a counterfeit share at 10 Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position Short B will then offer a short counterfeit share at 9 Short A will hit that offer or short B will come down and hit Short A s 9 bid Short A buys the share for 9 covering his open 10 short and booking a 1 profit By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral If there happens to be significant long buying then the shorts draw from their reserve of strategic fails to deliver and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand Source http counterfeitingstock com CounterfeitingStock html http counterfeitingstock com CounterfeitingStock html In an ordinary scenario with short interest dropping and shorts needing to buy back to cover the price is anticipated to go up As of 2 1 with GME s reported short interest declining with price also dropping there are signs pointing to shorts artificially covering or lowering their short interest via the generation of synthetic longs using options to cover which is in regulation of Reg SHO and again this assertion is supported by the high numbers of FTIDs GME has consistently reported

later ,To start I would like to be very clear I am in no way investing in the short squeeze and for what I am doing it does not matter whether or not it already squoze vs yOu aRe HeRE VolksWagon graph My goal is not to make money My goal is not to lose money I am not trying to send a message I do not care about your upvotes I will not be donating any proceeds to charity Namely because my goal implies that there will be no proceeds My goal is to own GameStop As absolutely much of it as I possibly can while I am alive and on this planet Because of this I want GME shares price to go down Whether this occurs due to algo driven price suppression or organic selling off of shares The more the value drops the more shares I can afford to buy obligatory Not financial advice I like the stock I fully expect everyone to watch me lose money on this Here are the facts 1 Mark Cuban raised a very valid point If you are investing in a company the way we used to as a person who actually wants to own a piece of that company then prices going down is a good thing Cheaper cost of entry position expansion 2 GameStop is poised to d o m i n a t e the space within the gaming industry Looking to build Esports arenas Guess what gyms are going out of business left and right Cheap real estate Dedicated gaming streaming channel Disney and others are already on that bus for their niches so dedicated game streaming platform owned by the single most universal name in gaming would be no surprise I m not talking about livestreams I m talking about produced content Speaking of live Twitch Discord Already set up and instead of competing GameStop could literally just buy these companies and relabel them Gwitch and Gamescord or leave them as is just own the revenue streams There are so many more things possible for a centralized brand with clear intentions of being a cultural hub epicenter really for such a massively exploding industry an industry with zero sign of slowing down Ever Entertainment as an all things umbrella industry will only become bigger and more valuable as our human lives become increasingly comfortable and more necessary as we deal with increasing amounts of stress when shit goes badly Interactive entertainment is just unrivaled 3 The man the legend the boyfriend to all of our wives DFV Roaring Kitty Mr G just doubled his shares position He undoubtedly recognizes the potential negative impact that him selling his entire position on GME would have on the stock and I have little to no doubt that he has already pulled millions of dollars off the top of his originally exploding positions values remember all those calls he had that were absolutely blowing up I didn t do the math and I m not gonna but I d be willing to bet money that he didn t turn 100 of those profits into shares anywhere near the top Because of this he has negative downside risk GameStop could go bankrupt and he would still come out ahead I m in a much much smaller but similar boat I made 100K and kept 100 shares which I fully intend to take to my grave This is the thing that got me thinking about this in the first place 4 GameStop will never be forgotten This is a stock which will be discussed in investment classes until the end of time The face of investing will be changed forever because of WSB and the GME phenomenon Even if there are not new regulations trade taxes the world will always always remember G M E 5 I am just fine financially My small business generates 100K to 250K year in revenue This is not a YOLO play I can afford to lose the money I am putting in Do not slide into my DMs seeking financial assistance See above where I discuss proceeds and how they won t exist so there s no money anyway The Plan Buy as many shares as I can afford never expecting to see that money ever again Sell a few covered calls way in the future at or out of the money As they approach expiration roll them forward another year This will either reduce my cost basis as the price drops or secure and yes limit upside potential in the case of the stock going up significantly in value As long as these options do not get exercised I will still own the shares I would prefer these options expire worthless so I may expand my share count over the 25 35 cash ROI every year see below somewhere As I earn more money externally buy more shares Again as many as I can afford Every Single Year Just constantly expand my position No matter what Forever Profit never Not ever sell a single share Use any capital gained from selling covered calls to you guessed it buy more shares Remember my goal here is to own shares not to make money Any money earned from selling calls will turn into more shares Any money earned externally that I do not need access to will be turned into more shares Currently at the money covered calls expiring 1 21 22 about a year out are effectively worth 35 40 of the value of the stock Assuming the stock value declines or stagnates YoY then I could theoretically increase my position by a solid 35 each year Yes there will be a decrease in IV in this case but using externally earned money I should be able to make up the difference First milestone overtake u DeepFuckingValue in share volume I will never beat his gains and I may never exceed his actual cash value returns but that is fine My goal is purely share count Second milestone overtake Ryan Cohen in share volume My understanding is that he currently owns 9 million shares I haven t dug any deeper than literally the first thing that pops up on google when you type ryan cohen gamestop shares and I m not gonna Anything further is basically the deep web and 9 million shares is a plenty fast rabbit to chase to keep myself motivated I am confident that I will fail at my second milestone as it would likely be reliant on Ryan selling his ownership in the company and moving on to do something else with his life before I get old and die Third milestone Own run and manage GameStop Whatever that means Member of the board sure Bust in on meetings like Hey I own most of this place someone grab me a coffee and then yell about how I pay your salary as I m being escorted out by security more likely But I m not gonna stop until I am at the head of that table even if I have keep at this until I am 85 years old or even if it happens right before GameStop finally gives up the ghost and goes bankrupt With this strategy cumulatively expanding my position by 35 YoY I should be able to turn a 1 000 share portfolio into a 8million share portfolio in 30 years This is just based on current prices options values and my current income It couldn t bother me less if it goes to 1 0 50 or 0 25 per share At a certain point cash infusion for shares from my income will grossly outweigh the rate at which options can possibly expand my ownership of the stock I like this stock and if that means I end up owning enough shares to run that shit myself then I will consider my life a massive success The only disappointment I could possibly experience with this plan it s not even a strategy at this point would be if GME finally squeezes all at once and all these options get exercised calling all my shares away from me increasing my net worth by 35 all at once Or if GME just does really well organically which would significantly slow down the rate at which I could expand my ownership in shares Becoming a millionaire would be cool and all but I m trying to do something specific here SEC interns I m just sharing my thoughts and am in no way advising anything to anyone I just like the damn stock Hedgies and MMs please crank up your algos to maximum Never stop doing what you re doing I need this thing continually dropping so I can keep my covered call money and amass shares YoY Current shareholders you are the only thing standing in my way and the ask ladder is pretty brutal with all y all s meme ass prices If at some point you get bored and sell off to take profits I will thank you for it If you wanna dump that shit all at once and not worry about it maybe shoot for buying back in lower I d appreciate that even more Yes I m going to be updating y all weekly or monthly or annually whatever Might be a little bit to get started as I m currently working to get all of my cash out of RH and somewhere better But hey I have 30 years to get this sorted out right Make fun of me as I lose money Ask me for advice as I make money Call me an idiot for the platforms I use Try to sell me access to your crappy web based indicator research tools None of it will matter Whether I am a fool or a genius will undoubtedly be decided by a coin toss of whether or not GME becomes fundamentally valuable I suppose tl dr there is no tl dr I am posting this just so I can reference it later when sharing my GME lifelong investor updates

story that involves GME but it is not about GME The events I m describing here happened on January 28 in my cash retirement account In short I had some GME shares and used the interface to sell them immediately after I read that Robinhood announced the disabling of their buy button A few minutes later it did not appear to work so I attempted to sell again Subsequently my account showed that both sells went through Then my account had the cash from both sales and a negative balance of shares that I was required to deliver in 3 days After seeing the stock price dramatically rise and my apparent liabilities increasing without limit I freaked out and covered the short position at a huge loss 180k If I was lucky and the price went down I could have been able to cover the short at a huge gain and could have kept my mouth shut not that I would have But instead I m out a bunch of money in my retirement account that was a result of this bug and Schwab owes me about 180k Had I not covered this erroneous short position the shorts probably would have become what we know to be Failures to Deliver I have attached the record of what happened below which I sent to Schwab soon after the event to try to get the situation undone I eventually was able to call their support team and they said I would have to wait 30 days to resolve the situation The guy on the phone said they were having lots of problems with this bug in other equities too I can t recall the complete conversation Anyway I recently got a message in the system that I would have to wait another 30 days So I flipped my shit and now I m posting about it here Please don t comment about how retarded I am for investing my retirement in GME That s not the story I do what I want I like the stock and there is a serious problem here completely unrelated to how retarded I am and the general public absolutely needs to know what is going on I have no information about how many naked short positions were created other than it was more than just myself and in other equities as well I have no information about whether or not the bug still exists I did not test it It may very well be the case that the bug is still a problem as far as I know Related I recently posted something that made me suspicious to r stocks https www reddit com r stocks comments lnvero i strongly suspect that schwabameritrade does not https www reddit com r stocks comments lnvero i strongly suspect that schwabameritrade does not I didn t realize this until today but I connected the dots between the details of this post and what happened to me in my Schwab retirement account i e Schwab TD are the same company and these two things could be related Here is the message I sent to Schwab for a record of what happened You might notice that it s a 401 k which most people might note does not usually allow individual stock trading but it is a self managed fund and individual stocks are actually allowed START OF MESSAGE To whom it may concern My name is my account number is I attempted to call your 1 800 number several times but I was unable to get through to your support Here is a breakdown of what happened There is a bug in your system that caused my non margin account to briefly become short GME shares My account is a non margin 401 k account In good faith I spent 430k to cover the position that my account should not have been allowed to get into Two trades need to be undone At market open my position this morning was NNNN shares of GME At 11 09 I attempted to place a market order to sell NNNN shares Order AAAAAAAA The order did not show up for about 10 minutes My account balance still showed NNNN shares so I attempted to make a similar order again I placed a sell of Limit Or Better to sell NNNN shares at 125 Order BBBBBBBB About 10 minutes later I got confirmations for BOTH ORDERS and a notice that the account was due securities I DO NOT have a margin account and it should not have gone short the system should have rejected one of the orders because the shares were not in my account Once I realized what the system did I saw the short position which your system erroneously put me in and to protect from the potential infinite uncovered losses on my account I did a market buy at 11 44AM for NNNN shares using the Buy to Cover button which zeroed out my position in GME Order CCCCCCCC The erroneous trade needs to be undone and my buy to cover also needs to be undone as both of these are not legal trades for my 401 k Orders BBBBBBBB and CCCCCCCC should not exist on my account BBBBBBBB is a result of a bug in your trading system and CCCCCCCC was a good faith attempt for me to prevent the issue from becoming a much bigger problem I m sending this in a timely manner so there is a record of what happened and I will refer to it when I call again when your call volume is reduced END OF MESSAGE Disclosure My current positions in my 401 k are as follows ignoring what Schwab owes me GME 4500 shares Cash amp Money Market 180k Again please don t comment about the intelligence or stupidity of my investing strategies None of this is advice If you do anything related to what I m talking about here you re probably retarded
