7,ouy0yl,t2_70k8pb6d,1627694244,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ouy0yl/covered_call_alternative/,1,Covered Call alternative,My bullish alternative to covered calls Hello everybody There are a lot of investors selling covered calls on long term investments and many say that it is a wasted income opportunity if you don t There is however a big problem with selling covered calls on stocks that you are highly bullish on that is important to keep in mind I also made a post some time ago asking for input on my suggested solution to this problem but I do not really feel like I explained my thoughts in enough detail so I will try to explain my strategy again this time in more detail If you already know the problem with selling covered calls on stocks that you are highly bullish on then feel free to skip down to my ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY below as I would still very much like your input on this THE ISSUE WITH SELLING COVERED CALLS ON STOCKS YOU ARE HIGHLY BULLISH ON For this example I am going to be using Upstart Holdings Inc UPST This is a stock that I am highly bullish on and hence also a stock that I would seriously consider using my alternative strategy on Let s assume that I bought 100 stocks of Upstart today at 122 stock giving me a total investment of 12 200 I am highly bullish on the stock but still want to create an income flow from the stock position The traditional way is that I sell an OTM covered call on a short ish expiration In this example I am selling a OTM covered call for August 27 27 days from today with a strike of 132 10 above the current stock price The bid ask midpoint here is about 9 20 so in this example I net 920 from selling the covered call If the stock price drops or trades below 132 at expiration I will keep my stock position having netted the 920 and I can then sell a new covered call for the next cycle This is the optimal scenario for this strategy and the aim of anybody selling covered calls on stocks they want to keep BUT this is a stock that I am highly bullish on It traded at 164 in June and I fully believe it will blast past this point as some point in a not so distant future If it went back to 164 before August 27 I would be forced to sell the stock at 132 netting me a loss missed profit of 32 share 3 200 in total This is a bad deal as we only made 920 selling the covered call in the first place And the more bullish you are the better the stock does past the strike price the worse this strategy is Covered calls effectively limits your upside potential significantly and to me that is not a balanced trade off for the downside protection it offers in reducing my cost basis for the position in total This works fine on a slow moving stock but not on something that I am highly bullish on The most common comment here is but you can just roll the option and yes you can but that only really helps if I believe that it will revert back down Otherwise sooner or later I will have my position called away from me as a loss compared to the stock price at the time ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY My alternative strategy is only relevant on stocks that you are highly bullish on and only really work if it is done on margin Instead of using a covered call I want to sell a naked put on the stock position If this strategy already has a name and is widely recognized then I will settle for a simple duh it s called xxx but I have not been able to find it I have no ego in this and really just want to help and to learn It must be a naked put sold on margin as we do not want to tie up funds for this otherwise it would not be a fair comparison to covered calls either Instead of selling a Covered Call 10 above the current price I sell a put 10 below the current price If the stock price rises or trades sideways the put will expire worthless just like the covered call would if the stock price fell or traded sideways My potential risk here is not if the stock goes up which is what I am betting on and not want to limit but if the stock price drops Let s examine when will happens if it does I have still invested 12 200 in 100 shares of Upstart I then sell a put with a strike 10 below the current price of 122 This 112 put is sold on the same expiration as the covered call above and will net me 8 4 share or 844 for the total contract At this point I have no upside limitations on my stock position but the naked put has both generated a bit of cashflow equivalent to roughly 8 of my initial investment 844 12 200 and obligated me to buy an additional 100 shares of the price drops below the strike It is obvious to everyone that if that does not happen the strategy works fine But what happens IF the stock price drops below the strike and I then run the risk of getting assigned an additional 100 shares My solution is to simply sell my long position and wait to get assigned from the put Let me explain If I sell my 100 shares of Upstart at 112 my trade costs are 8 57 for the trade I just entered it into my broker to check which is almost precisely 1 of the total earnings from the put option sold 844 But having netted 8 44 share when selling the put option I can afford to have the stock drop to 103 56 before I am no longer in the green on the put itself the strike of 112 minus the 8 44 share from the put If the strike drops close to 103 56 I sell my 100 shares If it goes back up above the strike I buy it back again It would have to move up and down nearly 100 times in and out of this range with me buying and selling every time before the premium from the put was spend on trading costs alone And that would be a very unusual situation The worst situation would be if the stock completely tanked and dropped to something like 90 Here I would still be forced to buy the shares via the put at 112 here it WOULD make sense to roll but since I also sold my original long position at 112 I would be left in the same situation that I would have been in had I only held stocks and never bought or sold any options In fact a bit better as I still collected the premium from the put I should point out that I am not taxed on the sale itself as I am only taxed for the sum total earnings or losses of all investments at the end of each year Now this is my strategy Feel free to poke as many holes in it as you can possibly find as I am only here to learn Thank you for your time

about the experience as a user I m currently a WISH investor with 2200 shares at an average of 9 4 my views may be biased and all views are welcomed To start this off here are some of my favourite comments that I read about WISH and my thoughts 1 WISH sells trash I don t totally disagree with this Even if 2 genius level intellects consummate and have 10 kids surely there will be at least one kid that is not too bright I guess With WISH we re now looking at over 800k merchants and hundreds of millions of products There are bound to be trashy stuff this is the same with Amazon same with Taobao 2 I don t invest in Chinese stocks Maybe this stupid ape mixed up WISH with another company We can actually Wiki this WISH is an American online e commerce platform based in San Francisco United States that facilitates transactions between sellers and buyers But they do have a significant number of merchants from China this is the same with Amazon same with Taobao 3 WISH sells Chinese junk Similar to point 1 but will just like to bring us back to reality that made in China products are here to stay whether we like it or not I can t think of another country with a bigger population of people that works as hard fast or cheap China produce about almost everything from cars to smartphones tablets stupid plastic toys big city skyscrapers etc you name it Look around your home and you ll probably find something that s made in China Tesla cars Iphones and many more big brand names are also made in China 4 Scam You re going to wait months for something which may never come As a WISH user I m going to have to say that this is a myth WISH is not a scam 2 5b revenues in 2020 projected 3 2b revenues in 2021 and over 100m monthly active users are facts If the product you want is not available it will be reflected as sold out When you place your purchase for an item which is available it will come Like most good e commerce platforms you ll be able to check your order status processed shipped arrival date etc via the WISH app and there s immediate 24 7 customer support whenever you need it If you want your items urgently you can pay more for WISH Express But if you re like most WISH users that are buying not through a search query and instead from personalized browsing basically it s mostly impulse buys and not needs based you can probably wait for your items to arrive which lowers the cost base And no it won t take months WISH quotes me an estimated 2 3 weeks for my items to arrive and I usually get them before the actual projected arrival date 5 Goodluck with your imitation crap that you purchased This comment reminds me of the time when I was studying as a kid my teacher used to say that copying from my classmates was wrong As an adult now I will like to share with her a quote from Oscar Wilde Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness This next quote is from me In the business world no amount of copying is bad unless we re copying crap 6 Dishonest management just look at the number of Class Action Lawsuits On the contrary imo one of the strongest points which keeps me convicted on WISH is actually their stellar management team and how they are incentivised for their stock price to do well over the long term through stock based compensation with future vesting periods Although not exactly the same it reminds me of how Steve Jobs was paid 1 and the rest through Apple stocks Just do a search on WISH management and you ll see many familiar names to get excited about Joe Lonsdale ex palantir co founder Jacqueline Reses ex Square Capital ex board on Ali Baba Farhang Kassaei ex Google ex Ebay just to name a few WISH is also in the select group of companies where their CEO Piotr Szulczewski is also the founder Considering the amount of skin he has in the game as the founder as a major shareholder and having rejected all the attractive buy out offers in the past I think it s quite safe to say that he is not looking for quick short term profits and that he has big ambitious goals for his baby WISH over the longer term On the other hand look into the Law firms and you may find no less than 50 companies per year that they are encouraging investors to file class action suits on I m a WISH investor just as a number of you are do go ahead and join the class actions if you really think you can get any form of settlement Personally I didn t bother as many class actions from Law Firms just have no real basis or settlement results to show for and it feels to me like an advertising gimmick to slap their firm name on or some part of the manipulation game a big waste of my time to even read really 7 Look at the net loss and profit margins WISH is not a profitable company Here is where we may have 2 schools of thought and the decision is entirely yours to make Do we want to invest in a company that is contented at where they are ie show healthy net profits and pass on those profits to their shareholders Or do we want to invest in a company that is ambitious thinks big picture and re invests those profits for explosive long term growth WISH made revenues of 2 5b in 2020 projected 3 2b for 2021 and unlike many tech companies this early stage tech set up can actually show net profits at any moment just by cutting back on sales and marketing expenses look at their balance sheet But instead they are re investing most of their profits into customer acquisition retention logistics infrastructure scaling wish local adding new merchants product categories etc Re investing for growth is personally what I think separates a great company from a good one and I d hate to invest into a company which passes their profits to their investors via share buybacks or dividends as it just displays to me a lack of innovation that they do not know how or what to do with their profits to scale or advance growth Amazon in their early stages warned their investors that they would re invest their profits in the best interests of their shareholders for the long term the smart and patient ones that stuck with them through the years deserve to be where they are today Why I m a happy user of the WISH app For WISH users the satisfaction really comes from finding the gems which is also probably the main reason why the average time spent per user on WISH app are far more than any other e commerce platforms Unlike fucking a dead fish it is just so much more interactive and fun shopping with WISH app Gems are basically good quality products with crazy cheap prices A recent gem I found from WISH was a soundbar for my gaming needs which costs 24 it s about half metre long and I m serious when I say the sound and bass is unbelievably solid for the price that I m paying I will like to encourage anyone to just log into WISH app to discover the gems for yourself to truly understand what I m saying just search under WISH select and there are already tons of solid products which are cheap and good with many verified user reviews Just be warned As a WISH user it all starts with WISH app prompting users to log in to the app with gamification flash sales etc And when you eventually do decide to see what they have to offer with no obligations of course The software prompts further discounts from already very Low prices for immediate purchases adding in similar or complimentary product recommendations based on data and advanced algorithms it s like a dollar store on steroids Most users and especially existing users like myself with address payment details done conveniently make the purchases sooner rather than later and when we do we potentially buy in quantity because of the low prices and understanding on the 2 3 weeks wait time This brings me to another point In order to truly enjoy the experience as a WISH app user your expectations must be accustomed that lower prices come with a longer wait time Good buys come with discovery In summary This is not financial advise buy or sell as you WISH I m just sharing my thoughts on what I believe to be an undervalued underestimated powerhouse and hope to understand the views of others on this topic I m a long term investor and don t expect WISH to pop immediately I feel that it needs some time to mature and I will wait out the manipulation accumulation phase I believe that WISH is a 20x multi bagger my target price 200 that is going to give the big boys in e commerce a good run for their money especially once they awaken with the following 1 To have a fully comprehensive catalogue of products with different price ranges moving upstream to touch a wider demographic audience 2 Filling in the gaps for product categories which are lacking right now in WISH app such as grocery products that are used daily by average consumers that require routine replacement or replenishment eg food beverages and household products 3 Increased sign ups of WISH users with stronger demographic profiles that prioritize services branded product range speed of delivery etc over savings this in turn potentially allows for rapid expansion on their logistics platform and accelerated growth in logistics transaction revenues 4 Establishing WISH as a global brand and expansion of in house WISH products WISH seems to be trending more than just a cool ticker it s also trending as a cool brand with low priced good quality in house WISH products on their platform such as WISH branded hoodies t shirts charging cables sun glasses bags etc Back in the days who knew a tick mark with the word Nike would move on to become a global top selling brand Personally I love the cool simplicity of the WISH logo and their mission to bring affordable and entertaining mobile e commerce to consumers around the world including the underserved With over 300 000 WISH T shirts sold currently in my mind it hints the potentiality of how the WISH branding might scale in an internet world of social media trendings and smartphones 5 Tapping on Jacqueline Reses ex square expertise and experience to accelerate their entry into payment and financial services which will further monetize their growing merchants and user base Imo their user base is likely to grow rapidly regardless of what haters are saying As a WISH user myself I can only say that my experience with WISH is just starting and it s worth referring my friends I believe this experience is not unique to me and that I m just one out of many users that loves WISH app and the WISH brand With over 100m monthly active users over 500m total WISH users over 3m of items sold daily most downloaded app globally for past 3 years we can t be getting it all wrong As the saying goes it only takes a spark to get a fire going 6 Expansion in WISH Local Merchant base WISH is strategically focusing and expanding WISH Local and I can understand why Imo this is the most underestimated revenue generating model that they have and one that can pose a serious threat to Shopify Wish Local can potentially create a sustainable ecosystem and rapid revenue growth while offering a lifeline for brick and mortar retailers to succeed in an era of disruptive tech and innovation fast forwarded by the pandemic WISH will be able to store their inventory orders with WISH local merchants saving costs on storage and last mile delivery This also translates to reduction in time taken for delivery and further cost savings for consumers WISH local merchants get to increase their personal product sales through WISH inventory pick ups as it translates to increased customer footprint and potential sales opportunities Wish local Merchants can also tap on the millions of WISH users by advertising their products through the platform It s basically a potentially easy win for WISH their merchants their customers and ultimately shareholders In addition to the above potential catalysts 1 WISH have massive cash on hand of about 2b and no long term debts Reduced risks from inflation fears potential buy out candidate 2 Strong potential growth in WISH users spending and new user sign ups from their existing marketing strategies pandemic driven consumer behaviour towards digital online shopping referrals word of mouth from existing users and social media hype WISH also participates in an huge e commerce market that s expected to reach 4 5T by 2024 benefits from emerging countries markets growth and is also a large beneficiary from the huge market of Gen Zs Potential monster earnings growth COVID play 3 Super undervalued at 6b market cap vs 3 2b revenue projections Great entry point below 10 we ll have an average which is below most retail and institutional buy in At these prices we re looking at a 60 discount from IPO and 70 discount from all time highs This is imo the last e commerce powerhouse which still haven t popped just take a look at Etsy Shopify Sea Limited to name a few If you see bear reports on WISH like as if they had a crystal ball telling you where the stock is headed please think through whether if it sounds logical or suspect to you All I can say is that trust no one but yourself and your DD it s your hard earned savings after all To share a true story When NIO stock dipped to 10 from 15 back in July 2020 a friend of mine sold all his holdings at a loss trusting on a report from Zacks and analysts and bought other stocks recommended by the same analysts which were deemed safer Almost just after he sold NIO went on to 6x within 6 months and today he is still in the red I don t hope this for anyone but in summary weak hands that lack conviction or patience may regret months down the road when they make silly decisions Maybe that s just another catalyst and what it takes for a stock to rocket when the weak hands are shaken out and new short positions opened based on bear reports Reduced downside risks vs potential upside squeeze play

download it for me I will try to take the precautions of the case Clarifying at the outset that there are people who have infinitely more knowledge of BABA than those who speak to them but can still shed light on the species and try to order you in time and space both from fundamental technical and even geopolitical aspects metrics etc Perhaps there are aspects that you cannot understand because my native language is not English ok but we will try to clarify any doubts you may have As you know I am bought on the asset so my comments could eventually be loaded with a perhaps optimistic bias but we will try to be as objective and cool as possible and rely only on hard data ok let s get started Alibaba is listed on the Hong Kong Hang Seng HSI index which along with BABA has also suffered a strong correction in the last few wheels We attach a chart in monthly view From what I see with the naked eye on that chart an imminent bounce should be coming something that should also drive the

2020 presentation Jovan Lee Yuheng Notable changes since Investor Day 2019 include Increasing its stake in electric vehicle maker Xpeng NYSE XPEV from 3 2 to 19 by the end of 2020 Acquisition of a 72 controlling stake in Sun Art OTCPK SURRY a leading operator of hypermarkets and supermarkets in China in October 2020 In 2021 e commerce is projected to account for more than 50 of total retail sales in the country and this percentage will increase by around 2 per year thereafter Retail e commerce sales growth will slow slowly but annual growth will remain in the 10 range after 2021 According to a Morgan Stanley report in January 2021 Chinese consumer spending will double in ten years China s private consumption was 5 6 trillion in 2019 and is expected to reach 12 7 trillion by 2030 the same amount that Americans currently spend By 2030 per capita disposable income is also expected to increase proportionally from 6 000 a year to 12 000 representing a 7 CAGR over the next decade According to Mashable the Internet economy of Southeast Asia reached the 100 billion mark at the end of 2019 with e commerce being the largest contributor to this figure Out of 100 billion ecommerce platforms generated 38 billion amp x200B Looking ahead the region s online market value is expected to rise to 300 billion by 2025 and e commerce will be one of the biggest benefactors of this growth For many investors Alibaba s foray into the fintech industry through Ant Financial would be a major catalyst for the company s growth However I am not going to include this as a primary growth driver as the restructuring of Ant is still incomplete and we do not know the full impact the regulations will have on Ant Therefore until we have a clearer picture of the Ant s updated structure business model and strategy I will not be able to provide a concise growth forecast for this segment amp x200B However since Ant s Alipay is China s leading mobile payment platform alongside WeChat Pay Ant will undoubtedly benefit from increased spending by Chinese consumers over the next decade as well as the increasing adaptation of payment methods mobile payment in the most rural areas of the country etc etc etc frankly it would take days weeks months to try to cover and dump the entire Alibaba conglomerate on these lines But frankly what you are interested in is that the good running of the company has its replica in the company amp x200B Regulatory framework First of all tell you what most already know Amazon the other major ecommerce was heavily fined with almost 900 million dollars the last company fined had been Google with only 50 million dollars In other words for Western technology it seems that regulatory frameworks also exist https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 07 30 amazon given record 888 million eu fine for data privacy breach https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 07 30 amazon given record 888 million eu fine for data privacy breach I will try to give insights later I doubt that these regulatory reforms will last five years The market should already be discounting all kinds of eventualities within that so called regulatory framework on the Chinese technology sector by the CCP at current prices and begin to price the next stage of Alibaba which in my opinion will come out very strengthened from All this at least that goes the phrase of Nietzsche Or I ll give you another example you saw those films that start out being censored something that ends up giving them a huge press and they end up generating record collections several come to mind amp x200B Xi Jinping will kill the goose that lays the golden eggs referring to Alibaba of course China invests billions in I D China has spent 37 3 percent more in high technology investment sector

Bullish Stock 20 of portfolio will likely go higher Ticker OFSTF Entry Price 1 40 Price when I exited TBD Hello I m a stock speculator and investor that is very bullish on carbon credits and companies in the space This is my thesis on what I see as the best company in the space Carbon Streaming Corporation I m not a financial advisor and you need to make your own decisions about what you do with your own money I am just telling you why I am so bullish Thesis Carbon credits are a relatively new commodity that few people have even heard of yet The market is growing at a rapid pace and is estimated by at least one leading natural resource investor more on him later to be larger than the oil market by the year 2050 maybe even as early as 2040 That is not a typo the growth in carbon credits is expected to make carbon credits the largest commodity market in the world in 30 years time This is from a base of only about 1 5 billion this year total and only 320 million this year in the voluntary carbon market specifically https www cnbc com 2021 07 08 carbon credits institute of international finance sees huge potential html https www carbonstreaming com resources presentations corporate presentation pdf v 0 4 Why will this market grow so much in the next few decades Because going green is good business Regardless of whether you believe in man made global warming this is one of the greatest money making opportunities of a generation and it would be foolish to not recognize and capitalize on it The ESG Environmental Sustainability Governance trend is unstoppable and requires that businesses around the world change their practices to make the world a better place One of the biggest ways of doing this is to lower their carbon emissions While many countries around the world are creating cap and trade schemes there is also a rapidly growing voluntary carbon market Some companies such as large oil producers are in a business that will always generate massive amounts of CO2 emissions however they can offset this by producing or alternatively purchasing carbon credits Why would they do that Because they want to lower their cost of capital and make their shares attractive to the rapidly growing pools of capital that are mandated to only invest in ESG friendly companies By lowering their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon credits or building projects that generate carbon credits the company is then able to issue green bonds which have a lower cost to the company than regular bond issuances https katusaresearch com carbonomics The green bond market is massive and growing all the time These are bonds of companies that meet certain ESG specifications Global ESG debt issuance just surpassed 3 trillion dollars in total this month Source https katusaresearch com carbonomics And that will not stop growing It took 12 years for the first trillion in ESG bonds to be issued the second trillion took one year the third took only six months The cost of capital is critical for large scale capital intensive businesses like hydrocarbon production firms such as Exxon or Chevron or large industrial metal producers like Rio Tinto or Freeport By lowering their cost of capital these businesses create huge cost savings for their operations and by going green these companies open their shares up to be bought by far more institutional investors who because of many factors are often now required to only buy shares in businesses that have a good ESG scorecard While it costs money in legal fees compliance officers etc to make a company ESG friendly the savings a company experiences from a lowered cost of capital more than makes up for it Oil giant Shell unjust lost a court ruling in the Netherlands that will now require them to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 45 by 2030 https www reuters com business legal big oil may get more climate lawsuits after shell ruling lawyers activists 2021 05 28 To put this in perspective this will require Shell to buy and or create 100 million carbon credits per year for the next decade Is Shell just a one off No 24 hours after the Shell court ruling the board of directors of Exxon was disrupted and two board seats were won in an acrimonious proxy fight by an unknown climate fund called Engine No 1 Then the shareholders of Chevron voted and changes will happen there too It is inevitable that other large oil companies and large resource miners get with the program Carbon credit prices in the voluntary market are likely to rise considerably over the next few years As legendary Canadian resource investor Marin Katusa puts it All of this is building up a pressure chamber of demand in the Voluntary Carbon Market that has not yet reached a tipping point When it does there s a lot of upside to be had Because It s the perfect setup for a long squeeze in the Voluntary Carbon Market Rising emissions from a growing population Tightening government mandates on carbon emissions Increasing consumer demand for environmental responsible More transparency in emissions reporting Corporate buy in at every level even from non emitting companies All together this is going to result in a desperate scramble for high quality carbon offsets of which there are few If you thought the rise in the price of lumber was crazy in early 2021 Just wait until you see the VCM market in five years https katusaresearch com the adoption rate of this obscure commodity will be the fastest of all commodities If you want to read more a really good primer on Carbon Credits read this https www forbes com sites erikkobayashisolomon 2020 03 13 want to understand carbon credits read this sh 4032228671aa Company Overview Carbon Streaming Corporation CSC just went public in Canada under the ticker symbol NETZ for Net Zero and trades in the US on the over the counter exchange under the ticker symbol OFSTF The business model CSC is going to employ is in my opinion brilliant They are going to finance carbon credit generation projects all over the world in exchange for streams of carbon credits Let me explain Back in the 1980 s and 1990 s companies like Franco Nevada Wheaton Precious Metals and Royal Gold pioneered a new business model within the gold industry Instead of spending money exploring for gold deposits and putting them into production by building mines they provided investment capital to mining companies in exchange for royalties on the mine s gold production For example the royalty company would invest say 150 million dollars into a miner and in exchange they would receive 2 of all the revenue generated by the mine over the entire life of the mine By doing this the royalty company got exposure to the price of the underlying commodity but took drastically less risk by avoiding having to build and operate the mine themselves Later this business model added the concept of streams A stream or streaming deal is one where again the royalty company like Franco Nevada puts up serious money to help another firm build their mine and in exchange they get the option for example of purchasing say 20 of all the gold produced by the mine for an artificially low price of 400 per ounce This deal would be called a gold stream This business model has worked remarkably well in the precious metals space with Franco Nevada returning much more over the long term than gold itself the Nasdaq and GDX the markets leading gold stock ETF https www franco nevada com about us Overview default aspx These royalty stocks trade at drastically higher multiples than golder miners themselves and currently the three biggest precious metal royalty companies Franco Nevada Wheaton and Royal Gold trade at price to sales ratios of 28 18 and 14 respectively www Finviz com Enter Carbon Streaming Corporation This company is going to employ the Franco Nevada royalty model to Carbon Credits The company just raised over 100 million USD in a financing bringing the total cash in their treasury to 141 million USD with no debt With about 200 million shares outstanding undiluted this amounts to about 0 70 per share in cash The stock currently trades at about 1 40 per share meaning that when you net out the cash the market is giving Carbon Steaming an Enterprise Value of 140 million In my opinion this is cheap given the size of the opportunity the quality of management and the first mover advantage the company will enjoy for the next 6 12 months The CEO of Carbon Streaming is Mr Justin Cochrane former investment banker and executive vice president of Sandstorm Gold NYSE SAND a very successful gold royalty company that has grown from a tiny micro cap to a large player in the space that may one day be considered amongst the giants like Franco Nevada He has personally been involved with hundreds of millions of dollars of royalty transactions in the precious metals space He put up millions of dollars of his own money in this latest financing round which is critically important when considering investing in smaller companies in my opinion The management team as a whole bought 10 million worth of the latest financing The shareholder roster for the company is also very impressive and includes legendary Canadian resource entrepreneurs investors Marin Katusa and Ross Beatty Mr Katusa recently took down almost 10 of the over 100 million dollar financing and is considered by many to be the Young Warren Buffett of resource investing up here in Canada He tends to be very reserved and conservative in his valuation models and very selective about his stock picks and entry prices He is the company s largest shareholder In his words The amount of capital that has and will continue to be deployed into the Carbonomics Sector is mind boggling it s in the hundreds of billions and will reach the trillions Carbon Streaming Corp is the first company to get involved in the financing and production of carbon credits at a large scale The company is priced attractively for speculators given the early stage venture risk I do believe that by 2030 the carbon market can be larger than copper and gold markets and by 2040 could be 2 trillion larger than the oil market Let that sink in for a moment The opportunity here is so compelling and we have a chance to get a core position in one of the leaders in this industry before it gets listed on a Big League exchange The company currently owns two Carbon Credit Streams the Marvivo Blue Carbon Project and the Bonobo Peace Forest Project Management has stated both of these projects have Internal Rates of Return IRR greater than 15 which is unheard of at this point in the precious metals sector given all of the new companies and competitors have entered the space over the last 10 years I will not go into the details here but Blue Carbon Credits are superior to regular Carbon credits and will trade at a substantial premium in terms of price Basically blue carbon credits are created by the growth and conservation of carbon absorbing plants such as mangrove forests and their associated marine habitat A blue carbon project will have its carbon credits trade at a premium because of the enormous second order benefits on such things as for example corals algae and marine biodiversity that have been so deleteriously affected by over fishing and farming I expect management to start to deploy their war chest of cash immediately to build their portfolio of high quality carbon credit streams to position itself as the Franco Nevada of the Carbon Credit space These deals should be positive catalysts for the stock moving forward Management has stated they are aiming to exit 2023 at a revenue run rate of 200 million USD per year And that is only using CURRENT PRICING for carbon credits which actually are expected to move much higher in price over the next few years Putting a 10 20x pierce to sales multiple on that would peg CSC with a market cap in the billions in a little over 2 years But with all the hot money capital that will seek to enter this space over the next two years I would not be surprised if the market cap gets much higher than that The reason for this is simple Other than the exchange traded fund KRBN there are still very few ways for investors to get pure play exposure to carbon credits CSC is going to be the first publicly listed company that provides investors with a way to invest in an equity 100 focused on carbon credits Given the massive amount of capital looking to get in on this emerging hot investment trend and the tiny amount of options available to those investors there will likely be massive buying pressure on the stock Think of a fire hose worth of water trying to get pushed through the eye of a needle While the stock currently trades on the OTC market in the US management has made it clear that they will seek to uplist the stock to the Nasdaq or the NYSE before the end of 2021 While this seems a bit optimistic to me in terms of timing I fully expect the company to uplist at least by the end of first quarter 2022 Risks While the stock has a sizable market cap already the shares are very illiquid and if a market crash were to occur before the stock becomes more well known it may be tough to get out of a sizable position quickly without trashing the stock price even more Competition Carbon Streaming has first mover advantage in the space but I expect numerous me too companies to pop up in the next 6 12 months with the same business model and this will create competition for the carbon streams that may drive down the Internal Rates of Returns on streams as companies try to outbid each other for the various deals to be had Trump gets back in in 2024 however I think this would merely create an initial shock lower in the stock and it would soon recover given that their assets will likely be located all over the world G Trends You cannot do a Dumb Money High conviction Doc without including G Trend data My experience with G Trends is limited and there may be better ways to use it for this trade but for now I am just going to show the 5 year charts for carbon credit worldwide and then in the USA As you can see both seem to be picking up steam in the last year or two Here are the 5 year trends when using the keywords Low carbon economy for worldwide and US searches respectively Here are the 5 year G trends for Environmental Social and Corporate Governance worldwide and from the US respectively Conclusion The carbon credit market is starting to take off and is poised for massive growth over the next 5 10 and 20 years CSC has perfectly positioned itself to take advantage of this trend by employing the proven and golden business model pun intended of royalty and streaming financing to this fast emerging intangible commodity space We have a chance to get in on the ground floor of a company that could easily be worth many billions of dollars at a tiny market cap before it lists on a major exchange The company has all the cash and management expertise that it needs to execute its business model and create enormous wealth for early shareholders Good luck and good investing to all
