uninterested skip to the ten tips list or TLDR A while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my gambling At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it I still fuck up alot but more often I do not fuck up This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales or are at a basic level and want to do it better I m using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots Tools I use barchart You can honestly get by using their free version you just can t sort as well They have a free month trial too I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan I have zero affiliation to either just saying what I use There are way more technical ways to do this but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer Basic Concept Long story short you re ideally chasing the options purchases of what are presumably deep pocketed individuals or institutions UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order For example if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4 000 and an option order enters for 4 000 or higher it s flagged as unusual activity since it s a multiple of that daily average volume sometimes it shows as multiple orders if they push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume MM are sneks who like to move in silence which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and shit However they can t get away with that with options activity it all shows That fact young autist is your slingshot against the institutional goliath Hunting the Whale So I ve got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I m looking at don t expire past a couple weeks out more on why earlier then I m ready to eye scan I typically start by looking for one of two things 1 large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker or 2 sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours but belong to non hot non meme stonk that does NOT have earnings imminents To make sure I m looking at something potentially weird I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out 1 Clusters of orders ABNB example The way I scope it is kind of a tiered process First I m looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan Second I m looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts with some OTM activity and spreads preferred Third I look to see if the number of call seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders or vice versa and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts or vice versa Why Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge or if it s hedging against itself as it s own positio n This is super important so try to follow along most UOA is just institutions hedging Mr MM has a nice busy life and fancy yacht and can t just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer He also has like a billion shares of his stonks so if he dumps it when he s got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect So instead of hedging by dumping his shit he hedges by adding OTM options against his position next level fucking diamond hands That would be the type of whale order from Mr MM we don t want to follow But if Mr MM buys 4 000 FB call options in a few blocks and you see like 1 000 in FB puts go through right alongside it the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge since it s a smaller volume Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger bet in their stocks the those type of option clusters indicate the option order is the big play and it s hedging itself Then I do an easy confirmation I check their general trend the past week or so in a chart do a news search on twitter with their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it s a good nerd play Example Here s the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week It went to 200 and change within a couple hours but I had unortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that ABNB UOA https i imgur com mYDXYmN jpg So this a softball First you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all those options showing up at 12 52 that s our cluster Second the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute with some put orders at the bottom Some of the calls are deep OTM as far as 200c Third the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume Awwwww shit looks like we got more than a hedge we re onto something Confirmation time ABNB had been on a general uptrend and I typically don t like to chase but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations I looked back into the morning and saw a few more unusual blocks and a few more rolled in just after that one Passed the smell test Options bought tendies gained Sparse Orders SNAP example The same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders not large clusters which a haven t had much attention b have been on a steep downtrend this makes the order unusual and or c seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day The same principles as above apply but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration you can assume assume it s probably not a hedge SNAP isn t the best example of the week because there wasn t a put order in this block But there was positive TA sentiment when I searched SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend and I don t have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after Plus importantly IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY this is huge EOD is prime time for AH news whales SNAP UOA https i imgur com GGr5bra jpg A better example from this week though is SPCE which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day and a one toward the end of the day which was DEEP DEEP OTM expiring 1 15 That s a flag for us sporadic listing throughout the day OTM toward the end of the day BAM EOD Otm calls sprinkle in ARK invests Sparse Orders Patterns Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP Seeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week I kept seeing FB options like this pop up https i imgur com muVGtq2 jpg https i imgur com T54peER jpg Sometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out I knew there was a risk they could a hedge but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well So I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM important more below to give the whale some breathing room in case was it was a hedge even though the technicals agreed with the bounce The whales were right and it was an easy little overnight profit How I ve Fucked Up 1 Don t get tricked by trends Although we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve often they are just dick riding lemmings who follow what s already way way up They buy the top just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in When you see shit like this think before you get excited NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP https i imgur com JCZBx2s jpg It was the same for all the memes PLUG FCEL MARA and RIOT all week dominating the orders If something is already too popular just stay away from it You can ride something up but when you see massive orders on shit that s already like 400 IV just don t How I ve Fucked Up 2 DO give the MM s some breathing room Even if you re confident in a move you see that is a few days out extend your play a week or two out and strike it closer to ATM If you can t do either of those things because you can t afford it just skip that play and check back for something new later I promise better opportunity will arise You can recover from bagholding but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE Breathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day The following Monday 1 trade day later DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20 if I d given them a week s breathing room it would ve been a 15 bagger Fucking F So to review look for order clusters or sporadic ticker order that a have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye this Monday s EV run or this Friday s tech bounce could be next week s airline dominance or cruiseline craze connect the dots Initially look for options expiring soon as they indicate the most riskiness and therefore confidence if the MM is not hedging 10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH 1 Monday and Friday morning afternoon are the most accurate whale times according to data from Unusual Whales 2 If you don t have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping 3 If you don t have PDT never ever follow a whale with a weekly Sometimes the news the whales bets on is a sell the news event 4 Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out 4b Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs 5 Sign up for barchart monthly trial and unusual whales they re each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD 6 You don t need to learn TA but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA This way you know if it s a proper breakout happening if the whale hits and you re not just guessing at when to take profits Remember they can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point they aren t bagholding until it s in the money 7 Leave at least 10 of your account spending power free each day I promise the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day Then you won t be able to do shit about it and you ll hate yourself when it s a 10 bagger overnight Trust me 8 Make sure the ticker you re chasing isn t just ER anticipation bets Always check earnings dates before buying 9 Remember whales are people so they can be stupid too Don t baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come They are gambling addicts just like you except they have more money 10 Always take profits if you ask yourself if it s time to If it s good enough to screenshot it s good enough to close the position Positions Dumped a ton of stuff and loading up Tuesday because long weekends scare me but saw some ineresting 2 5s I held including WKHSc PLTRc SPYc 1 19 1 22 LMNDp And a couple tickers that I couldn t post lol also have AAPL and JD leaps TLDR Use a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements Look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via call put ratio and do a legitimate check for TA and catalysts to confirm their moves Never follow a whale into a weekly but use weeklies are your best screener I might do a pretty consistent DD post a couple times a week on what I m seeing at the end of each day if there is interest and if it s not a day I don t have a ton of real work If something quick catches my eye I usually throw it up on my twitter yourboymilt I ll also probably throw some more potential Monday positions on here over the weekend once I decide to do some more research Later

why I m bullish on BBBY Overview Bed Bath amp Beyond Inc and subsidiaries is an omnichannel retailer that sells a wide assortment of merchandise in the Home Baby Beauty and Wellness markets It s subsidaries include Buy Buy Baby Face Values and Decoris Leadership Mark Tritton CEO ex target vice president and chief marketing officer COMPLETELY turned around Target into what it is today Launched 40 successful private label brands Transformed their digital market Remodeled 850 stores Lead to 6 consecutive quarters of growth at target He plans to do the same at BBBY and this becomes clear in the 3 year turnaround plan Rafeh Masoor Far less known but very innovative from a digital standpoint Top 10 movers and shakers in retail Strong results at BJ s wholesale club He brings a strong 3 pronged approach to the digital scene digital first mindset with a BOPIS and free delivery virtual rooms and improved ui to elevate customer experience develop omni capabilities Turnaround Plan Deepen Relations With Customers Retain and grow their INCREASING customer base with incentives and marketing Focus on their 5 segments in marketing the juggler the innovator the nester the creative and the minimizer create loyalty progams to increase retention Resetting Product Assortment Releasing BBBY s unique private label brands to penetrate the market and raise margin increase the range of prices on products to invite lower spenders to the store creating destination rooms to elevate customer experience Offer competitive pricing BBBY wants to remain competitive in pricing while filling price gaps between products Study promotional data to maximize return on coupons Omnichannel Integrate physical locations with the digital setting BOPIS buy online pickup in store This will allow customers to venture into physical locations as well Remodeling As stated earlier BBBY wants to create customer friendly stores Currently BBBY s stores look like ugly department stores and things are unaccessible They are remodeling 450 stores over 3 years the remodels are exactly what I wanted to see Creating stronger technology platform Better app and better website more digital sales As a BBBY shopper this addresses ALL my issues with the stores atm As an investor it s clear that BBBY knows their audience and how they can regain market share and capitalize on their customers Tritton clearly has a GREAT vision and knows what he needs to do to make it a reality REMEMBER this is a 3 year long plan which means it will take time to fully come to fruition If this is successful BBBY will be a leader in the industry and the stock will reach highs unseen for years With the leadership I expect BBBY to successfully execute this plan constantly top expectations and prove the shorters wrong Q3 Financials Profitability Profit margin is at a historically high level of 35 10 increase YoY lead by lowered payroll improved promo management and product mix SG amp A lowered by 41 million Cash Flow and EBITDA Cash flow of 244 million compared to a negative cash flow last year EBITDA growth of 168 from 38 cents to 08 cents Comp and digital Sales For the first time in 6 years BBBY is showing comparable sales growth in the last 2 quarters Digital sales up 94 In store traffic decreasing Market Share For the first time in ages BBBY saw market shares growth in the Home and kitchen departments Reversal of a negative trend in other departments Cash and Debt Cash is increasing to a solid 1 5 billion in cash and cash equivalents debt lowered by 500 million 25 this year Revenue and Net income Revenue is DECREASING by 5 YoY store closures and lowered in store traffic Net Income is INCREASING lower performing stores gone means higher profits Yes earnings missed estimates but as Tritton said he is doing everything he said he would do The balance sheet is improving he is executing his plan steadily and he is overall reassuring investors with his buybacks BBBY is focusing on optimizing their top performing stores as the country is over satured with stores currently With unprofitable stores closing we can expect a decreasing overall revenue but an increasing net income As the plan continues I fully expect overall revenue to reverse the trend and begin increasing Investors were also disappointed with guidance but Tritton has mentioned that he is being CONSERVATIVE in estimates He has always one to be conservative and deliver more than expected Tailwinds Growing customer base A general shift towards home improvement New private label brands are profitable and would help gain market share in 2021 150 stores being remodeled in 2021 Stimulus and perhaps more from Biden Return to normal would lead to a large surge in marriages and babies Headwinds COVID worsening and restrictions returning Twitter trying to get BBBY cancelled for selling MyPillow Buybacks Normally I am against share buybacks BBBY used them previously to suppport a dying stock but here it s different BBBY currently has an accelerated share repurchase program of 850 million dollars with 150 million to be repurchased by february 29th With excess cash from selling unprofitable businesses Tritton seeks to regain investor confidence WHILE producing obvious changes and results Due to these buybacks I expect share prices to grow over the next few months leading up to earnings Short Interest Currently short interest is astronomically high at 70 I believe that this has decreased as a hedge fund bearish on GME and BBBY seems to have covered at the same time Check the spike on GME and BBBY 1 13 11 30 It s likely Melvin or mapleridge covered a short position With Cramer pumping and this we saw a mild squeeze but there are no more catalysts to cause another for a while however with buybacks and strong performance shorters will slowly buy back their shares alongside BBBY causing a steady rise in price in the following months If the turnaround plan is successful shorts will have no reason to remain bearish and BBBY will grow exponentially in price over the next 6 12 months TLDR Bed Bath and Beyond is on the road to success As a consumer their private label brands store remodels and specialized marketing changes are exactly what I want to see In a growing industry strong leadership buybacks and a beautiful turnaround plan make me bullish on BBBY I do NOT expect growth akin to what happened this week but expect strong growth as the sentiment towards BBBY changes and their plan succeeds over the next few months I am bullish on BBBY and will be until Tritton leaves POSITIONS 1000 shares and BBBY 30 March 19 C

in wallstreetbets style Wanted to post this last weekend but now with the ongoing squeeze i might have to change the story a little bit Hope you guys like it and leave suggestions below in de comments Wasbet and the Valley of king Powell Two guards marched into the town square dragging a man in between them to the wooden stage Around the stage there were already other guards stationed each carrying a spear in their hands and throwing around bags of Schmeckles for the paupers From all over town people came pouring into the town square eagerly picking up the bags Because today was not just any day but execution day Wasbet was looking with grim eyes from a distance with his hood up as to not get recognised The man on the stage he knew and today he would be executed for the highest crime possible the trading of gold Even Wasbet knew that it was foolish to possess or let alone trade gold with this many guards around although it could bring great wealth here in the Valley More guards came marching into the town square but these weren t any normal ones These had shinier and more firm armour Wasbet recognised them as protectors of Powell PoP One of them suddenly stopped when he took notice of Wasbet in the corner and approached him He quickly dropped on one knee All hail king Powell Wasbet mumbled while making the common sign of the infinite well on his chest with his finger The protector grunted and threw a bag of schmeckles on the ground For your loyalty to the king he grimaced and spat in front of Wasbets feet The protector quickly turned around and Wasbet squeezed his fist furiously In his hand palm he felt the presence of the little diamond He knew that he was only one the few diamond hands left so he had to be careful He stood up straight and stared at the stage where by now a large crowd had settled How could things have gone so out of hands Wasbet thought to himself All this mess started long ago when king Powell introduced the mandatory currency schmeckles and took possession of all the gold in the Valley And that while he and his protectors enjoyed the spoils at the top of the highest hill overseeing the Valley Only his grandfather had ever seen what was outside the Valley he knew But that quickly changed when former earl Powell found the infinite well of schmeckles on top of the hill and took control of the whole Valley On top of that a stone wall was built guarded by the PoP and nobody could ever move in or out anymore Of course king Powell pretended to the people that he saved them and that he brought them prosperity with his schmeckles It already felt like everybody forgot how it used to be in the Valley The people keep cheering like sheep every time the PoP come and start throwing around bags like they are feeding animals These damn schmeckles have bewitched every peasant here Wasbet cursed to himself But not him he would never obey this ruthless regime of king Powell The man on the stage was protesting desperately and managed to grab a bag of schmeckles You see he screamed I love these things I don t need no gold I m sorry please spare me The PoP ignored the man and while one of them restrained the man with a hand on his back the other raised his sword and swung it downward quickly With the sound of a chop the body of the man became limp and the crowd began to cheer The bag of schmeckles fell out of the dead man s hand onto the ground Wasbet shook his head in disbelief the man died bagholding he thought to himself He quickly turned around to the nearest alley to get ahead of the leaving crowd Now that the show was over people were losing their interest and slowly went back to their regular day jobs After walking some time he took the nearest alley to the right He knew these streets all too well from previous pursuits with guards Right in front of him he saw the familiar inn Since the banning of gold not only possession was forbidden but also the usage of the word gold Therefore half of the text on the sign was crossed out and read G MErmaid Wasbet opened the wooden door of the inn and stepped inside A plump blond lady was cleaning glasses with a cloth and smiled when she saw Wasbet enter the inn Good to see you Wasbet she said Please sit and have a drink Thanks Lydia I ll have a beer Wasbet said and walked to a table in the corner He barely took a sit when the door slammed open and a group of six shorters wobbled into the room followed by a fat priest The shorters were bald little men and usually meant trouble Wasbet knew They lived in great numbers higher up the hill but still in the Valley and were known for manipulating people and bribing guards One of the shorters was a head taller uglier and seemed to be the leader of the squad Well well well Lydia the leader said Looks like King Powell won t open the well anytime soon for us folks in the Valley Therefore no more free schmeckles and no more spending from folks in this place anytime soon he explained When he dropped the king s name he made the sign of the infinite well on his chest just like Wasbet did earlier The other shorters stationed themselves around the bar and the priest waited patiently in the back carrying a book Lydia s face became pale and she couldn t open her mouth The leader continued Rumour has it that you got quite some grain stock in the back there haven t you I ll short everything you got No you can t do that she stuttered By the law of our earl ma am The leader held up a scroll containing some scrabbles and an official seal But don t worry you ll get everything back in a month you know how it goes he grinned He beckoned to one of his shorter followers that was carrying a chest The shorter nodded and emptied the chest of schmeckles on the ground Meanwhile the other shorters started to wobble into the storage at the back of the bar In rows they quickly began to unload all of the bundles of grain they could find The priest scraped his throat Forty and eight bundles of grain have been seized by sir Melvin from the G he paused for a second MErmaid for the price of precisely six bags of schmeckles and are to be returned within a month he declared publicly while writing everything down in his book Wasbet watched the event happen quietly but suddenly his anger took the overhand and he yelled Hey why don t you go and bully someone your own height The leader Melvin turned his head in surprise Oh yeah and what are you going to do about it boy the leader said as the shorters all began to form a group again Wasbet touched his diamond in his hand palm again He wanted to use it but not yet not here at least Instead he reached inside one of his pockets and pulled out three Blemflarcks I ll buy all bundles of grain Wasbet snarled and threw the Blemflarcks to Melvin Melvin caught the Blemflarcks and inspected them accurately He nodded with contempt Alright looks like we have a deal boy Melvin said Time to leave boys As quickly as the shorters had come they also left Lydia walked over to wasbet and hugged him You didn t have to do this Wasbet she said That grain was worth far less than those three Blemflarcks Don t worry about it Lydia I help where I m needed You take it all I have no use for that much grain anyway She looked him in the eyes and smiled I can t thank you enough Wasbet But actually could you do me a favour and bring it to the DeepValue storage up north from the town You could use my horse in front of the inn and there it ll be much safer from those shorters Wasbet nodded and Lydia went back to the bar cleaning glasses He had heard of the DeepValue storage before but never visited the place It was home to a small population called the longers he knew Longers were heartwarming people and always willing to support those in need of help With their huge storages there was always plenty of grain especially in times of need They don t get along with the shorters from uphill however One time a group of shorters broke into one of their storages to sell their whole inventory the next day for a considerable profit The town even appointed Special Elite Chariots SEC to assist the safekeeping of the town but they turned a blind eye to the thievery and the shorters never got punished The only thing the earl had done to make the business of shorters seem fair was the mandatory presence of the fat priest that followed them around everywhere Wasbet stood up and was about to leave when Lydia called him One more thing Wasbet Have you heard about the ongoing rumour When he didn t respond she continued They speak of the return of the great Palantir Rumour has it that he emerged from the northern caves Wasbets heart began to race According to the diamond prophecy the palantir was meant to open up the Valley again and bring great riches but he hasn t been seen in over a decade Could this really be him To be contiued Pos GME shares 13

in a great position looking forward to the next few weeks with a few risk factors Yesterday was rough but I believe that all you guys diamond handed the loses and are primed for takeoff If you bought at all time high I wouldn t worry this still looks good So what actually happened yesterday well there was a lot of dooming and understandably so given that it lost 11 in the day But one week ago if you were offered a 11 day after a 90 run off would you have taken it almost certainly This stock has insane volatility right now and these big moves are to be expected Profit Taking The reality is that this is super hard to quantify but there are paper handed investors among us who definitely sold to take profit after this insane run up The continuous low volume selling throughout the day indicates that this was happening a large part of it is probably repositioning GME within their portfolio to make sure it doesn t become too concentrated This leads us to number 2 Institutional Realignment If we look at Hestia for example we can see in 1 that as of June 12th Hestia owned 7 3 of GME Now it doesn t take a genius to realise that that stake is worth more a lot more today and that mean that GME is now outside their investment guidelines for their portfolio indication to this is in 2 To rectify this they will sell shares and reallocate them elsewhere I think it is a fair assumption that other institutions in GME are in the same boat at the moment and are probably selling some shares to do the same The good news is that as seen in 2 is that this is purely an action to stay within their own investing guidelines rather than judgement on future value of GME and the head of Hestia did not sell a single share of his personal stake More Shorting If there is one thing that these shorters have it is diamond hands and an iron will 3 shows that the short interest is still sky high now short interest is a two part equation This could mean there are less shares available or the shorts have shorted more Given that the short availability has gone up to 1 2 million shares and the borrow fee is only 31 4 compared to 46 on 14 01 it would indicate that there are less shares available to buy good for us But this means that the shorts have probably closed a few of their short positions although a small number at that However the fact that they are staying in means they are going to continue to try to push the price down obviously Board Sell Off It is really unclear exactly when sell offs from the board occurred this week 5 indicates that the average sell price is somewhere between 28 and 36 these sell orders were probably placed throughout the week Again don t let this deter you they have to do this to make way for Cohen and his cronies this is not bearish Hitting Big Sell Walls I don t have the link but level 2 data showed that there was a 27K sell order between 35 and 36 it obviously hit this and forced the price down This is definitely linked to profit taking there were tons of sell walls all the way down from 39 to the bottom price yesterday Macro Factors and Weak Volume The fact is SPY was down and it was the Friday before a long weekend there is going to be a bit of a sell off at least In addition the volume on GME was crap compared with the 13 01 and 14 01 and the predominant price action yesterday was selling obviously don t let this one day dictate your forward strategy on GME Looking Forward Short Sell Exemption So because the share price dropped more than 10 yesterday the SEC 210 uptick rule This means that short sellers are only allowed to short sell after the share price has gone up this can definitely partially example the rally around 2 30PM and this is in effect until end of day Tuesday Until then it is going to be difficult for short sellers to short GME further because the price has to go up for them to do it This isn t necessarily bearish or bullish it does give short sellers a bit of a headache though Margin Calls and Availability So margin has been stopped on GME this means that brokerages expect large volatility and doubt that people taking extra margin will be able to cover their positions This isn t good or bad until we look at the strong possibility that shorters are currently being margin called 6 which is MEGA GOOD for us longs With the uptick rule and elimination of margin it is looking like the clock is ticking on shorts which leads to the next point Melvins Positions Melvin are shorting in three different ways right medium to long term Puts legit borrowed shares and naked shorts We can largely ignore the Puts for now it looks like a lot of them expire on 15 07 and because IV is so high on GME options at the moment they probably aren t losing that much money on them yet Then there are their legit shorts that they have borrowed they can obviously hold these forever if they continue to pay to hold them and can accept the losses and there is no reason to think they won t Remember these guys have major conviction diamond hands and absolutely believe GME is going to go out of business They will cling to these like death That leaves their naked shorts and they have a lot of these There have been and still are an insane amount of fail to delivers due to the amount of naked shorts on GME and this has likely really suppressed the share price over the past year or more Really at this point margin calls on the shorters and action from the SEC are going to be required to shake these guys out Leading on from this DON T USE CRAP BROKERS TO BUY SHARES Robinhood will make money by lending your shares to shorts use good brokers and set high sell orders to stop your shares being lent out What We Need to Happen This might be an unpopular opinion but given the recent board sell off and the diamond handed nature of these shorters we need a real fundamental catalyst to cause the short squeeze The two avenues to this in the short term is a Cohen upping his stake to 20 and his cronies buying more shares as well I don t see why this wouldn t happen and b good Q4 earnings on 28th March and an encouraging plan on company restructuring If one or both of those occur I think we are in for a really good time Don t expect a short squeeze next week But don t let that deter this is likely the highest pressure and conviction a trade a lot of us will have done and will do for a while and we are up against seasoned assholes diamonds are made under pressure DO NOT SELL I am also hesitant to compare this to the VW squeeze there were pretty much no retail investors in VW and they were acquired just before the squeeze The route to the short squeeze for GME is likely to be a rocky and more difficult journey but it will come I can hardly believe we have made it this far to be honest let s keep the show going Good luck everyone and see you all in Valhalla Here is a rocket for you all amp x200B Processing img ulht7dw8pob61 1 https www barrons com articles activist

628,kyhyuv,t2_wcgol,1610799432,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyhyuv/a_wallstreetbets_short_story/,1,A wallstreetbets short story, Wasbet and the Valley of king Powell Two guards marched into the town square dragging a man in between them to the wooden stage Around the stage there were already other guards stationed each carrying a spear in their hands and throwing around bags of Schmeckles for the paupers From all over town people came pouring into the town square eagerly picking up the bags Because today was not just any day but execution day Wasbet was looking with grim eyes from a distance with his hood up as to not get recognised The man on the stage he knew and today he would be executed for the highest crime possible the trading of gold Even Wasbet knew that it was foolish to possess or let alone trade gold with this many guards around although it could bring great wealth here in the Valley More guards came marching into the town square but these weren t any normal ones These had shinier and more firm armour Wasbet recognised them as protectors of Powell PoP One of them suddenly stopped when he took notice of Wasbet in the corner and approached him He quickly dropped on one knee All hail king Powell Wasbet mumbled while making the common sign of the infinite well on his chest with his finger The protector grunted and threw a bag of schmeckles on the ground For your loyalty to the king he grimaced and spat in front of Wasbets feet The protector quickly turned around and Wasbet squeezed his fist furiously In his hand palm he felt the presence of the little diamond He knew that he was only one the few diamond hands left so he had to be careful He stood up straight and stared at the stage where by now a large crowd had settled How could things have gone so out of hands Wasbet thought to himself All this mess started long ago when king Powell introduced the mandatory currency schmeckles and took possession of all the gold in the Valley And that while he and his protectors enjoyed the spoils at the top of the highest hill overseeing the Valley Only his grandfather had ever seen what was outside the Valley he knew But that quickly changed when former earl Powell found the infinite well of schmeckles on top of the hill and took control of the whole Valley On top of that a stone wall was built guarded by the PoP and nobody could ever move in or out anymore Of course king Powell pretended to the people that he saved them and that he brought them prosperity with his schmeckles It already felt like everybody forgot how it used to be in the Valley The people keep cheering like sheep every time the PoP come and start throwing around bags like they are feeding animals These damn schmeckles have bewitched every peasant here Wasbet cursed to himself But not him he would never obey this ruthless regime of king Powell The man on the stage was protesting desperately and managed to grab a bag of schmeckles You see he screamed I love these things I don t need no gold I m sorry please spare me The PoP ignored the man and while one of them restrained the man with a hand on his back the other raised his sword and swung it downward quickly With the sound of a chop the body of the man became limp and the crowd began to cheer The bag of schmeckles fell out of the dead man s hand onto the ground Wasbet shook his head in disbelief the man died bagholding he thought to himself He quickly turned around to the nearest alley to get ahead of the leaving crowd Now that the show was over people were losing their interest and slowly went back to their regular day jobs After walking some time he took the nearest alley to the right He knew these streets all too well from previous pursuits with guards Right in front of him he saw the familiar inn Since the banning of gold not only possession was forbidden but also the usage of the word gold Therefore half of the text on the sign was crossed out and read G MErmaid Wasbet opened the wooden door of the inn and stepped inside A plump blond lady was cleaning glasses with a cloth and smiled when she saw Wasbet enter the inn Good to see you Wasbet she said Please sit and have a drink Thanks Lydia I ll have a beer Wasbet said and walked to a table in the corner He barely took a sit when the door slammed open and a group of six shorters wobbled into the room followed by a fat priest The shorters were bald little men and usually meant trouble Wasbet knew They lived in great numbers higher up the hill but still in the Valley and were known for manipulating people and bribing guards One of the shorters was a head taller uglier and seemed to be the leader of the squad Well well well Lydia the leader said Looks like King Powell won t open the well anytime soon for us folks in the Valley Therefore no more free schmeckles and no more spending from folks in this place anytime soon he explained When he dropped the king s name he made the sign of the infinite well on his chest just like Wasbet did earlier The other shorters stationed themselves around the bar and the priest waited patiently in the back carrying a book Lydia s face became pale and she couldn t open her mouth The leader continued Rumour has it that you got quite some grain stock in the back there haven t you I ll short everything you got No you can t do that she stuttered By the law of our earl ma am The leader held up a scroll containing some scrabbles and an official seal But don t worry you ll get everything back in a month you know how it goes he grinned He beckoned to one of his shorter followers that was carrying a chest The shorter nodded and emptied the chest of schmeckles on the ground Meanwhile the other shorters started to wobble into the storage at the back of the bar In rows they quickly began to unload all of the bundles of grain they could find The priest scraped his throat Forty and eight bundles of grain have been seized by sir Melvin from the G he paused for a second MErmaid for the price of precisely six bags of schmeckles and are to be returned within a month he declared publicly while writing everything down in his book Wasbet watched the event happen quietly but suddenly his anger took the overhand and he yelled Hey why don t you go and bully someone your own height The leader Melvin turned his head in surprise Oh yeah and what are you going to do about it boy the leader said as the shorters all began to form a group again Wasbet touched his diamond in his hand palm again He wanted to use it but not yet not here at least Instead he reached inside one of his pockets and pulled out three Blemflarcks I ll buy all bundles of grain Wasbet snarled and threw the Blemflarcks to Melvin Melvin caught the Blemflarcks and inspected them accurately He nodded with contempt Alright looks like we have a deal boy Melvin said Time to leave boys As quickly as the shorters had come they also left Lydia walked over to wasbet and hugged him You didn t have to do this Wasbet she said That grain was worth far less than those three Blemflarcks Don t worry about it Lydia I help where I m needed You take it all I have no use for that much grain anyway She looked him in the eyes and smiled I can t thank you enough Wasbet But actually could you do me a favour and bring it to the DeepValue storage up north from the town You could use my horse in front of the inn and there it ll be much safer from those shorters Wasbet nodded and Lydia went back to the bar cleaning glasses He had heard of the DeepValue storage before but never visited the place It was home to a small population called the longers he knew Longers were heartwarming people and always willing to support those in need of help With their huge storages there was always plenty of grain especially in times of need They don t get along with the shorters from uphill however One time a group of shorters broke into one of their storages to sell their whole inventory the next day for a considerable profit The town even appointed Special Elite Chariots SEC to assist the safekeeping of the town but they turned a blind eye to the thievery and the shorters never got punished The only thing the earl had done to make the business of shorters seem fair was the mandatory presence of the fat priest that followed them around everywhere Wasbet stood up and was about to leave when Lydia called him One more thing Wasbet Have you heard about the ongoing rumour When he didn t respond she continued They speak of the return of the great Palantir Rumour has it that he emerged from the northern caves Wasbets heart began to race According to the diamond prophecy the palantir was meant to open up the Valley again and bring great riches but he hasn t been seen in over a decade Could this really be him Let me know any suggestions for the story Pos GME shares 13

Zacks telling you PLTR BAD 1 eleven 2 Shills spamming pLtR tO tHe MoOn and rocket on PLTR thread comments 3 Last quarter s seemingly bad financials earnings 4 Financials Moving Forwards 5 Soros who owns 21 million shares threatening to sell his shares upon DPO expiry 6 DPO expiry 3 days after February s earnings and possible insiders and DPO holders sale and dip 7 What does PLTR tldr 8 Other Information amp x200B 1 Targeted Ads Ads and articles are both paid for by someone The fact that in the past 3 weeks i ve been getting multiple multiple targeted ads on my phone related to PLTR since i love PLTR so much Ads are telling me that PLTR is bad doesn t provide a dividend they re telling me PLTR s fair price is 20 instead of 25 based on some financial model and have gone as far as to provide a list of alternative stocks to buy To me this all screams SCARE TACTICS Additionally the last few weeks of ups and downs in PLTR s stock price is another indication of the attempts to short the stock to sh t and drive investors out For what reason I don t know amp x200B 2 Shilling PLTR I myself love to shill PLTR to people whenever i can I do this because i legitimately think this company will do great I work as a product manager in a software development house and understand what PLTR does PLTR is not cryptic Regardless i think when people shill PLTR to you they are right to do so as you re probably missing out on a great opportunity to make money in the long run If you re looking for big gains short term maybe try something else Shillery is OK but at least give the facts amp x200B 3 Last Quarter s Bad Financials If you d done your DD not by searching reddit posts but by checking PLTR s actual quarterly report you d know that PLTR s bad last financial quarter earnings were due to the costs of listing themselves on the New York Stock Exchange 855million were spent on listing and stock related compensations and this is the big reason Direct quote by PLTR here https

Reports Revenue Growth of 52 in the Third Quarter Raises Full Year 2020 Guidance default aspx gt We incurred a loss from operations of 847 8 million which includes 847 0 million in stock based compensation following our recent direct listing I would like to remind everyone that this is a 1 TIME THING Put simply this means that PLTR won t have as excessive losses next quarter as they did this last quarter Additionally let me go into further detail on this and not just leave it to that PLTR s quarterly operating expenses for the past 3 quarters were at around 260 million PLTR s operating expenses this quarter were 987 million ADDITIONALLY PLTR also had a higher R amp D cost this quarter that just passed Normally they d pay 80 million on R amp D but somehow ended up paying 300 million this quarter No one knows why but this is another thing that influenced PLTR s earnings https investors palantir com news details 2020 Palantir Reports Revenue Growth of 52 in the Third

satisfaction of the performance based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units respectively that had satisfied the service based vesting condition as of such date amp x200B 4 PLTR financials moving forwards PLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro surveillance e g pro Palantir Here s some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR 1 CDC 2 Office of the Secretary 3 Food and Drug Administration 4 Immigration and Customs Enforcements ICE 5 Internal Revenue Service IRS 6 National Institute on Drug Abuse 7 DOD ARMY ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground 8 Coast Guard DHS 9 DOD NAVY Naval Information Warfare Systems Command 10 US Attorney s Offices DOJ 11 US Special Operations Command SPEC OPS Boys The big institutional people know these things You just found this out See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government Palantir IS the next Raytheon Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization UPCOMING EARNINGS I ve done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0 02 cent EPS target we can easily assume that they ll destroy this with maybe 0 04 or 0 08 EPS In the worst case scenario PLTR s EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS 0 05 ish due to interview costs and ad campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR Now there s big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed That s biggest REAL reason for Palantir s balance sheet getting screwed I ve seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR s financials and that s that every year it s R amp D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in PLTR s balance can start going into the negative WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR Some people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this https www thedailybeast com cdc officials urge biden team to dump palantirs covid tracker https www thedailybeast com cdc officials urge biden team to dump palantirs covid tracker In my opinion i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what s going on There is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT these things take months and years to deal with and by then the contract s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID Short answer is A LOT The amounts below are PER YEAR That s a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable Processing img ba58nqcurob61 Palantir s prospectus 311 page document s 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR Mithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company Owned by Thiel Cohen Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit he s had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year Prospectus Document https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1321655 000119312520230013 d904406ds1 htm https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1321655 000119312520230013 d904406ds1 htm I suggest you skim through it it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable It s doable in my opinion but just barely and it s why they made the company public to try and get more people s attention and increase the inflow of contracts amp x200B 5 Soros and his 21 million shares First of all i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it If you ve read a few articles here and there you ll know that Soros owns owned 1 of Class A PLTR shares No one knows whether he s sold them yet or if he s an DPO holder who ll sell 3 days after February s earnings Whether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion We see dips and pumps every day He legally cannot sell his shares all at once he ll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2 3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands Nothing special to see here move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation PLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks NONE amp x200B 6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February To my limited knowledge this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns they re more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would If a stock hasn t performed as well as investors thought these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal There s a total of 1 16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently Give or take don t flog me We are currently trading with 250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO When those shares are unlocked in February the price of the stock won t be diluted These shares already exist and are accounted for They are simply locked Also when they are unlocked the share price won t simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable gt According to Palantir s after hours filing with the SEC this afternoon https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1321655 000119312520257973 d89036dex991 htm the company has 1 16 billion Class A shares 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today or a total of roughly 1 64 billion Only Class A shares will trade and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one to one basis On a fully diluted basis which Palantir says represents 2 2 billion shares total according to its most recent S 1 filing the company is valued at 16 billion The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants warrants and other financial instruments What WILL affect stock price Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares This IS dilution The bigwigs e g Alex Karp Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit To note regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings Alex Karp Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price What COULD affect the stock price a lot Massive sell off by the big institutional holders Not shorters Citron and Citi can suck it we re in control here People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything Big but silent scare campaign that s already going on to scare off normies like us amp x200B 7 What does PLTR do tldr Imagine Facebook s database of everything about everyone amp Youtube s Database of everything amp Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells Palantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it s human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter It s kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US Literally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area country family history anything While this all might sound super cool and amazing it is Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this but for now it s only Palantir Circles Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for terrorist cells warzones etc and the public backlash this could cause tldr Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform software with different access levels for different people PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments Governments are stupid and don t have neither the time nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much Governments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use but they can t and if they tried they d fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing By the time they d even complete a project like this it d likely be out of spec unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics Again PLTR wins because of this PLTR is likely NOT to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources Buying PLTR for their use is a joke PLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4 10 days for each customer The engineer customizes and configures the system for each company s custom use since the software allows you to do so Regular aggregation and visualization software CAN do the same but typically lacks data input types and features that PLTR has because PLTR has cultivated a special set of features over many years that were suggested by their existing clientele in battlefields and other places amp x200B 8 Other Information Big known PLTR Holders Processing img a404oalxrob61 PLTR s Price List 2019 https www esi mil

evening to all of you here on r wallstreetbets I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and is ready for the new trading week ahead Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 18th 2021 Biden heads into inauguration with a stock market tailwind Source https www cnbc com 2021 01 15 biden heads into inauguration with a stock market tailwind html gt President elect Joe Biden moves into the White House in the coming week with the biggest stock market tailwind since a presidential Election Day going back to at least 1952 gt According to CFRA data that begins that year the near 13 gain since Nov 3 would be the biggest increase in the S amp P 500 between the election and inauguration if the gains hold President John F Kennedy s 8 8 gain had been the best followed by President Dwight Eisenhower with 6 3 and President Donald Trump with 6 2 gt Biden s promise of the 1 9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market s surge and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval gt The Martin Luther King Jr Day holiday starts off the week and over the next four days several dozen S amp P 500 companies report earnings Bank of America Goldman Sachs IBM Intel and Procter amp Gamble are among the companies reporting gt Biden will have no honeymoon The 1 9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine as he has promised gt This is the number he came in at Where do negotiations go from here Quincy Krosby chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said of the 1 9 trillion package She pointed to worries about a weakening economy evident in December s retail sales data down a surprising 0 7 and weekly jobless claims at the worst level since August gt You could argue this is Covid related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines inoculations gain orderly momentum That is crucial for the market she said gt Krosby said the market is focused on the inauguration gt They want to see it go smoothly and that there s not any security lapse The market absorbed the events of Jan 6 The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one off and the market ended higher on Jan 6 she said But always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out gt There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals gt Stimulus and stocks Markets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats who now hold a thin majority in Congress gt We re getting stimulus and now the question is OK you re supposed to be this great compromiser said Sam Stovall chief investment strategist at CFRA gt Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down Ed Mills Washington policy analyst at Raymond James said the package could be cut to about 1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin gt Does Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year to put it mildly Mills said He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending gt D C is going to be there with more spending or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post vaccine world sooner he said gt Stovall said that if history is a guide the stock market should do well with Biden The average gain of the S amp P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3 5 going back to 1952 For Republicans in the same period it s been an average 0 5 gt The S amp P 500 has also gained an average 11 3 in the first year of a Democratic president but just 5 7 for Republicans going back to World War II gt The stock market will continue to monitor the bond market after the 10 year Treasury yield reached a high of 1 18 this past week the highest since March It since slid back to about 1 08 Friday after the weak data gt Other things are going on in the back room Bond yields have moved up of late and it was a change It gave you a sense of how fast rates can move said James Paulsen chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group It might be a preview of what you can expect this year This past week saw

Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998 In the 23 years since the market s performance during this four trading day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA S amp P 500 NASDAQ Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 Average losses range from 0 81 by DJIA to 0 16 by NASDAQ Of the five indexes not one has a record better than 50 50 However since

With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete January and 2021 are off to a solid start DJIA is up 1 26 as of today s close S amp P 500 stands at 1 05 NASDAQ 1 74 and small caps measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9 14 These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted gt Last September was weak as it has historically been then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive in line with typical seasonal patterns A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre Covid open for business way of life gt Due to the reemergence of seasonality we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February In the following seasonal pattern chart of January the last 21 years of data for DJIA S amp P 500 NASDAQ Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today s close plotted on the right vertical axis gt Over the last 21 years it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point this year it is Russell 2000 Other than that the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well There was strength early on followed by sideways action Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day January 18 is possible gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https 64 media tumblr com c921e48e1e14dd8a61d2ad5cc18d7f94 f775f74bce597bb1 b6 s500x750

Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer term policy impacts of the Democratic blue wave and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts gt First off blue waves have not been bearish for stocks with the S amp P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9 1 on average since 1950 gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https i1 wp com lplresearch com wp content uploads 2021 01 Blog 1 15 21 1 png ssl 1 gt We shared this chart in 2020 and it shows that historically stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office This makes sense as a new president will bring in new policies and likely question marks while you know what you will get with a re elected president Remember markets hate uncertainty and surprises gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https i2 wp com lplresearch

first year under such circumstances up nearly 12 on average explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick Maybe investors shouldn t fear a blue wave after all gt As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times What stands out to us for 2021 though is

Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans the 11 seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879 Yes the Democrats

outperformed global equities more broadly As shown below over the past year the S amp P 500 SPY has risen just over 16 That compares to 11 26 for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All World ex US ETF VEU Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets While emerging markets SPEM are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14 78 gain developed markets SPDW have lagged with just a 10 56 gain So far in 2021 though the rest of the world has been outperforming the US Whereas SPY has risen around 1 YTD VEU is up almost 3 times that Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3 87 Meanwhile SPDW has gained less 2 7 though it is still outperforming the US gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2021 01 011221 ETFs png gt In the charts below we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY As shown the longer term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021 In the case of emerging markets the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week The S amp P 500 s underperformance relative to other developed markets SPDW has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus

the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101 4 to 95 9 After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it s really rolling over gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2021 01 011221 NFIB Small Business Chart png gt Not only was this month s headline index weak but it caught economists completely off guard While the index fell to 95 9 economists were expecting a drop to 100 2 That 4 3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years July 2015 and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report gt Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations should we be concerned about a double dip As an investor we should always be worried about what could go wrong but in the case of this report you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report To illustrate this we would note that going back to 2010 as far back as we have data and right up through Election Day 2016 the NFIB only topped expectations 42 of the time Following Trump s election in 2016 though this index surged and has since topped expectations 63 of the time Since Election Day 2020 though the headline index has now missed expectations three times gt From a longer term perspective dating back to 1974 the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100 1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96 2 Now that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods but over that same span even though the percentages are low for both political parties lt 20 the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations gt The lesson to take from all this is that even if it s often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter it s usually best to leave politics outside gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2021 01 011221 NFIB

summary of charts and data that I personally looked at and thought was important Give it a read and let me know what you think Small speculative markets continue to explode higher while large cap markets rally less Summary Here s how I approach markets based on 3 different strategies amp time frames 1 Short term trend followers should continue to ride the rally because no one knows exactly when it will end If you are a short term trend follower you must use stops 2 Medium term contrarian traders should go neither long nor short Wait Risk reward doesn t favor long positions right now while shorting into a speculative rally can end in disaster 3 Long term investors should be highly defensive right now This speculative bull market may last another 6 months or even 9 months but in 2 years time long term investors will be glad they did not buy today Bottomline trend is up but beware of mounting risks amp x200B https preview redd it ura0cdrlepb61 png width 651 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 966798cf031deec44bd7cfba01e3bdda648a17f4 Let s keep our mind open to different outcomes by looking at both bullish and bearish factors Who is buying A day can t go by without another multi billion dollar IPO exploding higher But while traders and investors are buying small amp speculative stocks like there s no tomorrow almost no corporate insiders are buying their own stocks anymore The corporate insider sell buy ratio s 50 day average is at the 2nd highest level ever It was only exceeded by 2007 amp x200B Processing img fyas2rmoepb61 In 2007 stocks rallied for another half year before an epic collapse began This isn t to say that today is just like 2007 The future is never just like the past But even if we look at less extreme historical cases the next 3 6 months saw mediocre returns for stocks amp x200B https preview redd it za7o2nkpepb61 png width 643 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b842ef7978be9ad8281cc7df8311c96a4feed6f8 Beware of risks like this but also remember that the short term trend remains UP Momentum Small caps and emerging markets continue to surge higher Bloomberg publishes a Fear Greed indicator which is really just a momentum indicator price drives sentiment This Fear Greed indicator for emerging markets is at the highest level since 2007 amp x200B https preview redd it r06zkoqqepb61 png width 633 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 82f40c3ad08326189483588620a348e0e84ed628 This may seem scary but Bloomberg s Fear Greed calculation is based on NOMINAL numbers So as the market goes up over the decades this figure will naturally become more and more extreme Hence it s better to divide Fear Greed by the market s value amp x200B https preview redd it uee9em0sepb61 png width 650 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 42c2d3d127e1d03a7716833a7dfd0b8276164c22 Here we can see that the adjusted Fear Greed is high but this wasn t bearish in the past When emerging markets momentum was this strong they usually rallied further over the next 3 months amp x200B Processing img 4m2s2hzsepb61 This is a bullish reading for emerging markets Breadth Breadth is very strong across the world The of NASDAQ stocks at a 52 week

Everything small and risky is soaring right now An index of the most shorted most leveraged stocks saw its 14 week RSI explode higher The last 2 times this happened led to sharp corrections in these risky stocks amp x200B https preview redd it xcq302bzepb61 png width 653 amp format png amp auto webp amp s c42849e15fed5eb2ad006aa453aa712bfeb63f7d It s easy to see why investors are plowing into

country s stock index is 18 above its 200 dma This is the highest reading in over a decade I calculated this average using the following countries indices U S Australia Austria Belgium Canada Denmark Finland France Germany HK Ireland Israel Italy Japan Netherlands New Zealand Norway Portugal Singapore Spain Sweden Switzerland UK Brazil China India South Korea Mexico Taiwan Russia amp x200B Processing img wv59py12fpb61 When so many stock markets around the world surged in the past the S amp P 500 which accounts for half of global market cap usually rallied a little more over the next 3 months followed by a sharp pullback 6 months later amp x200B Processing img h7586so5fpb61 High volatility is to be expected in the coming months The overextended rally can overextend even further but nothing lasts forever Looking more closely within the U S micro cap stocks the smallest of stocks are now more than 40 above their 200 day moving average The last time this happened was in February

note that this also happened during the first year of the 2003 2007 September 2003 and 2009 2020 September 2009 bull markets In those 2 historical cases the stock market rallied another 4 6 months before major corrections began This is a bearish sign for spring amp summer 2021 Gamma Exposure And finally Gamma Exposure recently hit a record high High values are bearish and low values are bullish

fire lads let me polish your until the mythical piercing green dildo will penetrate us so hard we get sent to the fucking moon ,I deleted a couple posts showing my BB positions because I don t want anyone IRL seeing balances JuST mAkE a NeW acCoUnT Stfu reet I ll probably delete this as well soon but I know some of you autistic bastards need to hear this now yes you who put market orders first thing Friday morning expecting BB to rocket from high 10 s to 15 s in a single trading session Pure majestic autism I come out of Plato s cave to tell you I understand your pains I was there not too long ago you see Back in November I noticed BB cleanly up trending on the hourly bouncing off the 9 and 26 MA I use ichimoku heading towards a resistance level that had already formed a double top Like a true Gamblers fallacy believing retard I made a wager 10k into 6 calls expiring March on the DD that what are the chances it falls AGAIN there that s it A few days later AWS news came and that 10k turned into 70k Pure luck Sometimes she goes sometimes she doesn t She went that day In that moment of seeing massive profits on AWS news day I experienced violent and absolutely tremendous autism and thought this thing is going from 5 s to 15 in a single trading session yes even more retarded than you guys that bought the top on Friday Sensible thoughts couldn t penetrate my helmet fast enough as drool gushed from my gaping mouth gasping for oxygen and yelling at the top of my lungs what barely resembled words about Lambo s and Yachts so I hurled about 100k into shares at 8 77 and about 10k more into 15 leaps I proceeded to watch my profit dwindle to nothing as earnings came and bent me over so hard I couldn t bring myself to watch the stock for a week I thought about selling the bottom I was there order ready typed just needed to hit the send button and I was going to close my position around 6 7ish and be back to break even after striking gold But you know what I remembered it s just money I remembered that everything in reality is in flux and changing and decaying and being born again and to just flow with it and stop clinging and desiring one set of experiences over another aka a fat bank account over giving 5 blowies behind a Wendy s who cares All is well lads So let go of the burden if you bought the top and are stressing it s really fine Look at what s happening right now 1 Insane volume insane moves erratic behavior something is going on behind the curtain PS this movement and volume is NOT because of WSB full stop Big players are making huge moves here and fast we don t know why yet 2 1 Billion annual revenue 3 Soon to come online a RECURRING AUTO DATA business that will drive revenue into growth cycle BB is literally Microsoft Windows for cars but the auto sector was still underdeveloped technologically to benefit from this position hence this vertical is finally about to print HUGE HUGE HUGE MEGA BILLIONS ANNUAL This was always the plan and they just had to wait it out until the auto sector caught up with them digitally The auto data tech sector is so lucrative it made Papa Elon the richest person in the world and forced a fucking god damn phone company to join the race it s huge 4 UNDER FUCKING VALUED 5 VERTICALS GALORE 5 FB settled imagine the BALLS on BB going after this massive and dirty tech behemoth run by a literal lizard they are honest Canadians doing God s work 6 IOT AI smart city s insert other buzzwords I could go on and on and honestly I ve never felt more comfortable holding ANY stock than this Moral of the story as I let go and accepted my circumstances and decided to diamond hand BB to the death within a few days I proceeded to watch the fattest thickest randomest greenest dildo penetrate my butt hole to the high heavens and take me from what was 70k profit to 0 profit back up to 130k profit I ve trimmed half the options I don t even know why tbh reverse autism maybe but I m riding my remaining calls and entire share position to Valhalla Will likely add more if it dips But Just hold Something is cooking on BB You have to be a retard not to see it Look at the fucking daily chart look at the volume the gaps the swings BB chart literally has Tourette s syndrome right now This stock has not moved like this for 10 years It might stall a little deflate from here consolidate a bit more or it might blast off again any second Point is nobody knows when but it looks like in a short time we will know why this stock is moving the way it has Something is DEFINITELY going on behind the scenes the public is not aware of and neither is the media For fucks sake I found the court docs showing global settlement with FB is done 24 hours before gay ass Bloomberg even picked it up The majority of the investor world still thinks they make fucking phones for Gods sake Everyone is sleeping on this A note on Jim just in case he reads this Jim Cramer hates this stock because 1 BB and John Chen are not bootlicking CEO s jerking off CNBC and massaging Cramers asshole for air time they re a tightly run honorable company doing real things 2 He most likely became a bag holder during the epic fall of the BB phone and sold for a fat loss and wants to protect his ego by continuing to ignore the facts on the company The guy wants you to invest in CRWD with a fucking ridiculous market cap no verticals and less revenue than BB Promoting a literal bubble over a value play What a bizarre world we live in Take advantage of it I hear this phrase all the time and I fucking hate it but this is literally free money Know what you own There is TRUE value in this company No hype Pure value Diamond hand double down buy more and just hold You are in good hands Tl dr diamond hand BB

some option dynamics last week that seem to have played out to an extent I actually lost money on my puts because the expressed vol was less than I thought and Friday ended up playing out in a basically neutral way from a bull bear perspective with a mere 10 drawdown That post is here I correct predicted the outcome but didn t predict the magnitude well enough and thus my trade sucked https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kxb7dy analysis of massive potential gme forced selling https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kxb7dy analysis of massive potential gme forced selling In this new post I ll cover what I know about current option structure and will update once updated data for Friday comes out and the implications TLDR Mostly expect vol around multiples of 5 in stock price as well as other trading dynamic topics that I think are misunderstood or rarely spoken of I m not going to talk about my opinion of the value of the stock or the turn around plan I m actually in what is a modest put position for me at the moment jan 22 38 puts x 80 but I fully acknowledge this could go to the moon next week and I ll feel like a miniature Melvin capital though shorting at 38 is a lot smarter than at 17 and probably deserve it in that case Current Option Structure I will update this as new data gets in but you can see big concentrations of options at 30 35 39 40 and 45 There isn t open interest data for Friday but volume suggests there are further ramps at 50 55 60 but they are probably smaller than the 39 40 and 30 ramps Normally dealers are going to be long calls from people selling covered calls and short puts From people buying protection On GME I think we all know it s short calls and short puts since people are buying tons of calls from them and also speculating with puts As such dealers are extremely short gamma and that means that prices accelerate from dealer activity greatly When the stock sells the dealers have to dump stock or short it When the stock goes up dealers have to buy I believe that the Wednesday melt up was as much a short squeeze as a gamma squeeze as the price moved over a bunch of OTM options forcing dealers to buy as much as 1 3 of the total float of the company to hedge These patterns are most sharp at these large concentrations of strike prices so the stock can jump from 39 to 41 a lot easier than from 36 to 38 as an example On average it s about 1m of stock bought sold by dealers per percent change To put in context there was a jump Friday where about 250k shares got bought and moved the price 5 That means that if accurate dealer activity might have been up to half in that flash We don t yet have the Friday data but there was a lot of Friday volume This amplification may be greater next week This week had a gamma event on Wednesday after which there were a ton of ITM WSB calls and OOM Melvin puts that don t have gamma and thus the price de volatilized somewhat But we may now be in a situation with a lot of near the money options which means we could see very large gamma squeezes up or down again Here s the structure I ll update once there is Friday OI data available This chart assumes that calls are positive gamma they will all be negative gamma in this case so predict accordingly https imgur com a czrKy6X https imgur com a czrKy6X Also worth mentioning is the expirations next week Here s the current structure for next week using Thursday data which I ll update once I get Friday data https imgur com a 4wKTspB https imgur com a 4wKTspB This is a lot less bearish than the Friday we just had but again I ll update once I get the data It s still a net sell on Friday as those option positions get cleared out people sell to realize and then buy other things in general but more like under 1 10th of float vs the 1 3 of float we were staring at this Friday Unless people piled into ITM calls Friday which I find highly unlikely As such the downwards force this coming Friday if this Friday was 10 is more like 2 or 3 in a vacuum However the higher the prices go into Friday the more selling this in turn causes Friday so in a world where we end at 55 on Thursday I d definitely not go into Friday long as this forced selling increases My sense out of all of this is The current gamma structure provides more ramps up than down from 35 but there are strong ramps in either direction BUT the volume suggests a lot of new put positions were established On net volatility up not bearish or bullish There is some forced selling this coming Friday but if that was the driving force yesterday it would be a 3 or 2 not a 10 Slightly bearish If the stock moons this week I would encourage you to approach Friday with care and a more bearish or defensive mentality even if fundamentally bullish A LOT of capital went into OOM puts and calls this week targeting the week after If the stock is not volatile a lot of speculators bleed out on both sides Margin Changes There was a lot of talk about how various brokerages have increased margin requirements on GME stock Some set to 100 Schwab others set up a bit TDA from 70 to 75 others rumored to be planning but haven t IBKR The reaction of the sub is that this is bullish It s actually bearish The reason is that most of the shorts in my opinion are institutional Retail will typically short with OOM puts which don t cause much actual selling to hedge Institutions short GME are going to have that in a giant account with a ton of other assets so changes on margin placed on them if indeed that happened wont margin call them except in scenarios where GME goes up 20x in a day or something On the other hand if you are a retail trader where half or all of your positions are GME this margin change does effect you especially if you were out on margin and it makes it harder to buy more shares I don t think many retail traders are directly short the stock Anyone want to raise their hand and admit they are 50 GME and on margin to do it Also consider the context retail brokerages just did this on the back of everyone here buying shares long That to me suggests they are looking at customer accounts seeing some over extension worrying about it and setting the rule to prevent themselves being burned Some of you have a net worth of mostly GME in your levered account If that gets squeezed down and a liquidation is forced those brokerages won t be seeing the money So I think the margin changes are bearish I would also urge you bulls to not set yourself up to be squeezed which is my next point Squeezes and Short Interest It s true that this stock has high short interest There s contradictory evidence as to if the shorts went up this week or went down IBKR share availability suggests it may have went down other sources suggest up and I ll update once we have solid post Friday data that someone posts However just because the short interest is high doesn t mean that it can be squeezed easily from here Wednesday I think was that squeeze A lot of the old shorts may have covered then and we may be looking at new shorts Additionally while GME longs here on stock are not squeezable if not on margin those of you on OOM call options ARE squeezable and those of you on ITM options are in a sense even more squeezable OOM call options decay if the stock doesn t go up and then the shares dealers bought to hedge the call they sold you get sold back into the pool ITM options when sold do the same but more powerfully selling a very ITM call option on GME means a dealer immediately goes out and dumps 100 shares of GME on the market If you in turn buy 100 shares it s netural or if you buy a bunch of NTM calls you might even cause a net buy But those will tend to cause selling if people take money off the table and as time goes on And yes there are a TON of new put options and those get squeezed out too So there is a dual squeeze potential here shorts vs their losses and borrow fees and decaying option positions which cause dealer buying and longs using margin and longs in call options fighting time and also watching dealers dump their hedged longs Yield Enhancement Program A pro tip I have for this sub is if you intend to hold a ton of long stock that is in high demand by short sellers you should get paid to lend it to short sellers That s how the option dealers make a lot of their money I m sure citadel is making a killing holding a ton of GME stock to hedge and promptly lending it to hedge funds at 30 borrow rate while having very little risk Most brokerages don t pay you for lending your shares out but IBKR does Right now if your GME shares are loaned out you get something like 15 annualized in rebates This doesn t work if the shares are in margin they have be fully paid and settled but it is a substantial extra if you are a long term believer in the stock and on other brokerages they get paid instead of you If any other brokerages have this feature that are non institutional please post and I ll add Conclusion I think the major factor here remains simply the desire of this sub to pile new money in However it s hard to maintain these prices for more than a few weeks without additional catalysts because options are getting pricey and decay will set in and the transformation plan Cohen has laid out will take time to do and thus present it s own catalysts that would powerfully attract a institutional investors on the sidelines In terms of other factors The margin changes again are definitely bearish How bearish That depends on how many of you guys bought a ton of GME shares on margin and whether or not we gap down Tuesday I don t think it affects the short interest much The option situation is probably net bullish Tuesday Wednesday Thursday but net bearish Friday slightly but does mean that next week can be insanely volatile Price moves are easier in the vicinity of 35 30 39 40 and to a lesser extent 45 50 55 60 due to gamma ramps I ll post new data when I get it

PLC is a British company studying synthetic psilocybin as a treatment for depression Business Overview CMPS is addressing several mental health diseases There are ongoing trials for anorexia nervosa addiction primarily alcohol and smoking depression and anxiety The global TAM for depression and anxiety alone is estimated at 18 5b The most successful antidepressant at present is Zoloft and it has generated over 30b in total revenue for Pfizer CMPS is the largest of the psychedelic pharmaceutical companies by a significant margin with a market cap of almost 1 53b only MindMed also breaks 1b They are also currently listed on the Nasdaq While psilocybin research has increased significantly they are the dominant player in this space They now run all six registered clinical trials for psilocybin that are industry supported As with all the players in this space there are concerns about IP protections and the defensibility of their position CMPS was granted a patent US Patent No 10 519 175 in Jan 2020 for the use of psilocybin for treatment resistant depression This patent covered their proprietary synthetic version of psilocybin called COMP360 The primary purpose of the patent was to protect a stable form of psilocybin for clinical use Otherwise you would be stuck with a product with limited shelf life and significant variability in dosing This patent is significant because it fulfills the FDA s good manufacturing practice standards required to get final approval for any drug Phase 1 trials for psilocybin are by and large completed A 25mg one time dose has been well tolerated in several trials in a typical 70kg subject This has allowed for progression to Phase 2 trials Clinical efficacy trials are starting to get published The highest profile study yet is Davis et al 2020 JAMA Psych wherein they found significant benefit to psilocybin use in conjunction with therapy when treating depression trial NCT03181529 1 Comp360 is in Phase 2b trials NCT03775200 for an initial trial and NCT04519957 for long term follow up with a recruitment goal of 216 subjects The Phase 2b trial is projected to finish recruitment in May 2021 and completed in Dec 2021 Depending on how the data look in May they could begin working on Phase 3 approval through the FDA shortly after that The primary question is how large a trial i e how many subjects will they need for Phase 3 This gets at the efficacy and number needed to treat to see a benefit number needed to treat NNT The closest analog for investigational psychedelics is esketamine aka Spravato While ketamine has use as an anesthetic its use in mental health was controversial 2 There were multiple analyses of the data 3 5 but the most important thing to know is that psilocybin has both a greater and a more durable antidepressant than esketamine 6 8 It stands to reason that the size of their Phase 3 will be smaller than the esketamine Spravato trial and will proceed more quickly Regardless the timeline for that is still on the order of years The political climate is improving for psilocybin Oregon and DC have recently voted to decriminalize it In contrast with LSD there is significantly more will to study therapeutic uses of psilocybin and some reputable US universities NYU JHU are leading these efforts Differences from the marijuana industry An understandable comparison has to be made to the marijuana bubble There are several key differences between the two markets Higher barrier to entry Lower recreational demand Ability to learn from marijuana stock euphoria Dilution rounds Convertible debt situation CMPS has been through two rounds of funding and an IPO Series A and B raised 105m in capital Series B in April 2020 followed by their IPO which raised 146 6m They re backed by ATIA Life Sciences who have raised 125m in November and ATIA will be going through its own IPO sometime in 2021 Raising funds has not been an issue thus far and will get easier as trials are completed Dilution can be a significant hit to share price ask MindMed holders Looking through their F 1 on F23 pg 305 there are 116 455 234 shares worth of options and convertible preferred shares There are 94 651 686 shares authorized The F 1 has a section on dilution but every pdf version available looks corrupted and there are missing values Expect that any investment will be diluted at some point if the company is successful As a sidebar Peter Thiel owns 7 54 amp x200B Outlook The next major milestone for CMPS will be an interim report on their Phase 2b trial for Comp360 They have been enrolling patients for 12 months now When looking at the change log on clinicaltrials gov https clinicaltrials gov their initial goal was the complete the trial by Dec 2020 but this slipped to 2021 Their primary completion is now May 2021 this will be when they ve enrolled all the subjects There may be some kind of press release at that point or even an announcement of a pre IND call to the FDA to discuss Phase 3 plans My thesis is that the stock will continue to cool off from the ATH they hit in December A 10q will come out in late February they could potentially have an update on trial progress in it there could also be an 8k They will not disclose interim study results at that time Their goal will be to wait for a splashy publication after the trial is done The goal should be entry before then Prior results are strong enough and consistent enough to have a favorable outlook on the trials Longer term they will be administering a Phase 3 trial Look for a recruitment goal of 1 000 or more subjects it will be on the order of the Spravato Esketamine trial which had 816 Janssen Research moved Spravato rapidly through Phase 2 and 3 trials and it still took them four years to do the entire Phase 3 alone CMPS has been efficient thus far but Janssen is a J amp J subsidiary with significantly more funding A full four year cycle would be a reasonable estimate But we will get a better idea when the Phase 2 is done since it is already large for a trial of this type If they can recruit patients quickly then their Phase 3 may be faster than Janssen s was for Spravato CMPS also has the advantage of breakthrough therapy status with the FDA An all important caveat to CMPS this is a company with only one drug in the pipeline If Comp360 has a negative trial outcome then this stock will tank There is no plan B Administration of Comp360 is not as simple as getting a prescription and taking it at home Patients have to be monitored by a specially trained therapist for gt 4 hours after administration Even if there are significant benefits over the current therapies clinical adoption will be slow My final TLDR enter this play in the medium term after the current peak has wound down CMPS is a better long term hold that other players in this sector given the patentability of their therapeutic Comp360 and success moving through trials The science is on their side and the political climate is more favorable than other psychedelics e g LSD and MDMA Positions 4 000 shares no options Papers 1 A K Davis F S Barrett D G May M P Cosimano psychiatry 2020 2 E H Turner The Lancet Psychiatry 6 977 2019 3

of you know FUBO has been shorted like crazy since the news of their Victory acquisition It shot up 33 with the news and has since lost most of those gains I m here to tell you why the shorts are wrong and why this is a MASSIVE opportunity for us First I d like to address the issue of profitability It was founded in 2015and being a young growing company and isn t profitable yet To put things into perspective even Netflix which was founded in 1997 wasn t profitable until 2003 Fubo has more competition today than Netflix did back then but it s still growing rapidly Q3 Results https www yahoo com now fubotv announces q3 2020 results 210500756 html https www yahoo com now fubotv announces q3 2020 results 210500756 html Revenues were 61 2 million a 47 increase year over year on a pro forma basis or 71 excluding 2019 licensing revenue from the FaceBank AG business sold in July 2020 This growth was driven by continued subscriber expansion an increase in subscription Average Revenue Per User ARPU and growth of advertising sales Subscription revenue increased 64 year over year to 53 4 million Advertising revenue increased 153 year over year to 7 5 million Paid subscribers at quarter end totaled 455 000 an increase of 58 year over year Average Revenue Per User ARPU per month was 67 70 up 14 year over year Total content hours streamed by fuboTV users paid and free trial in the quarter increased 83 year over year to 133 3 million hours Monthly active users MAUs watched 121 hours per month on average in the quarter an increase of 20 year over year Q4 Preliminary Results https ir fubo tv news news details 2021 fuboTV Announces Preliminary Fourth Quarter 2020 Revenue and Subscriber Growth default aspx https ir fubo tv news news details 2021 fuboTV Announces Preliminary Fourth Quarter 2020 Revenue and Subscriber Growth default aspx Q4 total revenue is expected to be between 94 98 million a 77 to 84 increase year over year Prior guidance was 80 85 million Paid subscribers at year end are expected to exceed 545 000 an increase of more than 72 year over year Prior guidance was 500 000 510 000 subscribers It smashed its previous guidance because sports and normality are returning Also note that Fubo was still growing rapidly during the pandemic despite the lack of sports which is its primary focus This is huge and it will continue to grow faster as sports start to return to normal FUBO is estimated to announce earnings between Jan 25 2021 and Feb 03 2021 amp x200B Most of us know that Fubo was opportunistically hit by short sellers Kerrisdale Rich Greendfield as their lock up period expired This made the stock tank considerably from it s high of 60 The short argument is that integrated sports betting is a pipe dream and that its not profitable yet As mentioned earlier it took Netflix a while to scale up and become profitable At the rate Fubo is growing they are going to be profitable sooner than later This isn t even an argument to me as they scale up a few things will happen Customer acquisition costs will become a lower and lower percentage of revenue Since they license their content they need scale to turn those licensing costs to profit just like Netflix did More customers mean they can charge more for advertising More on this later Fubo very clearly addressed the issue of integrated sports betting with the acquisition of Vigtory The bear thesis is weakening significantly Almost nonexistent amp x200B amp x200B Now on to the NBA https www forbes com sites bethkindig 2021 12 31 fubotv solid positioning for sports betting sh 5fadb7c69cb5 https www forbes com sites bethkindig 2021 12 31 fubotv solid positioning for sports betting sh 5fadb7c69cb5 Over the past few years Sky Media led investment rounds in FuboTV along with Fox for a 39 stake This investment round was increased in late 2017 early 2018 with Sky Media holding Board positions The former NBA commissioner was also part of the last 15 million round Media has gone through some very big M amp A shifts at the top level with Comcast acquiring Sky and Disney acquiring 21st Century Fox However for FuboTV s formative years the company was influenced by arguably the top sports betting company in the world Sky Media from the UK The Comcast owned Sky Media is still a backer for FuboTV along with Disney David Stern the late former NBA commissioner was involved in funding of Fubo The current NBA commissioner Adam Silver worked extremely closely with his mentor I ve been a lifelong NBA fan and I had doubts in Adam Silver but I think he s done a fantastic job with the NBA Why am I bringing up the NBA https www casino org news nba considering betting broadcasts could help draftkings https www casino org news nba considering betting broadcasts could help draftkings check the date of this and check the date of the Fubo Vigtory announcement People are missing some key elements to the NBA announcement this announcement was made literally the DAY after the Fubo Victory acquisition People are missing the link between the NBA and Fubo let alone the timing Fact check me they were announced a day apart and Fubo is the ONLY company with plans of an integrated sports betting broadcast platform The NBA wants to get into this because they know viewers watch games for longer with sports betting and fantasy leagues which is why I think they threw in DraftKings amp x200B amp x200B Now lets look into two key acquisitions Vigtory Fubo acquired them and put their co founder in charge of integrated sports betting along with their licenses and tech Balto This one is another thing bears are missing They claim this acquisition was to get into sports betting it wasn t this was for their fantasy sports platform which Fubo is also planning on integrating amp x200B Fubo is going to be an absolute monster going forward It is trading at a discount thanks to shorts https www marketwatch com investing stock fubo https www marketwatch com investing stock fubo 34m shares short 62 5 of float shorted This thing is PRIMED for an epic squeeze AND it s valued at a discount right now Since the Vigtory acquisition new price targets came out ranging from 47 to 60 Short term I m confident this thing will pop soon It was hammered down after the Vigtory announcement by shorts followed by a low volume selloff Friday It s trading at imo a massive discount right now Long term this thing is shaping up to be a unique competitor in streaming sports betting amp x200B TL DR get in long one way or another Commons LEAPS anything this thing is going to explode as we inch towards earnings expected late January to mid February We got massive revenue growth we have strong tailwinds with the return of sports we have the NBA basically saying they re in as long as Fubo can execute
