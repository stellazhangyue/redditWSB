by saying i m currently balls deep in IQST and have gotten an absolute ass whooping over the last month but i ve done my due diligence and I believe this company has alot to offer Basic knowledge for reference MKT CAP 83 1 Million Current price 60 cents So let s start off with the DD I will be using the bracket point Bull or Bear respectively to illustrate where I stand on each of the points and how I believe that point impacts the business 1 Insane revenue Multiple revenue streams all in very interesting fields Bull IQST has pulled in a 44 9 million in the year 2020 amp plans to expand that revenue to 60 5 million which I genuinely believe may be a conservative number they made 18mil in 2019 so you can clearly see the revenue is growing at a very rapid pace This company is involved in high growth areas such as Blockchain Technology services They re into battery solutions and are working on an EV motorbike Internet of things Telecommunications and FinTech more They announced the first production of 2500 units of their Internet of things Award winning Smart Tank to be launched this month not sure if they have started yet but this is an additional new source of revenue for the company This revenue is much higher than companies such as ALPP and Can t aLlow Stock talK for some reason the ticker symbol isn t allowed on wsb so just filter with capitals who are valued more than 5x what this company is despite showing very low revenue growth relative to this stock I can go on and on about this company and it s revenue revenue streams but im trying to keep this DD relatively short This company trades at lt 2x price to revenue amp x200B 2 Customers Bullish This stock has some very high profile customers that are very eye opening on the first glance some of these costumers include Verizon IBM T Mobile and FLOW these people being customers is one of the main selling points for me as it shows that this company is able to perform at the highest level and can attract leaders in the telecommunications industry as customers amp x200B 3 Marketing Bullish and potentially Bearish IMPORTANT READ The thing I like about this stock is that it s always providing updates to it s investors on where each project is going these updates seem to come weekly and as an investor it is very nice to see this transparency It seems that compared to other stocks anywhere near a similar value it is much harder to find any information on them and it is a pain to undergo any analysis as you have to do a very deep dive to get information outside of the companies website on them My personal belief is that due to their expertise in the telecom and marketing departments they are able to effectively advertise better than most companies valued similarly This one is hard for me to write as someone who is invested in the stock but the bearish point of this marketing is that perhaps it s making things seem better than it really is and this marketing is in hope of a pump in the stocks price A big problem I see is that alot of the articles I see is that it is sourced from IQST themselves 4 Balance Sheet BEAR Arguably the most bearish point of this DD is a TATL lt 1 Meaning that this company has more Liabilities than assets which is never a good sign however if you pay attention to the company it is slowly reducing it s liabilities and slightly increasing assets over the last year 5 Management Meh Not necessarily a Bear point as the managers don t seem to have a bad track record however there was nothing that really stood out Most of the people in this company have years of experience in the telecom business which is their largest department at the moment Their team also consists of a lot of engineers which I personally like since I am currently studying to become an engineer and engineering CEO s tend to bring in alot more money although this isn t true for all individual cases I like the way that the company is going about diversifying revenue sources in high growth areas but at the same time that is a double edged sword on a company who doesn t have the greatest balance sheet For this point I say meh as it can definitely come back to bite the company but I think with the rollout of the smart tank this early investment can easily pay off heavily 6 Price amp Price action BEAR As i ve stated at the beginning of this DD this company has been biting me in the ass over the last month or two but this I believe is due to market manipulation from hedgies The reason I say this is because i ve been in this stock for a while and this stock moves methodically downwards it will have a huge spike up Like today then over a while it will slowly sell off and trend downwards then have another huge spike this i believe is due to naked shorting however I have no proof and I am not saying that I am right with this Another reason I think hedgies are potentially involved is due to trading bans that limit the volume of trades day which basically has forced the price even further downwards amp x200B 7 Conclusion Few stocks offer the growth potential and such a large diversity into high growth fields as IQST and unlike most speculation stocks this stock has proven and continues to prove that it can make money and has quite a few catalysts coming very soon The only problem is it s margins which should improve within the next year or two amp a bad balance sheet They also plan on uplisting to a higher OTC market NASDAQ which should help the price alot On the flipside the stock has been been absolutely slashed as of recently and is definitely a high risk play I m personally invested on a DCA of 96 cents Let me know what you guys think about my first DD TLDR Ez 10 bagger under good conditions portfolio wiper under bad but good outweighs bad imo

shorted heavily I personally plan to buy and hodl but that s just me Definitely not financial advice There s a lot to get through so the sections of this DD will be labeled This handy dandy index should help you navigate to information you may find relevant while skipping information that you don t care about 1 All in 1 quick DD for Apes who don t have time for reeding or wrinkles for numbers synopsis 2 Financials 3 CEO amp other key individuals 4 Why I like the stock 5 Short data 1 All in 1 quick DD for Apes who don t have time for reeding or wrinkles for numbers Reed s Inc REED is beverage company that specializes in ginger beers and specialty sodas Virgil s brand Sodas taste delicious ginger beer is eh for me but some people like it and importantly it s used in a bunch of mixed drinks bars buy from them bars reopening is good Products are handcrafted GMO free and many have sugar free and KETO friendly variants for the health crowd And again Virgil s brand sodas are stupid level tasty So why have you never heard of them Cuz competing with Pepsi and Coke products for shelf space is dummy difficult when you can t offer the same obscene deals as mega corporations like Pepsi and Coke Long boring stuff cut out that s changing and people will have the opportunity to taste actually delicious soda and then there s no going back It has been a short seller s dream stock With every piece of good news printed shorts come in and tanks the price super low But with what I suspect is a very good Q1 earnings report and even if I m wrong almost guaranteed fantastic Q2 earnings report they re not gonna be able to safely short it for some time Basically it s the ol buy and hodl again my Ape boys As long as the shorts can t tank the price after earnings squeeze likely to happen shortly after Apes that like numbers and stuff continue reading otherwise grab a few currently way too cheap shares and wait for tendies 2 Financials Just gonna be real with all you lovely Apes Reed s Inc has yet to show its worth as a net profitable company But at least in my eyes there s a very good reason for that The company went through a major restructuring right before Covid hit and that restructuring has yet to be able to show its true benefits in a post pandemic world Eh more on that later for now I ll just run you through the numbers Rather than copy paste a ton of data into an excel sheet and pretend I gathered the data myself here s a link to the Yahoo Finance financial sheets I encourage cross checking but the numbers seem to hold accurate across the platforms I use https finance yahoo com quote REED financials p REED There are a number of things I want to call attention to here but they all have the same basics in common We ll use total revenue and gross profit as examples Total Revenue From 2019 TR 33 820 to 2020 TR 41 615 total revenue increased by more than 23 compare Coke 3 7 and Pespi 4 8 Gross Profit From 2019 GP 7 876 to 2020 GP 12 766 gross profit increased by 62 Coke 6 Pepsi 4 25 Take pretty much any numbers on their 2020 balance sheet compare them to old numbers then compare that difference to their competitors REED is outperforming the growth of its sector by far Good numbers going despite the fact beverage sector as a whole had a major pull back thanks to the pandemic Admittedly comparing it to the giants of the industry may be unfair but the strong signals of growth REED has shown in the recent past outpace or match it s contemporaries as well While the price point of its stock considering market cap has lagged far behind Executives and recent insider trades John Bello Chairman Independent Director John Bello accumulated experience in the sector first as an entrepreneur that created and managed SoBe and then later as an executive with Pepsico after they acquired his company The brand grew rapidly under his guidance and its favorable acquisition by one of the giants of the beverage industry is testament to his ability He is also a naval veteran who left his position as lieutenant to pursue his education Norman E Snyder CEO Norman E Snyder is most notably in my opinion an accountant A seemingly humble position that carries great weight as a CEO Since taking on his position with Reed s he has done fantastic work refinancing the company and erasing bad debt His previous experience within the industry includes being the COO of SoBe prior to its acquisition by Pepsi and COO Rheingold Brewing prior to its acquisition by Drinks America Additionally he founded a consulting firm Redyns which offered financial and operational consultancy to small and medium sized companies Richard Hubli Vice President of Operations Put simply this guy is the reason I m convinced Reed s Inc has a bright future He specializes in directing and creating effective supply chains If you want to read more about him here s a link https patch com connecticut norwalk norwalk based reeds inc names richard h hubli vp operations But what you really need to know is simple The main choke that has always strangled Reed s ability to grow its business has been its supply and distribution network This dude came up with a stupid effective plan to restructure pretty much everything The plan is still in the works but its results are showing already most recently with the deal they made with CVS to provide their beverages nationally Recent insider activity no one within the company has sold a share since 2019 They have exclusively added to their positions https imgur com a gb9vMCF 4 Why I like the stock Their product is fantastic and the company takes pride in what they re making Their fundamentals are solid and they ve made nothing but excellent moves since restructuring their executive team Their stock is obscenely undervalued The only analyst to independently report REED s estimated value gave it a price point of 1 50 Hardly obscenely undervalued considering it s trading just under 1 now right Nope Because that s just what gets seen by most retail investor eyes Read this Analysts Opinion of REED Many brokerage firms have already submitted their reports for REED stocks with R F Lafferty repeating the rating for REED by listing it as a Buy The predicted price for REED in the upcoming period according to R F Lafferty is 5 based on the research report published on May 10th of the previous year 2019 Lake Street on the other hand stated in their research note that they expect to see REED reach a price target of 6 The rating they have provided for REED stocks is Buy according to the report published on April 26th 2019 Maxim Group gave a rating of Buy to REED setting the target price at 5 50 in the report published on April 25th of the previous year So most brokerages see the stock as being 5X undervalued at a minimum So why is it trading so far beneath its value Simple It s been a short sellers dream stock Short Data I only realized how egregious the short selling of Reed s is recently Please free to check anything I say here https www marketbeat com stocks NASDAQ REED short interest against Ortex data or from any other trusted source I am always open to being incorrect On may 7th 2021 700 00 shares were available to be shorted starting the day 0 6 0 8 borrow fee ending the day 52 5 borrow fee On may 8th 2021 I can find no available data On may 9th 2021 I can find no available data On may 10th 2021 500 000 shares were available starting 52 5 borrow fee ending at 450 000 available 10 8 So what the fuck happened REED spiked do to the news that it successfully made a deal with CVS retail investors eyes were drawn to it they bought into a fundamentally undervalued stock and then shorts absolutely hammered the hell out of it to steal away retail money It s that simple As soon as this stock goes above 1 30 shorts attack without mercy to scare off retail It s fuckin abusive For two whole days every single share available to be used for shorting had already been used Price still dropped despite low turnover rate on those days Basically I smell synthetic shares And with a stock this cheap showing the amount of growth potential it has and with such a small free float 84 M it s a dangerous fucking move to make But it keeps working because no one else is watching So help me out For anyone with bigger wrinkles check the info provided here and see if you can come up with a better explanation For anyone smooth brained enough consider buying a single share it s less than a buck right now and hodling it regardless of what happens I am heavily invested in AMC and assure you I m not trying to distract from any other stocks I just know that this is another good company with bright future that is being absolutely suffocated in the short term for no sensible reason other than there being no one there to stop the shorts Thank you for reading this DD No financial advice was given always do your own independent research and please share anything you

Introduction If you could find the most hated stock within the most hated subsector within the most hated industry today it may very well be coal mining company Peabody Energy BTU Energy is an industry that is not currently in vogue with investors focused on ESG and within the energy sector coal is certainly the black sheep of the family as the dirtiest of the 3 major fossil fuels Even among coal miners Peabody is especially loathed by investors given high debt levels and recent bankruptcy 2016 2017 This probably explains Peabody s high short interest of 10 So why should you care about this dumpster fire of a stock The fear and loathing surrounding Peabody has created a monster of an opportunity that offers more than 3x potential upside from current prices Overview Peabody s business can be split into 3 different segments 1 Seaborn Thermal Mostly comprised of Australian thermal coal that is primarily exported to Asian countries such as China India Japan etc 2 Seaborn Metallurgical Hard coking coal Hard coking coal mostly mined in Australia that is used in steelmaking and again primarily exported to Asia 3 Domestic Thermal Thermal coal mined in the Powder River Basin Wyoming Illinois Basin and a couple of other U S states The Opportunity While 2020 was a challenging year for Peabody all 3 of its major segments will benefit from the following tailwinds over the next 12 24 months 1 Increased industrial activity Industrial amp manufacturing activity continues to strengthen as global economies emerge from COVID China s manufacturing PMI has recovered to pre COVID levels and the US manufacturing PMI has exceeded pre COVID levels Stronger industrial activity means increased steel consumption which means increased demand for hard coking coal used in steel making 2 Higher Asian liquefied natural gas prices amp Chinese coal plant additions Asian liquefied natural gas prices are back to pre COVID levels making coal a more attractive fuel to burn In response thermal coal prices XAL1 have also rebounded from 2020 lows to reclaim 2019 levels While coal is viewed as being in decline in developed economies it is still growing in developing economies case in point China added 38 4 Gigawatts of new coal plant capacity in 2020 https www reuters com business energy chinas new coal power plant capacity 2020 more than 3 times rest worlds study 2021 02 03 These new plants will increase demand for Peabody s seaborne thermal coal 3 Higher US natural gas prices leading to increased domestic coal burn The recovery in natural gas prices is leading to an increase in thermal coal demand as coal becomes more cost competitive Coal s share of domestic power generation has been increasing while coal inventories have been decreasing What happens when demand exceeds supply You guessed it the price goes up 4 The load on the US electric grid will increase substantially over the next years As zero emission electric autos increase in number TSLA the load on the electric grid will increase substantially calling for increased generation and increased use of coal The electric grid in the USA is primarily coal powered 5 Massive short interest With short interest at 10 of the free float a sudden increase in BTU price will have short sellers scrambling to cover Similar to what we have seen over and over and over again Valuation To calculate Peabody s forecast equity value we will apply a conservative EV EBITDA ratio of 3x which is reasonable for a highly cyclical amp leveraged name like Peabody We would then subtract out the net debt of 900 million asset retirement obligation of 658 million and accrued post retirement obligation of 410 million While the asset retirement obligations amp post retirement obligations may be resolved for less than fair value we will be conservative in deducting the full market values Lastly we will divide the enterprise value by average 2021 1Q shares outstanding 1 Base Case Scenario 50 likelihood assumes that coal pricing returns to 2019 levels over the next 12 months allowing Peabody to generate run rate EBITDA of 850 900 million which gives 8 per share 35 upside 2 Upside Scenario 25 likelihood assumes that the tailwinds prove powerful enough to return coal pricing to 2018 levels allowing Peabody to generate run rate EBITDA of 1 3 1 4 billion which gives 20 40 350 700 upside 3 Downside Scenario 25 likelihood assumes that the aforementioned tailwinds fizzle out and coal pricing plummets back to 2020 levels which would imply run rate EBITDA of less than 300 million which gives 0 Given these estimates we can infer that at its current price of between 5 69 per share Peabody is undervalued by almost 100 Forecasted price 8 50 30 25 0 25 11 5 vs current price of 5 6 Bu more importantly if coal pricing can return to 2018 levels which is extremely possible given the powerful tailwinds outlined above Peabody s stock would potentially be more than a 5 bagger from current prices amp

the many forces of society the advancement of technology is one that is truly unstoppable From how we obtain information to how people communicate from a distance technology has changed the way people live their lives The service providers of our everyday lives are consistently looking for ways to automate amp improve their offerings operations This created a market and demand for Amdocs Limited Nasdaq DOX a technology and software product service such as consulting provider that serves companies in communications media finance entertainment digital etc Company Overview Established in 1982 In Israel Amdocs Limited is a multinational software company headquartered in Missouri US For 40 years Amdocs has been offering advanced software products and related technology services to optimize their clients operations With 26 000 employees Amdocs is currently in business with 350 service providers in more than 80 countries Their clientele comprised of leaders in a wide range of industries telecom giants AT amp T amp Bell financial institutions like HSBC and general crowd favorites such as Amazon 7Eleven and Microsoft Most of Amdocs offerings are provided within amdocsONE a comprehensive collection of products services consisting of Digital Experience amp Monetization Media amp Digital Services Enterprise amp Connected Society Open Cloud Networks amp NGOSS Services amp Hybrid Operations Technology amp Practices Driven Innovation With its cloud native modular and open offerings Amdocs helps clients smoothly and fully transition into tech automated digital operations In such a demanded market with high ticket clients Amdocs recorded 4 16B in revenue during FY2020 ended September 30th 2020 at a 33 9 Gross Margin 19 EBITDA Margin and 11 9 Net Profit Margin DOX also has consistently growing Operating Cash Flow recording 910 7M in the Last Twelve Months ending in December of 2020 Yes everything seems to be working out well for DOX but that brings up the question is there still room to grow or has DOX plateaued making it a safe bet but not a high return investment Capital Structure amp Shareholders Breakdown A quick look at Amdocs capital structure 22 Debt 77 1 Common Equity 0 9 Minority Interest What is important to point out here is that DOX has recorded 0 in debt for 3 straight years from FY2017 19 This is a very uncommon occurrence for a company to be 0 leveraged In contrast most of its competitors are operating around the 15 25 debt total capital ratio comparable companies like Akamai Technologies recording 40 leverage in its capital structure When it comes the shareholders of DOX most of its outstanding shares are owned by institutional holders Traditional portfolio managers such as asset manager firms are the biggest investors with FMR LLC as the largest holder The large scale and consistent holds amp buys asset management investment shows street professionals see DOX as a profitable stable investment Looking Long Overall I believe DOX shows potential at a hold buy for long positions if you are looking to invest in an undervalued but experienced amp matured company The following are three main theses behind a long investment in DOX Strong amp Consistent Financial Performance As an established company we are seeing highly predictable topline growth rate with consistent profit margins Although these no longer large scale increases we would see on a growing tech company DOX s consistency and strong performance is definitely a supporting factor when it comes to investment In more detail DOX has a 2 9 top line 5 year CAGR as of December 31st 2020 with corresponding 3 3 6 and 10 4 5 year CAGR with EBITDA EBIT and Net Income respectively Although top line growth was contracting a few years prior it has rebounded between 2015 20 which could be contributed to the increasing number of companies transitioning into digital operations cloud systems Nevertheless the higher and increasing bottom line CAGRs means the company is still consistently increasing its profit margins it is important to point out in that 5Y Net Income CAGR as of Dec 31st 2020 is significantly higher than previous years which were around 2 2 5 3 DOX also has a strong cash flow largely due to steady increases in operating cash flow The OP cash flow is the best indicator here as unlevered free cash flow has seen some small scale turbulence in recent years due to M amp As such as the acquisition of Openet Telecom Juganu Ltd and Veego during CY2020 Overall DOX is a strong investment from the financial perspective due to its margin growth and consistency Deep Product Portfolio with Wide Coverage Through amdocsONE Amdocs is able to provide a full suite of comprehensive products services that covers every stage of digital transformation From cutting 80 of time to market when utilizing Amdocs bundle offers to continuous operational support and open tools cloud platforms clients receive a thorough service when working with Amdocs Within the six main categories of offerings mention above Digital Experience amp Monetization Media amp Digital Services Enterprise amp Connected Society Open Cloud Networks amp NGOSS Services amp Hybrid Operations Technology amp Practices Driven Innovation there are numerous individual products that allows users to customize their usage of the Amdocs platform and offerings For example CES20 is Amdocs cloud based customer experience suite Within CES20 there are 4 products that helps automate and digitize the users operations DigitalONE CatalogONE RevenueONE and Service amp Network Automation DigitalONE is a cloud based system that allows users to work on their branding and customer experience CatalogONE is an open cloud platform catalog solution that allows users to launch new products easily with a detailed user interface RevenueONE is a platform that allows users to scale or acquire new revenue stream while limiting the cost of acquisition Last Service amp network Automation is a branch covered by amdocsNEO AmdocsNEO is a service amp network automation platform that offers a wide range of tracking and management capabilities It is used to drive and control the fast automation process of the company The CES20 is just an example of how Amdocs products are often interconnected and deeply comprehensive They also offer certain platforms or products services that are industry specific The wide coverage of the Amdocs offerings means they can gain market penetration across numerous industries At the same time the stage specific offerings allow Amdocs to stay in demand and relevant as clients transition and grow This plays a huge part into client retainment Last the continuous innovation initiatives at Amdocs supports an investment as it shows the company is consistently trying to grow and improve itself As a tech company it is extremely dangerous to slack off on innovation which is often seen with tech firms that reaches a consistent profit margin Being in the tech industry means you live and die by the creativity and uniqueness of the offerings Amdocs is consistently investing 20 of their gross profit into R amp D This shows the company s dedication to innovation which ensures that it will remain in demand in the future Extremely Low Leverage The last thesis is quite a short and simple one the low leverage of the company means reduced risks and limits debt related expenses such as interest principal payments which in turn increases their profitability As mentioned above there has be several years where the company literally at 0 in debt During FY2020 the company took on 1B worth of debt which could mean they are preparing for large scale development as from a financial standpoint they are not in a situation where taking the extra cash is worth the liability With that being said the new debt is only 22 of the company s overall capital structure and they will have no problem paying off the related fees as they have a strong track record of positive cash flow Macro Market Trends The overall demand for digital automation transformation operations creates numerous trends that can positively impact the future of DOX With the COVID 19 pandemic company were pushed by the circumstances to digitize their operations which will expand the market as well as create higher demand for the future Here are some top trends that will impact DOX s performance Overall Growth of the SaaS Market has been consistent growth in the past decade in the SaaS market This is driven by multiple factors including the automation of internal control enterprise centre processing system as well as the boom of 5G and cloud based services Looking into the future for the period of 2019 23 the worldwide SaaS market is expected to reach a 60 36B valuation recording a 9 CAGR over that period Lasting Impacts of COVID 19 The pandemic has already significantly accelerated the digitization rate due to the lockdowns and remote working environments This is not a one time catalyst but rather a preview of what was going to happen in the future regardless the pandemic situation has simply brought the future quicker Going cloud or digitizing is not a temporary decision this means the market has permanently expanded and will continue to grow as demand increases 5G Penetration amp Advancements Continuous developments in 5G technology will impact the SaaS industry in two ways 1 It will increase the accessibility of cloud platforms and related services thus increasing demand 2 It will improve the quality and range of capabilities for the products services of software companies In the modern society it seems like life is limited if you have bad Wi Fi connection That is emphasized in the world of SaaS Broader bandwidth and connection qualities will incentivize potential customers to digitalise and help service providers create higher quality products Financials and Valuations When it comes to the fair valuation of Amdocs Limited DOX I used both comparable companies and intrinsic valuations then weighted the price outcomes for the final target price Instead I evaluated the company using a basic comparable analysis The companies included in the comparable universe are Akamai Technologies Inc AKAM Ciena Corporation CIEN Citrix Systems CTXS Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp CTSH and Perspecta Inc PRSP The DCF valuation is relative crude with simple margin and top line forecasts but the results seem very reasonable and in line with street estimates Risks To finish off this analysis on DOX there are a few key risks to keep in mind Cyber Security Although moving operations towards cloud or digital platforms will increase efficiency and limit costs it does come with security risks By nature of public integrated and or connected cloud platforms or enterprise central systems a large quantity of information can be easily accessed in one spot Although that makes operations easier it also increases the impact of hacks or other cyber security concerns In these interconnected platforms large amounts of information are at risks once the first door is opened Hackers no longer need to crack multiple systems to acquire different information such as customer information and financials If Amdocs gets hacked it will likely be very detrimental to the company as large quantity of information will be exposed Limited Innovation or Growth due to Lack of 5G or Internet Penetration For Amdocs and the entire SaaS industry poor internet infrastructure will limit growth potential and market penetration If 5G usage and general internet coverage does not match the rate of innovation of Amdocs revenue growth will stall which might impact the pricing of the stock It will also limit the room for innovation and enhancement which allows more time for competitors to grow within the current infrastructure and increase the competition In the End Buy Hold or Sell Overall I think Amdocs Limited DOX is currently undervalued In general the street has a buy or hold buy valuation on the current price which I do agree with Therefore my final thoughts on DOX are Buy for long term value investment The stock might be somewhat volatile in the short term but its long term value will be consistent Hold Sell if an investment return is already realized The economy and overall market is kind of inflated as we recover from the pandemic therefore a potential cash out is definitely tangible as rumours of stock market crash spreads TLDR An undervalued technology solution and service provider in a growing market with 0 debt and an upside of at least 25 Original analysis can be found here https info utradea com idea 60997b509f45b0081495db90

platform and offerings For example CES20 is Amdocs cloud based customer experience suite Within CES20 there are 4 products that helps automate and digitize the users operations DigitalONE CatalogONE RevenueONE and Service amp Network Automation DigitalONE is a cloud based system that allows users to work on their branding and customer experience CatalogONE is an open cloud platform catalog solution that allows users to launch new products easily with a detailed user interface RevenueONE is a platform that allows users to scale or acquire new revenue stream while limiting the cost of acquisition Last Service amp network Automation is a branch covered by amdocsNEO AmdocsNEO is a service amp network automation platform that offers a wide range of tracking and management capabilities It is used to drive and control the fast automation process of the company The CES20 is just an example of how Amdocs products are often interconnected and deeply comprehensive They also offer certain platforms or products services that are industry specific The wide coverage of the Amdocs offerings means they can gain market penetration across numerous industries At the same time the stage specific offerings allow Amdocs to stay in demand and relevant as clients transition and grow This plays a huge part into client retainment Last the continuous innovation initiatives at Amdocs supports an investment as it shows the company is consistently trying to grow and improve itself As a tech company it is extremely dangerous to slack off on innovation which is often seen with tech firms that reaches a consistent profit margin Being in the tech industry means you live and die by the creativity and uniqueness of the offerings Amdocs is consistently investing 20 of their gross profit into R amp D This shows the company s dedication to innovation which ensures that it will remain in demand in the future Extremely Low Leverage The last thesis is quite a short and simple one the low leverage of the company means reduced risks and limits debt related expenses such as interest principal payments which in turn increases their profitability As mentioned above there has be several years where the company literally at 0 in debt During FY2020 the company took on 1B worth of debt which could mean they are preparing for large scale development as from a financial standpoint they are not in a situation where taking the extra cash is worth the liability With that being said the new debt is only 22 of the company s overall capital structure and they will have no problem paying off the related fees as they have a strong track record of positive cash flow Macro Market Trends The overall demand for digital automation transformation operations creates numerous trends that can positively impact the future of DOX With the COVID 19 pandemic company were pushed by the circumstances to digitize their operations which will expand the market as well as create higher demand for the future Here are some top trends that will impact DOX s performance Overall Growth of the SaaS Market has been consistent growth in the past decade in the SaaS market This is driven by multiple factors including the automation of internal control enterprise centre processing system as well as the boom of 5G and cloud based services Looking into the future for the period of 2019 23 the worldwide SaaS market is expected to reach a 60 36B valuation recording a 9 CAGR over that period https preview redd it re0rwefjhhy61 png width 581 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3e03058110bfbf707b168afd09bdda586914a7db Lasting Impacts of COVID 19 The pandemic has already significantly accelerated the digitization rate due to the lockdowns and remote working environments This is not a one time catalyst but rather a preview of what was going to happen in the future regardless the pandemic situation has simply brought the future quicker Going cloud or digitizing is not a temporary decision this means the market has permanently expanded and will continue to grow as demand increases https preview redd it 78jymbukhhy61 png width 601 amp format png amp auto webp amp s d0362d3fb6c918222d0ffb49fff1132dadea2686 5G Penetration amp Advancements Continuous developments in 5G technology will impact the SaaS industry in two ways 1 It will increase the accessibility of cloud platforms and related services thus increasing demand 2 It will improve the quality and range of capabilities for the products services of software companies https preview redd it zcswsxwlhhy61 png width 580 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f3c6560ebdcf519a5bbed1bdc42acc3c298571bc In the modern society it seems like life is limited if you have bad Wi Fi connection That is emphasized in the world of SaaS Broader bandwidth and connection qualities will incentivize potential customers to digitalise and help service providers create higher quality products Financials and Valuations When it comes to the fair valuation of Amdocs Limited DOX I used both comparable companies and intrinsic valuations then weighted the price outcomes for the final target price Instead I evaluated the company using a basic comparable analysis The companies included in the comparable universe are Akamai Technologies Inc AKAM Ciena Corporation CIEN Citrix Systems CTXS Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp CTSH and Perspecta Inc PRSP The DCF valuation is relative crude with simple margin and top line forecasts but the results seem very reasonable and in line with street estimates Risks To finish off this analysis on DOX there are a few key risks to keep in mind Cyber Security Although moving operations towards cloud or digital platforms will increase efficiency and limit costs it does come with security risks By nature of public integrated and or connected cloud platforms or enterprise central systems a large quantity of information can be easily accessed in one spot Although that makes operations easier it also increases the impact of hacks or other cyber security concerns In these interconnected platforms large amounts of information are at risks once the first door is opened Hackers no longer need to crack multiple systems to acquire different information such as customer information and financials If Amdocs gets hacked it will likely be very detrimental to the company as large quantity of information will be exposed Limited Innovation or Growth due to Lack of 5G or Internet Penetration For Amdocs and the entire SaaS industry poor internet infrastructure will limit growth potential and market penetration If 5G usage and general internet coverage does not match the rate of innovation of Amdocs revenue growth will stall which might impact the pricing of the stock It will also limit the room for innovation and enhancement which allows more time for competitors to grow within the current infrastructure and increase the competition In the End Buy Hold or Sell Overall I think Amdocs Limited DOX is currently undervalued In general the street has a buy or hold buy valuation on the current price which I do agree with Therefore my final thoughts on DOX are Buy for long term value investment The stock might be somewhat volatile in the short term but its long term value will be consistent Hold Sell if an investment return is already realized The economy and overall market is kind of inflated as we recover from the pandemic therefore a potential cash out is definitely tangible as rumours of stock market crash spreads TLDR An undervalued technology solution and service provider in a growing market with 0 debt and an upside of at least 25 Original analysis can be found here https info utradea com idea 60997b509f45b0081495db90

Earnings Call ,Righty o This is my final DD on the stock I m going to continue purchasing more and more shares selling way OTM covered calls to be able to buy even more shares up until such a point as my cost basis is below the share price My average being roughly 7 5 right now or the share price nets me a dividend yield below 5 5 I m currently wholly allocated to this and that s why while it would be attractive at a 3 or 4 yield I m not going to keep continuously purchasing it After a certain threshold is reached in regards to the share price I ll just use the premium on covered calls and the dividend as a backboard to purchase other securities at that point in time Considering any shares I buy at 6 38 will net me a dividend yield of 6 26 yield and the premiums on monthly options that are at 7 5 10 can range from 40 cents to 13 cents for that month for May 21 I m well capitalized to receive a minimum 15 20 annual interest on this stock while ensuring significant upside protection in that if my covered calls are exercised they would be exercised at a significant premium to my average cost basis T Stock currently has a 6 4 dividend yield Look at it s balance sheet Look at UWMC s Then look back at T s You ll understand why it s considerably safer to park your money in UWMC The Payout Ratio for T stock also takes up the majority of earnings per share and by a strong degree whereas UWMC by dint of its Class A dividend shares only being 1 16th of the shares has a dividend payout ratio that is essentially nothing at 41 5 million dollars a year Add to the fact that UWMC has just declared a 300 million share buyback when the public float is equivalent to 693 000 000 and you see why I think things are going to change by dint of the fact the company is flat out going to be able to buy 43 2 of the float of exactly 110 million shares Considering that the dividend is over 6 2 while their senior notes have interest payments of 5 5 It makes complete sense for them to immediately start doing buybacks starting today which is the day they are allowed to start Here are some of my thoughts after reading the earnings report please be aware that this was with the share price at roughly 6 5 The Earnings Report was a decidedly mixed bag and there s no two ways about it Here are some of my thoughts that are additional 1 The 49 1B in origination was a whiff as they guided for 52 57B in originations Gain on sale fell right in the middle ish which was fine I was right to guide for a little less or roughly 1B in net income and if the salaries commissions and benefits hadn t increased exponentially 123 624 million they would have met right around 1B at 983 624 000 2 I like they are guiding up as opposed to everyone else for Q2 and considering their miss for Q1 I feel they may even be being conservative so as to not disappoint again One thing I didn t like was that their gain on sale margin was expected to be 75 1 1 for Q2 but one part of that may be that they have an in house jumbo program where they retain servicing which might compress margin With that said there is definitely a pricing war going on and as the CEO of LDI said we don t know when that ll end but as he stated no one likes to sell something for ninety cents on the dollar and we can expect higher margins when the pricing war cools Please note RKT s wholesale margin is expected to be 1 3 I like that they are investing in Continued investment into machine learning and Robotic Process Automation RPA to further advance our operational excellence while driving down costs Margin expansion is key especially since they already have a margin advantage 4 I like that they have Continued to invest in our technology platform and on site teams resulting in additional operational efficiencies focused on reducing costs reducing closing times and increasing loan processing speed since again margin advantage I also like reduced closing and loan processing speeds 5 I like that Our continued investments in the cloud as well as technologies that increase Underwriting efficiency such as Automated Document Recognition and Optical Character Recognition have strengthened our technology advantage while driving greater efficiency and reducing both fixed and variable costs Ditto with everything else 6 Their jumbo and government portion of both refinance and purchase are extremely low relative to Q1 2020 because they only turned the spigot back on them the latter part of March This is probably why it s so low and why they are guiding up Remember the gain on sale margin for government loans are smaller than conventional though so that might help explain some of the margin compression This should also help them Q3 and Q4 7 The seasonally adjusted annual homebuilding rate is at over 1 7 million home as April There is a 4 million home backlog and to keep up with demand home builders need to build 1 2 million homes a year It needs to be more than 1 2 million to start reducing the backlog 8 RKT s share price was roughly 20 dollars when it announced its 1 billion dollar buyback and had a market cap of 40 billion at the time UWMC s market cap is roughly 10 8B So it s market cap is exactly 27 what RKT s was at the time of the buyback But the share buyback is 30 of RKT s So there is more bang for buck Additionally there was a 1 1B special dividend of 1 1B which equated to roughly 5 5 at 20 dollars The current annual yield on UWMC is over 6 What s more doing share buyback will increase EPS net income cash flow and the balance sheet as opposed to RKT where it will only help EPS Therefore there is strong upside to be had at this price point 9 I like that their highest expense employees is variable and stands at above 2 3rds of their expenses since it s easy to downsize in times of hardship or they can choose to maintain staffing levels but not replace people to leave for a natural deceleration of income 10 RKT is expecting closed loan volume of between 82 5 to 87 5B That s a sharp decrease in origination volume of between 15 5 and 20 3 This is an strong indication that the UWMC ultimatum knee capped them Please remember that the UWMC Ultimatum deadline was March 15 and Q1 is for the period ended March 31 for RKT Please note that the Partner Channel isn t just wholesale broker s as they also lump other things in there like their correspondent referral channel there I also found the 7 5 increase from 37 and something to 40 billion from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 to be quite small regardless but Q2 makes clear you can expect downward guidance on their Wholesale channel Now while UWMC may have won the wholesale volume war it s paying a price The entire wholesale channel is While rates rising means a lower gain on sale margin the pricing wars are cutting deep into gain on sale margin to With that said there is eventually going to be rationality as this cannot go on forever No one likes to sell something for ninety cents when they can sell it for a dollar So I call the gain on sale margin variable in essence Finally I expect investments to bear fruit and increase margin offsetting some of the pricing wars affect on GOS for both sides to be fair 11 I m revising my expectations of 2 2 5 Billion dollars a year in net income to roughly 1 5 2 25 Billion and I am being very conservative on the low end I am calculating roughly 500 million in net income for Q2 2021 to be somewhat conservative The way I am coming to that conclusion is by calculating a 49 1B origination for Q2 even though they are guiding for 51 55B and considering the embarrassment of the whiff and the new products they have on offer to increase capacity I believe them to be conservative I am also assuming a 75 basis point margin on gain on sale which is a touch more than 34 of the margin for Q1 2021 Under these presumptions they would be making 368 035 000 in loan production income I am going to flat out live in delusion land and assume that Mortgage Servicing Income remains the same at 115 205 000 after accounting for the fact that mortgage servicing income minus change in fair value plus gain on sale and interest income equals that That totals revenue of 483 240 000 I am going to assume the absolute worst and assume that they don t compress their expenses whatsoever and so their expenses will tally 317 000 000 Thus their net income will be 166 240 000 I won t place the income tax because UWMC s net income for periods prior to the first quarter of 2021 does not reflect an income tax provision since UWM UWMC s accounting predecessor is a pass through entity not subject to federal and most state income taxes For periods commencing with the first quarter of 2021 UWMC s net income does not reflect the income tax provision that would otherwise be reflected if 100 of the economic interest in UWM was owned by UWMC Therefore for comparison purposes UWMC provides Adjusted net income which is our pre tax income adjusted for a 23 78 estimated effective tax rate Adjusted net income is a Non GAAP Metric If one looks at the net income attributable to UWMC on the cash flow statement and then divides by the provision for income taxes then that is an effective tax rate of 26 8 for roughly 5 7 of the float which is roughly the 6 percent of free float What I am trying to say is that we only pay net income on the 6 of free float that is the Class A public float The adjusted net income would be if the entirety of the company was taxed which it isn t so disregard adjusted net income as it s not GAAP We ll assume a 25 percent haircut to income tax as a result though it would be a higher haircut I m just lazy which would give taxes of 9 664 After accounting for federal and state taxes the new net income would be 166 230 336 Net income and thus EPS is pre dividend income but let s count the dividend before EPS and count it as part of net income for a truly catastrophic scenario So let s assume no share buybacks occurred worst case scenario we d then remove 10 310 420 5 10 103 104 205 The new net income after accounting for dividends is 155 919 916 Please note that in accounting you don t calculate the net income by putting the dividend as a expense I m just doing this to give you guys an absolute shit tier scenario with revenue misses no mortgage servicing rights increases and thus no mortgage servicing income and interest increases no margin gain expenses that do not decrease a bit more tax than they d actually pay no shares bought back and dividends as an expense and thus weigh down on net income and thus EPS I did not count the interest expense on the new 700 million senior notes however But it should come to roughly 31 million The EPS would be 097 so round it to ten cents Account for the same EPS for Q3 and Q4 You get 30 cents This is 30 cents without the dividend payout ratio since the dividend is already accounted for We ll not include Q1 The dividend of 40 cents alone will net you a p e ratio of 16 175 The actual EPS for you as a class A shareholder would be 70 cents for the period Q2 to Q4 That would translate to a P E ratio of 9 24 If you count the EPS of Q1 which is Earnings per share of 47 then the FY 2021 EPS would be 70 and the P E ratio would be 8 64 But if you count the dividend of 40 in addition to the EPS then it becomes 1 17 and the P E ratio becomes 5 52 The only reason I count the dividend is because the dividend payout ratio is literally 006 10 06 006 per quarter However you re still getting ten cents a quarter on a stock that is 6 47 while retaining your economic interest in the company itself which is adding roughly 77 cents in EPS FY 2021 under a catastrophic failure of epic proportions scenario

only lose money when I invest 3 UWMC is the first company I went YOLO on so that says everything you need to know about me as an investor 4 This doesn t discuss their earnings Here we we go Cyclical vs Growth Cyclical companies are companies that are commonly referred to as value companies This means they trade at relatively low P E ratios in comparison to growth companies Sound familiar This is because their TAM Total Addressable Market is well defined and fluctuates with the economy or other macro conditions outside of the companies control Cyclical companies will trade at low P E s in boom conditions and higher P E s in slow down conditions A natural outcome of investors understanding of what is causing the growth and decline in earnings UWMC is in a cyclical industry Mortgages are a mature market that is defined by the economy and interest rates UWMC has no control of either It just went through the best macro environment ever for refi s and 77 of its revenue is directly tied to this incredibly rate sensitive product This is why its P E is so low right now and may even trend lower But is UWMC a cyclical stock I ll revisit later Interest Rates As mentioned above UWMC just went through the best revenue opportunity ever presented by the Fed There is still a large refi market available but math tells us as rates stay low or raise it will dry up quickly As interest rates rise that might shrink the mortgage market and offset any potential gains from the loans being worth more Unless rates continue to trend lower this will create a significant headwind to UWMC s earnings SPAC It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently It is very reasonable to assume UWMC is a part of that softening It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded Lots of other nice places to put institutional money Short Interest Fixation on short interest seems dumb to me If you invested in UWMC in hopes of catching a short squeeze you should hop out now If you have made it this far perhaps you understand there are perfectly logical reasons for UWMC to trade so cheaply in regards to P E I don t think a conspiracy theory about price manipulation is the most logical conclusion but maybe So why invest in UWMC What s above is kind of my bearish information on UWMC These are the reasons I invested in the stock 1 Founder ish Mat Ishbia is the 1 reason to invest in this company Do you trust him Do you consider him a talented and driven executive Can he make good long term decisions to grow the company and the brand To me the answer is yes There are a lot of threats facing UWMC particularly and every company generally Mat is a guy who has taken a company from 15 to 8 000 Do I expect that trend to stop here No I don t There may be some bumps but I consider him a talented executive and a winner He may have to pivot the company into other loan products like RKT has but hopefully he will navigate that well He just can t let the company stagnate He has a track record to prove he ll grow responsibility and consistently 2 Brokerage Channel Is the brokerage channel the best way to get a mortgage Can UWMC grow the channel AND their strength in that channel Can they educate consumers about the best way to get a mortgage To me the answer is yes I had a Rocket Mortgage and hate them as a company They call incessantly Talk down to you when you don t take their advice Rarely friendly and only helpful in origination I tried to refi with them anyway just cause I thought it would be easy Ended up going with an independent loan officer who educated me on the process and was a dream to work with The loan officer saved me 4k and tailored a solution to me needs that Rocket COULDN t have done Remember the mortgage market is mature so the only way to get a higher P E from the market is to take market share This isn t a rising tide lifts all boats trade For UWMC to grow market cap it has to shrink RKT JPMorgan Wells Fargo s mortgage market share 3 Publicity One reason that Mat went public was a marketing move He gets to tell investors about how the brokerage channel is the fastest cheapest and best way to get a mortgage Does this hit revenue in the long term Does this help UWMC increase mortgage market share To me the answer is yes 4 Growth This is the summation of my first three points UWMC is trading as a cyclical stock but perhaps it is a growth stock I m investing because I do believe it will overtake RKT as the 1 mortgage provider in America As it shows in earnings over time that it is increasing market share the stock market will reward it with a higher P E 5 Dividend I don t go out of my way to find a dividend stock but UWMC does some unique to me in that it can pay a high dividend on Class A shares while not messing up the balance sheet It is currently at 5 8 which is plenty I m just hoping for a modest bump every year in dividend pay No specials please TL DR UWMC is trading as a cyclical company but may prove to the stock market to be a growth company We are investing on the brokerage channel and Mat Ishbia to pull market share away from the other top mortgage originators This is the only way to grow market cap as the TAM of refi and originations will almost assuredly decrease in the next few years Position in UWMC 7 000 shares amp 7 42 and calls expiring on May 21

steps away from becoming Skynet , First of all let s take a look at PLTR s Q1 financial performance Total revenue grew 49 year over year to 341 million US commercial revenue grew 72 year over year US government revenue grew 83 year over year Cash flow from operations of 117 million up 404 million year over year and representing a 34 margin Adjusted free cash flow of 151 million up 441 million year over year and representing a 44 margin GAAP net loss per share diluted of 0 07 Adjusted earnings per share diluted of 0 04 Cash and cash equivalents 2 3 billion The company managed to pay almost all of its outstanding long term debt These numbers look amazing especially when you take into account the fact that as the management stated numerous times on the earnings call the company is just starting to expand and acquire new customers Many people think of Palantir as this old mature company that is still unprofitable and with limited growth opportunities The thing is that despite being 17 years old Palantir is just starting to get recognition on the world stage They spent years just developing their software and investing heavily into R and D over 2 billion dollars Foundry was launched in 2018 and already is experiencing very high levels of adoption despite the fact that it is a very complex and expensive software It is way easier to grow your revenue and acquire new customers on a quarter basis when you are selling cheap and rather simple software solutions not a complete OS for businesses PLTR is also just starting to build a proper sales team more than 50 new salespeople hired in this quarter alone and partnering with organizations like IBM that can pinch their soft to potential customers The only slightly negative thing is the fact that currently their european commercial business growth is lacking behind the U S one but it is mostly because european economic recovery from the Covid pandemic is way slower They still managed to close some deals and on the earnings call announcead a new client in Peugeot Also the Covid crisis definitely helped PLTR in a way but this does not mean that we should expect a slower growth rate in the future but qute the opposite For example video game manufacturers experienced huge growth during the pandemic because people stayed at home and had nothing better to do but that would not be the case in the future On the other hand the pandemic helped companies to realise how important is for them to be able to make sense of their large databases of unfiltered information and make better informed decisions to protect their operations from future geopolitical or macro economic events Palantir is also well positioned to increase their revenue significantly in the government sector due to the fact that their Gotham software proved its worth throughout the years and they just started their AI based Appolo software The Biden admin will apparently invest billions in AI technologies in the coming years I would not dive deep into other financial metrics cuz this DD will become too large but their margins are insane cost of revenue grew way way less than actual revenue adjusted free cash flow is now positive insane growth also wink wink to all analyst who use DCF and PLTR somehow managed to expand its business operations while at the same time increasing their cash at hand and having almost non existent debt Let s adress some retail investors worries now WSB and r PLTR are constantly complaining about the high amounts of SBC the employees receive They of course talked about this on the earnings call and the CFO said that the SBC will normalise in the future very common for growth companies but they will still give SBC to employess to align their personal interest with interest of the company also very common especially for soft companies and to have more cash for expansion and future investments Also they said that Alex Karp is selling shares for tax purposes and he plans to continue being one of the biggest shareholders in the future A lot of people also complain about the fact that the management does not believe in the company Karp told me to sell my shares The truth is that their believe is actually a bit cult like Management again stated that they are convinced of the fact that PLTR will become the most important software company in the future and they even literally said that they are a few steps away form becoming Skynet Furthermore they invested in Lillium and Sarcos robotics cuz they think that it is an incredible opportunity for an innovative startup to use Foundry from ground zero and not waste years of its development having to deal with data silos and so on When talking specifically about Sarcos they said that their are vision for Foundry is to become a digital IronMan suit and Sarcos is trying to build a physical IronMan suit and they want to combine their efforts Yes that is right Management thinks that their software is so good that instead of just selling it to other companies they can just invest in startups give their soft for free and reap even bigger rewards in the future Another interesting thing we learned from the conference call is that PLTR accepts the currency that rhymes with groin as a form of payment Investing in PLTR is giving you some indirect exposure to the forbidden word market In conclusion I want to say that my personal opinion is that PLTR s fundamentals actually became better and as Jeff Bezos said the stock price does not always reflect the state of the company correctly If you did not FOMO into PLTR expecting it to moon immediatly it is probably better to just wait and stick to your conviction that the company s financials will justify its generous valuation in the coming years

2020 was not enough to meet the strong demand This year we have modified our planning and allocation on products like grills and water sports to support additional sales compared to their normal trend line As we begin 2021 we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong results because of our incredible team the continued development of our key initiatives and the stronger deeper relationships we have built with our customers The company is providing the following estimate for fiscal 2021 Comparable sales are forecast to range from up 2 to down 2 This is an 18 to 14 increase on a two year stacked basis Okay great so people bought a lot of workout equipment Who cares What you semen suckers fail to understand is that some guys were able to find a woman that is attracted to them in a way that they will ACTUALLY have sex with them and sometimes that results in kids Those kids have been at home all fucking year and their parents want them out of the house so they can boink on the kitchen table again Ding ding those rusty gears in your seemingly empty head are starting to grind Yes wow vaccines are starting to become mainstream and everybody is pent up at home with their crotch goblins Enter every single recreational sport available Beyond boosts in kids sports equipment that we will probably see this part of my DD is literally just my personal social media feed where everybody on Facebook and Instagram is doing anything in their power to get the kids out of the house and bragging about it we are obviously going into outdoor season That means camping vacations swimming and other things people with active and healthy lifestyles do Academy Sports has it all Tents grills coolers clothing swimsuits fishing gear canoes sleeping bags Do me a favor walk into an Academy Sports store and look at the demand for yourself I obviously expect that Academy Sports will continue to exceed expectations and I am not the only one Show me another stock with a 100 buy rating https www marketbeat com stocks NASDAQ ASO price target and if you re too lazy type in ASO on Robinhood and look for yourself Now I m going to get into the most interesting part ASO has a 100 buy rating from 8 different analysts blew away earnings during a pandemic and has amazing financials and a healthy balance sheet It s kind of weird that it is 9th on the most shorted stock list https www marketwatch com tools screener short interest when every other company on that list looks like it could use some adrenaline shots or life support ASO was previously the most shorted stock on the market a few weeks ago If I had a guess it looks like shorters realized they shorted a company that didn t deserve to be and they want to cover before wallstreetbets gets a sniff of it Oops it s too late now Dick s Sporting Goods is trading at a PE ratio of 14 and has a short interest of 16 https fintel io ss us dks Academy Sports is sitting at an SI of 33 62 and a PE ratio of 8 Seems a little bit fishy to me and smells like a ripe vagina is wafting the room What could these large funds know that we don t Hmmm let s try nothing and the fact that they were hoping to capitalize on another seemingly Covid ravaged retailer Does this remind you of anything else I am not going to sell this to you as a short squeeze because those only happen when you have a very tight float on a company where buyers start jumping in droves while short sellers are already underwater in their positions Also interesting because at the end of March it went from around 24 50 to around 32 00 and the price hasn t gone below 28 39 Also of note the average 10 day trading volume for ASO is 1 584M The entire float is 40 436 703 https www marketwatch com tools screener short interest shares with 33 62 of the float shorted leaves you 13 594 583 shares short That gives you 9 days to cover with average volume if they did nothing but buy and were the only ones doing so Do what you will with that information or go do the math yourself To me it looks like some retards with a lot of capital put themselves in another bad situation Most recent rating from a JP Morgan analyst moves it from 32 to 35 If you re comparing companies in the same sector who would you prefer to make your long AND short bets on Operating income of Academy Sports at 129M in 2019 222M in 2020 and 424M in 2021 with a smaller PE ratio or Dick s with 445M in 2019 409M in 2020 or 741M in 2021 and a PE ratio twice that of the former I already know you little ringholes get mad when you see a DD on a stock only after it s up 150 for the week but this is one of those times when this post was made while the stock is down 3 for the week and up 10 for the month I do also want to give some credit to u XionTG https www reddit com u XionTG
