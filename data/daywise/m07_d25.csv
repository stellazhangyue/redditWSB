education stocks took a beating last Friday on rumor of non profit conversion Now the official regulation is out http m news cctv com 2021 07 24 ARTITWxyXnCQlhkq7XY0d21j210724 shtml http m news cctv com 2021 07 24 ARTITWxyXnCQlhkq7XY0d21j210724 shtml amp x200B For New Oriental Education my idea is BUY at the current price of 3 intrinsic value is about 4 5 for a 33 to 66 return in 3 6 months amp x200B Rationale The new regulation mentions a few things that are unfavorable to EDU 1 K9 core Chinese Math Sciences etc will be not for profit Rolling out in major cities like Beijing and gradually rolled out across the country with fees to be set by the government For EDU the profit margin of these will be 0 2 No weekend holiday tutoring of any kind Online tutoring is to be restricted in 30 min intervals 3 No tutoring on topics that s too advanced for the student meaning a grade 6 student cannot do k11 materials 4 No new tutoring companies can raise capital on the stock market via IPO 5 Existing public tutoring companies like EDU cannot acquire other tutoring companies 6 Foreign capital cannot acquire chinese tutoring companies through M amp A VIEs etc This applies both in the context of a controlling interest AND general share interest The question is EDU is trading at 3 share Ignoring 6 above what is the intrinsic value if EDU spins out the K9 core piece of business into a separate entity that s non profit What s the remaining worth To assess this I took EDU s FY2020 revenue breakdown to see how much revenue is left then applied an EBITDA multiple finally backed out the net debt to get the per share price Revenue Breakdown Overseas Test Prep 12 pre 12 post no impact U CAN Secondary School 45 pre 22 25 post cut by half since this includes k7 to k12 assume k7 to k9 is non profit at a 50 50 split In reality this mix is overweight k10 k12 since tutoring mostly done by highschool students for the university exam this is a conservative assumption on my part POP Kids 24 pre 0 post assume all not for profit Music and Sports courses are likely able to keep but assume not material Online 4 pre 1 post assume online restrictions will have significant impact Other courses 5 pre 5 post no impact Books 10 pre 10 post Overall revenue reduced by about 50 Valuation Let s use the 2020 annual revenue of 3 5 billion USD as a rough estimate Reducing by half is 1 75BN x 15 EBITDA margin is about 262 million At a 10x multiple implying a 5 annual growth rate at 15 WACC gives us 2 2BN enterprise value Current total debt is 2 billion cash is 6 billion We have 4 billion excess cash Share count is 1714 million Per share value of the cash only is about 2 4 share Per share value of the business is 1 3 share Implied value is about 3 7 share Oversold it seems amp x200B Now onto the last piece Foreign capital cannot acquire chinese entities Here is the quote Google translate Foreign capital may not control or participate in academic training institutions through mergers and acquisitions entrusted operations franchise chains and the use of variable interest entities Those who have violated regulations shall be cleaned up and rectified Better translation Foreign capital cannot gain controlling non controlling interest in tutoring companies through the four ways outlined and other ways as applicable but the pt is cannot control amp participate via share ownership This entire sentence is to limit control of foreign capital on chinese tutoring companies But the fact the chinese government explicitly listed those 4 ways to gain controlling interest or participate via stock ownership ties two points together First the four ways explicitly listed are all ways to DIRECTLY inject capital into china it means giving money to the tutoring company to use to grow Second the overall point of that paragraph is to limit the flow of foreign capital into china and halt the growth of tutoring companies restrict supply which when combined with no weekend holiday tutoring will restrict demand gt free up time for kids In addition major institutions like Singapore Government s investment fund Blackrock JP Morgan all institutional investors own 85 of total stock With a significant number being foreign firms These firms are not currently managing EDU and exert no influence forcing them to sell or delist the stock would severely restrict all future capital investment into china AND wouldn t really matter in the context of controlling tutor companies in china at this time since it is done retroactively Therefore I do not believe existing shareholders of EDU will be directly impacted through a delisting or what not It matter more if a foreign firm already has control and if a foreign firm is thinking of controlling in the future currently in the middle of an acquisition negotiation process for example It s helpful none of the major tutor companies are foreign owned currently amp x200B Therefore I see the foreign capital point as more of restricting FUTURE capital investment into china to stem the capital fueled growth and less so to penalize existing shareholders To conclude it is likely EDU will revert to a conservative intrinsic value of 4 5 dollars are share in the near term 3 6 months Longer term depends on if K10 K12 can be maintained if so that will drive future growth

my DD here with a big grain of salt This is not financial advice Do your own DD Don t listen to a random dude on the Internet You may lose money in the stock market yada yada if you lose your ramen noodles I m not to blame Anyway about a week and a half ago I was passively playing AMD stock buys during a work meeting and decided to do a little TA and noticed that there seemed to be a settling of the bottom end of a handle on a 4 month cup and handle formation in the classic form round not V shaped for AMD I predicted that it might enter an upward swing in the next couple of weeks which based on the classic cup and handle logic could run for up to 20 points Then red Monday happened and AMD ran green while almost everything that wasn t a COVID fix stock ran red Then AMD ran up the whole week The trend for last week perfectly matched the cup and handle classic expected trajectory and this is not just based on the graph AMD had a solid consolidation phase in the mid 80s The company has amazingly high sentiment not just in the gaming community but across the tech field in general They have multiple products in high demand AND in shortage The sell off position which started the cup makes sense as a profit taking driven trend The consolidation phase being long and having a solid spike in the middle represents a strong acquisition of solid holders for the stock and the accumulation buy in period makes sense on the right end of the cup as an accelerated buy cycle matched with a gamma swing in buy volume I DREW SOME SHIT WITH CRAYON ON THE GRAPH WANNA SEE TA is guessing at best or finding things that fit your requirement but when you see TA come up with a perfect classic pattern you should take notice because either it s being formed by actions it s natural and people running algorithmic response have see it and are now behaving based on the pattern I work in fintech I know how these people think The decline on the right of the cup makes sense as a patterned sales cycle for profit taking with a little exit escape because of the run but this isn t people running from the stock due to a catalyst The prior run up matched Fibonacci buying sequences hitting resistance at 95 just like the first spike did I don t put a huge amount of value in just reading the graphs here and often fib retracements just don t work but with the stock price adjustment a 96 97 stock resistance point following a 95 resistance point makes some degree of sense and it also makes sense that algorithms would identify the same cup and handle trend here What are people buying on the options market Look at the options chain for July 30th All calls are green and up by a large amount and all puts are running red with most in the negative double digits There s a MASSIVE number of calls waiting ITM on AMD for the end of next week culminating at 135 at the 865million range IF the stock went above 135 at the end of the day Of course it won t do that but 301m are already ITM at the current strike price and look at the capitalization values of all calls at each of these ranges All current ITM contracts 301 237 250 00 95 strike price 209 095 300 00 510 332 550 00 total 100 strike price 224 474 900 00 734 807 450 00 total 105 strike price 37 201 500 00 772 008 950 00 total 110 strike price 38 335 000 00 810 343 950 00 total 115 strike price 38 444 500 00 848 788 450 00 total 120 strike price 2 112 000 00 850 900 450 00 total 125 strike price 3 525 000 00 854 425 450 00 total 130 strike price 5 395 000 00 859 820 450 00 total 135 strike price 1 606 500 00 861 426 950 00 total Of course many of these are covered calls and there will be lots of sells competing so I don t expect all of these to add their value to the stock as it runs but that s a lot of buy happening with the stock at the end of next week and during the week if people exercise these calls and that s not even taking into account the large amount of open interest in these options over the next week Remember too brokers generally assign ITM options even if they expire because who s going to turn down profit The standing ratio of calls puts next week already ITM is 1 33 1 meaning the market is better for AMD and a gamma little gamma event may be in the works The wildcards I see are Earnings on Tuesday The FOMC meeting Any random event which scares people on any given day AMD did drive up during red Monday last week though Approaching Tuesday may be a bulltrap so set your stoplosses if you re in the stock and feel it s necessary Who knows what the Fed meeting will do to this stock market anyone who tells you they know is lying but odds are there will be panic even if it s just JPOW seeing his shadow So buyer beware but if you re asking if there s any patterns suggesting AMD can run this week I d say these qualify If this stock breaks 95 100 this week interesting things will happen

this retard market Gaming Market The gaming market is a strong growing market that has been expanding for the past two decades and is expected to keep growing Consumer spending in 2020 on PC gaming hardware and accessories reach 4 5 billion USD while accessories grew 81 YoY and hardware grew 57 Corsair manufactures hardware solutions such as fans RAM cooling units PC cases and many more that have profited from the recent increase in PC hardware sales Due to lockdowns many have been wanting to buy a PC which has shot up sales However this trend is not temporary as I will show Steam users a k a any gamer who has a PC and play video games have seen a very sharp growth in the past year due to the lockdown The trend fluctuates with the lockdowns easings around the world and is always and bottom in summer months From August 2019 to August 2020 there has been a 33 increase in steam users August of 2020 was a time when Europe had record low covid infections compared to winter months and beginning of pandemic as well as America Yet people were still playing video games at record rates This is a clear sign that this market has grown and the player base is hooked and not going anywhere Since then it had another 20 increase Bullish af The biggest nonsense I have ever heard is that now that lockdown is over gamers are going to stop gaming Have they ever even met a gamer Personally I was a hardcore gamer before lockdown and I will definitely continue to be one The lockdown accelerated the uptake of gaming and if anything people will be more committed to gaming Easing of lockdown would allow for social events e g LAN parties and gaming conventions to take place that will further encourage spending on gaming products Investors who believe that gaming is going to fade out or that the hype is over are completely in the wrong here Covid has only accelerated the trend and there might be a minor pullback in numbers as usually happens in the summer months but the YoY numbers indicate that there has been a strong increase in gaming and this trend is likely to continue You can buy the stock now at a lucrative price and when the investors realize that gaming is here to stay they will have to buy the stock at a much higher price down the line Streaming Market An excellent acquisition by Corsair has been buying Elgato and entering the streaming business The streaming market was 50 billion USD in 2020 and is expected to reach 59 billion USD in 2021 It is expected to continue growing to 2028 at an annual CAGR rate of 21 This is a huge market with a wonderful growth rate not easy finding a market with such a growth rate and corsair is perfectly positioned to take advantage of it From buying the hardware to run your PC also with products such as the capture card to the elgato streaming deck that allows for easy streaming controls Corsair is in the perfect position to take advantage of this growing market and be at the forefront of the hardware space Financial performance Absolutely solid financial performance over the past year with stellar growth and very prospective in the future YoY revenue and profit margins have been growing at double digit rates Revenue grew 55 and 65 from 1 163 and 1 300 to 1 702 and 1 923 million USD from Dec 2019 and March 2020 to Dec 2020 and March 2021 Q1 is usually the worst quarter of the year but they managed to get their best ever quarter EBITDA margins and Net Income margins have gone from around 6 5 and 0 to 13 5 and 7 7 from March 2020 to March 2021 respectively This is showing stunning increase in operating margins which are very healthy and promise great further investment and growth EPS this year is expected to be 1 81 However the CFO is usually very conservative and it could be much higher by the end of the year I could go on more detail about earnings growth but in this case margins are more interesting because it shows better efficiency and last year they were barely doing a profit so the earnings growth is skewed With an EPS of 1 81 a fair value PE multiple of 20 would be 36 2 However if you consider this is a growth stock in a growth environment then comparable growth companies trade at 30 40 PE ratio which would indicate a price target of at least 54 3 72 4 Additionally they have been paying down debt from 505 million at end of the year 2019 to 321 million in 2020 Comparing Corsair with its closest competitor Logitech Lets look at Logitech valuation metrics Last 12 months Next 12 months PE Ratio 23 4 30 1 EV Sales 3 8 3 8 EV EBITDA 15 9 22 6 Corsair Last 12 months Next 12 months PE Ratio 20 4 18 8 EV Sales 1 7 1 5 EV EBITDA 11 5 12 9 Now if Corsair was priced as Logitech it would indicate a price increase between 50 100 Additionally much of Logitech s offering has been focussed on working from home products whereas Corsair is more focussed on gaming Logitech too but not to the same extent The working from home trend has peaked and many companies like JP Morgan have announced that they will want all their staff to return back to the office within the next months There will still be people working from home but the trend will be declining from now Ownership There has been negative sentiment around IPOs recently as many of them have flooded the market resulting in extreme short term price movement which has led to investors staying shy of them and believing that they are more speculative Ownership currently sits at 62 with eagle tree capital and around 10 with other institutions Short interest is currently at around 19 of the float Overall great company with excellent financial performance actually makes a great profit and has super good growth ahead and I am mega bullish on them They also have super low valuation metrics which together make a rare combination TL DR Buy shares and calls now

16,orfy7z,t2_u7b8d,1627234443,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/orfy7z/could_chinese_education_stocks_bounce_back/,1,Could Chinese education stocks bounce back ,After the news on the new regulation Friday the 23rd chinese education stocks tumbled down after an already tumultous year TAL among other stocks fell over 70 after already falling from a peak of 90 to around 20 during this year The new proposal banned the education companies from teaching students between the age of 6 15 during holidays and weekends and after 21 00 However the biggest concern from the proposed regulation is that all active institutions active in formal school oriented education for K9 6 15 year olds will become non profit The uncertainty that this yields is likely the cause of the massive dip last friday Nevertheless it is entirely possible if not likely that the government does not mean corporations when it says institutions Institutions could instead simply refer to the actual learning centers registered at the local municipalities The exact quote regarding non profit is and existing subject based training institutions are uniformly registered as nonprofit institutions I think that this simply refers to the education institution for K 9 which is effected by the regulation and not the entire company itself This probably means that the company have to abandon these institutions to remain for profit organizations or that they need to adhere to new guidelines which mean that authorities control the market if they are only allowed to charge a certain sum like 25 yuan then they can only charge 25 yuan If this interpretation is correct the chinese education companies can still do business elsewhere and focus on areas such as online learning teaching people 16 selling books and education of K 9 in areas outside the school curriculum TAL education has a 52 week change of 92 with a 52 week high of 90 and 50 day moving average of 23 Currently it is trading at 6 despite a book value of 8 07 I think it is likely that the remaining sources of revenue will be higher than 8 of their current total and if they are able to continue within the non regulated areas there is a huge upside especially since they have a lot of cash in the bank At wsb we play the odds and gamble and in this scenario the potential upside far outvalues the risk I know there is a lot of china hate on this sub but this shouldnt matter in a casino where the only relevant factors are risk and potential return If we take one of the most known and infamous examples of chinese stocks Luckin Coffee it went down all the way to 1 39 per share after it was delisted but it is now trading at 13 17 at the pink sheets The chinese education stocks could very much play out similarly This makes it a high risk high reward play which suits me well If you feel the same the time to go in is soon Feel free to refute or discuss I encourage criticism this is not financial advice only bet what you are willing to lose

AMZN MSFT GOOG FB AMD and More, Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation and Analysis Q2 Week 3 TSLA AAPL AMZN MSFT GOOG FB AMD and More amp nbsp What s poppin bull gang I hope you made some awesome money last week The spreadsheet was spot on for nearly every company and all of my plays came to fruition MT and X ended up bagging us anywhere from 300 to 500 JETS gave us 1100 and SNAP netted us 250 on our strangles and nearly 600 on binary options I m looking to keep this momentum going throughout this week as well and with all of FAAMG I kicked NFLX out for MSFT after their disgraceful earnings set to report this week could prove to be more lucrative than the last We ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles to good old fashioned theta plays We ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish Let s get into it amp nbsp The Spreadsheet To aid us in planning our trades this week I ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week https docs google com spreadsheets d 1 xx9rsQ4

performance isn t indicative of future success but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information If you re struggling to find a given stock click on the ticker symbol on the index page it should hyperlink you straight to the table If the above link isn t working for you refer to the link below amp nbsp Spreadsheet HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 1 xx9rsQ4 0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok edit usp sharing amp nbsp If the sheet has helped you out in any way please drop an upvote or a comment so I know whether or not I should keep on making them Most websites also require you to pay for this data which I think is asinine amp nbsp Interesting Observations and Sample Plays Below I ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance If I missed anything feel free to bring it to my attention amp nbsp Pinterest is inefficiently priced Since going public PINS has had an average post earnings move of 14 The options this week are pricing in a move of roughly 6 on both sides of the chain which is likely going to shrink significantly going into earnings as theta eats away at the contracts Even though I m extremely bullish on PINS this trade could honestly move either way so I m personally opting to play a straddle like I did with SNAP last week Given that we get a historically average move we ll be making some money on this trade Keep in mind this trade is riskier than the one we played on SNAP since the average historical move is smaller Don t over leverage yourself and don t be afraid to turn the straddle into a reverse iron butterfly to reduce your cost basis on the trade amp nbsp Over the past 24 earnings seasons Shopify has gone up nearly 75 of the time The odds on this trade are phenomenal and we have quite a few options for how we want to play it If you want to gamble directionally call debit spreads would be your best bet from a risk to reward standpoint Alternatively we can also join theta gang for this play by selling ATM put credit spreads allowing us to net some extremely nice premiums If you want an even safer spread MSFT also has a similar win rate 65 while having a historically smaller move allowing you to defend your capital in the event that the trade goes against you Since both SHOP and MSFT report on different days we can look to make this play twice to ensure we re not overleveraged on any given day amp nbsp Counterintuitively XLE is NOT a good collateral play https www hungrybotalerts com blog collateral plays this week XLE actually has a higher IV than both XOM and CVS so if you wanted to play oil earnings you d actually be better off rolling the dice on the individual companies I m not sure why this is the case here Either the MMs are catching onto my bullshit unlikely or there s some nuances to trading oil that I m not aware of I m sure there s an arbitrage play you could make regarding the individual price and IV differences proportional to the ETF holdings but I don t have time to crunch the numbers nor do I think I d have enough capital to abuse it Regardless I just wanted to bring this to everyone s attention since this is one of the rare cases where the collateral play puts us at a disadvantage amp nbsp All that being said I haven t had much time to review any extra trades given that I ve been extremely busy this weekend If you want extra trade theses or updates alongside any live trade entries and exits feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile amp nbsp Summary and Conclusion We ve got another fun week of earnings ahead of us I personally tend to avoid playing FAANG stocks in general so my analysis was concentrated elsewhere If you see any appealing plays feel free to let me know Use the spreadsheet https docs google com spreadsheets d 1 xx9rsQ4 0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok edit usp sharing to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio and play
