Ponzi scheme without anyone noticing Can anyone debunk this ,This is currently blowing my mind so please help me out here There s this guy Tan Liu who has been pushing this idea that the majority of the stock market fits the legal definition of a Ponzi scheme Yes it would easily be the biggest financial crime in American history Yes its inflammatory and sounds like sensationalism I know He s had little to no traction for a couple years now Wrote a book about it called The Ponzi Factor and has some compelling YouTube explainers I ve searched debunkings expecting to hit a brick wall as usual with something as sensational as this and to my surprise I cannot for the life of me find anything convincing I m not a conspiracy guy I can t stand them actually and I generally defer to convention However I can t get this out of my brain The bare logic of it seems inescapable to me and the implications are so large I ve just been fixated on it So I wrote this up because I m curious to see what reddit thinks It s only been discussed very briefly here and dismissed out right without really thinking about what he s saying His basic argument is fundamental Stocks are not ownership instruments if owners never receive money from the companies they own This makes the majority of US stocks worthless because only thing that gave them worth has been sneakily stripped away without affecting people s perception of their value Perception meeting reality of course would revalue much of the market to 0 I ll try to break down the argument as concisely as possible or at least as best as I ve come to understand it What gives a stock value and why do we buy these things in the first place When you buy a stock you re buying a piece of the company right This is what I ve always understood and pretty much what everyone says Stocks are an ownership instrument You own stock in a company So if they turn out to be successful you make money too Super basic This is the fundamental assumption that makes stocks things people want to own And what makes owning a stock owning part of a company You can t just give someone a price of paper and call them an owner There has to be some real tangible benefit So there are two things make stocks ownership instruments 1 They pay dividends The company shares its profit with you via direct payments the more the profit the more the dividend This is the one that matters Money Company makes money you make money Because you re an owner That s why we re here 2 You get voting rights on major company decisions but if you re not getting paid who cares Are you buying stocks for voting rights in a company that doesn t pay you The crazy part the majority of today s stocks don t pay a dividend They used to but this has been slowly eroded since the turn of the century and heavily accelerated in the 1960s championed by Warren Buffett So following this logic if you took away dividends it would it mean a stock is NOT an ownership instrument which would mean they re not a stock this is where your bullshit detectors go off I know but just follow the logic The only reason you can sell the stock at a higher price later to another investor capital gains is because people value the stock But why do they value the stock They value the stocks because they are ownership instruments They are ownership instruments because they pay a dividend People still trade these non dividend Ponzi assets as he calls them on the marketplace and think they have value because well So if you really digest this reality or this is how it went for me you think how could this be true Are people trading worthless pieces of paper like crazy people Is my financial advisor ignorant or a shill Is the smoke and mirrors so intense that everyone just follows along blindly This can t be right The implications are too crazy What percentage of investors actually know about any of this He uses Google as an example Google gives its class C shareholders no voting rights and pays no dividends Google states the par value the amount Google owes you for the stock of each stock is 001 US Dollars So what is Google selling when they sell you a stock Why would people buy and sell these things Why would human being put a monetary value of Google stock Zoom out and think big picture What do you actually own here This is the thing I can t get out of my head But wait this is crazy you think of course Google stocks have value They re freaking Google stocks Say you bought one stock of Google early at 1 and now it s worth 1000 and you sold Great investment Well where did the 999 come from when you sold the stock The answer is some guy who bought it Another investor just like you Only because he believes that it is ownership instrument and the thing he bought from you has value And that investor is hoping that he ll sell it for even more but the money he ll make is just from another investor This is buy low hell high or capital gains This financial architecture Tan argues fits the SEC definition of a Ponzi Scheme So if this guy is right if you own Google stock you own a worthless arbitrary thing that people believe have value Their belief of course being the only thing that gives them value A digital token that says Google on it that has absolutely no financial link with the company There is no logical reason it should track the success of the company This is also a possible explanation for why the S amp P is back to 2019 highs Analyzing Googles fundamentals is simply absolute insanity The chain of money completely excludes Google s profits mathematically and financially Just keep an open mind for a sec If this logic checks out the only money to be made from Google stock never ever comes from Google s profits but exclusively from the pockets of other people who have nothing to do with Google therefore Google s ability to make money doesn t matter at all The stocks value are a complete illusion that we have assumed has to track with the company s ability to turn a profit That mechanic is only relevant if you see some of those profits via dividends If people knew the truth the value of their stock would crash to 0 There is no benefit to owning Google stock other than other people paying you for them If you couldn t make capital gains think about it what benefit would there be in owning Google stock Dividend stocks however are legitimate unless of course they stop paying it which they can instantly tanking the real value to zero and the author explains that dividends are supposed to be fundamental to stocks Dividend stocks are a true ownership instrument and in that case capital gains make sense because people are offering you money for something with real value ownership This is the true sound mechanic of the stock market So further down this quarantine boredom fueled rabbit hole this is on his website and Instagram a logic proof of why non dividend stocks fit the SEC definition of a Ponzi scheme S E C Definition A Ponzi Scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors TPF Proof In practice under foreseeable and non hypothetical conditions we can observe the following characteristics for non dividend stocks 1 Stocks are investment instruments 2 Investors do not receive any money from the companies they own The returns to existing investors the realized capital gains are strictly dependent on the funds contributed by new investors 3 Investors think the returns come from the underlying business purported The characteristics of non dividend stocks meet all three technical elements in the definition The word fraud is a subjective opinion word not technical Therefore non dividend stocks meet the SEC s definition of a Ponzi scheme Ponzi schemes are illegal for many reasons being they steal from the gullible confused masses to benefit the few Remember Ponzi schemes produce winners towards the top of the pyramid If you made capital gains sure you made money but you took it from someone else just like you It is a net loss for investors And think about the crime here if true the Ponzi scam simply vacuums up money from investors and concentrates them into corporate pockets and early investors top of the pyramid Taking away the dividend of course is denying another payment to investors So in essence if true this has just been just sneakily orchestrated systematic theft And if when the house of cards collapses the top of the pyramid takes the money and runs Is this real reddit Please let s keep it logical please and not attack eachother And please avoid jargon soup if you can Also to save some time because yes I did Google this before posting here are some common counter arguments I ve found and Tan s responses that seem solid to me Dividends could be paid in the future Hypotheticals aren t reality What matters is the reality right now The value of money is just a belief as well No because money is legal tender backed by law Companies print stocks to get money and investors buy stocks because they want money This puts fiat money and stocks on completely different hierarchies He s just selling a book The book is non profit and he gives away a digital copy Reddit doesn t allow bitly links Stock buybacks companies dilute shares when they buyback counteracting the benefit Voting gives them value because you can vote for them to pay dividends It s a democracy companies can issue more shares and tip the scales whenever they want

some due diligence I recently did on QS QS has been a hot stock in recent months having made large moves both up and down They also entered the market as a SPAC and as they are intensely research based have no prior financials worth noting So this dd post focuses on their innovation and their management and recent news I hope you all enjoy it and look forward to any discussion amp x200B QUANTUMSCAPES DUE DILIGENCE 5th Jan Intro to QS QuantumScape Corp engages in the provision of energy storage solutions It focuses on the development of solid state lithium metal batteries for use in electric vehicles The company was founded by Jagdeep Singh Tim Holme and Fritz B Prinz in May 2010 and is headquartered in San Jose CA amp x200B First I checked their ratings and trend summary on stockinvest us https stockinvest us Here is what I found Rated as sell on stockinvest us https stockinvest us changed to buy on the 6th Jan Trending search for the day week though bullish investor sentiment shows hype and interest QS Stock Risk This stock may move very much during a day volatility and with a very large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is considered to be very high risk During the last day the stock moved 13 60 between high and low or 28 69 For the last week the stock has had a daily average volatility of 17 36 Our recommended stop loss We hold a sell evaluation for this stock No stop loss set Volume has increased on the 4th of January by 69 million shares but on falling prices Given the current short term trend the stock is expected to rise 185 84 during the next 3 months and with a 90 probability hold a price between 142 81 and 406 18 at the end of this 3 month period amp x200B Next I checked Motley Fool although I have no confidence in their analysis overall to see what they had to say QuantumScape is several years from commercial production and its current market capitalization https www fool com investing how to invest stocks what is market cap is still over 18 billion Investors who want to speculate on the potential of QuantumScape and its business need to plan on a lot of volatility in the years leading up to its technology going to market Investors have jumped in excited about the potential but QuantumScape will soon have a lot more shares trading The company updated an S 1 filing at end of December registering more than 300 million shares with at least 60 million not subject to any lockup agreement and able to be sold as soon as the filing gets the rubber stamp from the Securities and Exchange Commission More shares available typically means downward pressure on a stock In this case it is existing holders and not the company selling shares meaning QuantumScape would get no cash from the offering But existing shares could feel some near term downward pressure which they have since mid late December We ll likely know when the registration becomes official probably sometime January when we see a spike in the volume of shares traded and probably another down day for the shares likely the increase in volume and decrease in price mentioned on stockinvest us https stockinvest us on the 4th It s hard to read too much into options pricing but if options are to be believed some investors are pricing in the potential for the stock to lose 20 or more in the weeks to come QuantumScape was a breath of fresh air as it hit the public markets after its reverse merger https www fool com investing 2020 11 13 why kensington capital is charging higher today with Kensington Acquisition Corp in November QuantumScape in partnership with Volkswagen expects to begin construction of a 1 gigawatt hour GWh pilot facility in 2021 If successful QuantumScape will expand the project to a 20 GWh facility To put this in perspective consider that in mid 2018 Tesla reported that battery production of its Gigafactory in Nevada achieved annualized battery production of about 20 GWh While management foresees the company reporting 275 million in revenue and 73 million in gross profit for 2026 QuantumScape estimates that the following year the top line and gross profit will skyrocket to 3 billion and 1 billion respectively Likewise the company believes that 2027 will be the year it starts to report positive EBITDA https www fool com knowledge center ebitda aspx approximately 808 million Since 2012 Volkswagen has provided more than 300 million in funding to QuantumScape making it the company s largest investor though it maintains a minority stake In 2018 Volkswagen and QuantumScape formed a 50 50 joint venture one of the goals of which is to produce solid state batteries for Volkswagen s EVs on a mass scale Thanks to the joint venture and pilot facility QuantumScape envisions that Volkswagen will be the first to commercialize its solid state batteries But QuantumScape demonstrated in a recent filing that its dance card is hardly full stating that subject to the other terms of the joint venture arrangements we are not limited from working in parallel with other automotive OEMs to commercialize our technology While QuantumScape is singularly focused on developing its solid state batteries for EVs the company recognizes that its technology may be used in other applications such as stationary storage smartphones and wearables While the company may in time pursue the latter two markets it seems that stationary storage is closest to the company s current focus moreover it s one that certainly represents a significant opportunity According to Lux Research the stationary storage market which represented installations of 164 GWh in 2019 is expected to grow at a 20 compound annual growth rate through 2035 when it will reach installations totaling 3 046 GWh Apple has a mountain of cash https www fool com investing how to invest cash is king and one could speculate that it would acquire a company with the right technology QuantumScape highlighted its technology in a presentation earlier this month The solid state technology charges to 80 capacity in just 15 minutes has greater than a 300 mile range has a long usage life and is non combustible The company is notably backed by both Volkswagen OTC VWAGY https www fool com quote otc volkswagen aktiengesellschaft vwagy and Bill Gates Whether investors are speculating about an Apple investment is anyone s guess Moves could also be driven by thinking that other potential customers will want to partner with QuantumScape if they have to compete against an Apple EV amp x200B After this I went to Simply Wall St to get an overview of management and financials Shahmoon Keller PLLC Files Suit on Behalf of Holders of QuantumScape Corporation Warrants Shahmoon Keller PLLC announced that the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Manhattan has scheduled an injunction hearing for January 19 2021 in a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of warrants to purchase stock of QuantumScape Corporation QuantumScape the successor to Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp by virtue of a business combination that closed on November 25 2020 stated in its proxy statement and prospectus that the warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of the Business Combination QuantumScape subsequently asserted that the warrants could not be exercised until June 30 2021 at the earliest amp x200B Their management is excellently qualified and highly respected in their field of expertise with many years experience and strong motivation At the minimum this is evident in their

Company s possible violations of federal securities laws amp x200B On January 4 2021 Seeking Alpha published an article pointing to several risks with QuantumScape s solid state batteries that make it completely unacceptable for real world field electric vehicles Specifically it stated that the battery s power means it will only last for 260 cycles or about 75 000 miles of aggressive driving As solid state batteries are temperature sensitive the power and cycle tests at 30 and 45 degrees above would have been significantly worse if run even a few degrees lower On this news the Company s

Quantumscape amp sort new amp page 1 https patents google com assignee Quantumscape amp oq Quantumscape amp sort new amp page 1 Also a quick Google Scholar search on solid state lithium batteries should be enough to satisfy the battery nerds out there Some really great articles and research on this stuff showing huge potential I also highly recommend everyone interested to watch the following It is the investors presentation released on 8th December on Youtube It contains more information on their actual breakthrough btteries than I have above https www youtube com watch v dGnPSkXKb0I https www youtube com watch v dGnPSkXKb0I amp x200B Lastly check out r QuantumScape for even more dd if you desire amp x200B My Tl dr Overall bullish the tech if all data and results are true representations is extremely advanced It will be the future But production doesnt start until 2025 at the soonest There have been accusations that the results and data were exaggerated fabricated or whatever else usually follows success Ongoing investigations are likely to turn up nothing though Management and the board overall are extremely experienced and likely trustworthy They are and will continue to be the best they can be at what they do There are some extra shares floating around that may suppress price for a couple of weeks or so And with a huge run up already after happening it is unlikely to see another for a couple weeks months again minimum People are comparing it to Tesla already There are also some competitors some of them Chinese some of them just other car companies such as Toyota and GM Also EV stocks in general are hot are getting bad rep because of valuations In terms of technical analysis I predict a big move upwards over the next few week months Long term 5 years this could go up 1 000 from current prices if they deliver on all their promises and especially if they overdeliver That would be extremely bullish amp x200B Also as a side note I want to give a special mention to c b a t mods have banned because of market cap another battery maker All the hype surrounding EV s and Battery companies could cause c b a t to go on a huge bullish run For reference it is already up around 30 over the last week or so and could easily rise another 100 from here with a current price of only 9 I am personally going long both amp x200B I hope you have all enjoyed my dd on QS as much as I enjoyed putting it together I hope to see big things from them in the future amp x200B Yours truly NathMcLovin

the commodity club We continue our narrative today with Nickel 05c about to make you so hard Quick disclaimer today s post will focus on VALE So much news to share about why this is about to go to 25 27 by March amp x200B Earnings Link https 1drv ms x s Aqh0bpkatZYkciY7YA4lH8hq3BQ e GA4hvF Earnings for Q3 were very solid If you reference the above link I ve shared details into VALE s Q3 earnings There s a few key takeaways Reference the Avg Prices tab and see what VALE got in Q3 for each commodity For Q4 there s a few big winners we should expect Iron Ore up 30 in Q4 This is VALE s largest commodity and likely priced into earnings It is 80 of their revenue Met Coal also up 30 in Q4 This is another huge line item for VALE and was a loss in Q4 At current prices this will be an easy winner but only 1 of their revenue Copper up about 20 in Q4 This is 5 of their revenue and drive about 500m in profits in Q4 Nickel up about 15 in Q4 This is about 10 of their revenue VALE made 2 9b in Q3 That s about 59 share They have a 3 9 dividend to go along with this Production was up over Q1 and Q2 but depressed since 2019 Some of this has been a result of declining ore quality and Covid There was also a landslide that caused some production loss High Level Research Okay so core commodity prices are increasing We also know that VALE sends about 60 of their product to China So how does this translate Here s where I explain why Q4 will be amazing and how Nickel will be the catalyst for a massive earnings beat Iron Ore is super expensive and we are seeing massive shipments being sent to China China is so short on steel that they are buying scrap for the first time ever from Japan Here s a series of articles tweets to read Post 1 https twitter com YuanTalks status 1346356073309978624 s 19 Iron Ore hitting record high prices but shipments falling Post 2 https www mysteel net article 5020695 0501 WEEKLY Aust Brazilian iron ore shipment over Dec 28 Jan 3 html looking at shipping details we see that VALE s shipments actually increased while iron from Australia fell VALE shipped 6 5m tons of iron in the last week of the year that s about 1b in revs in a week Post 3 https www mining com iron ore shipments from brazil and australia set record high even though shipments fell in the last week of December shipments are at all time highs VALE is literally sending mountains of iron to China at record prices Yay Also note that the Baltic Dry Index is nearing highs too Shipping rates are expensive and will hurt margins slightly Projections Okay so Iron is going to be a huge winner in Q4 Right now here s the earnings projections for VALE Low 5 share about 2 5b in profit Medium 8 share about 4b in profit High 1 share about 5b in profit At Q3 output levels and current prices we should expect to be near the high estimate of 1 share Revs are expected at 12 13b but should be much higher given current shipping details we ve seen from VALE to China At the worst we have a Rev and Earnings beat So why Nickel Thesis If you reference the Q3 Earnings Call Nickel was the clear callout for VALE s earnings beat last quarter You ll regularly see Nickel prices and sales being a major driver for increased earnings Here s Nickel s chart https tvc invdn com akamaized net data tvc b0922c4db148b2c166ae2ff909d8183a png amp x200B Nickel Futures https preview redd it y36ns5ublx961 png width 1677 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 8d09c9901ac2abdb4914ae42fd17f097c4e069d2 Nickel just broke out and is entering a massive bull market Currently Nickel is trading at 18 000 ton which is much higher than VALE s realized price of 15 000 ton in Q3 What s interesting is that Nickel is rising despite rising stock piles http www kitcometals com charts lmewarehouse html in warehouses Here s where we get a bit speculative reference VALE s Nickel production here Link http www vale com EN investors information market quarterly results QuarterlyResultsDocs PREREPORT3T20 i vf pdf Mining outputs are variable quarter to quarter due to weather ore grades demand prices etc sometimes when bull markets or demand increases miners turn on production that was previously on hold We see that in Q3 VALE saw soaring demand for Nickel as it relates to sales and this would be an indicator for a higher demand for Nickel However nickel output is actually down from 2019 when prices were at similar prices to today With nickel prices breaking out and appearing to be headed much higher VALE might have offline nickel production that they ll turn back on to take advantage of higher demand and prices Additionally nickel prices are looking like they might go significantly higher into Q4 and have a much higher price target than say iron or coal We ve also seen VALE buy miners in Indonesia for additional Nickel production which is aligned with this ongoing Nickel breakout Prediction VALE s nickel output will return to 2019 levels and take advantage of the current pricing We could see an additional 20m tons produced and a massive profit line item on Q4 Additionally if VALE can lock in these prices for Q4 and continue to increase production and see rising prices Nickel could become 15 20 of VALE s business and bring in over 1b in profit a quarter Based on an expected earnings rev beat and future outlook for VALE I m expecting the share price to jump to 25 27 in March based on current P E and other metrics for the stock Positions amp x200B https preview redd it 0r4768skox961 png width 718 amp format png amp auto webp amp s dc3185bea658f163e58e1a38f8c66f6e1214d8b8
