351,ng38hg,t2_93z31p3f,1621423597,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ng38hg/keypath_education_ipo_is_junk/,1,Keypath Education IPO is junk,Keypath Education is a US based education business that is soon to IPO in Australia not sure why they don t do it in the USA Keypath Education has been building its business since 2014 7 years and is yet to turn a profit Each year Keypath Education adds additional programs Masters to drive additional student enrollments and revenue Additions of programs requires investment in learning design The more Keypath Education invests in learning design the greater its future growth will be as this means new programs are being developed or existing programs are being refreshed Old programs grow stale and over time drive lower revenue so ever increasing investment in programs is required to drive revenue growth year on year The second part of Keypath Education driving revenue growth is through marketing Keypath Education primarily drives student enrollments via online marketing primarily Google and Facebook but also a range of online sources Keypath Education is operating in a highly competitive market which results in high marketing costs as a proportion of revenue Higher marketing spend drives higher enrollments which drives revenue If marketing spend is reduced enrollments reduce The covid pandemic was a black swan event which saw a large portion of its largest market Australia in lockdown for a good part of half a year which the government paying people to not work and doubling welfare payments to unemployed This saw a large spike in enrollments over 2020 and 2021 as people turned to study to improve chances of re entering the workforce or to upskill while they were under lockdown Keypath s financial statements for the years 2020 2019 and 2018 Statement of Cash Flows shows increasing investment in its program offering Additions of amortizable assets with investments increasing 50 over the three years Meanwhile existing programs also see increasing depreciation as the investment in those programs depreciates in value However the financial statements for the half year ended 31 December 2020 shows something interesting While revenues have increased substantially 70 marketing spend only increased 42 This means the marketing spend over the 6 months ended Dec 2020 was much more effective than that in the six months ended Dec 2019 Additionally salaries and wages which reflect investment in people to generate sales and retain existing students only grew 43 in line with marketing What this means is that Keypath Educations recent jump in revenue is not sustainable and was only due to the Covid pandemic as people were left with little to do but study What this means is Keypath Education saw a windfall gain in enrollments due to Covid without a resulting higher investment in either marketing or staff to enroll those students Keypath Education was converting marketing spend at a rate far higher than in previous periods This is an abnormal situation and is unlikely to continue as people return to work and life returns to normal Further Keypath Education s additions to amortizable intangible assets was lower in the Dec 2020 half than in prior periods This means Keypath Education invested less in its business As new courses see diminishing enrollments as they mature this under investment in building and maintaining courses will show itself over the coming years If Keypath Education isn t building and maintaining its existing programs at ever higher rates its revenue will eventually plateau then decline Keypath s main revenue drivers is number of new students and its ability to retain existing students However if you read the offer documents both of these drivers are completely absent instead is hundreds of pages of fluff about minimil investment in technology to market itself as a tech business It s nothing more than a sales and marketing arm of universities Definitely not a true tech business What Keypath s IPO represents is a private equity firm that is desperate to exit a loss making business that cannot turn a profit The Covid epidemic saw a windfall temporary increase in enrollments which combined with reduced investment in its product and reduced marketing and staff spend gives the impression of a business about to turn a profit This could not be further from the truth Keypath Education is highly over valued based on its proposed offer price This will be a float like Macquarie Bank s other recent famous IPO Nuix which was tainted by inflated numbers fraud and has tanked and will be very unlikely to return to its IPO valuation Keypath has no path to profit requires massive investment just to keep pumping out new courses and due to the intense competition in the industry must spend a massive proportion of its revenues on marketing and staff to keep students from dropping out after finding the online learning experience less than satisfactory Keypath Education IPO is junk and is only to being listed as a path for the private equity owners and key staff to cash out their shares

AM EST Others CLAM ortex lists 234 but I am unable to confirm that Fintel also shows that shorts were pretty active yesterday up to 11 AM until the borrow costs went from 21 to 98 The fails to deliver are also staggering That indicates plenty of shorts are getting BURNED and don t want to payout Let s burn more A LOT MORE https fintel io so us uwmc https fintel io so us uwmc 8 50 was challenged hard yesterday broke multiple times and it will be claimed today It is chipped and should become strong support once it is claimed The 8 50 sell wall was completely eliminated so 8 50 remains as a psychological not sell wall resistance good The market is heavily down today As UWMC has been pulling up its been weighted by general downward market pressure and looks like that will continue today but stronger Don t be discouraged if we have a down day the schedule has an extra day built in but it would be better to conserve that for chipping away at the 9 01 wall if needed but we can still see a secular gain out of UWMC to maintain the squeeze schedule today despite market pressure The goal remains conversion of 8 50 to support Wednesday and maintaining a bump above that for the 9 push on Thursday This is looking good despite market conditions The sell wall at 9 01 is real and will need to be chipped away hopefully start Thursday tomorrow Options sellers were greedy and sold those 9c calls and now don t wanna give up the shares They will do what it takes to keep the price down until 5 21 THEY ARE HOLDING OUR SHARES GET IN THOSE POCKETS This post is continued from last week s UWMC squeeze thread in which 7 50c strikes were pushed ITM in preparation for this week s push to 9c rocket pad assembled ITM After those 9c are pushed ITM and exercised 5 21 rocket is fueled 10c next week going ITM will be the ignition point TO THA MOON The UWMC squeeze continues to spread via WOM on other platforms and subreddits this is an important method of getting more powder into the UWMC pool If we have another secular gain today it will further push UWMC onto more momentum trade screeners and further the goal of adding buy pressure to this heavily shorted hard and expensive to borrow and undervalued stock This WOM spread in addition to the multiple Reddit posts is critical to the push This is going extremely well and the train is on schedule UWMC The 8 50 resistance then the 9 01 sell wall will need buying pressure to overcome The 9c wall is one of the FINAL obstacles holding it back I have powder held back for 9 01 and hope others have the discipline to buy in to smash the wall

but stronger Don t be discouraged if we have a down day the schedule has an extra day built in but it would be better to conserve that for chipping away at the 9 01 wall if needed but we can still see a secular gain out of UWMC to maintain the squeeze schedule today despite market pressure The goal remains conversion of 8 50 to support Wednesday and maintaining a bump above that for the 9 push on

AM EST Others CLAM ortex lists 234 but I am unable to confirm that Fintel also shows that shorts were pretty active yesterday up to 11 AM until the borrow costs went from 21 to 98 The fails to deliver are also staggering That indicates plenty of shorts are getting BURNED and don t want to payout Let s burn more A LOT MORE https fintel io so us uwmc https fintel io so us uwmc 8 50 was challenged hard yesterday broke multiple times and it will be claimed today It is chipped and should become strong support once it is claimed The 8 50 sell wall was completely eliminated so 8 50 remains as a psychological not sell wall resistance good The market is heavily down today As UWMC has been pulling up its been weighted by general downward market pressure and looks like that will continue today but stronger Don t be discouraged if we have a down day the schedule has an extra day built in but it would be better to conserve that for chipping away at the 9 01 wall if needed but we can still see a secular gain out of UWMC to maintain the squeeze schedule today despite market pressure The goal remains conversion of 8 50 to support Wednesday and maintaining a bump above that for the 9 push on Thursday This is looking good despite market conditions The sell wall at 9 01 is real and will need to be chipped away hopefully start Thursday tomorrow Options sellers were greedy and sold those 9c calls and now don t wanna give up the shares They will do what it takes to keep the price down until 5 21 THEY ARE HOLDING OUR SHARES GET IN THOSE POCKETS This post is continued from last week s UWMC squeeze thread in which 7 50c strikes were pushed ITM in preparation for this week s push to 9c rocket pad assembled ITM After those 9c are pushed ITM and exercised 5 21 rocket is fueled 10c next week going ITM will be the ignition point TO THA MOON The UWMC squeeze continues to spread via WOM on other platforms and subreddits this is an important method of getting more powder into the UWMC pool If we have another secular gain today it will further push UWMC onto more momentum trade screeners and further the goal of adding buy pressure to this heavily shorted hard and expensive to borrow and undervalued stock This WOM spread in addition to the multiple Reddit posts is critical to the push This is going extremely well and the train is on schedule UWMC The 8 50 resistance then the 9 01 sell wall will need buying pressure to overcome The 9c wall is one of the FINAL obstacles holding it back I have powder held back for 9 01 and hope others have the discipline to buy in to smash the wall

50c last Friday and need to hit the 9c by 5 21 https iborrowdesk com report UWMC https iborrowdesk com report UWMC Short borrow costs remain staggeringly high with iborrow reporting 93 Wed morning 7 AM EST Others CLAM ortex lists 234 but I am unable to confirm that Fintel also shows that shorts were pretty active yesterday up to 11 AM until the borrow costs went from 21 to 98 The fails to deliver are also staggering That indicates plenty of shorts are getting BURNED and don t want to payout Let s burn more A LOT MORE https fintel io so us uwmc https fintel io so us uwmc 8 50 was challenged hard yesterday broke multiple times and it will be claimed today It is chipped and should become strong support once it is claimed The 8 50 sell wall was completely eliminated so 8 50 remains as a psychological not sell wall resistance good The market is heavily down today As UWMC has been pulling up its been weighted by general downward market pressure and looks like that will continue today but stronger Don t be discouraged if we have a down day the schedule has an extra day built in but it would be better to conserve that for chipping away at the 9 01 wall if needed but we can still see a secular gain out of UWMC to maintain the squeeze schedule today despite market pressure The goal remains conversion of 8 50 to support Wednesday and maintaining a bump above that for the 9 push on Thursday This is looking good despite market conditions The sell wall at 9 01 is real and will need to be chipped away hopefully start Thursday tomorrow Options sellers were greedy and sold those 9c calls and now don t wanna give up the shares They will do what it takes to keep the price down until 5 21 THEY ARE HOLDING OUR SHARES GET IN THOSE POCKETS This post is continued from last week s UWMC squeeze thread in which 7 50c strikes were pushed ITM in preparation for this week s push to 9c rocket pad assembled ITM After those 9c are pushed ITM and exercised 5 21 rocket is fueled 10c next week going ITM will be the ignition point TO THA MOON The UWMC squeeze continues to spread via WOM on other platforms and subreddits this is an important method of getting more powder into the UWMC pool If we have another secular gain today it will further push UWMC onto more momentum trade screeners and further the goal of adding buy pressure to this heavily shorted hard and expensive to borrow and undervalued stock This WOM spread in addition to the multiple Reddit posts is critical to the push This is going extremely well and the train is on schedule UWMC The 8 50 resistance then the 9 01 sell wall will need buying pressure to overcome The 9c wall is one of the FINAL obstacles holding it back I have powder held back for 9 01 and hope others have the discipline to buy in to smash the wall

certain in life is death and taxes well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you ll double your money This isn t some wishy washy bullshit oh it s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it s just a question of when How can I be so sure They already own 54 of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with UROV being the last one to be bought out at like 95 premium in the fall Should you trust me Am I financial advisor good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can t lose What is it Their drug is a GNRH antagonist What the fuck does that mean fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock Ready for Primetime They didn t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine kind of a big deal They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year Oh and did I mention that they are on the agenda for a meeting literally as I type with a decision by Friday for Fibroids in Europe Sell themselves at any cost Hell no They got a 4 2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted Added bonus Pfizer s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill Buyout Price This sucker ain t going cheap They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner Sumi owns 54 of the outstanding shares but isn t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth The non SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius not piece of shit pharma we have here Going rate for takeovers is at least 100 premium and they have even ticked up to 130 in recent times Sumiwho Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks You don t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article Why buy now Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like 17 50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost 2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R amp D expenses going way down whatever could they do with that cash 44 a share wouldn t even cost them that 2 billion and would lock this down With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in remember this isn t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them And we ll have the Fibroids decision by Friday for Europe and I can t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval first FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they ve already approved in new indications like this one Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them 50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point It s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density the solution they will monitor bone density That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies Summary Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on doesn t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer Even if they don t Myovant has zero debt zero risk of an offering cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs Truly can t fucking lose so why is it trading so cheap Well cause no one knows about it and the upside is only written down in Japanese

certain in life is death and taxes well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you ll double your money This isn t some wishy washy bullshit oh it s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it s just a question of when How can I be so sure They already own 54 of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with UROV being the last one to be bought out at like 95 premium in the fall Should you trust me Am I financial advisor good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can t lose What is it Their drug is a GNRH antagonist What the fuck does that mean fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock Ready for Primetime They didn t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine kind of a big deal They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year Oh and did I mention that they are on the agenda for a meeting literally as I type with a decision by Friday for Fibroids in Europe Sell themselves at any cost Hell no They got a 4 2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted Added bonus Pfizer s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill Buyout Price This sucker ain t going cheap They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner Sumi owns 54 of the outstanding shares but isn t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth The non SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius not piece of shit pharma we have here Going rate for takeovers is at least 100 premium and they have even ticked up to 130 in recent times Sumiwho Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks You don t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article Why buy now Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like 17 50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost 2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R amp D expenses going way down whatever could they do with that cash 44 a share wouldn t even cost them that 2 billion and would lock this down With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in remember this isn t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them And we ll have the Fibroids decision by Friday for Europe and I can t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval first FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they ve already approved in new indications like this one Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them 50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point It s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density the solution they will monitor bone density That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies Summary Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on doesn t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer Even if they don t Myovant has zero debt zero risk of an offering cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs Truly can t fucking lose so why is it trading so cheap Well cause no one knows about it and the upside is only written down in Japanese

Waves Doritos and Mountain Dews patterns So many fantastic DDs well thought through researched and written those patterns exist But how am i not rich yet Well this is the real question we wanna answer today If those patterns are everywhere why dont they work I ll try to keep it short while giving links to sources for your own Research Keep in mind this is my own take on the sources provided A code from God little spoiler In the movie Pi Cohen is able to predict the market by using a 216 digit number an approximation of the number we all know as Pi 3 14159 Many powerful rich and wise people are later on his tracks to abuse his findings At one point Lenny Meyer a hasidic jew lectures him about his mathematical research of the Torah He mentiones how some believe that it contains a code sent from God later we find the same 216 digit number in the Torah Coincidence amp x200B Let s look at this example and the assumptions made amp x200B 1 Mathematics is the language of the nature amp x200B gt You can use mathematics as its own language without any particular association to any materialistic property lt gt Apply it to our physical world and boom you got yourself a theory Often enough those get later proven by experiments which give us a quantitative empiric confirmation of what seems like objective reality The one we can measure lt gt But what about the qualitative side of it The nuances of the universe and reality as we see it mathematics seems to be lacking features to express some of the more meaningful things compared to our natural language lt gt In other words If maths are the language of the universe and we emerge from it why aren t we speaking it lt gt What s fascinating is that our language allows for algebraic patterns like lt gt All cats are wanderers Minou is a cat Therefore Minou is a wanderer lt Our natural language and mathematics definetly share some features but both have distinct differences We can t really give a definitive answer so let s just assume that yes math is the language of nature and thus a different language then ours More on that http fdavidpeat com bibliography essays maths htm http fdavidpeat com bibliography essays maths htm amp x200B 2 Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers amp x200B gt Following the logic above this is where it starts to get just a little whacky Yes everything around us can be represented in numbers Yes it s a way of understanding meaning lt gt Sometimes mathematicians seem to detach from the way we think in our natural language In a way they cant really put into words what a equasion expresses lt gt A popular example would be quantum mechanics which nobody seems to have an intuition for Many great minds still struggle to find the right words to convey all its meaning and implications So if our language cant express some mathematical features why should mathematics be able to represent our language in full form lt Taking the differences in human languages every culture has its own set of it and many words can t be directly translated For me the implication would be that we can represent amp understand everything with numbers but always in our own way less in its purest original mathematical meaning We are biased by nature amp x200B 3 If you graph those numbers patterns emerge amp x200B Probably you can sense the pattern emerging here graphing those numbers would be the very definition of translating into another language subjective to our way of perception Some of its meaning will be lost in translation gt One popular example for this would be the hard problem of conscioussness We can map and graph the brain all we want but nobody knows how its materialistic properties would result in conscioussness as we know it lt gt There is brilliant simulations done by cognitive scientist Donald D Hoffmann that basicly uses game theory and some simplified assumptions to determine how random traits in evolution get passed on and if there is consistency in which type of traits those are His findings seem to reaffirm the theorem of mathematician Chetan Prakash which results in lt gt According to evolution by natural selection an organism that sees reality as it is will never be more fit than an organism of equal complexity that sees none of reality but is just tuned to fitness Never lt gt Your casual TED talk lt gt critical debate about those types of experiments and results lt gt Further it implicates that reality as we can measure it or express in mathematics never played a big role in our evolution Why would we have tools that would be finetuned to do that lt amp x200B Conclusion The further down the line of understanding mathematical or quantitative patterns we go the less they represent the purest meaning and implications of those It s all subjective to bias which in return cant be objective amp x200B So back to the question Is Pi appearing in both Torah and Market a coincidence We truly have no way of knowing and it wont matter Here s a fun example of that WallStreetJournal employee Burton Malkiel https en wikipedia org wiki Burton Malkiel jokingly claimed that a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper s financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts while beeing on a walk with a colleague They tested this for 14 years https www automaticfinances com monkey stock picking The monkeys beeing employees throwing darts btw cant spot the difference tho tl dr A monkey throwing darts is just as effective in predicting stocks as a professional human doing it with blood amp sweat for a decade Investing in an ETF would likely give you better returns then sweating your ass 10 hrs a day amp x200B BUT look at ma gainz 2017 NASA had 18 700 applicants for becomming an astronaut 11 got selected Another lil simulation from a science tuber Veritas https youtu be 3LopI4YeC4I t 221 estimates that only avg 1 6 11 applicants would be selected based on Skill Experience amp Hard Work alone Thats with luck only counting for 5 as a factor as opposed to Skill beeing 95 Yes in order to have that luck you gotta show up amp roll the dice Yes beeing experienced skilled and hard working gives you a better probability of beeing succesfull but luck plays the biggest role for an individual You got lucky There is more people that where just as experienced skilled and hard working then you can imagine but Its a useful delusion that you are in control of your own destiny Veritas in the same video seriously watch it amp x200B Final Verdict What does this mean for sick DDs Elliot Waves Doritos amp Mountain Dew The patterns exist but they wont help you get lucky Might aswell get a drink relax and throw some darts amp x200B Im curious what you guys think of that and what arguments you have for algorithmic trading and if that even related enough for not getting banned or deleted lol

CBG at UNDER 500 kg with no trace of THC Amyris is also involved with sweeteners vaccines plant based proteins monoclonal antibodies and more , Summary Amyris AMRS is a synthetic bio company they are a platform for programming the DNA of micro organisms to make them into living machines These organisms consume sugar and convert it to virtually any molecule cannabinoids proteins mRNA vaccine adjuvants vanillin etc They sell rare molecules to companies as a manufacturer In less romantic terms and extremely simplified Yeast breaks down sugars from grain to make beer yeah beer is yeast poop Beer is relatively low value Amyris twiddles yeast DNA so that when the yeast eat sugar they will poop PURE CBG out of those micro booty holes CBG is a rare and high value molecule Its modern day alchemy instead of turning lead to gold they turn sugar into rare molecules Why are they worth so little if they are so magical To the market Amyris looks like an old broken down synbio company that is grasping at skincare and clean beauty for life No hedgie would give a dead company such a deep dive It would be absolutely retarded of anyone to look at that balance sheet and decide to do constant research on a dying company for 6 years and that s where I come in amp x200B The market is focused on new synbio companies that are going public which have a focus on cellular programming machine learning Ginkgo and Zymergen Amy was one of the original older synbio companies that was focusing on biofuels 10 years ago It wasn t profitable and then they went silent During their silence they were burning a hole in their pockets by dumping in 70M into research every year And then they solved it They made one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs in modern history they could repeatedly program and optimize yeast to produce molecules at true commercial scale where the production cost approaches the price of sugar Their science was amazing but they got stuck because the company was in a 2B hole from all the research They have been clawing their way up since The market is completely unaware of this giant who is 8 10 years ahead of its competition and valued the lowest of the three They are unaware of Amy s technological might because on the outside it looks like a washed up biofuel company trying to do skincare This is a chance to beat the market to an extremely undervalued stock Amyris is turning the corner to profitability and is already producing 13 molecules at commercial scale CBG being one of them amp x200B FAQ Why are they so focused on Skincare Clean Beauty It has disgusting margins for them they make so much profit from it because it is high value and low volume The fermentation game is all about capacity by choosing skincare they maximized the money their single fermentation plant could make They are using these margins to claw themselves out of debt and it will eventually fully fund their operation amp x200B If you are interested you can follow along the Conference Call breakdown below where I will summarize the call If people like this sort of thing I may do more in the future amp x200B Morgan Stanley Amyris CEO John Melo Conference Call Breakdown Highlights Link https morganstanley webcasts com viewer event jsp ei 1460586 amp tp key 2ae2690d24 https morganstanley webcasts com viewer event jsp ei 1460586 amp tp key 2ae2690d24 2 35 13 commercialized molecules 24 in the pipeline 250 molecules where they have already engineered yeast to produce the molecule effectively 07 00 Amyris and Ingredion join in a 100M deal to produce RebM and other sweeteners Amy steals Ingredion s heart by being so darn sweet Info RebM is a rare molecule found in Stevia its sweetness profile is the closest to real sugar RebA is a shittier version of RebM that has some bitterness but is more available in the plant PureCircle produces RebA and RebM via plant extraction and is the dominant player in that market Ingredion bought 75 of PureCircle for 263M in 2020 One day Ingredion notices that it is losing customers to Amyris a skincare company They find out Amy is producing RebM at 30 lower cost than the plant extraction method from AND at a higher purity less bitter taste Ingredion offers Amyris 100M to manufacture RebM and develop other sweeteners for them They forked out that 100M a year after they bought PureCircle for 263M you know they weren t happy lol This is how disruptive Amyris is Ingredion benched PureCircle for Amy Amy turned one of the market leading producers of RebM into what will probably be only a RebM sales distribution channel for Ingredion I m sure PureCircle has some useful data that Amy can use too 16 00 On the left is Amyris Sandalwood derived from fermentation and on the right is plant extracted Sandalwood The discoloration is due to impurities that oxidize and create off notes in the scent Fermentation derived Sandal wood is cheaper to make more pure and easier to formulate due to its purity The scent also lasts 2x longer Amyris partners with Industry leaders who already know the market and demand for rare molecules Amyris manufactures the molecules through fermentation and the Industry leaders market it or formulate it into a product Amyris expects its business to generate 60 70 gross margins in a sustainable way into the future 20 35 Throwing shade on competitors Because Ginkgo and Zymergen are going public more data on them is public Amyris claims to be 8 10 years ahead of any synbio company across the world Gingko and Zymergen are not really making any product yet and they don t have Amyris experience in scaling John wants to step on the gas more to keep the lead They have been investing 70M into their core platform since 2011 even while everyone thought they were going out of business Amyris goal is a single design of a target chemical to commercial production in a single step It currently takes them 12 months or less to get a molecule to commercial scale and it costs 1M side note they did CBG in 9 months amp x200B 31 15 CBD is only mainstream because it is available at a lower cost In the same way RebA is a shitty version of RebM we are seeing that CBD is a shitty version of CBG when it comes to inflammatory properties Amyris is currently producing more volume of CBG at scale than any one else in the world They plan on going after the other minor cannabinoids as well Amy is producing CBG at the market cost of CBD currently and will soon be producing it at under 500 kg Amyris uses directed evolution they are constantly optimizing their yeast or other micro organisms to have higher yields which improves their costs over time They can get their prices extremely low due to their experience with biofuels Cannabinoids produced by precision fermentation have no detectable amounts of THC making it easier to get by regulatory hurdles They will be using this CBG to create a breakthrough new acne treatment Their plan is to own the CBG market before they open up and supply CBG to the rest of the world note how low can the cost go As of 2015 Amyris produced farnesene at 1 75 L it originally cost 16 L I have a hunch they produce farnesene at under a dollar

Analysis or reading the Horoscopes wallstreetbets reddit com https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nfojpr uwmc some techno mumbo jumbo analysis or reading Some technical analysis on the short term movement of the stock 2 UWMC Shorters have doubled down to manipulate the price in the Market wallstreetbets reddit com https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments ng5fx7 uwmc shorters have doubled down to manipulate the An explanation of the pre market move down that was hard I ll explain more in the commentary below So before I begin I just want to state that I respect the work you guys put into moderating this sub At 10 1 million degenerates that s a lot of work With that said I have concerns regarding your ruleset Namely that when multiple posts get removed people aren t actually aware of the reason for it Posts that otherwise meet the criteria to be posted are otherwise removed The reasoning i suspect is because your ruleset is extremely vague and leaves a lot of discretion Clarifying and expanding your ruleset would likely fix this and I have some suggestions First while you are under no legal obligation to moderate the content of this sub board under section 230 I appreciate you are assuming a duty of care to your community to ensure that they are somewhat protected With that said your ruleset and your content guidelines could stand to be strengthened In point of fact you are removing content that objectively meets your content guidelines Case in point is that I made an update to my YOLO nearly a month after my last YOLO and that was because i had very significantly added to my position since then However Memetron removed the post and was kind enough to tell me that YOLO updates were not allowed now even though DFV had been doing them I told him that i wasn t aware there had been a rule change since then and apologized However under your content guidelines linkflair wallstreetbets reddit com https www reddit com r wallstreetbets wiki linkflair wiki yolo there is no rule restricting what I did and I actually met the YOLO content guideline to appropriately post a YOLO Nevertheless I m not actually mad about it What i am a little annoyed by is that my post regarding the shorting in the pre market of UWMC was removed even though i provided a factual basis for everything there Shorters borrowed 145 000 shares from IBKR in the pre market when volume was thin to try to drive the price down and cover at market open after doing a stop loss raid They wanted to do it in the pre market because under rule 10b UWMC can t do their buyback until the market opens I caught it and explained what was happening but the post was removed After the post was removed at exactly 9 30 roughly 100k shares were covered Please note this is in reverse order and you can just see it yourself at Iborrow 87 3 150 000 2021 05 19 09 30 03 87 3 55 000 2021 05 19 09 15 03 87 3 55 00020 21 05 19 09 00 03 93 9 200 000 2021 05 18 16 45 03 Let s break down the numbers here If a shorter borrowed 1M to borrow at a 93 7 rate the calculation for what they d pay that day would be 1 000 000 937 63 000 Then you divide by 365 That would cost the shorter 172 6 to short it for the day Now the shorting activity caused the price to go down 3 59 So 1 000 000 1 0359 1 035 900 That nets you a profit of 35 900 172 6 35 728 I m sure people paper handed at a loss because they got scared Not many people are sophisticated investors and to be blunt not many sophisticated investors are actually sophisticated because the requirements to be labelled one don t actually apply to knowledge for the mots part They don t know what goes on and just look at a stock go green and FOMO in and look at it go red and paper sell for a loss As for the Technical Analysis i guess I misflaired it as DD instead of Technical Analysis I d also like to make it clear regarding something The I m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise thing is a meme Or i thought you guys were meming but apparently i need to lay it out The investment advisor act of 1940 sets forth the definition for an investment advisor There are three requirements to be defined as an investment advisor financial advisor 1 You need to be paid 2 to give financial advise 3 regarding a security So for example if I gave you advice as a financial coach regarding personal finance the SEC wouldn t care I would only need to be licensed and required to have a fiduciary duty of care to you if I was a financial coach that was being compensated by you and told you you should buy Microsoft Furthermore you also don t need to register with the SEC as a financial advisor unless you have a certain amount of assets under management and that number is high With that said each state requires you to register with them so there is that All three of these conditions need to be met for the regulations concerning financial advice and licensure to come into effect and for the SEC to be able to nail you Anyone offering DD is not being compensated by you and thus does not have a duty of care to you Market manipulation is also not something that you need to be afraid of provided that citations to well regarded publications are used or you refer to GAAP security filings Think 8K 10K s 13F s etcetera If someone is providing a stream of citations like I like to do I should not be flagged because i am reinforcing my point with objective data points Anyways some suggestions 1 Reinforce Update your ruleset and make points of clarification 2 If you manually remove a post post why as Memetron did for my Yolo post so that the individual can cure the defect and make his post compliant with the rules If it was a bot have the bot post the reason why 3 Add moderators solely for the purpose of responding to modmail I requested a reasoning as to why one of my posts was deleted three weeks ago and it was never responded to 4 Unironically you should probably crowdfund so that one of you can go have a consultation with a Securities Attorney on behalf of this sub Preferably one that was previously in the enforcement division of the SEC in a past life Take notes on what he says and you could even pay the individual to write you a content guideline that will act as a CYA since you all obviously feel compelled to even though you re not personally liable Furthermore you guys don t actually know much about what is and isn t allowable under the investment act of 34 amp 40 and so honestly its probably best you get a crash course in securities regulation and a ruleset that appropriately accounts for securities regulations This will probably not happen but Wikipedia does it so it s not a total lost cause

side due diligence I believe a lot of investors don t necessarily look at this point of view because time in the markets beats timing the market but hear me out I do recall Benjamin Graham also didn t really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if I m as shrewd of an enterprising investor as the man suggests I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is 1000 I can take it at market value or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good 10 20 discount That s approx 200 saved just by talking A save that you can get a good shirt knickers and socks to go with your new suit This is how I see price action technical analysis Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share Now to business Apple Inc Ticker APPL has been ranging since last year between 100 and 140 This is promptly after we had the split from 330 You would imagine that some investors who weren t involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price The distribution schematic chart https imgur com voCVxwf and annotations for visual At PSY which we would call the preliminary supply is where the first batch of selling took place hence the pause in price at the level But as you would have guessed investors bought the dip which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax BCLX At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given this is why it s so easy for the big guys to distribute liquidate his positions while we prop up the price With the first batch distributed price will automatically drop back to support this is the automatic reaction AR This is obviously because there aren t any strong hands fully committed to the stock anymore at least at that point in time But since we keep buying the dip not just novice investors even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure price will rally up again until the secondary test ST Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to support Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping While doing this it creates a low higher than the previous meaning the stock is still trending upwards giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher This is why after the up thrust UT price drops just a little then pushes even higher This would be the up thrust after distribution UTAD The big money here has now left the party Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume see bottom of the screen This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a big mistake to sell their Apple holdings but here s something you should understand An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life His aim is to get in at a good price get out when his objective has been met making a good profit out of the situation Warren and his partners bought low and sold dear as they always advise made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example Once the shares have been distributed into the market price keeps dropping The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market This means once we buy the dip off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting Why I believe we re reaccumulating now Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support inducing fear https imgur com oCYJz0l and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks months on the company or missed earnings This contribute to price declines While this may be seen as negative institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions sometimes even fund managers who don t know what they re doing will sell out during bad news and declines This would be the process called a terminal shakeout or a spring This is when a lot of fear is in the market shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands uninformed novice investors to strong hands In situations like these buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ceiling that s been keeping it low This level is where my limit orders https imgur com mqm1yyv are placed Once price has strong commitment big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark up would ensue This whole process can take weeks or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does The analysis here is based on price behavioral systems developed by Richard D Wyckoff a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof Hank Pruden from San Francisco Golden Gate University With this you can pair up with the typical

agree that Nucor NUE is the best in class of al the steel makers The company has excellent management owns a considerable amount of share through multiple end markets and generates high free cash flow for a commodity producing firm Its stock performance has shown its strength with its stock price rising from 50 to over 100 in the past 3 months Previously I wrote about why US Steel X could provide 2X or 3X returns Why I do not believe that NUE will hit 300 this year I do believe that it is worth considering in your portfolio With the steel prices continuing to maintain at all time highs Nucor has provided record results with that are expected to continue to grow this year Nucor s advantage Unlike traditional steel makers that use blast furnaces to produce steel NUE operates electric arc furnaces EAFs to produce steel The EAF is different from the blast furnace as it produces steel by using an electrical current to melt scrap steel and or direct reduced iron The EAF uses scrap steel and electricity to produce molten steel EAFs are generally cheaper to operate and allow NUE to adjust to changes in market demand This advantage has allowed NUE to become the 1 steel producer in the United States and one of the most profitable in the world Record breaking year Last month Nucor posted a record quarterly profit of 942 4 million or 3 10 per share for the first three months of 2021 https www cnbc com 2021 04 23 nucor ceo expects strong 2021 after posting record quarterly profit html text The 20company 20recorded 20 247 20billion mills 20segment 2C 20the 20company 20said https www cnbc com 2021 04 23 nucor ceo expects strong 2021 after posting record quarterly profit html text The 20company 20recorded 20 247 20billion mills 20segment 2C 20the 20company 20said This was the most profitable quarter in the company s history and next quarter will be even better Going forward analyst expect the company to earn approximately 12 89 per share These high earnings are attributable to the rise in steel prices Earlier this month the price of hot rolled steel touched above 1 600 ton before pulling back 3 Billion share buyback After posting record numbers NUE announced that its Board has approved the repurchase of up to 3 billion of the company s outstanding common stock Companies generally use share buybacks as a way to return capital to investors when they believe their share price is too low As of the time writing this post NUE has a 30 billion market cap which means this buyback program could effectively buy back 10 of the shares outstanding This new share repurchase program replaces the previously authorized 2 billion buyback program The company sees repurchase of shares to be made in frequent time intervals in the open market at prevailing market prices through private transactions or block trades The amount and time of repurchase will rely on market conditions share price applicable legal requirements and other factors The new repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date https finance yahoo com news nucors nue board approves upto 144402940 html guccounter 1 amp guce referrer aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8 amp

buyback the company has raised its dividend every year With the recent run up in the stock price the annual dividend of 1 62 only provides a 1 6 return However I would not be surprised if the dividend was raised again after their next earnings July 21 2021 The future is bright Recently Nucor and Array Technologies one of the world s largest manufacturers of ground mounting systems used in solar energy projects announced a supply agreement that aims to benefit both companies Under the new agreement NUE will supply the solar company with torque tubes and rolled steel which are needed for Array s production of several parts and components used in its solar systems It should be noted that NUE already supplies various products to the solar industry Last year the company said orders for products in the renewable sector had already exceeded the 2019 volume by 15 just through September 2020 Other considerations As a tailwind for the steel industry President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan which not only includes major spending on roads bridges pipelines which will help all steel producers but the plan also contains various spending plans on renewable projects which could also go to help NUE s growth It is expected that this will bill will pass even it cannot get Republican support The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated Conclusion NUE is a great company and a great long term play It s stock has had a good run over the past few months and investors should look to any dips as an opportunity to enter For investors with more of a risk appetite companies like X or CLF could offer greater returns
