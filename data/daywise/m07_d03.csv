cake But don t eat it This is my first big write up so be gentle As I am sure many of you are aware uranium is a popular topic with some people very big on uranium You might have even heard people talk about the uranium squeeze I m writing this DD to explain the uranium thesis and why I am very bullish on uranium NOTE This is not a short term play This is an investment and could taker months or even years I know crazy who waits that long for money If you re looking for a way to become rich over night this isn t it Go buy some SPY FDs or something and call me when you end up behind Wendy s Uranium why should I care Uranium is used for nuclear energy Specifically it is used by nuclear power plants to create electricity Now I know what you re thinking what about all that radiation Radiation leaking and contamination are actually not very common even though movies act like it is Plants are designed with this in mind and ways to prevent it When people think of nuclear they think of Chernobyl just know that was a case where a plant had a meltdown but the plant itself was not built to safety standards That s why that example was so bad Modern plants are not built like that and honestly it should have never been allowed to operate in the state it was in The other major one being Fukushima in Japan While people know radiation leaked there have been no reported deaths or cases of radiation sickness from that accident In fact the radiation has been contained and kept in water for treatment Japan is even planning to release the treated water into the ocean in the next 2 years So outside of these two major cases nuclear energy really hasn t had that sci fi movie effect of melting people or turning ants into giant city destroying monsters Now that we got past the scary part let s get into the benefits of nuclear energy For one it is carbon neutral A coal burning plant will release as much carbon in 1 hour as a nuclear plant will release in its entire lifetime of operation Not only is it a green energy source but it is vastly more efficient than other forms of green energy To get the energy of a single nuclear power plant you would need 430 wind turbines or 3 million solar panels and no that s not a typo Nuclear plants require 1 square mile of space while a wind farm needs 360 times more space and solar photovoltaic plant requires 75 times more space It s more efficient and takes up far less space than renewable energy sources This has a large impact on pricing as well When Japan shut down their plants in response to the Fukushima meltdown their electricity costs went from 17 wk hour to 1 kw hour That s more than 5 times the cost Similar price increases have been seen in Germany who also shut down many of their plants In fact Japan is now planning to reopen their nuclear facilities to deal with this electrical energy issue Finally unlike renewable energy sources nuclear plants can operate 24 hours a day 7 days a week have low maintenance needs and only need to be refueled every 1 5 to 2 years Nuclear energy and the future Nuclear energy is already a major source of electricity for many nations The US gets 20 of its energy from nuclear plants and nuclear accounts for 50 of the carbon free electricity produced Know how states are trying to go carbon neutral and want people driving electric cars Well if our cars go electric they re going to need a lot more energy production to maintain that and nuclear is the clear winner The US has already approved two new power plants being built in Georgia expected to be up and running in 2021 2022 There is also bipartisan support for increasing the US nuclear capacity to meet future energy needs France had pledged to decommission half their nuclear reactors but after seeing the energy issues of Japan and Germany they have decided not to do this anymore Then there s China China is looking to go carbon neutral to clean up their air and nuclear is their answer They currently have 17 new nuclear reactors under construction In total the world has 50 new nuclear reactors currently under construction including Russia India and the United Arab Emirates to name a few As the world turns to nuclear energy they re going to need more uranium to keep these plants going How do plants get uranium As stated before nuclear plants need uranium to run This uranium has to be mined and processed before it can be used at a plant In addition plants are specific so once the uranium has been treated it is only able to be used at that one plant From mining to processing it takes over a year for the uranium to be ready for a plant to use This means they need to have at least 2 years of stored uranium on hand at any given time Remember that Fukushima meltdown Well when Japan shut down their plants they had a lot of uranium on hand about 100 million pounds of unprocessed uranium So they sold it to the market This added a lot of uranium at once Japan in 2011 accounted for 10 of the worlds nuclear energy driving the price down Operating a uranium mine isn t cheap Take Cameco Corp CCJ They are the world s largest uranium mining company They also have one of the cheapest uranium mines to run For them to be profitable they need to get at least 30 pound of uranium Take a look at this graph below showing the price of uranium pound amp x200B https preview redd it lfae17a9uz871 png width 624 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 6b00ce3a4714a427d4b2715b88a633def0c3a663 Uranium today sells for just over 32 pound That s barely enough to be profitable for Cameco Corp and they have one of the most efficient mines out there For many mining companies uranium mining needs to be closer to 40 pound to be profitable The way uranium mining works is they sign contracts usually 10 years long with power companies at a set price Take a look at the same graph but now showing the last 10 years amp x200B https preview redd it lgb094sauz871 png width 624 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 06ddb7ecb0fb9e97cb589119ac6a82a429b08023 What you ll notice is starting around 2016 the price of uranium dropped to a point where it wasn t profitable for mines to operate So many of them didn t sign new contracts and stopped production Not only is production halted but these mines can t just be activated right away It takes time If a mine were to reopen today it would take 18 24 months for their uranium to be ready to be used at a plant There is a second way for plants to get their uranium This is through the secondary market These private groups have uranium they have bought up and are reselling to plants for their uranium needs Many mining companies will also buy this uranium to make up for deficits in production for their contracts However this supply of secondary uranium appears to be running out Take Denison Mines DNN They went to try and buy uranium on the secondary market and in order to fill their order they had to use 17 different suppliers Within this secondary market is also that 100 million pounds that Japan sold off when they shut down their facilities in 2011 However experts expect the Japan supply will be fully used up by the end of this year It is unclear how much uranium is left in the secondary market but experts predict between 2 3 years of uranium are left Uranium prices and the future So we have established two key things Uranium prices are currently too low for most mines to operate and uranium stocks are starting to run out So what does this mean Well simply put it s supply and demand As the supply drops the demand for uranium will go up As it goes up the prices will also go up Experts predict that Uranium will have to get to around 50 60 pound before most mines will be willing to sign new contracts That s double the current price Now remember these are 10 year contracts This is where the price increase for uranium will come from Also remember these companies are not running the majority of their mines or for some of them any of them So they will go to full capacity and make double the current market amount per pound These two things mean and stock go up Now that 50 60 price is not set in stone it could very well be higher as power companies bid against each other and the longer power companies let the supply drain the higher that price will be In the power industry many of them are in denial stating there is no current uranium shortage but it is estimated the US only has 2 3 years of stored uranium left and US companies 1 2 years worth These companies usually never let their supply drop below 2 years because it takes a reopened mine 18 24 months to get them that usable uranium So the longer they wait the more they will have to pay as they start negotiating contracts against each other to fill their needs The big uranium squeeze Yes I know I said the S word Don t start jumping around thinking you re about to buy all the uranium stocks and cause them to rocket That s not what it means Remember those secondary markets I talked about before Many are private buyers and in particular hedge funds Yes those hedge funds But no don t start booing in this case they re our friends Now put the torches down and let me explain When hedge funds start getting the feeling uranium supply is dropping they start buying up uranium And they buy a lot of it They try to take over the secondary market supply Why Because then when the power companies come to them to buy uranium they jack the prices up and squeeze them Yes the hedge funds cause a squeeze and this squeeze can cause uranium prices to soar Take a look at that chart again amp x200B https preview redd it o0puqojbuz871 png width 624 amp format png amp auto webp amp s adfd25c193b21f50f64b4725ff5f5c6460eed6a3 See that giant surge in 2007 Yep that was a uranium squeeze caused by hedge funds And when the price of the secondary market soars those mining contracts soar to match it Many mining companies in 2007 signed big fat contracts of 100 pound of uranium This is the gold mine where we go from making some money to having to decide which color Porsche we will be buying Now this is not a guarantee and most experts actually think it won t happen as most power companies remember 2007 very well and don t want that again But those same power companies are also in denial about the uranium supply and hedge funds have already started putting a low of money into uranium But even if this doesn t happen the stocks will still go up when uranium hits that 50 60 pound price range This would just be icing on the cake The Bear Case Yes yes I know we hate bears But I have to include it There are three major bear cases against nuclear The first and probably most obvious is the threat of another major meltdown If this were to happen the world could turn from nuclear and seek different energy sources Public opinion does play into the creation of new nuclear plants and we saw how 2011 s Fukushima meltdown caused Japan and Germany to turn from nuclear to new energy sources Second there is a chance there are uranium sources out there that are not accounted for Unknown suppliers could come out and show that uranium stocks are in fact not low While this would cause an issue in the short term it still wouldn t fix the fact that eventually they would still run out It s not like people can just come up with unlimited uranium without mining it The last one is if China decides to change their plans While not likely they could announce tomorrow they re changing from nuclear to a different energy source This would cause issues as it would remove a major nuclear nation But again it s not likely with 17 facilities already under construction Conclusion There you have it the uranium stock piles are going down not enough is being mined to maintain them and at some point the price is going to go up and when it does you re going to want to own shares in uranium As I said this is a long play and you should be prepared to have your money sit for 2 3 years maybe even more But the stage is set and at some point Uranium is going to go up Just make sure you re in before prices get out of reach TLDR Uranium supply is dropping and mining is limited because the price is low Low supply will cause a higher demand and we know supply plus demand money Final Note I didn t mention any company suggestions because I felt this DD was already long enough If people want I can make a follow up where I list out the companies and some pros and cons Positions DNN 200 shares UUUU 2 6 7 16 puts sold Will become 200 shares soon but I m playing theta with this one because it s been bouncing around a bit I will also be adding to my shares over time

into tendie sauce ,I am a substitute PE teacher who just finished googling this shit so do not take this as financial advice I m excited about this sexy fucking company though and I ll try my best to tell you why This is APPHARVEST short for Appalachian Harvest APPH has such an amazing mission that I wish I had more money to throw into it because I believe in it so much I m at just under 8k and the only other stock I have right now is 1 share of GME I ll upload proof if needed but idk if it matters Chase app doesn t let me screenshot or I would have already Put simply APPH is a vegetable farm that uses giant greenhouses to grow in weather and nutrient controlled hydroponics instead of using dirt That s kind of a big deal since soil is so depleted of minerals nowadays right now people eat more fruits and vegetables than ever in recorded history but still get less micronutrients from those fruits and vegetables than ever too APPH is based in the hills of the Appalachian mountains in the US their giant facility is capable of delivering produce to the US population faster than companies outside of the US most of tomatoes are from outside the US and tomatoes are currently what their biggest facility grows They re working on getting this tomato greenhouse running at the same time as a cucumber greenhouse and a green leafy veg greenhouse APPH doesn t use pesticides stuff to kill pests which is great because the US insect population on farms is down over 90 since the 1990 s due to these pesticides this is an absolutely insane critical issue that is being ignored by the media and public Farms make up a lot of our open land Think about your last road trip how many times did you have to wash your windshield from bugs none Yep but even in the 90 s you d need to wash at every damn gas station or you literally couldn t see It s almost like mass extinction of insects is actually mass extinction of insects crazy right Instead APPH uses bugs like lady bugs to control the pests that would eat the crops Speaking of the crops they stack these babies to save space the equivalent production to 1 800 000 acres of dirty farming is condensed down to their 60 000 acre greenhouse with 6 plants high of stacks and 5 time the amount of crop yield per plant That s 30 times the yield Plus they have year round growing since the weather is controlled it s like Central America climate without all the El Ninos and my wife s rich sexy Columbian boyfriends Not only do they require 30x less space they also use 90 less water than dirty farms because they recycle rain water for their crops so I m assuming rain generally only makes up 10 of a dirt farms water needs on average and it s 100 for APPH Maybe that s how that math works Again I have no clue what I m talking about so you should probably just ignore this entire post You know what you shouldn t ignore though They use AI robots on a rail system to pick the crops No cheap labor no unions no pay hikes no training people what to pick and what not to pick no human contamination no worries I think the company they bought in their recent merger owned the AI so now they own it Not positive what happened my brain is almost smooth as APPH s perfectly ripe tomatoes Tomatoes that are grown up in the mountains of America unlike most tomatoes why does it matter Freshness shipping costs both economical and ecological and sex appeal of course If you re going to a party identifying as a bottle of ketchup cross dressing then you want to stuff your ape bra with only the sexiest tomatoes of course Remember I said the greenhouses are weather controlled Well hopefully this isn t an imminent disaster but climate change is a bitch and it s only a matter of time the Pacific heatwave this year is probably just the start of the major issues we re bound to see in the near future Crops don t do well with extreme temperatures or sharknados so what happens when a ton of dirty crops spoil Greenhouse farming to the rescue APPH is from what I know which isn t much the biggest of these farm types Did you know that the US has been water seeding clouds since WW2 to control our crop air temperatures reduce hail and increase rain fall They ve been using silver iodide a substance that depletes the royal FUCK out of our ozone layer You know what sucks about that Everything If you eat from dirty farms you re supporting silver iodide and you re a fullturd milksop This isn t financial advice but it remains a fact that if you re not supporting APPH you re a horrible person just consider yourself a water wasting bad weather loving blanched dirt using bug hating cheap labor supporting unfresh tomato eating plant hater Another cool thing is that they have warrants available APPHW The W means warrants and for 11 50 you can turn the warrants into the real ticker What s cool about this If APPH goes up 5 that s only about 33 on the main ticker but if you re all in on APPHW then that s about 100 Now I ve read that warrants bring the average share price down because it s effectively doubling the available supply well that s supposed to mean something to me I guess but whatever because they ll expire eventually and then the stock will cum even more buckets of cucumber sauce on your tendies
