market share so how is one to know which is the company to own if they wanted to consider investing The answer is simply research And today I d like to share some of my own thoughts based on the research I have done to date 1 Tesla has arguably been the King in the EV Space for some time now and minted some individuals a tidy profit if they stuck with the company through thick and thin Being first in this space from a mass production standpoint has worked well for them However the crown is starting to tarnish There are quality concerns and recently the Model 3 lost Consumer Reports Top Pick Status and IIHS Safety Award after stripping features Safety concerns with the Model 3 is a big PR problem especially in the world s largest market China China is also worried about government employees owning Teslas due to perceived security concerns with surveillance One also must acknowledge that Tesla makes its money not from selling cars but from the regulatory credits it gets from governments around the world in their push to reduce carbon emissions Since Tesla only sells electric vehicles they get these credits for free and can sell them at a huge profit to other auto manufacturers who can t meet environmental targets It s big for Tesla but what one cannot look away from is the fact that Tesla IS NOT profitable from selling its cars At least not yet 2 Now on to Chinese Car manufacturers and there are quite a few The big names are Buffet loved and held BYD Li Auto which is relatively new NIO which has some similar roots to Xpeng Motors but isn t the same All mentioned here are true EV plays Xpeng Tesla and the race to autonomous driving 3 Autonomous Vehicles is truly the next play in this market and a necessary move for vehicles to go in Removing driver error is huge for safety and will save insurance companies a TON of money And in the AV space the race is between Tesla and Xpeng 4 Not long ago Musk charged Xpeng for stealing proprietary tech after a senior engineer left Tesla to join the Xpeng Team Same was said about a senior Apple engineer who left Apple s Car R amp D division and joined Xpeng as well Tesla sued the engineer and the linchpin was on the AV tech housed in Xpeng s XPILOT software Tesla argued that their tech was in their software In the end both companies agreed to allow an independent tech arbitrator to view both company s AV source code and guess what it was proven that both Tesla and Xpeng have their own source codes that were designed by their own R amp D efforts and nothing was stolen or was being shared That was BIG News 5 Xpeng in the quest toward Phase 5 self driving cars liked the safety and accuracy that LiDar tech provides Musk on the other hand scoffed at LiDar for years calling it a fool s play However years later Musk is now conceding there is something to LiDar and may even be developing with it But here is the rub Xpeng has it is using it and their software works very very well with all the various sensors combined Their new model the P5 was showcased at the Shanghai Auto Show complete with LiDar and that show gave Xpeng 10 000 pre orders on reveal day alone I can only imagine how that number has grown since and in October deliveries begin 6 Xpeng has a new manufacturing facility set to go online in December of this year which will ramp up the ability to produce more cars In 2022 they also have plans for 2 3 new models one of which will be a new SUV type 7 In the race toward full autonomous vehicle capabilities Xpeng is targeting 2025 as the year for this to be fully operational safe and complete That said they are logging thousands upon thousands of accident free XPILOT driver assisting kilometers with their cars doing a lot of the driving without needing help from the driver No sleeping behind the wheel yet but they are charting a significant course towards getting this done Tesla Well when was the last time you heard of an accident or life lost Probably not long ago so they still have a long ways to go I think and now Musk is backpeddling on his timelines for full AV capabilities SCALE 8 Like China or not with the GREEN push throughout the world and everything drivable going electric there really is only ONE country that can help to meet the demand China They are a manufacturing powerhouse and Xpeng is ramping up to get the world and humanity the cars they need SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE 9 A big hope for Tesla is that they can sell the software for their cars to have the capabilities they can have You want software assisted driving That s going to cost you like 4 grand as an option It s smart if it works well Xpeng has a similar hope but is really successful already in this strategy They also deploy OTA upgrades on what seems to be a weekly basis almost which is exciting like when your phone gets an Over the Air update and new features that same excitement is happening with XPeng s car owners and it is translating into more sales And while we are on the topic of sales you can t help but notice that Xpeng was the first Chinese EV Car company to start selling vehicles in Europe in Norway and plan to expand their distribution in more parts of Europe before the year is over In Conclusion Xpeng is an impressive company with huge goals for itself and they make technologically superior vehicles from many different angles Entertainment Drivability Safety Comfort etc I remember reading a quote of a comment that He Xiaopeng Xpeng CEO and Founder said to Musk and it went something like this We will destroy you in China and we will be an absolute nuisance to you in Europe and I think it won t be long if not already that He Xiaopeng lives up to his statement Xpeng is worth a serious look and currently has price targets north of 50 USD A great opportunity for a company of purchasing value today Do your own research and I think you will come to see the true Tesla competitor if not successor Xpeng Motors The One to Watch https en

believed to be transient largely the result of hiccups in the supply chain post covid compounded by economies and demand scaling back up quicker than expected However the market reacts and follows even temporary spikes in commodity pricing Commodity producers growers miners typically have fairly fixed overhead costs so when windfalls in pricing come their way their net income skyrockets This has been reflected in commodity companies share prices particularly since November when speculative tech biopharma renewables and the other beneficiaries of the 2020 bull run that were not tethered to fundamentals began to show their first signs of weakness in anticipation of the impending economic reopening Most analysts do not expect this commodity run to last too deeply into 2022 and for many

consolidation and shipping bottlenecks that promise to keep steel pricing high for the foreseeable future So long as China doesn t decide to abruptly walk back its new trade and pollution policies the

www reuters com article us clean enrgy fuel m a bp biomethane idUSKBN1684C5 for 155 million As part of the deal at the time CLNE signed a long term contract to purchase biomethane from BP The decision for CLNE was due to a desperate need of cash as at the time the company was still recovering after the massive oil price collapse and the natural gas trucks business proposal relied mostly on the diesel natural gas spread which after the OPEC increase of supply became extremely unfavorable Add into the equation the blistering Tesla narrative and the disaster is complete After the sale CLNE became a de facto distributor that is a very low margin business mostly dependent on commodities price oscillation Demand for natural gas kept rising over the quarters and in October 2018 CLNE asked BP to increase the RNG supply agreement https bioenergyinternational com biogas bp and clean energy reach agreement to increase rng supply In February 2019 CLNE set the goal to offer zero carbon RNG at all of its fuelling stations by 2025 https www cleanenergyfuels com press room clean energy sustainability goals outline road to 100 renewable zero carbon fuel 20 years ahead of californias electric grid Even if today RNG seems to be essential for the success of an energy company at the time the market was not so happy for the announcement RNG distribution margins are lower than the ones of fossil natural gas The company was likely aware of this and tried to increase margins with the zeronow program which linked the price of fuel for leased trucks to the diesel price minus an appealing fixed sum per gallon The program took more than expected to take off and was not able to affect margins considerably This is part of the reason why after the first UPS announcement in May 2019 https www cleanenergyfuels com release archive ups makes largest purchase of renewable natural gas ever in the u s the share price was not able to hold its gains In 2019 markets and policymakers were not able to weigh properly the amazing characteristics of RNG Hydrogen narrative was still in its infancy after more than two decades of losses and again the storytelling ability of Musk with the Tesla SEMI made everyone ignore RNG The analyst of Raymond James that kept a neutral rating on CLNE for most of the share price from 2 to 20 used to mention BEV trucks and buses during earning calls

global warming balance as the CO2 from the tailpipe emissions will have a 1 30x effect if compared with the collected natural gas amp x200B RNG production potential amp margins From the CLNE Q1 2021 earnings call we know that there are from five to seven billion gallons of dairy RNG available annually and that according to management it is going to take from 5 to 10 years to bring it online at the cost of 50 billion to 70 billion From the same call we know that in the USA 35 billion of diesel are consumed annually Please note that CLNE sells less than 100 million gallons per quarter with 560 fueling stations in operations On the margin side it is good to have a look at the question of Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse during the same Q1 2021 earnings call Manav Gupta Credit Suisse I actually wanted to quickly focus on the upstream RNG production versus downstream RNG distribution profitability here So let s say you have a company owned station and let s say you believe it s giving you 0 30 to 0 35 a gallon What I m trying to understand is is this Amazon deal giving you the volumes to develop the low CI RNG through your upstream partners and the profitability over there is 5 to 7 a gallon So if you split that half way that s like 3 a gallon So it doesn t really matter if on a downstream basis you make 0 30 a gallon or 0 40 a gallon the real benefit of this deal is that now you can go back to your partners Total BP and others develop the upstream RNG which is like 3 a gallon So the real benefit will come from the upstream side on the margin not really the downstream side Can talk about that Robert M Vreeland CFO Well Manav yes and no I mean there s value on both but you re absolutely correct that the demand that s created from a deal like this just completely supports our position on the upstream supply side Because look I mean after all the upstream is being developed with the intent of putting it into to get the highest value to put it into vehicles heavy duty vehicles And so when you come to the table where you have that and you have that demand then it s a pretty powerful upstream proposition Not to mention the economics that then flow into the upstream which is separate from that 0 30 0 35 you mentioned That would be in our case would be in the joint venture Now we will have those economics to the extent that we are the producer and we re using the gas from ourselves But we ll have to get it from other sources as we ll Andrew J Littlefair CEO Manav we also just on the source side I don t want those on the call to think well how are these guys going to develop all this RNG We because we are the sort of the choke point with the infrastructure and have the largest network we already take RNG for 40 different sources And that grows all the time And it will that will continue to grow But Manav you re right the upstream is very profitable But don t underestimate the value of the downstream per gallon And don t and what I say go back and look at my buildup and you might be surprised that at a station that we own our margin is better than what you re thinking It seems then that management confirmed the educated guess of the analyst which is around 3 of gross margins per gallon from the RNG production against 0 40 from the RNG distribution The reason why management underlined that also the distribution side of the business has potential may be related to the fact that the current network operates at 50 capacity thus average fixed costs will go down when the number of gallons will increase source Q4 conference call transcript amp x200B RNG PRODUCTION amp DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIPS OF CLNE Truck adoption leasing programs partnerships On the truck adoption at ports CLNE is favored by the recent decision of the LA Long Beach authorities decision https www porttechnology org news port of long beach exempts natural gas vehicles from clean truck fund rate which will equate treatment of Natural Gas trucks with BEV ZERO emissions ones Please note that there are more than 16 000 trucks operating at this port and as of Q2 900 trucks should be natural gas ones 6 market share As a reminder CLNE annual revenue depends on around 48 000 Heavy duty vehicles bus and trucks The company is working with Chevron and recently upsized the program with an additional 20 million leasing support from the oil company

the RNG production side of the business CLNE has partnerships with the following companies CLNE amp TOTAL JV https www cleanenergyfuels com press room clean energy and total sign joint venture to develop carbon negative fuel and infrastructure announced in March 2021 is a 50 50 partnership with an initial commitment of 100 million and can increase to 400 million as development opportunities progress In addition Total will be providing credit support for Clean Energy development in the RNG value chain including 45 million for contracted RNG fueling infrastructure Please note that the JV exposure can be larger than the funded amount due to leverage CLNE amp BP JV https www cleanenergyfuels com press room clean energy and bp create jv to invest in rng fuel production each company will retain 50 of the votes but BP will fund 50 million and CLNE will fund 30 million Please note that Chevron established partnerships on its own to set up RNG production facilities In September 2020 CalBio Dairy Farmers and Chevron announced their RNG JV https www chevron com stories calbio dairy farmers and chevron announce first rng In December 2020 Chevron and Brightmark https www waste360 com waste energy chevron and brightmark forge ahead four dairy rng projects are partnering to build and own four projects in multiple states to produce RNG In February 2021 Chevron and Brightmark https

30 CNG retail sites https csnews com chevron rebrand or open more 30 cng retail sites 2025 It seems clear that with 3 of gross margin per gallon the opportunity for CLNE and its partners is huge If just 25 of the distributed RNG is going to be produced in house it will represent a 300 million windfall for the company This may help to understand why analysts target prices are higher than today s price Although it is important to note that RNG plants require time to come online from 9 to 15 months therefore I think that we will see the first effect on the company s guidance later in 2022

42877bda75f7296c7851517a2bd2a6364e8df0bf Let me talk about Corsair Gaming CRSR A company that I have such a high conviction in that I have literally YOLOed my entire life savings and previous profits into Yes I made BIG money with CLOV and CLF and now that s all going into CRSR With over 170 000 in options and 2 000 000 invested into CRSR let me explain my thesis Let s be honest For the past few months the stock for CRSR has been significantly underperforming especially when you consider their recent amazing earning report The Esports and at home gaming market are already massive and ever growing Gaming is actually the quickest growing sector of the entire entertainment industry in its entirety CRSR is a company that is destined for growth not just based on their financials but also the fact that they are positioned within an industry that is currently experiencing massive growth rates right now and is expected to grow even faster over the next 5 to 10 years As of the June 16 market closing price CRSR is down 35 06 from its 52 weeks high of 51 37 As I will be explaining below CRSR s financials in no way justify the current low stock price or the significant selloff from its 52 week high Since March prices have pretty much remained stagnant and CRSR s forward price to earnings ratio Forward P E is 16 60x and a price to sales ratio of ONLY 1 60x Yes you heard that right CRSR S PRICE TO SALES RATIO IS ONLY 1 60x For context a similar company to Corsair Gaming is Logitech LOGI Logitech has a market cap of about 21 59 Billion which is 7 TIMES the market cap of CRSR and Logitech has a Price to Sales ratio of 4 11x The Price to sales ratio of Logitech is 2 5 times higher than that of CRSR With this in mind if CRSR had the same price to sales ratio as Logitech its market cap would be 7 91 billion making the average stock price 85 69 Not to mention that similar to how Nvidia and Razer have strong brand recognition Corsair also has strong brand recognition within the gaming industry that Logitech simply doesn t have Let s take a look at CRSR s recently reported 2021 Q1 earnings to understand their strong financial growth In Q1 of 2021 CRSR reported revenues of 529 414 million which is very impressive for Q1 Why is this impressive you may ask Well because this figure is just below the Q4 2020 figures with Black Friday and Christmas shopping both happening within that quarter Year Over Year that s the growth of 71 75 which really shows that Corsair Gaming is on the right growth trajectory for success Gross profit also increased for the quarter and Corsair has been posting positive net income over the past year s quarters which is amazing On top of that CRSR s operating cash flow both in the Q1 of 2020 and last year are substantial leading to positive free cash flow figures Corsair s balance sheet is also very good for a hardware company with a current ratio of 1 42 and a total ratio of 1 57 meaning that Corsair s financial position is more than adequate amp x200B https preview redd it mwombvkn0u571 jpg width 859 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 3ca121add8603a3de01ba631626c36af739c2af7 Taking a look at projected revenues and net income growth CRSR is an exciting growth company despite its short term market value By 2025 total revenues are projected to be just under 3 5 billion but in my opinion I believe that Corsair will reach this value much sooner In fact forecasted annual earnings growth is also at 21 8 which for a company that s focused on growth remains quite high and above the industry average https preview redd

maintain their growth momentum which is showing no signs of slowing down I have no doubt that this company is going to reach high figures as the company keeps producing better and better numbers not

other founder is Peter Thiel or Daddy Thiel You might say he is a powerful man and he handles the other side of american politics Thiel is an extremely influential and powerful billionaire contrarian

to understand the facts I am about to present to you With a ton of hype and plenty of meme power PLTR rose to past 40 a share earlier this year Most if not all did not truly understand how special the technology was and it fell on FUD surrounding stock based compensation and Daddy Karp selling shares We will get to this FUD at the end W hy it s special MOAT I see people say it s just data analytics anyone can compete with them no This is like people saying it s just an airplane copy it and it should fly great An analytics platform that is able to gameify real world problems in real time and present solutions using integrated Ai ML is a MASSIVE engineering problem Think a ton of PHD level skilled engineers making the highest salaries in Tech So much that they can retire after a few years if they want Now imagine them working for 17 years on something before any other company even thinks to start competing This is a bigger moat than many darlings of the tech world have in their software such as TSLA which had google apple etc working on competing solutions for years And it has saved it s clients MILLIONS in Skywise For anyone in the software space you know how brutal implementation is for SAP and similar platforms Often it s unsuccessful and expensive PLTR is already demonstrating PROFITABLE implementations This is a sign of a massive moat for anyone who understands the enterprise software world This is just a summary of one application of PLTR s Skywise platform built on Foundry They are going to do this to every industry true prescriptive analytics

company Their margins aren t the best as they continue to invest and maintain future monopoly status but they are landing 300M govt deals SOCOM and expanding that business which is EXTREMELY STICKY Their revenue growth officially is about 30 per year However as all SAAS companies do internally they have a goal target of around 50 per year That is absolutely achievable in fact a few large deals can accomplish this AND MUCH MORE I would argue this in itself is sandbagging due to the potential size of their enterprise deals just ONE big deal would annihilate that number and they have been

hard to scale Companies won t buy it SAP is horrible and it s implemented all the time takes years to implement costs HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to implement and is often not successful It s actually a running joke in the enterprise software world Palantir has a history of successful implementations it s custom but designed so low code it can be developed and delivered quickly in any enterprise a testament to the 17 years that Karp and Thiel spent training their team in high gravity lul This is like a SMART salesforce which by the way was the fastest growing software company IN HISTORY and is worth 400B now and it has competition in the CRM space PLTR is the next evolution and has ZERO competition Salesforce was created to be a single source of truth in an enterprise Pltr takes that a step further by allowing you to simply plug in business units and allow it to act as your sky net and tell you what to do It literally is that incredible It s true mass available prescriptive analytics sprinkled across an entire company Is it unreasonable to think the mkt cap of pltr could be a multiple of salesforce in the near future when it is the next evolution of data platforms has no competition and salesforce previously held the record for fastest growing software company in history amp x200B 2 Daddy Karp made the most of any CEO this year and he sold hundreds of millions of shares The way he is paid his Stock granted is income So he pays TAXES on it That means he has to sell shares just to cover the taxes so he doesn t go to federal prison The dude can t pay it any other way he doesn t have hundreds of millions of dollars laying around he s spent 17 years building this as his baby This is all stupid media FUD because it makes awesome headlines and scares the shit out of boomers that aren t used to the financing around an insanely fast growing software company The numbers look crazy on the surface but make sense once you realize it s all because of the meteoric rise in the stock price 3 They are compensating their employees with Stock It Dilutes us They are hiring the worlds best software engineer PHD Data Scientists to make sure their moat and monopoly doesn t even come close to being encroached on These people are expensive They continually train their models in their client s environments without keeping their clients data only evolving their own model This maintains privacy and creates momentum for their algorithm that makes it impossible to catch up to PLTR s Foundry Think google with their threatgraph for search They have too much

with 50 growth yoy which will accelerate as proof of concept is demonstrated at large orgs My price target is 80 EOY because I believe at least one HUGE contract will roll in that will provide further proof of FOUNDRY as a concept and the impact will be undeniable Companies will be lining up to get Foundry and projected demand will show implied growth off the charts that no one has accounted for The Skywise project finalized my opinion on this PLTR told them WHEN VALVES IN ENGINES WERE BEHAVING ODDLY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED PRIOR TO FAILURE OPTIMALLY TO SAVE MILLIONS A YEAR PER AIRLINE IN SCHEDULING AND OTHER COSTS you can read about that on another subreddit the info is out there if you do a google search on skywise Price target in 4 years 500 1 its Cathy Bae s Number not for that time period but also because I think revenue growth will be more like salesforce was as a necessary platform to enterprises This would give it a larger MKT cap than Salesforce If this becomes a hyped

the float up to 250m shares I thought this would be the turning point for CLF but investors gobbled it up and the dip was short lived This told me X is gonna X no matter what it s the United Steel States Corporation founded by J P Morgan himself among others Even with ZERO recent hype while CLF has WSB eyes for a week you can see that X moved parallel as steel should to CLF and maintains the lead That will continue CLF goes up X will rise harder More upside 2 indicates the run up pre post earnings Most steel companies report earnings at a similar time CLF will be the next one in mid July

CLF but reported higher earnings Adjusted EBITDA EPS in Q1 2021 As X has higher margins assets and debt overall US steel has a lot more room for recovery growth than other steel stocks which it is primed to obtain AND beyond at this rate The Return of the King is in the works X has dividends It s small but a company to post one of their most profitable years in history with raised guidance after a shares offering will likely return something to shareholders RKT special 1 dividend Torchlight Energy special preferred A dividend share Not sure Expecting something on this front towards their earnings next month however Price targets by analysts don t matter and often I m more tempted to sell than buy depending on the coverage But JP Morgan along with other banks are hoarding literal billions in cash due to QE inflation and low rates and they won t sit on it for long they re going to buy in if not already They are smart money after all Here are the price targets for X Credit

and this is a casino So here are two main reasons why I like X 1 Market Capitalization X s market cap is one of lowest among steelmakers Their float at 260m shares is half of 500m in CLF and other stocks like WISH AMC BB so on Market cap is the biggest reason why we likely will never see something like GME again Before last week CLF s daily volume of 18m 4 float was lower than X s volume of 21m 9 float despite having double the available shares X moves more swiftly and momentously than you can expect of this boomer I imagine X s volume to heading into July without a doubt They are THE United States Steel after all soon to post historical earnings in a commodity boom 2 The United States Steel Corporation US Steel Ticker X Fucking X Understand I own X and if it ain t worth just for the sexy

technicals 22 short interest or more Let me start off by saying there s been a lot of p d s going around right now this is unfortunate because legitimate tickers get lost in the mix Saying something is memeable ItS a PlAnE cOmPaNy its LITERALLY tAkInG oFf Lol or iT rHyMEs wItH YOLO is not DD They might spike up but they will fall down I ve been around since retards yolod their life savings on Riteaid if I post about a stock here I m holding it for the long term because the chart will go up Yesterday I posted about GOEV https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments o0k89j car wars episode ev a canoo hope why goev can be while it took a hit from its high it s still up over 10 from the post and I expect it to continue growing it s a solid company with good fundamentals and everything I wrote about it holds up same for ASO What is ASO ASO or Academy Sports Outdoors is a sporting goods store that recently IPO d and has not stopped it s steady traversal upwards since With new institutional backing and investors plus unmatched earnings for its sector and a nice short float I believe this stock has one of the brightest futures on this sub and it s JUST starting to get noticed First things first short interest Everybody likes a good word that rhymes with fort sneeze ASO short interest is currently 22 of the float Compare that to their 1 mo 3mo or 1 yr chart and you can see that the shorts have CONSISTENTLY been BTFO This will keep happening and analysts agree it is rated BUY by every major analyst from barchart to fidelity to nasdaq It s honestly a mystery why no one here is paying attention to it but once it starts flying it wont stop until it hits 60 70 where it belongs Along with a small market cap this will move the stock quickly Unusual options activity Look at the option flow for the past week https i postimg cc 02q48KLt bullish call flow png and month https i postimg cc fyHSg9Xw bullish call flow 1 month png 100 bullish this has heavy

don t care about but should because it s the difference between stocks that crash and ones that don t Long Term and Fundamentals LOOK AT THAT FUCKIN P E ASO has blown earnings out of the water pretty consistently but last quarter was their best yet With a P E of 10 which makes this stock insanely undervalued they currently have a forecasted growth of near triple for 2022 Like I said earlier every analyst says this is a buy stop falling for overpriced stocks with no fundamentals ASO has solid earnings and a terrific debt position Earnings Earnings were absolutely blown out of the water this last quarter Adjusted income of 182 5 million vs Q1 2020 400 000 income EPS estimate of 0 84 vs actual eps of 1 89 Revenues up 40 year over the year to 1 6 billion with an estimated 1 51 Billion

care provider compensated through a fixed per member monthly fee from insurance companies Because of this Cano Health and comparable companies assume all risk and reap all benefits from costs of treatment This structure incentivizes preventative care to stop health issues before they happen which means lower costs for patients and Cano Health This can be seen in action through Cano s lower

How do Medicare and Medicare advantage work for senior citizens Medicare is a government run taxpayer funded health insurance program for primarily senior citizens over the age of 65 barring some exceptions Medicare allows senior citizens to go to any care provider who accepts it and receive treatment care Medicare is broken up into 4 key parts which are the following 1 Medicare Part A Medicare Part A covers Inpatient Care in Hospitals Skilled Nursing Facility Care Hospice Care and Home Health Care This is generally at a low cost to most seniors provided they have paid Medicare taxes for a long enough period They still may have some coinsurance payments and deductibles however 2 Medicare Part B Medicare Part B covers Services from doctors and other health care providers Outpatient care Home health care Durable medical equipment DME like wheelchairs walkers hospital beds and other equipment and Many preventive services like screenings shots or vaccines and yearly Wellness visits Patients using Medicare Part B generally have to pay a monthly fee similar to normal health insurance and in doing so any care received by the patient is covered and paid for by Medicare 3 Medicare Part C Medicare Part C is also known as Medicare advantage This is essentially an all in one package that serves as an alternative to Original Medicare Parts A and B Medicare Part C is fulfilled through private companies which are vetted and approved by Medicare These packages generally include the benefits offered in Medicare Parts A B and D but may also include other services such as vision hearing and dental 4 Medicare Part D Medicare Part D is an optional Medicare program run by private companies who are regulated by Medicare It s primary purpose is to Help Cover Costs of Prescription Drugs and Protect Patients Against Future Increases in Drug Prices Currently there are 24 1 million seniors on Medicare Advantage plans representing 30 of all Medicare patients This

routine health checkup 10 tests are run on the patient whilst they are there In the fee for service model Medicare is billed for all 10 of these tests individually This model creates incentive for more individual services Volume to be done on patients rather than high quality and important care Under fee for service models cost variations for procedures and tests increased and the healthcare industry was spending more to treat patients even though patient outcomes were not necessarily improving The model also challenged provider workflows because physicians were seeing more patients and each claim had to be processed in a fragmented network On the flipside Value based care models create a much better environment for everyone Value based care models are based on patient outcomes not quantity of services provided to patients Unlike the traditional fee for service model value based care is driven by data because providers must report to payers on specific metrics and demonstrate improvement Providers may have to track and report on hospital readmissions adverse events population health patient engagement and more Cano Health has successfully lowered Mortality Rates Hospital Admissions and ER Visits despite Covid 19 and all the challenges brought with it which proves the model s success https preview redd it 2sud290r0u571 jpg width 850 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s

annual membership growth with additional growth from acquisitions 2 Has strong tailwinds in an industry with increasing pressure for cost reductions and a shift towards value based care from fee for service care 3 Cano currently serves 113k members in 15 different markets With this they only have 6 penetration in existing markets The overall TAM is enormous at 24 1M Medicare Advantage enrollees in 2020 with that set to grow in the future years This leaves Cano with plenty of runway to grow organically and through acquisitions 4 Extremely favorable comps to OSH which put a fair value for this at 30 dollars based on revenue multiples 5 86 revenue CAGR 6 Raised ebitda revenue and membership guidance from management 7 Recent acquisition of University Health Care increasing their market share and exposure in Florida a place which is among states with the highest enrollments in Medicare Advantage in the country 8 Reputable Analyst Nephron Research initiated a price target of 22 dollars with more to follow from other institutions in the near future 9 Great institutional PIPE holdings from the likes of Fidelity Blackrock and Third Point who in addition purchased shares from the open market

states as well 85 of their employees are bilingual and 80 of Cano s members are minorities Most of the largest states for Medicare have substantial minority Spanish speaking populations which gives

presented an amazing entry price for an otherwise bullish disruptive fintech company Root is using data driven telematics and proprietary pricing models to deliver fairer more accurate pricing to customers Customers download an app on their phone and the phone tracks the user s driving behavior Every 9 months the data collected allows Root to reiterate its pricing models Each reiteration will allow further cost reductions During last year alone they were able to grow written premiums by 37 Bigger insurance companies are increasingly adopting telematics Right now companies like state farm use third parties to collect data and use it as an adjuvant to their traditional pricing models Overtime though with data science using telematics is going disrupt the insurance industry pricing models Root in the future could offer SaaS to major insurance companies There are two main points here 1 The insurance market has Big PP energy with 266 billion in annual premiums in the U S alone and is mandated purchase in most states 2 The data is clear that consumers have traditionally been very dissatisfied with their car insurance experience describing it as complicated confusing unwieldy and as pleasurable as spending your day off at the DMV Business Models Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a persons driving skills Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone and it tracks their driving allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share Root Insurance Company provides car insurance to drivers in 30 U S states and growing Root requires drivers to download their mobile app and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background If the driver passes the driving test they are offered a premium which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies Root offers a discount to Tesla owners who drive using Autosteer mode making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a semi autonomous vehicle https imgur com UX504jG New ROOT who dis Tremor and Root Inc the parent company of the Root Insurance family of insurance companies today announced that Root has successfully placed its June property catastrophe program with Tremor Panorama As the leading online marketplace in reinsurance Tremor enhances the placement process by using modern technology to help provide a more efficient and data rich experience When we got the call that the Root team wanted to place their entire property catastrophe program with us we were thrilled This team is known for being thoughtful and for their commitment to innovation says Sean Bourgeois Tremor s Founder and CEO In less than a week we were able to organize the placement and bring more capacity than was needed allowing Root to manage its long term relationships during the process We were particularly excited that we could bring new markets to the program while delivering competitive pricing subject to their constraints in record time Tremor has recently announced more than 1 billion in new placement commitments with 20 more reinsurer capacity in the last quarter alone and continues to add new insurers and reinsurers to its platform each month New Leadership ROOT a leading AI technology provider for insurance and parent company of Root Insurance Company today announced key additions to the executive leadership team as it launches into its next chapter of growth Anirban Kundu will join as Chief Technology Officer on June 21 and Michele Streitmatter will join Root as Chief People and Organizational Effectiveness Officer on June 28 Root has evolved at a breakneck speed since we were founded in 2015 I m so proud of the company we ve built and where we are today says Root CEO Alex Timm By welcoming Michele and Anirban to our executive leadership team we re amping up two of the most important areas of our business our people and our technology Both Michele and Anirban bring integral experience to our leadership team as we continue to use technology to disrupt the insurance industry RootReady The parent company of the Root family of insurance companies today celebrates more ways for drivers of connected cars to get quotes based on their driving behavior with RootReady RootReady pairs sensors from connected cars with the Root experience allowing drivers who own a 2015 or newer General Motors vehicle including Chevrolet GMC Buick and Cadillac models to get an instant quote in the Root app without taking the Root test drive This means drivers of 2015 or newer GM vehicles can receive a quote from Root today using data from their connected cars More than 90 of new cars sold in the U S today are connected Root is meeting drivers where they are today with where the market is headed tomorrow through both mobile and vehicle connectivity As the overall volume of connected vehicles continues to grow RootReady offers drivers the option to further simplify the quoting process receiving all the benefits of a fair quote without any wait Root has been built to fundamentally understand the intersection of data and telematics says Root CEO Alex Timm Our expertise and understanding in rating driving behavior allows us to leverage the rich data from OEMs to more fairly price drivers and positions us to extend our leadership as the data gets better Valuation ROOT can not even compare LMND because they are two different businesses but at LMND s multiple ROOT would trade at 65 And if ROOT is successful in capturing 2 of the 266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth 10x BUT instead of doing Voodoo math there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of 27 This is at the crosshairs of disruptive technology and Agnes trend that is too strong to ignore Additionally direct written premiums of 203 million were the highest in the company s young history representing a 23 increase from last year s first quarter and a 39 increase from the fourth quarter of 2020 Management was also happy about its direct loss ratio of 71 its best quarter with the exception of the second quarter of last year which saw drastically fewer claims due to less driving amid the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic 2021 Guidance Outlook for FY 2021 is as follows Direct Written Premium in the range of 805 855 million Direct Earned Premium in the range of 685 715 million GAAP Total Revenue in the range of 270 300 million Direct Contribution in the range of 25 35 million Operating Income in the range of 555 505 million Marketing spend As outlined we plan to more than double sales and marketing investments in 2021following a COVID driven pullback last year Growth While our modified approach to state expansion in 2021 has deferred some of our written premium growth to 2022 we are still targeting significant growth acceleration during the year Inflation The auto insurance market historically has annual embedded price increases Our guidance does not include any inflation assumption in 2021 given the uncertainty around COVID 19 and our competitor pricing levels Retention We may experience areas of increased customer churn as we implement our pricing and telematics models in unseasoned states Loss ratio Importantly our state expansion adjustment allows us to improve our expected Direct Loss Ratio outlook and Direct Contribution for the year as we reduce the impact of new unseasoned states on our loss performance Our 2021 guidance does not assume any material impact from COVID 19 whereas we believe that 2020 included 6 points of annualized loss ratio improvement related to the pandemic Reinsurance Due to positive loss ratio trends we elected to postpone extension of our January 1 treaty until April 1 when we expect to obtain superior terms We believe this will drive higher GAAP Total Revenue as we retain more premium in the first half but it has a negative impact on Operating Income due to reduced ceding commissions Bear Case Cash Burn Bank of America initiated coverage of Root with the Rating of underperform and a price target of 9 They figure that Root won t be cash flow positive for at least 5 years They expect that Root will require not insignificant cash infusions from the capital markets to bridge its cash flow needs Let s look at some of the numbers With their IPO Root raised 1 1 billion in cash In the most bearish of analysts estimated cash burn Root has enough in the bank to make it well into 2021 without needing to raise capital On the highest end of Root analysts estimates Root can make it to 2023 without a capital raise with profitability only a few years out To summarize even with Root burning cash at a high rate the company has enough in the bank to stay afloat without capital infusions for several years When the time does come I believe it will have grown out its system enough to be a very attractive buyout target Root s loss ratios improve significantly as the customer base ages Conclusion ROOT is a misunderstood short This is a disruptive tech company and investors have an opportunity to buy the stock at bargain prices vs what the smartest tech investors in the world paid just five months ago A high loss ratio is to be expected in a growth insurance company because of the higher percentage of new customers which are harder to price with a lack of history Also the longer that Root is operational the more data they will have to use in fine tuning their models All of the data points to much lower loss ratios in the future Cash burn isn t a huge issue due to the massive amount of cash in the bank The base case has Root coasting for more than two years without needing a capital infusion Who owns gROOT Lockup ended in April 26th and shook out many of the weak hands leaving an amazing buying opportunity for new investors Insider Ownership is

known and there are plenty of DD s on why CLOV will surpass 50 150 in the short midterm However I m not going to get into that My goal with this post is to explain how CLOV is revolutionizing the healthcare industry much like TSLA did in the auto industry and give my perspective on why it will outperform its competitors TL DR First intro they re changing the game just like Tesla did back in the day Next they re growing but the haters gon hate Why Because CLOV is the first of its kind and troglodytes hate change Wrap it up be dead inside cuz studies show the highest returns went to people who are dead or forgot their account This is 10 Luck 20 Skill Have you or a loved one ever gone to the doctor more than once to get a diagnosis for a problem you can t figure out The doctor reviews your file each time but always gives the same answer Let s do another test I ll refer you to It seems like you re never making progress because either your doctor has run out of ideas or isn t familiar enough with your medical history Now imagine an elderly person navigating this same system trying to remember what tests they ve had done and their results on their own This is impossibly difficult for anyone to deal with and it s exactly the problem Clover Health is trying to solve Their AI learning and database Clover Assistant make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing repetitive diagnoses and it consolidates a patient s medical history into one platform This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts 15 Concentrated Power of Will Clover Assistant is offered for free and currently they re taking a yearly net loss to improve their AI which will eventually pay off just like Tesla s AI One problem they may face in future is their competitors integrating machine learning into their platforms as well but by then Clover will be years ahead of them with no hope of any of them catching up 5 Pleasure 50 Pain Last week CLOV announced new partnerships with Upward Health https finance yahoo com news upward health announces contract clover 124500091 html and the U S Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services https www globenewswire com news release 2021 06 09 2244291 0 en Clover Health to Scale In home Primary Care Program Through Direct Contracting html expanding their in home and virtual service offerings Considering the trend towards virtual healthcare this is extremely good news and helps strengthen its fundamentals growth Everyone can clearly see how well Teladoc is doing with their in home service and this integration will only continue to improve and expand as they cater to our convenience laziness This is not priced in due to the volatility in the stock market Sidenote If Hindenturd s claims were even remotely true CLOV would not be expanding their partnership with Medicaid Medicare only for it to fizzle out in a year Besides with all the fear of inflation it s important to remember that healthcare companies do really well during inflationary periods unlike most other industries In spite of the evidence of growth you ll continue to hear nothing but bad press about CLOV particularly being compared to its competitors These comparisons are nonsensical for multiple reasons first this is not an outdated dying business it has a real future in the rapidly growing healthcare tech industry Secondly none of CLOV s competitors currently integrate machine learning into their platform and are still using archaic methods of service delivery Similarly TSLA had bad PR almost daily when constantly compared to regular auto makers even as the company continued to roll out new and improved technology like their autonomous driving tech I did not let the bad press deter me from purchasing TSLA for 38 40 per share price after split and as the market and media has realized the nuance and innovation of the company my conviction paid off CLOV is the same it s not just a regular health insurance company it s a disruptive tech company that uses AI to enhance its database for more profitable and superior care for their future growth Sidenote One of my favorite investors Baillie Gifford has 5 million shares of CLOV and he bought 2 3 million shares of TSLA at 8 a share during its bearish news cycle period Circling back why do so many analysts have negative sentiment towards Clover Health It s because they re constantly comparing it to the outdated healthcare insurance companies the same exact way Tesla was compared to Ford GM Toyota and Nissan In Tesla s time there was nothing else to compare it to Tesla was the only one of its kind in its sector Heck Tim Cook wouldn t even meet with Elon when he tried to sell his company to Apple for pennies on the dollar in 2018 Imagine passing on what would become a trillion dollar company MISSED OPPORTUNITY EEEEEK If the negative press was so convincing it begs the question why didn t institutions and Chamath dump some or all their shares at 28 per share Because they re not paperhand losers These institutions rarely sell their stocks for a 2 3x return when they invest they re looking to hold long for a much much greater return They base their investment decisions on solid fundamentals therefore if they are still holding CLOV the company must have a legitimate future of success Institutions are not emotional Retail investors on the other hand are the real paperhands Many get in for the short term make 100 return give away 30 to Uncle Sam and leave with 70 in change This isn t a bad return at all by any means but a lot is left on the table when one makes emotional decisions Take a look at any successful company and their stock volatility over its lifetime and you ll see MANY major dips Folks who sold on those dips are probably filled with regret but the Buffets of the world who are dead inside have reaped the rewards The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient Warren Buffett And 100 Reason to Remember the Name CLOVER HEALTH Like I said before I m not here to talk about the short mid term potential of CLOV 100 but rather the long term potential of CLOV 100 If y all have been following Chamath as I have you ll know he s known for making conservative valuations In 2018 he said Tesla would triple it actually went 22 5x at its peak currently at 15x Whether you like the guy or not he has a stellar track record On top of that he is one of the very few who stood with retail investors against market manipulation This short term volatility doesn t deter me I am long on this company and will not sell my position for a measly 2 3x gain I ll leave you with what I think is the most succinct outlook on Clover Health that s been shared So when you bring all of this forward and you think about the future here s what I see in a nutshell Number one is a business that is actually delivering the promise of technology improving better outcomes and lowering costs in healthcare Number two is a market that I think is huge and growing quickly And number three is a business that is consistently taking share year over year over year And so when you put all of these things together in my opinion this is one of the most straightforward investments I ve ever made It s a business that I think will become extremely valuable It will build a lot of enterprise value and will be what I think is going to be our next 10x in 10 years investment Chamath Palihapitiya

place a price target for MX at 30 or higher that they have shown they are willing to actually execute at Regardless of successful buyout MX is highly undervalued at its current 23 25 price point What is MX Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation is an odd company that is incorporated in Delaware is headquartered in Luxembourg and operates almost entirely in South Korea designing and manufacturing analog mixed signal and digital semiconductors Among its various product offerings Magnachip most notably controls the second largest market share globally for OLED display driver integrated circuits preceded only by Samsung Recently their stock has seen a lot of up and down movement due to a combination of multiple potential buyout offers shareholder litigation and federal regulatory interference that given the following information presents a clear buy opportunity at the current price point Note This post won t be covering any financials or other fundamentals regarding the company simply the details regarding the company s merger status and effective price implications 1st Buyout Offer Wise Road Back on May 25th Magnachip confirmed the details of a merger agreement with South Dearborn Ltd https investors magnachip com static files 40589cb3 9433 4d68 af2c 62e1c76af403 a sub corporation for a Chinese private equity fund Wise Road Ltd with a track record of acquisitions in the semiconductor manufacturing industry in Asia for a buyout offer proposing the acquisition of all outstanding shares at a price of 29 per share This led to an overnight increase in share price from the low 20s range to 25 It would continue to trade in this range with a slow decline to around 23 until this past Friday June 11th when a second unsolicited buy offer came through from Cornucopia Capital Ltd https investors magnachip com static files af010acc 8ffb 4482 b8a6 aa02436ee7d1 page 11 amp zoom 100 21 9 on behalf of another group of Chinese investors This unsolicited offer was significant due to the fact that the initial merger agreement with Wise Road included a No Solicitation provision that restricted Magnachip from attempting to directly solicit any competing offers that might have pressured Wise Road to raise their initial purchase price 2nd Buyout Offer Cornucopia This second buyout offer came with a proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of MX at 35 per share compared to Wise Road s 29 per share offer However Magnachip was already quite far along in its deal with Wise Road and had plans to gather shareholder votes by June 14th to approve deny the acquisition and announce the results and further details of the acquisition at a virtual shareholder conference on June 15th This bid from Cornucopia led to Magnachip delaying the shareholder conference until June 17th while Magnachip s board and legal team reviewed the new potential deal with Cornucopia with a deadline of 5 00 P M June 16th Which was yesterday meaning there s going to be a press release in the immediate future US CFIUS Review On May 26th the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States CFIUS requested that Magnachip and Wise Road submit a notice for a formal review of the merger which both parties complied with and filed on June 11th Now Magnachip itself has released statements in their SEC filings stating that they do not believe that there should be any approvals required for the merger in the US for the following reasons as quoted from their filing gt All manufacturing and research and development activities take place in South Korea and substantially all sales activities take place in South Korea with the remainder of sales operations located in China Hong Kong Taiwan Japan and Germany Substantially all of the employees are based in South Korea and employed by Magnachip Semiconductor Ltd the Korean operating company and the remainder of the employees are located outside the United States There are no tangible assets or IT systems located in the United States and all intellectual property is owned by Magnachip South Korea or to a very limited degree other non U S subsidiaries of the Company Source https investors magnachip com static files 8117620b c4f2 485b b80e c9cadbdfec88 On June 16th the CFIUS imposed an Order Establishing Interim Mitigation Measures ordering Magnachip and Wise Road to completely halt all further progress discussion on the merger until their review was approved As a result Magnachip further delayed its shareholder meeting intended for June 17th to a currently unspecified future date This led to the spike downward to today s price as shareholder confidence in the merger fell The primary concern on behalf of the CFIUS is the sale of advanced proprietary semiconductor manufacturing tech to a competing nation in China while both nations have recently committed heavily to increased investment in domestic semiconductor manufacturing However Magnachip s manufacturing R amp D and sales are all based out of South Korea with China already accounting for over 50 of their sales in 2020 while U S sales composed only 1 https www marketscreener com quote stock MAGNACHIP SEMICONDUCTOR C 6361073 company In addition to the reasons stated by Magnachip it seems further unlikely that the U S would risk further aggravating US China relations over a company that does not even command a 2B market cap barely conducts any business within the United States conducts over 90 of its sales across Asia does not contribute to domestic semiconductor manufacturing goals has over 80 institutional ownership of available float https www nasdaq com market activity stocks mx institutional holdings i e investors that hate losing money would vote yes for guaranteed profit in a heartbeat and wield significant political power in the financial sector But most importantly the U S does not compete and has not shown any indication of competing in the future in the specific market in which MX currently holds its most distinct competitive lead its OLED DDIC technology most commonly adopted for modern smartphone displays South Korea Regulation The United States isn t the only entity that MX requires the okay from to proceed with the merger South Korea has a list of technologies that it classifies as national core technologies or technologies that require regulatory approval in cases such as this where a company that produces such technology is being sold to foreign investors Originally industry insiders in Korea believed that this would not apply to MX as MX s OLED semiconductor technology did not fall under this classification and China already possesses relatively high level OLED and semiconductor manufacturing technology However it was recently confirmed that as of June 9th https view asiae co kr article 2021060917303625530 South Korea s Ministry of Trade Industry and Energy has registered OLED DDIC semiconductor technology as part of their national core technologies which confirmed that MX would be required to undergo review on the Korean side as well in order for any foreign acquisition attempts to proceed Magnachip SEC filing from June 17th regarding aforementioned Korean regulatory review https investors magnachip com static files d7f8ba0b 1d32 48e3 86c3 d5c0a6731bfd The reason for the rushed regulatory attempt from the South Korean government can be traced back to 2002 when Hydis an liquid crystal display focused spinoff from Hynix Semiconductor was sold to China s Jingdongfang At the time Korea was the dominant world leader in liquid crystal display semiconductor production But after the acquisition of Hydis Jingdongfang began its own production within a year and is today the world s largest producer of liquid crystal displays Seeking to avoid a repeat of this scenario Korean citizens petitioned the government to intervene on the deal Currently it is being speculated on the side of the Korean media that the decision of the CFIUS s review will likely be the final deciding factor for the South Korean government s decision on the matter and the national core technology classification served to appease citizens and establish precedence for regulatory precedence for future international dealings involving OLED technology Shareholder Litigation Magnachip is also currently involved with multiple litigation claims from individual shareholders claiming that Magnachip failed to carry out its fiduciary duty in negotiating the deal with Wise Road The shareholders that brought forth the suit believe that the 29 per share acquisition deal undervalues their shares and that Magnachip did not perform its duty in negotiating a fair price for the buyout on behalf of public shareholders one of whom stated the following gt First the compensation afforded under the Proposed Transaction to Company gt stockholders significantly undervalues the Company The proposed valuation does not adequately gt reflect the intrinsic value of the Company Moreover the valuation does not adequately take into gt consideration how the Company is performing and its promise Source read from point 44 page 12 onwards to see why MX is undervalued EVEN WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE BUYOUT OFFERS https storage courtlistener com recap gov uscourts nysd 558913 gov uscourts nysd 558913 1 0 pdf AKA the stuff I would have included if this was a normal DD Essentially this states that if the company executives weren t so greedy on securing a deal that gets them a fat bonus they could ve easily negotiated a deal that reallocates more of that value into a greater than 29 per share buyout Shareholders are literally suing Magnachip because they believe the stock is worth significantly more than 29 Yeah if that s not bullish I don t know what is Price Action Analysis Due to a relatively low average daily trading volume the stock price tends to jump quite a bit in a short period of time when positive negative news comes out As of time of posting MX is trading at around 23 25 a significant drop from the 25 50 26 range it traded at just a few days before We ve seen that ever since the announcement of the initial buy out offer in late March MX has seen a strong price floor at 23 And given that basically all of the negative news that could possibly have come out has already come out I believe that the downward pressure is now or soon to be fully priced in leaving a significantly favored upside compared to downside from here on out Additionally regardless of whether either deal with Wise Road or Cornucopia goes through or not these two buy offers have shown that there are large professional investment institutions out there that value MX at a price of 29 minimum a sentiment seemingly aggressively shared by shareholders as well The above along with the recent drop in price attributed to the unease surrounding by the CFIUS Interim Order present what I believe to be a great buy opportunity when looking at a medium to long term reversal with a huge potential catalyst in the short term as well And even if these two buy offers fall through would shareholders ever vote to approve a buy offer for LESS than 29 in the future after all of this Not a fucking chance Conclusion Might be boring but I d go shares over calls here for this play If your personal risk tolerance is on the higher side and shares are for boomers I d go for calls at the 25 or 30 strike at least a few months out If a buyout is confirmed calls are printing infinite If not then they still have a solid chance of going ITM assuming a decently far out expiry Do note that at the current trading volume options can be fairly illiquid Positions 250 shares at 24 each and 5x 30c 9 17 for fun This is my first DD so go easy on me I d love to hear some discussion about any points I may not have thought of or covered

8 to 10 Historically 8 has been a ceiling but with a shock to supply like this I would expect this to go to above 10 In 2012 when the drought hit and made headlines on June 15 2012 the price of corn rose 64 in 2 months in a straight line If corn prices rose 64 from here it would be 13 which seems like a big increase for corn in 2 months but this increase has happened before and with commodities like lumber corn could be the next when it breaks 8 resistance What this means for ticker CORN it mirrors the gain in the actual commodity Currently CORN is trading at 20 96 if corn rose 64 then CORN would go to 34 in about 2 months With inflation general increased demand in the US currently and the current drought 34 may be actually low The 64 increase in 2012 was only based on a US drought Now

USDA reduces their forecast supply there should be no problem blowing through the 8 00 resistance in corn and going to all time highs Some media attention would help too When most droughts occur the

things have only gotten spicier Here is the link to the last post https old reddit com r wallstreetbets comments n5dzl9 return of big oil the death of oil has been Sorry to use a baseball reference but we are in the 2nd or 3rd inning of a great oil supercycle regardless of what the Kingdom of Saudi says through OPEC Last time I was speculating on the upside and I will continue to do so but update the current progress I have sold some of my lower price calls 60 and 70 and moved them to 80 calls additionally I have increased exposure to OXY calls TLDR Current Trends are now showing from Gov agencies that we will not have enough increase to cover demand causing the price to continue to march upward XOM Calls 244 80 calls for 1 21 22 63 75 calls for 1 21 22 77 70 calls for 1 21 22 6 60 calls for 1 21 22 OXY Calls 31 40 calls for 1 20 23 Ok So here s some news EIA reported their details yesterday and Baker Hughes put a great graph showing the number of rigs in correspondence with the oil price One thing to note is that even with efficiencies in Rig use we will still need additional rigs to hold production flat as we see the large decline profiles on the well brought online in 2018 2019 Keep that in mind when looking at the US production Might be time to look at Oilfield Service companies https twitter com chigrl status 1405170946097483783 The expectation from WoW was for roughly a 4 million barrel draw and we doubled expectations with 7 5 One other thing to note was that the refineries are running at extreme capacity in the US They have yet to shut in for preventative maintenance that usually happens around this time 92 7 utilization https www eia gov petroleum weekly crude php This shows the current information on the week from the EIA on Crude Oil stocks Clearly we are smack dab in the middle of the 5 year average however we should see draws consistently from this point on in the summer and even with significant activity we will expect that this summer oil will continue to rise Macro wise the Russian oil minister said that if more money is not reinvested in finding and developing oil 2020 384 billion normally its around 800 900 B then the supercycle in oil will create a demand spike to prices of 150 per BBL Take his commentary with a grain of salt Its Russia That being said this new information prior to Q2 earnings from any O G company has not been fully realized Focusing on XOM BOA announced that XOM will increase the dividend in Q4 and the share price should be around 90 share by the end of year while bringing the debt levels back to 20 25 https pulse2 com xom stock price increased 3 64 why it happened They are on the extreme end of pricing in terms of valuation but here is the consensus amongst analyst Goldman 65 Morgan Stanley 71 Credit Suisse 72 Morning Star 74 JPM 76 BOA 90 Obviously there are some that I am missing but you get the point at the current share price of 62 27 sell off this morning there is some upside in the near term My key takeaway is that the analysts expect a large earnings report next quarter and the rest of the year The Engine 1 board takeover 25 of the board was able to convince the largest shareholders Blackrock Fidelity California School Board that the changing of the board would help govern the spending of XOM not really focused on the climate side however it would show that the large money managers are trying to make an attempt at moving towards climate issues IMO it was all about the recent performance of the stock and a referendum on Woods performance not on climate issues So where does that leave us XOM in the next quarters at the current Oil price of 70 73 will be able to pay off a large portion of their debt from last year pay the dividend and potentially raise the dividend by EOY All while the price of oil remains above 70 Not to mention the activity in Guyana in which XOM found another zone to target offshore that will produce and sell at Brent pricing 72 83 Might also be time to look at HESS https www naturalgasintel com exxonmobil partners strike more oil in stabroek offshore guyana All of that is on the crude side w o the refining capacity that XOM has increased and now lets talk about natural gas The XTO acquisition was terrible by all means but it has provided some benefit of large natural gas exposure Henry Hub currently is at 3 24 and essentially XOM produces the gas and ships it to Asia where it sells for 2 3x HH Currently the outlook is good and should remain stable with more gas going to exports until we see a larger increase in export capacity and there is a chance that with a colder winter this year 2022 would have large swings in gas pricing Roughly we are 4 down on the 5 year average curve but gas companies have been extremely hesitant to increase production and have contained supply Now on to OXY What a terrible company Literally every time I look at the balance sheet I cry So bad However they have a couple good signs that they will make it out ok 1 Burry decided to pick up 225 000 shares 2 CNBC reported live that David Tepper thinks oxy will end the year at 40 50 share 3 As quoted in their IR slides for every 1 increase from 45 in WTI Oxy will have 185MM 46 25MM per QTR so lets play on this further and we would be around 1 1 B of FCF per QTR assuming everything is consistent Highly doubt its that high but whatever https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 06 16 david tepper says he s bullish much loathed oil stocks Also BOA had a call with OXY as the last presenter and here is the transcript https www oxy com investors Documents BAML 202020 20Conference 20Presentation 20Transcript pdf This presentation let us know that OXY plans on continuing its divestment of non core assets while retaining a large amount of the purchased Anadarko acreage Recently OXY divested 508 million set of properties in Reeves which was a great price per acre and flowing barrel 10k per acre ish I think that this will shock the investment community on their Q2 and Q3 reports when they significantly reduce debt Their focus is to push out the maturities in 2024 and pay off almost all of the debt due in the next 2 years with FCF This will make OXY extremely attractive at the current price OXY is a bet on the company not being a shit company That is why my calls are set out so far I don t trust the management but I cannot deny the money they will make give the price of oil and the land positioning of their interests in the Permian Let me know your thoughts about what companies you see making a killing this year and this is not financial advice just thoughts about my positions

Announcement for Period Ending Q2 2021 08 13 202 In trading on Wednesday shares of Purple Innovation Inc Symbol PRPL entered into oversold territory hitting an RSI reading of 28 7 after changing hands as low as 25 12 per share By comparison the current RSI reading of the S amp P 500 ETF SPY is 56 0 A bullish investor could look at PRPL s 28 7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side We have previously seen a bounce at these levels after March I m hoping to see this bounce happen again Ongoing market volatility may be an opportunity to buy PRPL at a good price Make sure you clearly understand any positions you are entering PRPL could soar high as many institutional investors are aggressively trading PRPL backwards and forwards amongst themselves Be careful to set your exit target and stop losses if it soars in order to not get caught out on a crash

closed strong in 2020 showing top and bottom line growth However the market reacted negatively despite predicted double digit revenue growth in the first quarter PRPL has grown both its revenue and operating margin since its IPO in 2018 From 200M to 648M in 2020 Operating margin has improved from negative to positive territory to 5 7 at present During 2020 people upgraded their living conditions at home this resulted in a 2020 net revenue increasing 51 YoY to 649M Gross margin also improved from 44 1 in 2019 to 47 in 2020 due to lower input costs 2020 operating expense dropped to 36 1 this caused a 339 YoY increase in operating income to 71 2 million This is stellar performance Management pivoted the company well during the pandemic as last year direct to consumer revenue increased by 83 and wholesale revenue still increased slightly The pandemic broadened it s consumer base Management plans to increase this momentum by expanding its retail and online presence With our additional manufacturing capacity coming online we intend to lean into accelerated wholesale door growth Our current plan is to add approximately 1 500 new doors in 2021 with a focus on both expanding our footprint with existing partners as well as launching with additional leading regional furniture players Now to launching a new e commerce platform We have been developing the new design and platform for much of 2020 In order to capitalize on immediate opportunities during the stay at home fuel demand we deferred some of the work into this quarter Analysts are projecting strong earnings growth for the next two years with 14 and 28 EPS growth estimates for 2021 and 2022 Summary Purple has been a good investment over the past year due to rapid consumer adoption of its products Management continues to invest in growth and expand their consumer reach This is supported by growth seen before the Pandemic The recent dip is a good buying oppurtunity As always do your own DD I m just an autistic woman who writes DD s when I take extra adderall I will expand and edit this DD as I do more research but I decided to post it in it s current state as there has been a good dip just now

type of energy storage power station that uses a group of batteries to store electrical energy This is primarily used in the renewables space with solar and wind energy In recent years battery storage and in part renewable energy hasn t seen the exponential growth that many are expecting due to limitations in battery technology and high development costs This being said recent developments of battery tech and reduction of costs have now made battery storage much more feasible at the commercial industrial level Battery storage still has ways to go in the residential space due to risks that

demand and energy production Ok so now that we know how it works what does the market look like All major global markets are forecasted to double over the next decade Over the next decade the US

https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments o14jei aso this week for you to check out if you re an autist and or can read I won t get into all of those details in this post again but suffice it to say I m sporting a boner reading about ASO Third Looking at Simple Moving Averages ASO has maintained higher short term averages even during this pullback It s also worth noting that ASO has repeatedly seen the 5 day SMA track down for a few days during a pullback barely touching the 20 day average and then immediately beginning to track back upwards to a new ATH As a result looking at the chart pictured below I would expect ASO to begin tracking upward again within the next few days https preview redd it coecvh1xlw571 png width 3198 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f1b4330ef45104898c5183145183ce251c2d7d93 It s also worth noting that ASO has been overbought lately so it is expected to see a little bit of a correction as we saw this week and the pullback is in no way a bearish sign Fourth I know all you apes can t wait to tell your wife s boyfriend about this one short interest I have seen some different numbers floating around pun intended so I took the liberty of screenshotting several different sources and doing the math myself First screenshot here is from the Nasdaq https preview redd it cs465zbylw571 png width 2132 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 68692f1ceebe0ad4d31595b6052e6a5e5d43edfa The highlighted line shows the most recent short interest report available on the Nasdaq Ignore the Average Volume and Days to Cover as the Average volume has gone up since 5 28 The important number here is 12M shares short Now let s look at MarketWatch https preview redd it 939vc0gzlw571 png width 1031 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3695096bbe844d30c7e2c2bd9bc72e1c0145390a MarketWatch is also listing 12M shares short so this number seems to be fairly accurate coming from 2 reliable sources This screenshot also includes a couple other important numbers I want you to remember updated volume of 2 67M and public float of 54 64M Now let s look at one other source via shortsqz abbreviated for algos click here https shortsqueeze com symbol ASO amp submit Short Quote E2 84 A2 to go to the website https preview redd it 7bckf6u0mw571 png width 1239 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b41e340a2d48b7f09f8f5f98e299ba48f000bef7 So this source would seem to confirm the 12M shares short 54 64M public float and 2 6M average trading volume I would say it is reasonable to work with these numbers and calculate out our short of float and Days to Cover That math is as follows 12M shares short 54 64M public float 21 96 of float shorted 12M shares short 2 6M average volume 4 65 Days to Cover under normal volume That s all I have to say about short interest Just wanted to clear up those numbers Fifth Options have been seeing increasing action lately to the point where they began writing 1 intervals as opposed to 5 As you can see below there are over 14k call options at 40 strikes expiring tomorrow and the total number of ITM contracts if it reaches 40 tomorrow is about 21k Those 21k contracts represent 2 1M shares of stock or about 81 of normal daily trading volume If we can get the stock to close at 40 tomorrow a significant enough number of options may be exercised to trigger some gamma movement Chart below https preview redd it yafwka42mw571 png width 2870 amp format png amp auto webp amp s bed869d4c6753e0bd8973a4a64d460f56c396555 So what does all this mean This means that if enough people buy in tomorrow the price could easily be pushed to 40 then consequently trigger gamma movement notably higher The 21 96 short interest trends and general health of the stock compound this and make it more likely that ASO will continue performing well regardless of what happens tomorrow What more could your wife s boyfriend ask for for Daddy s Day This is not financial advice I am ape

UWMC https utradea com stocks UWMC holds a strong reputation in the mortgage lender business which in turn translates to their large market position in the wholesale channel With their continued growth from the market outlook I expect to continue to see strong financials aided by their operational efficiency and their strong IT infrastructure which will help to drive their market share higher Company Overview United Wholesale Mortgage Holdings Corporation NASDAQ UWMC https utradea com stocks UWMC is a wholesale lender The company underwrites and provides closing documentation for residential mortgage loans originated by independent mortgage brokers correspondents small banks and local credit unions The company offers its broker partners direct access to dedicated in house mortgage advisors as well as their own teams of underwriters and closers It also provides training technology marketing support and more to help its entrepreneurial partners For the last 6 years included FY2020 they have been the largest wholesale mortgage lender in the U S by closed loan volume with approximately 34 market share of the wholesale channel Strategy Operating solely as a Wholesale Mortgage Lender and thereby avoiding conflict with partners independent mortgage advisors and their direct relationship with borrowers By not competing for the borrower connection and relationship they believe they re able to generate significantly higher loyalty and satisfaction from clients Market Opportunity Residential mortgage loan originations continuing to grow Federal Reserve reports residential mortgages to represent the largest segment of the U S consumer finance market In 2020 annual residential mortgage origination volume reached 3 7T and an average of 2 2T over the last 5 years Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts residential mortgage debt to increase to 12 4T by the end of 2022 An increase from FY2020 value of 11 1T Loan origination volumes are continuing to shift to non bank originators Since 2008 non bank originators have grown from 32 of the loan origination volume to 79 in 2020 Traditional banks have since reduced their footprint in mortgage origination Non bank originators and servicers have been able to meaningfully grow market share Steady home appreciation driving higher mortgage purchase volume and increased residential mortgage loan originations for purchases Investment Thesis Operational Excellence and Strong Revenues By focusing solely on the wholesale channel it provides UWMC with a differentiated client centric business model that allows for scaled efficient and centralized processes and the ability to focus on high quality loans FY2020 UWMC closed approx 561 000 loans with an average submission to clear to close turn times of 17 days With an average of 9 8 loans per month per production team member UWMC outperforms the industry average of 3 5 At this rate UWMC is able to capture a bigger market share in the growing industry and in turn generate attractive financial figures and returns for shareholders Revenue In the 4QFY2020 alone UWMC reported a net income of 1 37B nearly half of their total net income in 2020 This was approx a 700 increase YoY 2019 2020 and is expected to continue to rise given the industry outlook and opportunity UWMC has a clear advantage over its competitors when it comes to operational strength balance sheet and their liquidity and further enforces their position if there were to be drastic changes in the market that would add to uncertainty as discussed in Risks Investment Thesis II Strong IT Infrastructure UWMC s own technology platforms and exclusively licensed technology allows them to support clients and borrower to provide a best in class client experience Their variety of full service technology platforms is offered to independent mortgage advisors and helps to deliver closely managed end to end experience for the borrower from origination through closing Because of this their technology platforms give them a competitive edge helps to drive customer retention and offer the ability to efficiently and quickly achieve closing on loan originations It is primarily due to their technology that they are able to achieve the faster than industry average for closing loans As well the technology helps to drive brand recognition and brand loyalty because of their personalized marketing tool offered to the independent mortgage advisors Risks Their financial performance is directly affected by and subject to substantial volatility from changes in prevailing interest rates A rise in interest rates and increased inflation expectations in the U S could lead to stagflation in the coming years As interest rates rise refinancing generally becomes a smaller portion of the market as fewer consumers are interested in refinancing their mortgages refinancing makes up 75 of their mortgage volume In the mortgage loan business higher interest rates may also reduce the demand for purchase mortgages as homeownership becomes more expensive These could affect their financial position and the results of their operations Their financial performance is highly dependent on the U S residential real estate market conditions The U S residential real estate industry is seasonal and highly affected by changes in general economic conditions Economic conditions such as interest rates slowed economic growth unemployment numbers and wages affecting borrower s income and ability to make loan payments directly affect UWMC s financial position Negative market conditions can lead to a decrease in loan originations and will result in lower revenues or lead to an increase in loan delinquencies this increasing UWMC s expenses for loans serviced Valuation Using a comps analysis I found 6 companies of competition to UWM Holdings Given their recent IPO I found it hard to estimate revenue numbers and use EV Revenue to further value the company P S Ratio Using a P S multiple of 4 27 I arrived at a fair value of 15 23 representing a 50 88 upside P E Ratio With the P E ratio I arrived at a fair value of 28 27 representing a 179 implied upside Using a 50 50 weighting system I arrive at an estimated fair value of 21 75 which would imply approx 115 upside amp x200B https preview redd it 3jnsdo75zh571 png width 1155 amp format png amp auto

the market opportunity strong financials and the strong IT infrastructure UWMC brings I think the company is positioned for solid growth in the coming years By solely focusing on the wholesale channel the company offers a competitive edge and presents operational efficiency in generating high quality loans while also meeting the growing demand Going forward I hope to see increased revenues on their
