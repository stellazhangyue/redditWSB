listen up If you sold Nokia during the run up then you just hate money NOK got caught up in the GME saga and now the stock has a stink on it thanks to the mainstream media and others who don t understand how a Short Squeeze works and how GME went parabolic in one week Let s keep in mind there were some good and truthful DD posts on NOK in December January and some great fucking DD on Nok in the last couple months I suspect it went from 4 to 9 just from the massive influx of new members checking out our old posts trying to find an affordable seat on the Rocketship No Nokia doesn t have a ton of short interest But I still really like the stock and I d like to tell you why and a little bit about our future re John Titor gt Let s not forget about when this wasn t ALL about fucking the shorts jeezus christ NOK is different from that bullshit because it truly has deep fucking value And believe me this goes DEEP They don t manufacture or sell phones anymore The only connection they have in making and selling phones is the Nokia brand name being licensed out to a Taiwanese manufacturing company called HDM Global Almost all the company s revenue comes from Wireless Network Infrastructure and Internet Routing Equipment Let s go back and track this evolution gt In 2010 this only generated 30 of its revenue Networking Products Cellular Base Stations etc In 2020 this made them 85 of their revenue Nokia transformed itself into Wireless Technology Company you fucking retards They did this through a series of Autistic Acquisitions AA In April of 2011 they acquired the Wireless Network Infrastructure Assets of Motorola Solutions this basically gave Nokia all of Motorola s 2G 3G 4G assets gt In August of 2013 Nokia acquired Nokia Siemens Network joint venture and renamed the division Nokia Networks and that same year Nokia sold its entire mobile phone division to Microsoft gt The in early 2016 Nokia agreed to acquire Alcatel Lucent for 15 6 Billion which gave then all of their Wireless Technology Routers Switches and Optical Tech within Alcatel as well as Bell Labs formerly an Alcatel Lucent division This final deal gave Nokia the massive scale they have now to compete with the industry giants like Ericsson and Huawei head to fucking head yeah this is real you idiots And we know that Huawei is literally banned in multiple countries around the world soo So where am I going with this and why will they emerge as one of most important companies the near future REEFSHARK AI DRIVEN 5G WIRELESS NETWORKS NETWORK SLICING AND THE POWER OF THE FUTURE Take an extra retard pill for the rest of this DD post you re gonna need it They have been building themselves up to this moment ReefShark is the key here 5G Network is the door and AI Driven 5G Network Slicing is the living room of the future Nokia has this proprietary chip that will play a big role in how 5G will be available It will ease the load of 5G Network rollout because it has a 50 60 reduction in energy use which is an outstanding selling point to the industries looking to tap into 5G bandwidth It is the most efficient chip of its kind by far with the added benefit of boosting antenna performance This efficiency is necessary to the way different industries and companies will utilize the 5G Network They will go through MVNO MOBILE VIRTUAL NETWORK OPERATOR to basically rent out their 5G bandwidth from a cloud This is called Network Slicing for all u chimps out there For example Tesla will rent out their own slice of dedicated 5G Bandwidth More than 1 000 companies use MVNO already and most apes have not even heard of it yet Here is how Nokia fits into all of this techy garbage NOK IS ALREADY THE BIGGEST PLAYER IN THIS MARKET SPACE they made up 4 5 billion of the 66 9 billion of Telecom Software and Services in 2019 AND REEFSHARK MAKES THEM THE UNCHALLENGED LEADER IN THIS EVERGROWING MARKET WITH AI POWERED NETWORK CAPABILITIES lt BONUS LEVEL Last year NASA selected Nokia s Bell Labs division to supply the 4G LTE communications network for the moon soon No joke the ACTUAL Moon not emoji moon Before the end of 2022 they will put a highly functioning 4G network on the lunar surface in preparation for the planned 2024 return mission to the Moon Drop the crayons for a second and think about this Ok now eat the red one it s the same colors as your wife s butthole after her bf leaves your driveway in his big loud pickup truck Your stupid little smooth brain is probably wondering what all this old 4G talk is about with all the 5G shit rolling out nationwide changing the course of history Answer gt the lunar surface is relatively flat so there won t be interference with the cheaper more practical 4G network We are talking about putting a mobile network into space you retards so stfu The signal will travel further it just makes more sense They must start somewhere though this will evolve into 5G up there eventually NASA could ve given this contract to anyone but THEY CHOSE NOKIA because they believe in them They believe Nokia has the best performing Wireless Network Equipment So I like the fucking stock ok gt Insert Rocket Emojis Fire Boom Flags all that shit right here lt The time to buy in is now

given a higher multiple for valuation They got a lot of exciting and growth customers like Barstool PENN YouTube Google Twitch AMZN FanDuel PDYPY Roblox RBLX CoinBase COIN Visa V ApplePay APPL BetMGM MGM Spotify SPOT Microsoft Xbox etc and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet 2 in market share where you can trade buy the fast growing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases https www reddit com r stocks comments mysz54 reviewing the bear case on paysafe psfe https www reddit com r stocks comments mysz54 reviewing the bear case on paysafe psfe the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe so I m not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub Most of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth As an example EV related stocks PLUG BLNK QS LAZR NKLA BLDP etc get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don t even have revenue yet worth billions While this assumption may be accurate it is extremely hard to know 1 how big the market is 2 How many competitors each company has 3 when will growth begin to accelerate Because of this predictive nature it s really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop When or if it will pop is anyone s guess So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk high rewards But what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners If your customers partners revenue grows it s more likely than not they are using more of your products or services Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers partners financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start For this reason Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential Paysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11 The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth 1 PENN Reported May 7 2021 Penn National s income from operations rose to 216 5 million in the first quarter against 560 6 million in the prior year quarter Adjusted EBITDAR jumped 77 2 from the year ago quarter to 447 million Moreover adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded to 35 1 from 22 6 a year ago source https www zacks com stock news 1515673 penn national penn q1 earnings

REPLACING Skillz Reports Record Q1 Revenue and Raises 2021 Guidance https www businesswire com news home 20210504006307 en CORRECTING and REPLACING Skillz Reports Record Q1 Revenue and Raises 2021 Guidance As you can see these Paysafe s customers partners are reporting explosive growth While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost i e Draftking However here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe These companies reported earnings before Paysafe so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow May 11 Several things to note about Paysafe besides their customer s earning growth These factors will also influence Paysafe s future growth 1 They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG MGM PENN SKLZ etc 2 Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again Also when re opening occur more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe 3 They are 2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital currency with the wallet These currency has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ more on this below Finally both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation Paypal earning May 5 2021 Revenue 6 03 billion vs 5 90 billion expected by Refinitiv source https www cnbc com 2021 05 05 paypal pypl earnings q1 2021 html https www cnbc com 2021 05 05 paypal pypl earnings q1 2021 html Square earning May 6 2021 Square reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts It also brought in 5 06 billion of revenue vs 3 36 billion expected by Refinitiv source https www cnbc com 2021 05 06 square sq earnings q1 2021 html https www cnbc com 2021 05 06 square sq earnings q1 2021 html So I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th For those of you who don t know Paysafe they are not a small player Their transaction volume is about that of SQ 100 Billion If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple See the reddit link above for DD on valuation Paysafe involved with Gaming Sports digitalcurrency which I find very exciting and feel that if I own the stock I ll be part of the journey of growth with these sectors Roaring Kitty DeepFuckingValue simply invested in GME because he liked the stock I m investing in Paysafe simply because it s cool and sexy regardless of its growth potential In summary I think Paysafe is a low risk high reward stock compare to other fintech Their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward They got the 2nd largest digital wallet They are involved in the highly popular and fast growth digital currency market I believe as a monopoly in iGaming Sport Betting their growth will be massive when the 4 largest states CA TX NY FL begin to allow online sport betting This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has this space This is a massive high growth area and they own the space For these reason I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play Disclaimer I own Paysafe commons warrants and option calls I am not a financial adviser I m more or less like you retard redditor who ape and think with your penis instead of your

clinical protection even if Spike variants arise Based on pre clinical work and data from Gritstone s cancer patients we hope and expect to see strong neutralizing antibodies to Spike as well as CD8 T cell CD8 T Cells offer second layer of defense and may provide longer immunity responses to both Spike and additional viral antigens which may provide clinical protection against emerging Spike variants We are also exploring the potential to use a lower dose of the self amplifying mRNA vaccine which could enable more patients to be treated with a given amount of manufactured vaccine amp

challenges that are likely to emerge particularly around novel Spike variants of concern Building on this NIAID IDCRC first in human study we are planning to examine the expected broad immunity elicited by our vaccine by delivering it as a B OOST for people who have received first generation vaccines in a Phase 2 study starting later this year We hope that strong CD8 T cell immunity

following words This study has been met with great enthusiasm as Gritstone s vaccine is differentiated in its potential to broaden the immune response to SARS CoV 2 potentially preserving clinical protection even if Spike variants arise Based on pre clinical work and data from Gritstone s cancer patients we hope and expect to see strong neutralizing antibodies to Spike as well as CD8 T cell CD8 T Cells offer second layer of defense and may provide longer immunity responses to both Spike and additional viral antigens which may provide clinical protection against emerging Spike variants We are also exploring the potential to use a lower dose of the self amplifying mRNA vaccine which could enable more patients to be treated with a given amount of manufactured vaccine Allen M D Ph D co founder president and chief executive officer of Gritstone Said the following words As we look to the future we believe CORAL has the potential to address coronavirus immunity challenges that are likely to emerge particularly around novel Spike variants of concern Building on this NIAID IDCRC first in human study we are planning to examine the expected broad immunity elicited by our vaccine by delivering it as a BOOST for people who have received first generation vaccines in a Phase 2 study starting later this year We hope that strong CD8 T cell immunity generated against key non Spike gene

comments mtehdq i analyzed all 700 buy and sell recommendations TL DR there does appear to be a benefit over SPY from repeatedly buying holding for 1 day and selling his Buy picks or for shorting his Sell picks for the same time period For income generation with fixed capital not reinvesting gains losses there also appears to be a slight benefit from holding his Buy picks for 3 months Ignore the

long time Reddit lurker decade who finally made an account a few months ago and now finally decided I should probably actually contribute something every now and then I don t know much about stocks or finance but I know a lot about data and algorithms I ve set up my own scripts for analyzing various strategies including a few stock picking services and my own weekly algo swing trading strategies Data Thanks to the pointer from u nobjos to the Mad Money picks I was able to run my scripts on Cramer s picks Like mentioned in the original post the site doesn t exactly make it easy to get all the data It s kind of like they just want to give the appearance of being transparent Imagine that But I think I got all of it as of today 19 251 mentions of 2 068 stocks data is from Mad Money Stock Screener https madmoney thestreet com screener index cfm 258 stocks didn t have data available in the yahoo finance API all returning with No data found for this date range symbol may be delisted I m assuming symbol changes also apply here but I was pretty surprised to get that for gt 12 of the stocks None of the dates on the website include the year so for every pick I get the price for that month day combo for each year since 2016 and use the year with the closing price closest to what s given on the website There s potential for error here where a stock happens to be around the same price on the same date in multiple years As far as I can tell the screener covers the past few years There are 5 types of mentions in the data Buy Hold Sell Positive Mention and Negative Mention I ignored which segment the mention was on He rarely makes Hold mentions so there s not really enough data for that one to draw any conclusions I considered dropping it from the results altogether and did end up clipping it in places to zoom in more on the others Honestly I can t fault him for that If you own a stock and you wouldn t buy it if you didn t then you should dump it and buy something you believe in Unless you re just trying to avoid a tax hit Mention type Count w valid data Buy 10808 Pos 2588 Hold 30 Neg 2623 Sell 1848 Metrics My goal with these scripts is to see how a strategy performs over time e g does it work well for a week and then tank are gains losses optimal or most stable after a month etc So I get the price on the pick date then see how it performs for various subsequent time periods For Cramer s picks since he makes them after market close the price I use for opening the position is the open price of the following market day This is a key difference to the original post s analysis which used close price from the day of the pick I look at 3 things the percent change labeled Del in my data the percent change vs SPY labeled RDel and the percent gain if shorting vs going long on SPY labeled SRDel E g if a stock went up 3 and SPY went up 1 then Del 3 RDel 2 and SRDel 4 because you did 4 worse than you would have by just buying SPY shares I m constantly on the fence about whether I should use SPY or QQQ or maybe even VTI as my benchmark but SPY is what s most commonly used and it s not hard to make comparisons to others afterwards based on how they performed vs SPY Evaluation There are a few ways of looking at returns for something like this The most common is the arithmetic mean we all know and love from basic math If one stock gives you a 100 return and another gives 50 your average is 25 This evaluation works for a strategy of investing in multiple stocks at once with a buy and never sell strategy Take 200 split it across those two stocks the end result is 250 a 25 gain Basically all of his mention types perform the same remember ignore the Hold type for this strategy This chart basically just shows that in general yes stonks go up https preview redd it mor6bvlkl9y61 png width 1720 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e78d8c63f468b094aac190240681aacd74eb26e2 For shorter term trading where we re investing in multiple stocks sequentially we need the geometric mean Take 200 invest it in the 100 stock then sell and invest in the 50 stock and we re right back at 200 a 0 gain This is the result the geometric mean of 100 and 50 would give us calculated as the geometric mean of the multiple of capital remaining 2 and 0 5 minus 1 This evaluation works for a strategy of keeping a fixed amount of capital invested and taking any extra out as income or replacing any lost It s also important to note here that the metrics relative to SPY are the difference in the geometric means of the picks and of SPY not the geometric means of the differences The latter would produce invalid results and be impossible to calculate if any differences were lt 100 geometric mean is only valid for values gt 0 With this strategy we do start to see a bit of a difference still ignore orange https preview redd it rpq2ugdgo9y61 png width 1720 amp format png amp auto webp amp s d6323554d9c1f42e6fe84263e7da5b24753d4445 Seen in the middle chart at time periods of 3 months or longer the Buy mentions and to a lesser extent the Positive mentions do outperform SPY by a bit and the Sell mentions underperform but not by enough to make shorting them a viable strategy Something I haven t tested yet but from this chart would be quite interesting to look at is whether buying his Buy picks a month later after the hype has died down and then holding for a few months would produce good returns But we also need to consider how long we re holding Of course we would much rather have 10 gain in a month than in a year So this final evaluation is what I consider to best reflect how the strategy would behave in practice For this I take the arithmetic mean of all stocks picked on the same date then the geometric mean for a given time period then compound the interest for however many of that time period exists in a year to get the effective annual return Note that I consider the time intervals to be the number of market days e g a week is 5 days and a year is 253 This strategy assumes gains and losses are applied directly to our invested capital So for the 1D time period you would split all money across all picks from the previous evening buy and sell after 1 day then continuously repeat With this strategy things really start getting interesting no really ignore orange https preview redd it duikpvsio9y61 png width 1720 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 6b7bf03a94ac2a7f2461a536665a5e098ae31933 At holding periods of 1 day the Buy mentions and interestingly the Neg mentions significantly outperform SPY and shorting the Sell mentions does as well Shorting longer than a day is a terrible idea it usually is Melvin and the Buy benefit has dissipated within a week only to re emerge slightly when looking at 3 months Remember these values show equivalent annual returns Conclusion The raw data is here https drive google com file d 1iZfOif0R3hmOnmfcLOCy1 K9yFrLo2e view usp sharing https drive google com file d 1iZfOif0R3hmOnmfcLOCy1 K9yFrLo2e view usp sharing This includes every single pick along with the aggregate values arithmetic geometric compounding and count at the bottom for each pick type The aggregate values are what s shown in the charts This does include results looking at gt 1 year but there s not as much data at those time ranges and those results are more likely to be affected by the year matching problems mentioned earlier Another quirk you might notice is the count of data at 1 day post pick is slightly less than at 3 days I haven t had the time to figure out why My biggest hope in doing this was that I would see a pattern that I could reliably short his buy picks at open the next day after it pumps AH and then cover at close or a few days later That doesn t seem to be the case I would get crushed doing that and the most viable strategy from this analysis is actually to buy his Buy picks at open the next day then sell and repeat every day Shorting his Sell picks for a day also seems to be viable and could be a decent hedge for in case the market tanks on any given day Using AH trading to try to better time entry points could further improve this strategy Remember though that all this shows is that doing that would have outperformed SPY without taking into account taxes commissions short borrow rates etc In the last few years a blind monkey throwing darts at a tech stock board would have beaten SPY QQQ outperformed SPY by 30 in 2020 and if I had used that as the benchmark there would probably be no useful strategy here Outside of shorting his Sell picks for 1 day the SRDel results are terrible pretty uniformly across all mention types Generally shorting over long time periods is and it definitely would have been in 2020 My hope was to be able to briefly short Buy mentions after he pumps but that doesn t appear to work at least not as of market open the next day shorting in AH a minute after he mentions it might work but I don t have that data I didn t go through this with a fine toothed comb for errors or other issues so if anyone sees any issues with the data or analysis please let me know Also remember the gt 12 picks failed to return anything from the yahoo finance API and there s the issue with matching the year As I mentioned I set these scripts up to analyze some other things I ve considered and just kind of pointed them at the Mad Money data In the future I ll try to provide something similar for Motley Fool Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers TipRanks SmartInvestor a system I found called StockSignals and maybe some of my own machine learning based picks at some point they ve actually done fairly well so far but I don t have anywhere close to enough data yet to trust them I m open to other suggestions as well all I need is a list of stocks each with a date and I can run this I suppose ARK picks might be another good one to try Anyway I hope some people find this useful I think now I m supposed to say something about this not being financial advice and that I have no idea what I m doing And I probably am on the spectrum somewhere

betting on Pekka Lundmark and his blueprint to success on Nokia s comeback from the early 5G fiasco It hasn t been a year since his appointment as Nokia s CEO however he has already made very bald moves He changed the high level leaders within the organization He changed the approach to 5G going from an end to end strategy to customer specific approach Basically saying if we are not making money on any segment of our business we won t sign unprofitable contracts just to support the greater good His goal is to be the technology leader where ever Nokia is competing He has no intention of being the low cost provider as his goal is consistent high profitability via technological leadership That is the right approach Therefore he is increasing the R amp D spending significantly More on that later He also trimmed the Nokia leadership team from 17 leaders to 11 Maybe the most important move he has made was giving not only full accountability to division leaders meaning they did not have to consult 10 plus people when they wanted to make a decision regarding their divisions he also gave them full responsibility Now division leaders have the full power AND the full responsibility The reason why this is very critical is very simple With this approach he eliminated internal wars regarding profitability and accountability Some division leaders rightfully or wrongfully hid under the excuse of signing contracts for the greater good of the company Plus Nokia s group common and other division which is the corporate support division of Nokia had way too many people The reason for this for me is simple Some divisions were offloading expenses to look profitable It made no difference to the company as a whole it just made them and their bonuses much better Now Pekka moved over 10k employees from Group Common out to the divisions they really belong to So the blueprint is there What about the execution Since Pekka Lundmark has been at Nokia Nokia performed really well in the earnings reports His guidance has been on the conservative side He promised the investors and share holders full transparency and he held that promise Sometimes to the point of annoying the share holders as the stock plummeted after a great earnings report last year when he said the famous words next year will be challenging If he perhaps chose better wording Nokia would have went up 15 instead of plummeting I feel that the newest hire in Nokia Melissa Schoeb who is the Chief Corporate Affairs Officer will help with some of this and since her hiring whether related or not Q1 earnings call had a much different vibe to it than the previous calls Pekka Lundmark looked a lot more positive than before and I don t think it was only due to the great results Anyways Let s take a look at the first quarter of the challenging year amp x200B https preview redd it 5zdagi6t4ay61 png width 461 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f84e604efa4435bcdf9d5ff06a0532670269a321 EPS expectations were 0 01 Euros per share btw Basically Nokia killed it with a caveat Regional and product mixes were favorable as well as the SG amp A and R amp D spendings were lower than expected These will balance out in the upcoming quarters and therefore seasonality will not be as high as previous years The exact effect is unknown however the Q1 earnings are so good that I don t see a way where full year results will be within the lower or even mid range of the guidance I believe Nokia will beat even it s high end guidance easily Moreover I believe the OM improvement for MN to 5 8 will happen in 2022 instead of 2023 There is just no way for this year to be negative and next year to be stagnant if you look at the numbers and listen to each division leader during conference calls or more importantly during the last capital markets day presentation Let s take a look at the guidance amp x200B https preview redd it fx1bau9x5ay61 png width 345 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 6d8ad5e3b6593f19a02dd541d3299845b9b9603b In Q1 2021 Mobile Networks had 3 4 OM Network Infrastructure had 10 8 OM Cloud and Network Services had 3 OM this was due to unprofitable contracts signed in the past but these will balance out in upcoming quarters and per the team Nokia will reach it s guidance for 2021 Nokia technologies had 78 4 OM Basically in its historically weakest quarter Nokia had extremely good results Post Q1 Earnings I expect Network Infrastructure to go full steam ahead as Nokia signed strong contracts in the US There is no indication or a reason for it to slow down https www t mobile com news un carrier tmobile expands home internet to more than 130 additional cities towns https www t mobile com news un carrier tmobile expands home internet to more than 130 additional cities towns Also Nokia s full year 2021 revenue estimate is between 20 6 billion Euros to 21 8 billion Euros That was with the estimation of Networks Infrastructure having around 7 billion Euros in revenues However NI is doing excellently and it was the highlight of the Q1 earnings report Not only because NI is on a trajectory to earn 2 billion Euros more than expected in full year 2021 but because NI has 9 10 OMs Therefore the additional revenue profit will hit the EPS stronger than say the CaNS division Here is how well the NI is doing You can also see the strong seasonality in Mobile

63a5b09a54ceadf65c177213f943cf9a5991f19a Enterprise Market This one is extremely important Per Pekka Lundmark Nokia is a leader in the Enterprise market This is very important not because it is a new ish market and a additional revenue opportunity but because the growth and the profitability is very high This market is expected to grow in double digits in the next 5 or so years Currently Enterprise market is somewhat small with around the size of 10 of the CSP market however that will change within 3 5 years By 2025 Enterprise market will at absolute minimum be around 3 5 billion Euros with double digit operating margins If that happens and the whole industry is saying it is already happening Nokia s share price will get to 20 much earlier than expected amp x200B https preview

laughable manner However for the value investors this is where the value of Nokia lies It is heavily undervalued and is trading like bankruptcy is an option where as this company has solid cash reserves at over 3 billion Euros and positive cash flows going forwards with no chance of bankruptcy whatsoever Let s talk about potential Ericsson has 138 Commercial 5G agreements 81 5G contracts and

contracts you are wrong please watch the CMD presentation and pay attention to Tommi Uitto s section Spoiler Nokia is not offering low margins to win contracts They haven t needed to cut costs to CSPs to win contracts Therefore the potential is absolutely there I was somewhat taken back by the CMD presentation when Nokia skipped 2022 guidance and instead gave 2023 guidance I suspected things would get worse before they got better However looking at the Q1 earnings report so many things are going well for Nokia that I don t see how things will take a turn for the worse Sure the usual seasonality will not happen at the degree it usually does but that doesn t mean Networks Infrastructure will slow down and Mobile Networks will plummet to negative margins R amp D and SG amp A expenses will go up per Marc Wiren Nokia will accumulate some inventory in the upcoming quarters that they skipped on in Q1 and these things will smooth the curve however they will not cause Nokia to deviate from it s guidance Therefore I am much more bullish than ever before Especially hearing how well Nokia is managed in avoiding the chip shortage Nokia currently should be around 6 7 range Conservatively I expect within 1 year Nokia to reach 9 12 Within 2 4 years 20 or more is possible due to strong foothold in the highly profitably and high growth Enterprise market and the strong performance in the US and Europe markets partly thanks to the Huawei situation

FUBO QS SNDL and More, Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation Week 4 PLTR BABA XPEV DIS SPCE FUBO QS SNDL and More amp nbsp What s poppin bull gang Flux here with Week 4 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week cause it s time to do it all again This week is a little janky because a whole boatload of new companies are reporting so we don t actually have comprehensive historical data for them Instead of the standard 25 datapoints we ve got closer to half that and in some cases even less Trade carefully everyone I ve omitted Monday AM and Friday AM reporters due to there being no relevant companies reporting on the given days amp nbsp All that being said I fucking love earnings season It s an absolute battleground out there Insane volatility breaking announcements and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time What s not to love Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers roll the dice and amass a small fortune That being said the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders many find that they re one bad trade away from a complete blowout so you always need to think about each trade critically No shame in sitting it out altogether amp nbsp The Spreadsheet To aid us in planning our trades this week I ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week https docs google com spreadsheets d 14TOO6S W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh Fl pN3dxsREv0 edit usp sharing Using this spreadsheet we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker Obviously past performance isn t indicative of future success but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information If you re struggling to find a given stock click on the ticker symbol on the index page it should hyperlink you straight to the table If the above link isn t working for you refer to the link below amp nbsp Spreadsheet HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 14TOO6S W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh Fl pN3dxsREv0 edit usp sharing amp nbsp Please note that scraping and compiling this data took hours If the sheet has helped you out in any way please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials It would mean alot to me Most websites also require you to pay for this data which I think is a load of shit amp nbsp Interesting Observations and Sample Plays Below I ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance If I missed anything feel free to bring it to my attention amp nbsp First and foremost expect extra volatility this week Many of the companies who report this week are young and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their true values Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies Be wary of second time reporters such as Opendoor QuantumScape Upstart Poshmark etc Having only reported earnings once before we can t necessarily make any reliable predictions on these tickers so it may be best to avoid them all together The IV is cranked and even though the moves have the potential to be massive the risk just isn t worth it Lots of heavy movers report this week Some notable names include Magnite Novavax Canada Goose Vroom and Sonos Expect some insane post earnings moves and high volatility if you plan on playing these tickers It s tough to tell which way either of these tickers will go but according to the historical data at 10 move isn t uncommon Similar to PENN and DKNG last week we can make a similar play with VLDR and LAZR this week VLDRs report before LAZR and as a result we can use VLDR s price action to gage the expected movement of LAZR when it reports Thursday after hours Keep in mind this method can be used to predict the direction the price will go but not the magnitude Don t be afraid to play tickers who have never reported earnings before Some names include household favorite s UWMC PSFE RBLX and COIN All of these tickers report earnings for the very first time since going public this quarter so if you re looking to roll the dice on some newly minted tickers this is your opportunity Each company has some fun catalysts in the pipeline so you ve got a good chance to bag some gains should you choose to do so amp nbsp Obviously since I gave data on over 50 companies there s plenty that I ve missed Dive in have a look around and have some fun with it Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes and get the best risk reward possible Feel free to share your findings too I d love to see what you guys come up with amp nbsp Conclusion We ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week meaning there s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles Use the spreadsheet https docs google com spreadsheets d 14TOO6S W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh Fl pN3dxsREv0 edit usp sharing to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio and play accordingly If enough people found these useful I ll continue making them throughout the earnings season If the sheet has helped you out in any way please consider dropping an upvote or a comment and checking out my socials it would mean a lot to me Happy

jpg width 800 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s e33fa2868ec0edb3f32c872f48f73869b03d7555 Paysafe is one hell of a company They are a fin tech like PayPal and Squares thus should be given a higher multiple for valuation They got a lot of exciting and growth customers like Barstool PENN YouTube Google Twitch AMZN FanDuel PDYPY Roblox RBLX CoinBase COIN Visa V ApplePay APPL BetMGM MGM Spotify SPOT Microsoft Xbox etc and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet 2 in market share where you can trade buy the fast growing e currencies I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases https www reddit com r stocks comments mysz54 reviewing the bear case on paysafe psfe https www reddit com r stocks comments mysz54 reviewing the bear case on paysafe psfe the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe including but not limited to its valuation and bear cases so I m not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub Most of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth As an example EV related stocks PLUG BLNK QS LAZR NKLA BLDP etc get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don t even have revenue yet worth billions While this assumption may be accurate it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate Because of this predictive nature it s really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop When or if it will pop is anyone s guess So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk high rewards But what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners If your customers partners revenue grows it s more likely than not they are using more of your products or services Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers partners financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start For this reason Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential Paysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11 The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth 1 PENN Reported

Revenue and Raises 2021 Guidance https www businesswire com news home 20210504006307 en CORRECTING and REPLACING Skillz Reports Record Q1 Revenue and Raises 2021 Guidance As you can see these Paysafe s customers partners are reporting explosive growth While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost i e Draftking However here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe These companies reported earnings before Paysafe so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow May 11 Several things to note about Paysafe besides their customer s earning growth These factors will also influence Paysafe s future growth 1 They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG MGM PENN SKLZ etc 2 Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again Also when re opening occur more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe 3 They are 2 in digital wallets and you can buy digitalcurrency with the wallet These currencies has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ more on this below Finally both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation Paypal earning May 5 2021 Revenue 6 03 billion vs 5 90 billion expected by Refinitiv source https www cnbc com 2021 05 05 paypal pypl earnings q1 2021 html https www cnbc com 2021 05 05 paypal pypl earnings q1 2021 html Square earning May 6 2021 Square reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts It also brought in 5 06 billion of revenue vs 3 36 billion expected by Refinitiv source https www cnbc com 2021 05 06 square sq earnings q1 2021 html https www cnbc com 2021 05 06 square sq earnings q1 2021 html So I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th For those of you who don t know Paysafe they are not a small player Their transaction volume is about that of SQ 100 Billion If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple See the reddit link above for DD on valuation Paysafe involved with Gaming Sports digitalcurrency which I find very exciting and feel that if I own the stock I ll be part of the journey of growth with these sectors Roaring Kitty DeepFuckingValue simply invested in GME because he liked the stock I m investing in Paysafe simply because it s cool and sexy regardless of its growth potential In summary I think Paysafe is a low risk high reward stock compare to other fintech Their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward They got the 2nd largest digital wallet They are involved in the highly popular and fast growth digital currency market I believe as a monopoly in iGaming Sport Betting their growth will be massive when the 4 largest states CA TX NY FL begin to allow online sport betting This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has this space This is a massive high growth area and they own it For these reasons I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play Disclaimer I own Paysafe commons warrants

given a higher multiple for valuation They got a lot of exciting and growth customers like Barstool PENN YouTube Google Twitch AMZN FanDuel PDYPY Roblox RBLX CoinBase COIN Visa V ApplePay APPL BetMGM MGM Spotify SPOT Microsoft Xbox etc and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet 2 in market share where you can trade buy the fast growing e currencies which is growing in popularity I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases https www reddit com r stocks comments mysz54 reviewing the bear case on paysafe psfe https www reddit com r stocks comments mysz54 reviewing the bear case on paysafe psfe the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe valuation in depth and discussion of bear cases so I m not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub Most of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth As an example EV related stocks PLUG BLNK QS LAZR NKLA BLDP etc get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don t even have revenue yet worth billions While this assumption may be accurate it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate Because of this predictive nature it s really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop When or if it will pop is anyone s guess So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk high rewards But what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners If your customers partners revenue grows it s more likely than not they are using more of your products or services Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers partners financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start For this reason Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential Paysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11 The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth 1 PENN Reported May 7 2021 Penn National s income from operations rose to 216 5 million in the first quarter against 560 6 million in the prior year quarter Adjusted EBITDAR jumped 77 2

you can see these Paysafe s customers partners are reporting explosive growth While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost i e Draftking However here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe These companies reported earnings before Paysafe so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow May 11 Several things to note about Paysafe besides their customer s earning growth These factors will also influence Paysafe s future growth 1 They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG MGM PENN SKLZ etc 2 Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again Also when re opening occur more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe 3 They are 2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital stuff with the wallet These currencies has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ on their 1st qtr report more on this below Finally both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation Paypal earning May 5 2021 Revenue 6 03 billion vs 5 90 billion expected by Refinitiv source https www cnbc com 2021 05 05 paypal pypl earnings q1 2021 html https www cnbc com 2021 05 05 paypal pypl earnings q1 2021 html Square earning May 6 2021 Square reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts It also brought in 5 06 billion of revenue vs 3 36 billion expected by Refinitiv source https www cnbc com 2021 05 06 square sq earnings q1 2021 html https www cnbc com 2021 05 06 square sq earnings q1 2021 html So I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th For those of you who don t know Paysafe they are not a small player Their transaction volume is about that of SQ 100 Billion I get it people will say look man their CAGR is way too small compare to PayPal or SQ I m not looking at the past I m looking at the future Their CAGR estimate did not include the sportbetting igaming growth Remember that Sportbetting was banned in the USA but has been overturned by the SCOTUS recently Right now less than 1 2 the population can bet online and the 4 largest states haven t yet legalized online gaming This is why I post the results from their customers like DKNG and PENN which is showing high growth rate And best of all They own this space in online gambling as they are a monopoly So we ll see what their new CAGR will be going forward once they reported earning tomorrow May 11 If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple See the reddit link above for DD on valuation Paysafe involved with Gaming Sports e wallet currencies which I find very exciting and feel that if I own the stock I ll be part of the journey of growth with these sectors Roaring Kitty DeepFuckingValue simply invested in GME because he liked the stock I m investing in Paysafe simply because it s cool and sexy regardless of its growth potential Paysafe I believed is a lower risk and high reward stock since their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward They got the 2nd largest digital wallet I believe as a monopoly in iGaming Sport Betting their growth will be massive when 20 states including the 4 largest states CA TX NY FL begin to allow online sport betting This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has this space This is a massive high growth as seen with DKNG PENN MGM 1st qtr report area and they owns it For these reason I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play Disclaimer I own Paysafe commons warrants and option calls I am not a financial adviser I m more or less like you

FUBO QS SNDL and More, Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation Week 4 PLTR BABA XPEV DIS SPCE FUBO QS SNDL and More amp nbsp What s poppin bull gang Flux here with Week 4 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week cause it s time to do it all again This week is a little janky because a whole boatload of new companies are reporting so we don t actually have comprehensive historical data for them Instead of the standard 25 datapoints we ve got closer to half that and in some cases even less Trade carefully everyone I ve omitted Monday AM and Friday AM reporters due to there being no relevant companies reporting on the given days amp nbsp All that being said I fucking love earnings season It s an absolute battleground out there Insane volatility breaking announcements and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time What s not to love Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers roll the dice and amass a small fortune That being said the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders many find that they re one bad trade away from a complete blowout so you always need to think about each trade critically No shame in sitting it out altogether amp nbsp The Spreadsheet To aid us in planning our trades this week I ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week https docs google com spreadsheets d 14TOO6S W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh Fl pN3dxsREv0 edit usp sharing Using this spreadsheet we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker Obviously past performance isn t indicative of future success but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information If you re struggling to find a given stock click on the ticker symbol on the index page it should hyperlink you straight to the table If the above link isn t working for you refer to the link below amp nbsp Spreadsheet HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 14TOO6S W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh Fl pN3dxsREv0 edit usp sharing amp nbsp Please note that scraping and compiling this data took hours If the sheet has helped you out in any way please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials It would mean alot to me Most websites also require you to pay for this data which I think is a load of shit amp nbsp Interesting Observations and Sample Plays Below I ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance If I missed anything feel free to bring it to my attention amp nbsp First and foremost expect extra volatility this week Many of the companies who report this week are young and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their true values Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies Be wary of second time reporters such as Opendoor QuantumScape Upstart Poshmark etc Having only reported earnings once before we can t necessarily make any reliable predictions on these tickers so it may be best to avoid them all together The IV is cranked and even though the moves have the potential to be massive the risk just isn t worth it Lots of heavy movers report this week Some notable names include Magnite Novavax Canada Goose Vroom and Sonos Expect some insane post earnings moves and high volatility if you plan on playing these tickers It s tough to tell which way either of these tickers will go but according to the historical data at 10 move isn t uncommon Similar to PENN and DKNG last week we can make a similar play with VLDR and LAZR this week VLDRs report before LAZR and as a result we can use VLDR s price action to gage the expected movement of LAZR when it reports Thursday after hours Keep in mind this method can be used to predict the direction the price will go but not the magnitude Don t be afraid to play tickers who have never reported earnings before Some names include household favorite s UWMC PSFE RBLX and COIN All of these tickers report earnings for the very first time since going public this quarter so if you re looking to roll the dice on some newly minted tickers this is your opportunity Each company has some fun catalysts in the pipeline so you ve got a good chance to bag some gains should you choose to do so amp nbsp Obviously since I gave data on over 50 companies there s plenty that I ve missed Dive in have a look around and have some fun with it Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes and get the best risk reward possible Feel free to share your findings too I d love to see what you guys come up with amp nbsp Conclusion We ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week meaning there s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles Use the spreadsheet https docs google com spreadsheets d 14TOO6S W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh Fl pN3dxsREv0 edit usp sharing to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio and play accordingly If enough people found these useful I ll continue making them throughout the earnings season If the sheet has helped you out in any way please consider dropping an upvote or a comment and checking out my socials it would mean a lot to me Happy Trading Everybody

enable effortless credit based on true risk We are a leading artificial intelligence AI lending platform designed to improve access to affordable credit while reducing the risk and costs of lending for our bank partners Our platform uses sophisticated machine learning models to more accurately identify risk and approve more applicants than traditional credit score based lending models Why should I care Upstart is one of the few AI companies outside of FAANG to actually Make a profit they are GAAP net income profitable Demonstrate product market fit Upstart s business is in lending a market that has a number of characteristics that make it a highly optimal AI use case The end goal can be clearly defined and measured Make higher alpha lending decisions vs traditional human driven credit analysts and over reliance on credit scores More accurate credit risk evaluation by AI means more people can be approved for more loans with fewer defaults Upstart claims it excels when evaluating risk for individuals like immigrants younger lenders that have no credit score or a borderline credit score that would usually get them denied elsewhere Upstart also claims https www upstart com for banks that at the same approval rate they are able to hit 75 fewer defaults which means more for lenders who use their platform Around 71 of loans originated by UPST are instantly approved and fully automated a big plus in the current consumer environment that expects instant gratification A robust supply of underlying data UPST s AI models their secret sauce use a combination of Employment History Credit Experience Education Cost of Living Bank Transactions and Application Interaction with probably thousands of data points per model Being able to leverage data points that would normally not be factored in to a human credit analyst decision making presents clear potential for increased performance Easily scalable to adjacent applications The TAM for unsecured personal loans according to TransUnion for Q4 2019 Q3 2020 is 92B That s a huge addressable market for Upstart but what makes the company even more exciting is their recent expansion to Auto Loans UPST announced their acquisition of Prodigy Software last quarter a software company that created an end to end platform to allow dealerships to offer buy now pay later deals to customers buying cars as a bolt on no effort for dealerships they get a cut of the profits This is huge in terms of expanding UPST addressable market Auto Retail is probably the biggest BNPL markets with around 626B in Q4 2019 Q3 2020 originations If this acquisition is successful in hitting the same metrics it would demonstrate the platform appeal of UPST s technology a plug n play AI engine that can be adapted to different market contexts Why now UPST made a meteoric move upwards on their last earnings call by backing up their claims with real hard numbers and highly optimistic guidance Not going to go in depth on the numbers as you can read those for yourself but I think the key thing to take away here is their guidance for FY21 approx 500M in revenue If they hit or exceed this it would demonstrate a huge inflection point in their growth and a sign that their technology has hit a point where it is generating significant value for bank partners Like with most platform driven companies investors are looking for this exact spike up to call success failure on the whole thing Over the past 2 months UPST has fallen from ATH s and is now around the 90 range Similar companies like Affirm AFRM have dropped even further recently on headwinds for BNPL fintech platforms and increased competition However I think UPST currently has the best in breed tech platform best talent amp team and the best competitive position to take over this emerging market any further concrete evidence of this in Q1 2021 tomorrow will take this very sharply upward Risks Continued market pressure on growth fin tech stocks Anything less than stellar delivery on current guidance Weak guidance for Q2 End Notes Things to pay attention to in their earnings call 1 early indications of traction in the auto loan market post acquisition 2 any updates and new strategies for BD product strategy going forward into 2021 they recently did a post IPO secondary offering 120 hopefully they will elucidate more on what they plan to do with the money riased 3 they recently launched the UPST referral network that basically offers a plug n play whitelisted consumer loan portfolio solution to banks and credit unions who don t have the resources to build it all out in house very curious to see UPST s evaluation of the potential market for this and any traction in the past month since they released https www upstart com for banks referral network My position Mostly shares some highly OTM calls super cheap rn for 5 21 to capitalize on the post earnings upside potential

reddit com r wallstreetbets comments n6q9v0 regeneron rgen is rumored to be buying out ino Buying out INO at 30 is pump and dump garbage Second thread I m responding to https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments n70cim my first dd im a doctor and i think ino is about Emotional appeal of the treatments I get I worked in GBM for years its a horrible disease very resistant to treatment As someone who has analyzed clinical trials across all solid tumors but GBM especially I can tell you that their trial isn t anything special more likely than not to fail at Phase 3 Arguments Presented for INO Moonshot Regeneron is looking at acquiring for 30 share I cannot comment on whether Regeneron is pursuing an acquisition for sure It seems pretty strange though Regeneron is your typical biopharma with strong focus in oncology large molecules rheumatology anti virals etc You see this kind of approach everywhere think Genentech Gilead etc These have very established sales channels primarily sold to the rich world large indications i e lots of patients in other words On the other hand INO has a focus on vaccine development Trials very frequently fail distribution is extremely difficult and you are often selling to poorer countries with worse health infrastructure Add on top of that the recent bad news for INO s COVID vaccine where they are forced to find new funding their Phase 3 trial Add on top of that I don t believe INO even has a product in market i e approved for use ON TOP OF THAT paying 4x current share price for a bunch of Phase 1 Phase 2 drugs is fucking crazy Thus I have a hard time understanding what the synergies would be between the big biopharma business model and the vaccine development at INO The first related article I cited above is probably a pump and dump douchebag Arguments presented for INO in GBM I know a bit about GBM I worked in pharma forecasting for a long time which means I spent a lot of time studying clinical trials and trying to figure out what doctors are likely to use in the next 15 20 years I ve frequently been in the same room with research directors chief medical officers for some of the most well respected biopharma firms in the business I was always the guy taking notes so don t get the wrong impression but I ve at least heard how they think about trial design On top of that I ve spoken to hundreds of oncologists about how and why they treat my focus was solid tumor oncology and especially GBM My knowledge is a little dated as I haven t actively been in the industry in awhile but it s not so dated that I m wrong about INO To address the second article cited I agree that GBM is a horrible disease Extremely difficult to treat the symptoms are a nightmare for oncologists patients and their families I can t tell you how many treatments have tried and failed to make a dent even treatments that have proven revolutionary in other areas of oncology think anti PD 1s This is where my agreements with OP s DD end First off INO 5401 is not an anti PD 1 OP was even called out for this in the comments but never edited this in the post In fact the trial they reference https www clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT03491683 literally has an anti PD 1 developed by Regeneron as part of the treatment combination use of two or more PD 1s is outside the current norm From the CT gov website INO 5401 is a combination of 3 separate DNA plasmids targeting Wilms tumor gene 1 WT1 antigen prostate specific membrane antigen PSMA and human telomerase reverse transcriptase hTERT genes It s actually a kind of vaccine Similarly the other INO molecule INO 9012 is a type of vaccine that targets IL 12 You can find the same info on the INO website https www inovio com dna medicines pipeline though worryingly they don t even reference INO 9012 which is pretty weird This directly refutes the OP s main thrust about results which is based on the claim that INO owns an efficacious PD 1 inhibitor Analysis of Interim Results If you want to invest in pharma you need to understand clinical trial data There are other factors critical to understanding a molecule s subsequent success but nothing can happen without positive data During Phase 1 trials and joint Phase 1 Phase 2 as INO s GBM trial is the trial is intentionally designed to show us how safe the molecule is It is NOT necessarily designed to show us how efficacious the molecule is though we can begin to glean it from the results Phase 2 trials will be designed to indicate potential efficacy then Phase 3 trials are the big test of efficacy As I mentioned the INO GBM trial is a P1 P2 trial so we are mostly looking for adverse events AEs the most common measure of safety trying to see if the risk is outweighed by any potential benefits Therefore any claims about efficacy should be understood as directional that is as a way of helping us judge whether this merits more study not whether it is an effective new treatment for GBM As far as I can tell INO has not released any AE data for this trial thus far In as much as efficacy data exists we have the PFS progression free survival a common measure of efficacy in cancer data that the OP mentions https www prnewswire com news releases inovio demonstrates 80 6 month progression free survival in phase 2 glioblastoma multiforme gbm study with ino 5401 in combination with pd 1 inhibitor libtayo cemiplimab 300951433 html This states that 75 patients had yet to progress after 6 months of treatment What it only mentions in passing is that patients also received the current standard of care which is radiation therapy RTx and temozolomide TMZ in addition to INO 5401 INO 9012 and cemiplimab This is important for two reasons 1 It muddies the water around efficacy It s unclear whether patients are responding to the current standard of care which is standard because it s the best we have or whether patients are responding to the new molecules 2 That is an aggressive fucking treatment regimen 4 drug combination treatment plus RTx is extremely rare anywhere in oncology much less in a tumor where patients have crippling symptoms to begin with and poor health overall Aggressive treatments tend to have good efficacy but poor AE profiles meaning that patients feel like absolute dogshit while attempting to survive both their disease and the harsh treatments Again I haven t seen interim data on the AEs perhaps other folks know better than me but I m guessing we are going to see early discontinuation bad sign Some patients may choose to feel very sick in order to have a few extra months of life but it s certainly not uncommon for patients to opt out of that With regards to the PFS being on first line 1L treatment in GBM for 6 months is not uncommon I would say that 50 of patients will take 6 months to reach first progression with standard of care based on proprietary datasets of n gt 300 That compares with 75 80 for this trial where n is very small n 20 and n 32 This is likely not significant stat guys can help me in testing these values but I doubt p lt 0 05 On top of that I have seen some interim OS overall survival another common measure of efficacy in cancer and often seen as the most important in GBM data presented at SNO last year https www biospace com article releases inovio presents clinical results of its dna medicines ino 5401 ino 9012 in novel combination with pd 1 inhibitor libtayo cemiplimab in the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme at society for neuro oncology 2020 meeting showing median OS of 18 months for one arm and 70 alive at 18 months in the other arm This is also pretty mediocre Median OS overall of GBM patients is probably around 18 20 months based on epi data n probably gt 8k per year from SEER Again I very much doubt p values would be significant with such a small sample size We should not take efficacy data too seriously at this stage but I wanted to refute some of the ideas put forward by the OP and say that the efficacy data presented isn t too interesting I would probably call it standard for an acceptable P1 P2 trial Analysis of GBM Business Case GBM is an extremely under served tumor type If you can get good efficacy here you are definitely going to make some money However because the disease has a small amount of patients and the duration of treatment is very short sadly patients do not live for very long there s not a ton of money for INO or anyone else to make here I am of course a strong believer in studying efficacy regardless of revenue potential in case it will help patients but as an investor WSB subscriber profits matter Let s say for the sake of argument that in Phase 3 we see PFS increase by 3 months and OS increase by 3 months with no difference in AEs compared to standard of care This would be lauded by oncologists as an incredible improvement no question We have now overcome the safety and efficacy barriers I mentioned earlier You now need to get payers onboard We are adding 3 new drugs with standard pricing models for each we could say that s probably around 400k per patient per year in the US It will be less in other countries perhaps 1 4 that price in other rich countries but very few country level payers will accept 100k per year for 3 months OS improvement Developing world is absolutely out of the picture at this or indeed any price point US payers will shit a brick about this cost to efficacy ratio I would expect a ton of payer management step therapies prior authorizations the whole gamut No way this gets more than 20 of the 1L market in the US perhaps 5 ex US This means very few patients will ever benefit anyways People familiar with the economics of oncology pricing will recognize this kind of outcome It would single handedly be the biggest barrier to revenue Not only that but INO only takes home 65 of the revenue I mentioned above as the remainder will go to Regeneron s PD 1 treatment Note pricing in pharma is almost impossible to predict accurately so give me a little leeway here I m just trying to illustrate a big potential issue I see even if the INO treatments are approved with this label Please dont interpret this as me dunking on the OP I m glad he s excited about new treatments for GBM I am too However I thought that my background would give me some insights you guys might appreciate I hope I m wrong about INO and that OP s tendies will forever be hot and crispy A huge caveat to the above analysis is that I haven t looked into INO s HPV pipeline nor their infectious disease pipeline However I didn t come across any great news there either so I would probably expect their performance to be middling if not somewhat disappointing They could make an acquisition target for some pharma giant but if a bid came in soon I would expect it at 7 50 share if anything No positions on INO thinking about a 6 00P for Jan 2022

FUBO QS SNDL and More, Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation Week 4 PLTR BABA XPEV DIS SPCE FUBO QS SNDL and More amp nbsp What s poppin bull gang Flux here with Week 4 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week cause it s time to do it all again This week is a little janky because a whole boatload of new companies are reporting so we don t actually have comprehensive historical data for them Instead of the standard 25 datapoints we ve got closer to half that and in some cases even less Trade carefully everyone I ve omitted Monday AM and Friday AM reporters due to there being no relevant companies reporting on the given days amp nbsp All that being said I fucking love earnings season It s an absolute battleground out there Insane volatility breaking announcements and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time What s not to love Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers roll the dice and amass a small fortune That being said the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders many find that they re one bad trade away from a complete blowout so you always need to think about each trade critically No shame in sitting it out altogether amp nbsp The Spreadsheet To aid us in planning our trades this week I ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week https docs google com spreadsheets d 14TOO6S W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh Fl pN3dxsREv0 edit usp sharing Using this spreadsheet we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker Obviously past performance isn t indicative of future success but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information If you re struggling to find a given stock click on the ticker symbol on the index page it should hyperlink you straight to the table If the above link isn t working for you refer to the link below amp nbsp Spreadsheet HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 14TOO6S W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh Fl pN3dxsREv0 edit usp sharing amp nbsp Please note that scraping and compiling this data took hours If the sheet has helped you out in any way please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials It would mean alot to me Most websites also require you to pay for this data which I think is a load of shit amp nbsp Interesting Observations and Sample Plays Below I ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance If I missed anything feel free to bring it to my attention amp nbsp First and foremost expect extra volatility this week Many of the companies who report this week are young and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their true values Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies Be wary of second time reporters such as Opendoor QuantumScape Upstart Poshmark etc Having only reported earnings once before we can t necessarily make any reliable predictions on these tickers so it may be best to avoid them all together The IV is cranked and even though the moves have the potential to be massive the risk just isn t worth it Lots of heavy movers report this week Some notable names include Magnite Novavax Canada Goose Vroom and Sonos Expect some insane post earnings moves and high volatility if you plan on playing these tickers It s tough to tell which way either of these tickers will go but according to the historical data at 10 move isn t uncommon Similar to PENN and DKNG last week we can make a similar play with VLDR and LAZR this week VLDRs report before LAZR and as a result we can use VLDR s price action to gage the expected movement of LAZR when it reports Thursday after hours Keep in mind this method can be used to predict the direction the price will go but not the magnitude Don t be afraid to play tickers who have never reported earnings before Some names include household favorite s UWMC PSFE RBLX and COIN All of these tickers report earnings for the very first time since going public this quarter so if you re looking to roll the dice on some newly minted tickers this is your opportunity Each company has some fun catalysts in the pipeline so you ve got a good chance to bag some gains should you choose to do so amp nbsp Obviously since I gave data on over 50 companies there s plenty that I ve missed Dive in have a look around and have some fun with it Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes and get the best risk reward possible Feel free to share your findings too I d love to see what you guys come up with amp nbsp Conclusion We ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week meaning there s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles Use the spreadsheet https docs google com spreadsheets d 14TOO6S W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh Fl pN3dxsREv0 edit usp sharing to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio and play accordingly If enough people found these useful I ll continue making them throughout the earnings season If the sheet has helped you out in any way please consider dropping an upvote or a comment and checking out my socials it would mean a lot to me Happy Trading Everybody

this post by saying i m currently balls deep in IQST and have gotten an absolute ass whooping over the last month but i ve done my due diligence and I believe this company has alot to offer Basic knowledge for reference MKT CAP 83 1 Million Current price 60 cents So let s start off with the DD I will be using the bracket point Bull or Bear respectively to illustrate where I stand on each of the points and how I believe that point impacts the business amp x200B 1 Insane revenue Multiple revenue streams all in very interesting fields Bull IQST has pulled in a 44 9 million in the year 2020 amp plans to expand that revenue to 60 5 million which I genuinely believe may be a conservative number they made 18mil in 2019 so you can clearly see the revenue is growing at a very rapid pace This company is involved in high growth areas such as Blockchain Technology services They re into battery solutions and are working on an EV motorbike Internet of things Telecommunications and FinTech more They announced the first production of 2500 units of their Internet of things Award winning Smart Tank to be launched this month not sure if they have started yet but this is an additional new source of revenue for the company This revenue is much higher than companies such as ALPP and CLSK who are both valued more than 5x what this company is despite showing very low revenue growth relative to this stock I can go on and on about this company and it s revenue revenue streams but im trying to keep this DD relatively short This company trades at lt 2x price to revenue amp x200B 2 Customers Bullish This stock has some very high profile customers that are very eye opening on the first glance some of these costumers include Verizon IBM T Mobile and FLOW these people being customers is one of the main selling points for me as it shows that this company is able to perform at the highest level and can attract leaders in the telecommunications industry as customers amp x200B 3 Marketing Bullish and potentially Bearish IMPORTANT READ The thing I like about this stock is that it s always providing updates to it s investors on where each project is going these updates seem to come weekly and as an investor it is very nice to see this transparency It seems that compared to other stocks anywhere near a similar value it is much harder to find any information on them and it is a pain to undergo any analysis as you have to do a very deep dive to get information outside of the companies website on them My personal belief is that due to their expertise in the telecom and marketing departments they are able to effectively advertise better than most companies valued similarly This one is hard for me to write as someone who is invested in the stock but the bearish point of this marketing is that perhaps it s making things seem better than it really is and this marketing is in hope of a pump in the stocks price A big problem I see is that alot of the articles I see is that it is sourced from IQST themselves 4 Balance Sheet BEAR Arguably the most bearish point of this DD is a TATL lt 1 Meaning that this company has more Liabilities than assets which is never a good sign however if you pay attention to the company it is slowly reducing it s liabilities and slightly increasing assets over the last year 5 Management Meh Not necessarily a Bear point as the managers don t seem to have a bad track record however there was nothing that really stood out Most of the people in this company have years of experience in the telecom business which is their largest department at the moment Their team also consists of a lot of engineers which I personally like since I am currently studying to become an engineer and engineering CEO s tend to bring in alot more money although this isn t true for all individual cases I like the way that the company is going about diversifying revenue sources in high growth areas but at the same time that is a double edged sword on a company who doesn t have the greatest balance sheet For this point I say meh as it can definitely come back to bite the company but I think with the rollout of the smart tank this early investment can easily pay off heavily 6 Price amp Price action BEAR As i ve stated at the beginning of this DD this company has been biting me in the ass over the last month or two but this I believe is due to market manipulation from hedgies The reason I say this is because i ve been in this stock for a while and this stock moves methodically downwards it will have a huge spike up Like today then over a while it will slowly sell off and trend downwards then have another huge spike this i believe is due to naked shorting however I have no proof and I am not saying that I am right with this Another reason I think hedgies are potentially involved is due to trading bans that limit the volume of trades day which basically has forced the price even further downwards amp x200B 7 Conclusion Few stocks offer the growth potential and such a large diversity into high growth fields as IQST and unlike most speculation stocks this stock has proven and continues to prove that it can make money and has quite a few catalysts coming very soon The only problem is it s margins which should improve within the next year or two amp a bad balance sheet They also plan on uplisting to a higher OTC market NASDAQ which should help the price alot On the flipside the stock has been been absolutely slashed as of recently and is definitely a high risk play I m personally invested on a DCA of 96 cents Let me know what you guys think about my first DD TLDR Ez 10 bagger under good conditions portfolio wiper under bad but good outweighs bad imo
