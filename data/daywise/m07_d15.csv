know next to nothing about money markets but I know a lot about EVs and the car sales industry My small business has put a lot of EVs on the road over the past year and I am on a quest to put most if not all of my earnings into EV Charging Stations People are buying and leasing cars they can t put gas in but they still gotta go places so I want to buy in to the Charge Stations I want to buy in to the most convenient charge network one that delivers a fast charge in convenient places where I d park anyway Tl dr EVGO went on sale today as they acquired PlugShare com The best charging network bought the best site for finding a charger Buy amp Hold EVGO Actual EV drivers on the East Coast prefer this charge network So do GM https www evgo com press release general motors and evgo aim to

whitehouse gov briefing room statements releases 2021 04 22 fact sheet biden administration advances electric vehicle charging infrastructure EVgo has the balance of cost to install and utility to drivers figured out which is absolutely key to scaling in this industry Don t buy CHPT I think it s a trap because the product is not very useful in real life despite being 1 largest EVSE network in the US The more I unravel the more I realize that this network is more about raising money valuation than it is about charging cars and getting drivers on their way BG amp Motivation People will need to charge their cars and EV adoption is climbing big time so it seems like investing in charge stations is a great bet as long as you invest in the right one This idea started because I actually wanted to own my own charge station in a strip mall or a Wendy s parking lot or something My research into that taught me enough about the material costs of electricians and permits and thus I have pivoted into trying to buy charge station stock instead of a physical charge station If anyone knows how I can own my own commercial EVSE in strip malls in NJ please message me I am interested Who am I I try to restrict being a shill to this section Everyone is presumed a shill posting investment advice here Here is my stake I own and operate a 1 man car lease brokerage LLC I help connect people that want to lease new Hyundai Cars amp SUVs Electric Gas and Hybrid to authorized dealerships that have those cars at fair prices I post content including price guidelines on car buying leasing forums to better educate prospective customers on market conditions when it comes to leasing their new ride Beyond that customers can text me where I charge a 249 brokerage fee to provide a more personal level of service and an escalation point outside of the dealership You may have seen enough dealership horror stories to understand why I may have a place in the new car market Frankly my level of pricing process transparency is unique in the US market for new Hyundai vehicles All that aside this post isn t about getting you in a new car today it s about profiting off of charging your car in the future whatever you buy lease and wherever you buy lease it from If you look at how important Gas prices have been to the economy it s a no brainer that EV charging is going to be big money More chargers will be a necessity and the lack of enough fast chargers is a potential bottleneck to seeing more new EVs join the road If there is nowhere to charge the cars I m worried that I will lose opportunities to connect prospective customers to new EVs As an EV driver myself I find EVgo to be the most convenient app and station network to find a charger and so I bought a heavy position in CLII before the merger Today I bought more as the stock dipped below 11 again Why EVgo is the Best Charge Network for Consumers EVGO stations are on average and by my approximation 30 50x more expensive to install but charge a car 7x faster compared to the average Chargepoint Station Over 100 miles of range per hour vs 25 miles of range per hour again this is on average most of Chargepoint s stations are Level 2 Electrify America Volkswagen does have a few faster stations that are on average 100x more expensive to install than ChargePoint Level 2 stations or 3x more expensive to install than EVGO stations Those stations can charge compatible cars even faster as fast as 160 miles in 22 minutes https media electrifyamerica com en us releases 75 but I believe the infrastructure costs will keep those stations at designated sites major interstates etc EVGO provides that Sweet spot where its feasible to deploy to the average American strip mall 50kW charge stations in more places Per Forbes https www forbes com sites bradtempleton 2020 07 09 the future of ev charging may be at 50kw not the gasoline thinking of 250kw https www forbes com sites bradtempleton 2020 07 09 the future of ev charging may be at 50kw not the gasoline thinking of 250kw As an EV Driver it is delightful to pull up to a station that is conveniently near the shops business attraction you already want to go to and know your car can add 100 miles of range per hour while you re parked running your errands In my opinion in this business it s not about a race to having the fastest charge station in the middle of nowhere where you have to watch Netflix in your car This is what EVGO gets right consumer facing Fast enough charging in the right places Why EVGO makes sense as an Investment to Me In addition to a superior charging network and partnerships with major automotive players the executive leadership at EVGO has strong ties to the Biden Administration Biden recently test drove the all electric F150 with a big smile on his face so I m going with the political climate of EVs and EV charge stations to be healthy Biden also visited an EVgo station recently My philosophy is that even if this dips people will need to charge their cars and there s no way it s not a solid long term play This stock doubled in price when the EVGO CLII merger was first announced but now it s basically back down to its original valuation which is what made me feel that now is the time to strike again Additional Facts EVGO is the only 3rd party charge network that displays its own logo in Dash on charging Teslas due to partnership with Tesla EVGO only builds new stations that will be cash flow positive in 7 years or less based on their model of EV adoption in given locales Why CHPT is Annoying for Consumers The problem with Chargepoint is two fold 1 Most of their chargers are sloowwww but labeled as Level 2 fast chargers 25 miles of range added to your car per hour plugged in 2 Find a Charger apps GPS etc don t always differentiate charger types when routing frequently directing EV drivers to shit stations that leave them stranded in parking lots for extreme amounts of time Frequently the driver thinks they are going to a fast charger but their definition of Fast is very different from Chargepoint s definition of fast The advantage of Chargepoint is it s simple amp cheap to install You just need a 240V 40A circuit such as one for a dryer or air compressor to add a Chargepoint to your existing building lot If you want to charge faster than this you need 480V three phase power The difference in investment to install goes from a 10k job to install one charger to a 300k job to install one charger The result is Chargepoint advertises this massive network of chargers but in reality they re only useful if they re at say a hotel where your car will be plugged in overnight You see these things at supermarkets and hospitals and at strip malls all over but they only recoup 20 30 miles of range while you re in the store running your errands basically negating any benefit after circling a parking lot and finding one to plug in You also see a bunch of small Boomer town halls getting excited about being part of the future for installing one ChargePoint L2 charger https www kingston ny gov evstations in a municipal https www kioskmarketplace com news connecticut town installs ev charging station lot somewhere The best example I can give is on two different occasions I got stuck on a Chargepoint My destination was 100 or 200 miles away but I only had about 30 miles of range left on my car The nearest Chargepoint was 25 miles away and the nearest DC Fast Charger was about 50 miles away I could not make it to the Fast Charger so I had to divert to a Chargepoint Since the Chargepoint was a detour I needed to sit at the Chargepoint to recoup 40 miles of range before I d be able to make it to the fast charger So I spent 90 minutes in a hospital parking lot in the middle of nowhere Then my car had just enough range to drive to the nearest fast charger Once I got to the fast charger another 90 minutes added 300 miles of range to my car But still because I was 10 miles short on range getting there I had no option but to add nearly 3 hours of detour Over 80 of Chargepoints are useless for getting you any further than the next charging station Consumers expect the average charge station to perform 10 12x faster than what most of Chargepoint s fleet provides And 10 12x faster than Chargepoint is still a lot slower than getting Gas Why Reddit Has Made me Think CHPT is Also a Scheme Financially So this part is inspired by Reddit I noticed during the height of the GME volatility that there really was enough evidence of some of these popular blogs pushing an anti GME shill agenda type of thing I saw that Cramer interview and I took a step back and realized that it did make sense that the companies buying Google Ads to hype stocks might have a financial stake in those values And sure enough when you Google for NYSE CHPT those same type of sites come up StockNews SeekingAlpha InvestorPlace Motley Fool etc These guys are pumping CHPT and so this is where I can see this alleged shill blog behavior could be either ignorant or dishonest in a market and landscape I actually understand the fundamentals of I think about being stuck for 90 minutes at a Chargepoint to add 40 miles of range to make it to an Electrify America where 90 minutes added 300 miles of range and took me home and I call bullshit on these Pro CHPT articles Thank you Reddit and thank you to those sites themselves that tipped off the general public at how they work during the period of peak GME volatility That historical information gives me confidence in asking this opinion and shower thought What if a large Chargepoint shareholder actually tried to use a Chargepoint Station got stranded or inconvenienced on the side of the road and realized that this needs to pump dump to get out thus paying for some media coverage to hype the stock I just don t want to buy CHPT because the service isn t useful to me The question I d love to ask anyone that owns that stock is is the service useful to you Have you used it to charge your electric car A point on Electrify America main competitor of EVgo growth What not everyone knows is that Electrify America is a wholly owned subsidiary of Volkswagen and its existence is punitive as a result of the Dieselgate settlement The Electrify America stations are awesome but also very costly to deploy 150kW charging needs really beefy transformers and electrical equipment to charge your car that fast On interstates 150kW and 350kW charging will be king But on the more local level in malls and supermarket and movie theater parking lots EVGO can install 50kW stations at a fraction of the cost of what VW Group is installing 150kW EA stations at Electrify America is also a bit of a showcase of the technology and enables VW to sell more cars like the Porsche Taycan to compete with Tesla Their end game is more about interstates than about around town EV charging EA s pricing is also currently regulated as a result of the whole dieselgate fiasco whereas EVGO s pricing is not regulated and the charge station owner is free to mark up the electricity Final Point EVSEs are more like ATMs than Gas Stations I believe that the EVGO model will ultimately follow the ATM model An enterprising company will put one in every parking lot that makes sense until there is saturation At that point rent and rates can be negotiated between the business utility ATM owner Gas Stations are more standalone whereas the sell of EVSEs is putting them in places that make strategic sense where people are already driving and spending 45 120 minutes in one place In Summary buy and hold CLII Don t buy CHPT And if you haven t yet Try driving an electric car They re so much fun to drive as long as you can find a place to charge Thank you for reading Andy

off do not listen to anything I say I am literally retarded Not even my girlfriend s boyfriend likes me Seriously I wear a helmet In the painstakingly late hours of the night while contemplating my existence in the face of being down THOUSANDS on GME I had this retarded realization that could make us all rich I am 29 years old and have no professional investing experience but I was alive in 2008 In fact in 2008 I turned 16 and got my driver s license What do I remember about this year aside from using my Playstation PSP to jack off in order to avoid the parental locks on my family computer Getting my driver s license At this point in the story if you are still reading you are probably wondering if I am actually retarded yes and what this has to do with stonks Well the day I got my driver s license in April of 2008 the price per barrel of crude oil was over 110 Gas was outrageously expensive and even with my newfound freedom no teenager could afford to drive with 5 00 per gallon of gas While I was jacking off into Kleenex and storing them under my twin bed WTI was trading over 55 share The stock price today is currently around 4 10 During this time the CEO and Founder of W

walking to the bathroom Current Status of Oil Barrons and other financial media outlets reported Bank of America and other suits see oil spiking over 100 barrel and potentially staying there for an extended period of time Many suits think we could see 100 barrel as soon as late 2021 2022 We are back to the Obama Biden doctrine of canceling pipelines and offshore drilling Yes we are going to buy a shit ton more from the Saudi s but companies who currently have a massive presence in the Gulf of Mexico will be working overtime to keep up with demand while not having the ability to expand Now this is where it gets interesting Exxon Mobile and the Phillips66 types don t own every single rig or every plot of drillable land to mitigate loss when oil prices are low What they do is LEASE these oil rigs drill sites from companies like WTI who have a massive presence in the Gulf Obviously the stonk got fucked when Trump was in office because gas was cheaper than Trader Joe s white rice As we see demand increasing as the world opens and Biden keeps Biden ing large companies like Exxon have begun to increase their drilling expenditures and lease back these drill sites to keep up with demand which will push WTI to the moon And by the moon I mean conservatively to 2011 2014 levels by fall 2021 or early 2022 This means the stonk price will be upwards of 10 and as previously stated is now around 4 00 WE HAVE A MAJOR EARNINGS RELEASE ON AUGUST 4th WTI HAS ONLY BEAT EPS AND WILL CONTINUE WITH OIL PRICES THIS HIGH During the Q4 earnings release on March 4th the thing went from 3 30 to 4

confirming bullish bias,Greetings retards autists and apes Here to share my outlook and some very simple TA in way too many words that you don t know how to read which may have already been invalidated in after hours trading with the vanilla NFLX news This is a fictional account and not investment advice Preface Today is Wednesday July 14th 2021 As you can see GME has been selling off on very low volume and really accelerated today along with many other caca stocks that are starting to make their way back down to hell after a nice consolation bounce out of the May lows Many will break May lows and never recover FYI GME is special though as it is the Queen of caca stocks standing steadfast beside King TSLA who retired from greatness after the SPX add and has a date with 400 For both many would say they are not caca and have fundamental upside Maybe they do maybe they don t What we do know is GME low float high SI and is subject to gamma squeezes helped by short covering and that is what we are looking for come August to September as we watch for a pattern to repeat itself Where we are at Today just before close GME found a potential bottom at 165 with huge volume which is peculiarly right where we have several supports 7 The positive trendline running from the extremely bullish engulfing candle just after the earnings gap down in March to the beginning of the breakout in May heading into Q2 ER 2 The all time highs AVWAP which basically encapsulates the average of volume and price since the day GME sent Gabe home crying Like moving averages above is bullish and below it is bearish 4 Thicc volume shelves from 100 150 where most volume has traded since January indicating where traders have been interested in buying in the past and where those who sold at highs or missed the boat the first time may find value in entering 6 151 is a pivotal level related to some gamma greek mysticism As we saw after hours today price hit 151 01 and bounced for 9 pts Below 151 is certain death or possibly a 200 day MA test around 110 orange line Not just are we at these multiple areas of support we are in the midst of oversold territory with daily RSI at 33 its lowest reading since before most of you were born April 3 2020 2 80 close An aside What a long way GME has come to be knocking at the year to date RSI lows and closing at almost 168 OG GME bull u Uberkikz11 and the GMEdd team s bull case fair value target released on 1 20 21 Market weighing machine well at work Cheers Rod But wait There s more While GME is in oversold territory SPX and especially NQ FAGMAN are well overbought and starting to show weakness here at monthly OpEx We ve seen money flow to the safe haven of GME in times of hedging need Should the indexes pull back starting as soon as tomorrow Thursday 7 15 the money that was made dumping tech on retail at ATHs will find its way somewhere and in the past it has been GME and boomer value stocks All this being said today I would put us at or around 3 24 in the quarterly cycle Especially with the NFLX news knocking us down even lower into oversold territory with support at 151 our capitulation may be in Where we are going All these factors are indicating that should patterns repeat GME is ripe for a bounce in the near future and it could be a nice 40 60 pt ripper up to resistance levels at the 20 or 50 day MAs around 200 or one of the other two swing high AVWAPs above 207 235 At the very least from the after hours action we will open gapped down with gap to fill at 167 Could fill now could fill next week could fill never Now I don t think we are going to see a breakout with continuation until we get to mid August for another 4 week run up into earnings As you can see between Q1 Q2 ER we caught a 64 pt dragon dong oversold bounce out of the 3 24 capitulation candle and after that came two months of consolidation where GME was pinned in a relatively tight range in order to let IV die down cheapen OTM calls for large in scale buying and let shorts get comfy enough to catch them off guard GamePlan Immediate term Watch price action tomorrow AM for a rip out of open which dips may be bought or a sell at open to re test 151 followed by a reversal on increased volume if 151 holds and shit starts hitting the fan on NQ SPX If it doesn t reverse strongly but holds 151 look for basing to occur with more volume to come in possibly in the afternoon eventually bringing volatile movements to the upside The basing could take a while might not start getting interesting until Friday afternoon into close IF we don t get a strong reversal by end of this week but hold 151 look for a dip to moon or rip straight out of the gates on Monday Targets are the upper resistance levels 198 209 235 Don t be greedy IF we lose 151 let it die some more If you liked GME at 483 you ll love it in the low 100s Don t try to catch the falling knife you will get cut Earnings play Watch for price to consolidate for a few weeks after any bounce identify the consolidation range and look for entries at the low end of the range around August OpEx 8 20 Footnotes Positions 7 16 170c 180c 190c 7 23 190c Be realistic with OTM calls 800c will not print Obligatory rockets Disclaimer Headline risk is real and any bad or good news can send the stock in any direction fast All of this can go to shit and the stock can limit down to 0 in 5 minutes if it wants Expect 0 Risk only what you can afford to lose Don t let gains turn to reverse gains This is not investment advice GL HF https preview redd it byxbp4qkmab71 png width

made and lost 200 000 twice in the last year once on Gilead shares and a host of other random shit and once on Canoo shares and a host of other random shit I took my losses it was profit first then I obviously doubled tripled and quadrupled down on GILD because even if everyone on this planet dies it will still be worth somewhere in the 60 range As previously stated I am retarded So I did the exact same thing 6 months later with GOEV shares and warrants but this time I took some money out and bought a fast car margin keeps calling but I have since learned about options so I just don t pick up the phone and then replace my lost shares with options 1 month out If you ve been paying any attention these definitely almost always expire worthless because I have arthritis and can t actually open my diamond hands after closing them On the one hand my massive profits from shares has evaporated on the other hand GOEV is going to pay for my future houses in Hawaii Japan and New Zealand all soon to be underwater because I am obviously retarded so I m not fucking selling and here s why January The year started off with the merger completion and MPDV had just been launched February Top shelf hopium sourced from Hyundai Apple Canoo rumors Hyundai execs did some leaking and Apple got pissed Deal thrown in the garbage March Truck revealed and leaked by retail shareholders first bigly positive reception I obviously didn t take any profit after doubling down here Cut to earnings where Tony Tequila tells everyone he told Hyundai to go fuck off and the CFO responsible for the deal is shitcanned April New management team onboarded Tony Tequila takes the reins May Manufacturing news coming soon multiple CMs have been visited retail shareholders tracking flight records June Apple hires the ex CEO of Canoo who just left to help them with their car program The same ex CEO who was formerly Canoo s CTO and responsible for developing Canoo s licensable platform Apple also happened to mention they have no interest in developing their own car platform Investor day happens Oklahoma governor Big Tall Homie says he s giving Canoo 300million in incentives to build a factory there VDL Nedcar in Europe will also be the contract manufacturer making cars for the US market and elsewhere Europe China until Canoo finishes building their own factory Sedan prototype spotted by a preorder customer stopping by their California HQ Imminent public release July more on this at the bottom That is a short recap of the Canoo timeline to date now let me go deeper into why exactly I am bullish on Canoo The platform technology Canoo has developed the first true steer by wire driveable platform with integrated crash testing that is not only ADAS ready but also has a composite leaf spring suspension and more Steer by wire As we move towards the self driving future of tomorrow but for real when will tomorrow come My calls are wondering my margin callers are wondering and my future wife is wondering Ok ok let me restart mfers As society moves towards the self driving future of tomorrow Steer by wire technology will be a NECESSITY and not a luxury I ve seen the inside of a computer and its all wires in there and I m pretty sure electric cars are just computers on wheels and I m not the only retard who thinks so Tesla is also developing their own steer by wire platform This technology also allows for the steering wheel to be repositioned ANYWHERE inside the vehicle You can drive this platform sitting on top of the rear wheels if you want to My mailman is a chill dude but I feel bad for him This mfer is driving his grandpa s USPS truck with garbage AC in the 115 degree heat we have here and it s all because the steering wheel goes on the wrong side in those things Canoo s platform can solve that instantly Driveable platform Race cars Canoo is building them first then others will build their own I look forward to this future Battery module Incorporated into the platform batteries used can be easily upgraded as better batteries become available or new technology comes to fruition The ECUs and battery management systems which are developed in house are also housed nearby I ll let Canoo explain why this is the good shit Our leaf spring suspension system flat packs the springs and dampers below the height of the wheel for a low profile platform and more versatile cabin space Crash Testing 70 of a vehicle built on top of Canoo s platform is enclosed inside the platform The majority of the crash testing is incorporated into the platform design Canoo has developed and patented technology to improve passenger safety in the event of a side impact collision and incorporated that into the platform as well What this means for vehicle development is that the development cycle from design sketch to concept to prototype to production vehicle is significantly faster than ANY competitors Since last year alone they have shown off the Multipurpose Delivery Vehicle the Truck and the Lifestyle vehicle A driveable sedan prototype is currently at Canoo s california facility spotted recently and will be unveiled shortly 4 models shown off in the span of 1 year with more to come Canoo will have an entire lineup of electric cars on production lines before some legacy automakers have a few developed and ready to go using dated factories body styling and technology Recent Developments BMW MINI licensing Canoo platform rumors MINI unveiled the Urbanaut concept recently this is their vision of the future It has multiple similarities to Canoo s Lifestyle Vehicle the open concept the driver s seat that faces both ways and most importantly a Steer by wire system Although a swivel chair will never make it to production this was MINI s concept of what the drivers seat of the future will be something with seating on both sides and the ability to create an enclosed loft type space Canoo currently has a driver and front passenger seat with jump seats for use when not in motion as standard on the Adventure and Premium trim levels How is it possible to know that the MINI Urbanaut is using steer by wire The design concept has a feature that turns the front dash into a daybed of sorts the windshield also pops open Part of this transformation is the folding and tucking away of the steering wheel which would not be possible otherwise Lastly w r t the Urbanaut the wheelbase is the same as Canoo s LV Next up is a recent job posting on Canoo s breezy hr eDrive calibration manager eDrive is trademarked by BMW It is repeated multiple times over in the job listing including The position oversees design and release of each component and must have familiarity with current eDrive systems to maintain a level of competitiveness in target setting Tony Tequila s plane recently flew to Spartanburg SC closeby to BMW s largest production facility and the only one in the US It s just a matter of time before the first very large company licenses the Canoo platform but after that the floodgates will open The time to develop advantage is something no competitor will be able to compete with While competitors have all been making square shaped electric cars try to fit into circular holes Canoo has been steady stacking triangles through the triangle hole I might be retarded but the engineers they have clearly aren t Neither is management Tony Tequila took Solera to the moon He knows how to raise cash without doing share offerings One more thing No share offerings which may end up being a problem for the ortex estimated 40 of the FF currently shorted and very very little volume thanks to diamond handed conservative bull retails who bought during the SPAC days and post merger Tl dr My favorite holding period is forever

just bought more shares albeit Clearside is already my largest holding The reason for my suicidal confidence is simple but please stop reading if you are not interested in 10x 100x upside potential 10x 100x Clearside has demonstrated potential to prove superior to beat Eleya the world s largest drug for eye disease with estimated 10bn sales next year This news popped out in June 2021 and despite the recent run Clearside s market cap remains at nearly invisible level of 300m As a rule of thumb pharma biotech companies tend to trade at 3x 10x revenues It does not take a rocket scientist to make the math and argue that Clearside might have 30bn market cap one day just taking the lower end of the valuation range applying it to 10bn peak sales potential This still leaves a juicy 100x from where we are today But even taking a conservative approach a simple 10x still seems not far away Let s take a look at another biotech firm without any revenues Kodiak Bioscience In Q4 2019 Kodiak announced solid phase 1b data on roughly 100 patients gt 300 injections that appear promising Since then Kodiak s market cap hovers around 3 8bn I think that Clearside can generate comparable and even better data within the next two years which points to 10 20x upside potential from today s level Value drivers Note that Clearside is much more than a one trick pony There are two pillars for value generation 1 Drug delivery platform Clearside s patent protected SCS Microinjector injects drugs into the suprachoroidal space in the doctor s office as convenient as today s gold standard of intravitreal injections Clearside s technology is far superior for several reasons 6 11x higher efficacy on the same drug volume while offering lower side effects as the drug goes directly to the target region and not through healthy tissue lt also seems that the drug amount stays longer in the target zone which should yield longer duration of the therapy This is very important as no patient is keen to receive injections straight into the eye every month or every other month I estimate that the duration benefit stemming from the Clearside injector exceeds 5x Clearside has several partners Bausch amp Lomb Regenxbio Artic Bioscience Aura Biomedical that have very specific sublicenses and so far progressed very nicely with observations of annoying side effects 2 Proprietary drugs axitinib for wet AMD with excellent first human data Plus two preclinical projects with a lot of promise and close to initiation of human studies Clearside generated preclinical data showing the axitinib is the best in class compound In the first human study the data appeared superior to Eylea Patients on therapy had stable vision with Eylea BCVA 0 2 while vision improved BCVA 4 7 for the very same patients following the suprachoroidal administration of axitinib More data and real head to head comparison will be needed to justify a superiority claim to Eylea but this is tremendous efficacy at a very low dose There are no signs of any side effects so data for higher doses should look even more spectacular I expect this data readout before year end Next steps Based on a unique and broadly patented drug delivery platform Clearside has had a solid IPO five years ago but the first FDA filing did not get approval due to the lacking information from Clearside s contract manufacturer and yielded a partnering deal with Bausch A few weeks ago the FDA accepted the resubmission of Xipere for the treatment of inflammatory eye disease uveitis I expect approval in Sept Oct which should trigger a 19m milestone payment for Clearside I also expect important phase 2 data from Clearside s partners Regenxbio and Auro this year Both partners confirmed that drugs could be safely administered while dose level could be increased and additional centers started recruiting of more patients Clearside plans to provide more insights into its pre clinical program integrin inhibitor before year end It is open what will happen to a pre clinical compound from Biocryst that shows promising pre clinical data with Clearside s data of axitinib using a higher dose in the second cohort of patients This data have the potential to shoot the share one or even two levels higher In 2022 we should see data from several cohorts of own and partnered products that could lead to a paradigm change and ultimate proof that Clearside is in pole position for next generation drugs I also see Clearside s partner Regenxbio with promising data but the rest of the pack far behind If Clearside can show the ultimate proof of concept in man it will capture more and more industry interest M amp A target The pipelines of the big ophthalmology companies are not impressive the inventor of Eylea has nothing else but high dose Eleya in the pipeline Regeneron s partner Bayer lacks ophthalmology drugs in its pipeline while diabetes firms such as J amp J and Boehringer are starting to put more emphasis on eye diseases not surprising given the correlation with diabetes but their pipelines are still thin and very early After its spin off from Novartis the ophthalmology medtech company stated its interest to re enter the space of ophthalmology drugs in a meaningful way On the same time Acon s direct competitor Bausch continues with its dual drug medtech approach and should already be very familiar with the benefit of suprachoroidal injections give the Xipere license deal with Clearside for the US Big pharma companies such as Novartis and Abbvie just digested headwinds from drugs with inadequate side effects Roche is the only company with a full ophthalmology pipeline but benefits are only modest compared to current standard of care Conclusion 10x in two years realistic in my view

position on the COMEX even bigger than the one on gold It is a semi monetary metal so the banks fear it just like gold and silver It was briefly used as money in Russia in the 1820s and 30s In the east it is also considered a precious metal rather than an industrial one The majority about 80 percent of platinum is mined in one country South Africa For those who are not aware there is a chaotic situation in South Africa right now which is only continuing to get worse see ZeroHedge for live updates and some believe that South Africa may soon become a failed state Rick Rule has been consistently for years that any chaos in South Africa would quickly lead to soaring platinum prices Here is a recent interview where he says it The demand side for the platinum group elements is very much intact The supply side is what s curious Most of the PGEs in the world come from three countries South Africa not the model of stability Zimbabwe almost not a country And Russia which of the three is a paragon of stability But if you were to experience social and political disruption in any of those markets you would see markedly tightened PGE supplies and I would argue higher prices In the near term demand is very inelastic with regard to price And if you shut down production in any of the markets I described I expect you d see a price explosion I m not saying that South Africa Russia or Zimbabwe is going to blow up I m just saying that the production of this element is constrained to countries that are well let s just say it isn t Western Australia https youtu be xeIorlppdaI t 755 https youtu be xeIorlppdaI t 755 Here are some further thoughts from Rick Rule on the subject of platinum over the years as well as Doug Casey Rick Rule interview from March 2020 Platinum is viewed in the U S as an industrial material rather than a precious metal Were you a retail physical dealer in Japan or Korea or China you would be feeling substantial demand for platinum investment products but culturally that isn t the way that Americans respond Americans look at platinum as a component in catalytic conversion Platinum is on my shopping list I have a reasonable proxy in physical platinum in the Sprott Physical Platinum and Palladium Trust I should note parenthetically that at my age I m 67 it s simply easier for me to buy physical precious metals on the New York Stock Exchange through the Sprott products I don t discourage physical ownership in fact I encourage physical ownership But for me it s just easier to buy the stuff and sell the stuff online in an account and I like the tax advantages of the Sprott product Were I younger and more inclined to take physical delivery and store it in a safe deposit box I would likely be a platinum buyer now The reason for that is that the utility of platinum is so extraordinary The amount of platinum that it takes to deliver the air quality that we enjoy today relative to the cost of the vehicle that that platinum enables the sale of is incredible At today s platinum prices it takes about a 100 or 125 worth of platinum in catalytic converter to sell a 40 000 car Were the price of platinum to double it wouldn t impact the price of the vehicle whatsoever Also the disparity in price between platinum and palladium means that people are investing like crazy in fabrication technology that will allow us over time and by time I mean two to five years to begin to substitute platinum for palladium in many fabrication applications but particularly in gasoline powered internal combustion engines So I think that the price disparity between platinum and palladium will begin to close Palladium 2700 Platinum 1100 Rick Rule interview from January 2019 I think that supply chain disruptions in South Africa are in fact a probability rather than a possibility The industry has not made sufficient sustaining capital investments for 10 or 12 years The industry has been required politically sometimes with state assistance to keep uneconomic shafts open And you have a circumstance now where the lack of sustaining capital means that literally billions of dollars must be put in place to rehabilitate these old shafts so that they can continue to produce At the same time workers wages must increase These two circumstances are confronting an industry that loses more than a billion dollars a year The money has to come from somewhere and there is nowhere for it to come from The second circumstance that this discussion needs to include is the fact that although South Africa has abundant resources including human resources the government mismanagement has been so incredible For example while South Africa is an exporter of coal and uranium the domestic power supplier in South Africa Eskom can t pay its bills or meet demand for electricity The mining industry in South Africa is extremely power intensive But Eskom is run more politically So ironically the part of South Africa that pays its power bills which is the mining industry experiences rolling brownouts Eskom needs to invest more money money that it doesn t have in power generation and distribution This again augurs very dramatically for supply disruptions For example if there were an extended brownout it could cause the pumps for water evacuations in the deep shafts to go down for very short periods of time I m talking about a week or so That would cause material destruction to the ventilation and electrification of these deep shafts My suspicion is over two or three years that s a probability as opposed to a possibility too Doug Casey interview from 2019 On the supply side of platinum the three countries in the world that matter are South Africa Zimbabwe and Russia I believe that Russia is in better shape than most people allege it to be The primary platinum producer there I believe is in robust shape But the truth is that both Zimbabwe and South Africa in the two to five year timeframe are likely to disappoint That s especially true in South Africa where the cost pressures are unbelievable Because of the lack of property rights in South Africa the mining industry has been unwilling to substitute capital for labor In other words it has been unwilling to invest in sustaining capital or expansion capital in the platinum mines in South Africa The consequence of that is that probably 60 maybe more of platinum production in South Africa is unprofitable The industry needs to invest more but can t because it s losing money on every gram that is produced currently And the situation is only going to get worse Mining platinum is a labor intensive business You have partially politically inspired and partially reality inspired labor actions from the unions agitating for higher payment to workers The workers absolutely need to be paid more But the companies can t pay them more because there is no money There s no sustaining capital to continue employment and they re losing money on the unit of production business right now at current wage rates So it s going to be impossible for the companies to pay workers more This is literally the case where you re stuck between a rock and a hard place I think we are going to see some sort of reckoning within the next two years It s a very ugly situation in the near term with no way out If anybody is interested in buying premium free platinum there s a ETF called SPPP which seems to be a platinum Sprott equivalent of PHYS gold and PSLV silver However it seems to be both platinum and palladium not simply platinum If you re signed up to GoldMoney or BullionVault you can buy allocated premium free platinum purely on its own And of course platinum bullion with premiums is available in many places

care for them and nor will I include any chart related info in this post What is Purple and what do they make They make mattresses you can comfortably lay down and make long passionate love with your hand on According to the CEO Joe Megibow the tech molds and makes it so it responds to your movements and adapts so you always feel comfortable whether it is masturbating whilst in a spread eagle

you read these as well as doing your own research What else do you have to offer I ve already read these you bozo My conviction leads me to believe PRPL is coiled and ready to explode Here is why The

and over 92 of the float are owned by institutions Which tells me people who are paid to do research have come to the conclusion that this is a stock you want in your portfolio amp x200B https preview

basis That means right now based on the PRPL 10K and the institutional 13F filings there are only 6 million shares out there I should add that the 13F don t show what has happened in the last month

NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR that the low volume in the last several weeks support the 6 million shares statement As I mentioned above a worker tragically lost her life and if you are keen on value investing and or investing in companies that take steps to address employee safety then I believe PRPL is the company for you After the accident OSHA came and cleared the facility and what did PRPL do They did not immediately start up production again Even though according to the CEO everything they produce is sold they instead took even more time to ensure this tragedy does not occur again https kutv com news local 4 workplace safety issues reported this year at purple mattress facility where woman died https kutv com news local 4 workplace safety issues reported this year at purple mattress facility where woman died You might say but this will negatively effect earnings in August and you would be right But a wise person can make another argument instead and that would be that this means future accidents are mitigated and if the aforementioned statement by the CEO is true then we are going to see a well oiled machine from here on out If you listened to the June 28th investors conference then you would also recall how Megibow played coy when an investor asked if their are 3rd parties looking to partner with PRPL Joe smirked but didn t directly answer Any body language expert will tell you that his exchange with the investor was a sign of a person hiding something they really want to let out This is all conjecture of course but it helps with my conviction For the following statement I have no pictures In my experience watching PRPL I have noticed that anytime volume increases from the average the price starts to move up this I ve seen occur several times And this is why I say PRPL is coiled just waiting to bust If what I believe is true then I think with volume PRPL has the ability to skyrocket to 35 40 even 45 The options are dirt cheap super duper cheap but if I was a responsible person I would not buy em If I were a responsible person I would buy shares and wait a month or two But I am not a responsible person and I also have conviction That is why I have bought 55 8 20 40 dollar options with an average price of 44 currently trading at 13 lol If you have conviction then why don t you average down Well I might not be into TA astrology or even numerology but there s something I like about seeing numbers that just seem right 55 for 44 TLDR I have conviction baby Low float even lower free float Low market cap 1 8 billion Cheap options Analysts have 30 buy rating With volume equals rockets And as always don t just blindly invest DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AS WELL and remember no matter what you do in life DO IT WITH CONVICTION

Tennessee Virginia Florida Georgia North Carolina and South Carolina The 13 states are segmented into three regions West East and Southeast with the West currently their busiest area They have been building homes for over 25 years and while they have not and may never again reach their ridiculous valuation of 2006 during the housing industry peak I believe there is certainly a lot of potential

fool you though Beazer Homes performed well YoY compared to the competition as well Comparing the Competition Here is a quick growth comparison using the data above using one of the behemoths in the homebuilding sector Lennar Corp market cap 31B amp x200B https preview redd it vtmpra89deb71 jpg width 698 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s ceb8ea7c9f6ad0bae962ac7e277b632751f18940 A lot of positive data to digest here as Beazer Homes holds up well against Lennar especially in FCF where Beazer more than tripled to 101 2M and Lennar actually fell to 93 7M Keep in mind Beazer Homes has a current market cap of 537M vs Lennar with a market cap of 31B 56x larger with less FCF in Q2 2021 Some more metrics and ratios that I like to use to compare against Lennar TTM https preview redd it 2dvuolwbdeb71 jpg width 562 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 5f897b3f949ce7683408160de33db0b1b3dd582e So Beazer does very well in ROE FCFM but the other two metrics operating margin and debt to equity are admittedly pretty bad The operating margin looks a bit better when you compare Beazer Homes to the industry instead of just Lennar The industry average operating margin is 9 4 and the D E average ratio is 86 according to readyratios com That s better but not great which brings us to the company s weaknesses Beazer has an operating margin issue and a debt issue If they can effectively tackle these problems which I believe they can this company and more importantly their stock price has a very bright future The Stock I Like It BZH which is currently trading at 16 78 has a market cap of 525M The stock is up 55 on the year but is still 52 off its 52 week high of 26 12 There is a reason I said the stock is objectively cheap in my thesis and the comparison below will really tell the story img 4w277gredeb71 The stock is trading at huge discounts as compared to the sector Even the Price to book ratio is less than one meaning if you took the equity the company has and divided it by the number of shares then compared it to the current price you would see that the current price is actually less Seeing ratios like this tells an investor that the company is in a lot of trouble or the market is incredibly inefficient Yes markets are inefficient but not to this scale which means that investors believe there is something horribly wrong with this company and they re in for a lot of trouble Having studied their financials and read their filings I would disagree with the market on this one Debt is Beazer Home s most pressing issue which is why I included ratios utilizing EV Unlike earnings enterprise value takes a company s debt into consideration and even when comparing EV ratios the stock still looks cheap Outlook So what s going on with Beazer Homes USA Their comparative pricing metrics show they are heavily undervalued compared to the sector their financials are up big YoY and the CEO is giving positive statements about the future and raising EPS estimates Well the answer is twofold they have a lot of debt and their margins are poor The question then becomes will Beazer Homes be able to manage their debt and improve their margins If you thought so like me then now might be a good time to invest in this company They can manage their debt As of Q2 21 their total liabilities stand at 1 4B with 250M of that being a revolver draw similar to a LOC that they haven t accessed yet giving them a Debt to equity of 2 2 Compared to the industry average of 86 according to finviz obviously not good and certainly a cause for concern One positive is that only 218M of this debt is a current liability the rest is long term debt Beazer Homes is aware of their balance sheet and had they taken a passive approach to it I wouldn t be writing this article but they are not As a matter of fact the CEO set a target to reduce their debt to under 1B by FY 2022 and they are very much on track as we can see here https preview redd it uo50ikrhdeb71 jpg

42,okwq58,t2_axrbp7c9,1626367566,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/okwq58/the_truth_about_clov/,1,The Truth about CLOV, My beautiful smooth brained Apes I apologize for the length of this in advance You may want to have your wife s boyfriend translate it into some sort of cave drawing for you I want my Lambo and calf implants as much as the next ape but I recognize the hedgies are still steering the CLOV ship for now with the last of their borrowed shares What is CLOV s real current value It is nearly impossible to provide a solid valuation on a growth company and we keep hearing that CLOV is worth 9 or even 100 but Based on competitiors like ALHC and PRVA CLOV truly would be around 10 a share if they were apples to apples companies I used P S ratio for that analysis and compared their annual revenue growth as well as the projected growth from all three DCF info wasn t easily available And I did not use P E ratios since all three are not profitable However CLOV is more of a software company that acts like an insurance company so comparing the three is not quite fair CLOV hopes to scale up faster than their competitors since they market to the healthcare providers as well as the insured This different approach could be a big competitive advantage and is the reason for the hype behind CLOV I would not disagree much with a current valuation between 13 25 Honestly I am slightly biased But CLOV could outgrow this range quickly Either way I believe CLOV is currently undervalued at 8 9 level Market factors we have to realize Lots of recent SPACs and IPOs are returning to or below their initial offering prices Many companies took advantage of the roaring market to go public at ridiculous prices Yep I m looking at you Coinbase Investors are realizing that a P S ratio of 25 and a large net loss is not a safe investment Airbnb I believe this is causing downward pressure on lots of these growth speculative stocks At the same time We are seeing relatively safe stocks like AMZN and AAPL go up over these past few weeks for almost no fundamental reason Hedgies may keep playing their game longer than we thought Remember they individually have little to lose We can lose our savings and Altimas and if they lose they lose someone else s savings and someone else s fine Nissan automobiles CLOV hedgies have larger balls than we thought Big balls are totally overrated btw Huge potatoes just make the steak look smaller When GME and AMC took off every ape was in those two stonks Hedgies can attack harder now since we are divided among many different battlegrounds We are all over the board now WISH CLNE UWMC AMC GME SPCE AMD etc The good news is that CLOV is getting a lot of attention and this community is growing We also have a 3 5 billion market cap This is much easier for 37 5k CLOV apes and large institutions to work with Best Case Scenario 90 chance CLOV rockets like AMC or GME The setup is there apes We all know the SI information by now When this occurs I buy my Lambo I get myself a girlfriend and I start paying for my own Netflix account and cell phone bill Just kidding mom My wife inevitably continues to see her Hedgie boyfriend Hoyt but she starts thinking about me sometimes when they are in my bed My kids grow up to be disrespectful entitled jerks Worst Case Scenario 10 chance CLOV becomes CLNE Everyone here paperhands it and walks away with their tails between their legs CLOV continues along a downward trend and reaches 7 50 a share CLOV then stabilizes as Hedgies buy to cover for some amazing gains They get our green Lambos and take on even more of our wives as girlfriends CLOV hits 10 again by the end of the year before rocketing up to 40 in 2022 based solely on fundamentals and organic growth I continue to drive the Silver Altima and Hoyt still bangs my wife while I watch Bar Rescue re runs My kids grow up to be disrespectful entitled jerks That part was never going to change The Bright side Insurance and maintenance on lambos sucks anyway amp x200B In the meantime here are some ways to think about your CLOV investment so far Expensive initiation into this awesome fraternity Your current 42k unrealized loss has made you 37 5k Ape friends That s like a dollar a friend At least you didn t buy at 28 85 whoever did won t be sad when CLOV is at 169 You probably would have spent your CLOV money on something useless like Rent and that is being subsidized right now amp x200B TLDR You will get your tendies by holding but you may need to reschedule your Lambo delivery Best and worst case scenarios are still a better return for CLOV holders than investing in some boring REIT Repeat after me DIVIDENDS don t buy Lambos or cosmetic surgery amp x200B Disclaimer This is not financial advice a promotion for Nissan or even an endorsement to watch Bar Rescue My only real financial advice is to not have kids or a wife They depreciate more than CLOV has since June 8th I am long CLOV and short on brain cells amp x200B I love you all my silly little fellow CLOV tards See you on the moon

offer my condolences to the family of Ms Coester a Purple facility worker who tragically died in mid May Are TA akin to reading and believing in horoscopes In my opinion yes so that is why I don t care for them and nor will I include any chart related info in this post What is Purple and what do they make They make mattresses you can comfortably lay down and make long passionate love with your hand on According to the CEO Joe Megibow the tech molds and makes it so it responds to your movements and adapts so you always feel comfortable whether it is masturbating whilst in a spread eagle position or when sitting on the edge and watching your wifes boyfriend satisfy her The last part was not said by the CEO of Purple Joe Megibow Where is the well researched dd I came across the company

this company it is highly recommended you read these as well as doing your own research What else do you have to offer I ve already read these you bozo My conviction leads me to believe PRPL is coiled and ready to explode Here is why The analysts love it one in particular I respect is Brian Nagel Days before Nike shattered earnings and people were able to cash out 10 and 20 baggers Brian issued a 150 buy rating As of me typing this it sits at 160 Brian days after the June 28th drop caused by the guidance revision caused by the facility death issued a buy rating for PRPL with a 45 target amp

stock you want in your portfolio amp x200B https preview redd it vf1v3fye1fb71 png width 1125 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f98f93397ddd9505a29a9e07b4d4b52c85d5f22b amp x200B https preview redd

owned by institutions many if not most with a 32 cost basis That means right now based on the PRPL 10K and the institutional 13F filings there are only 6 million shares out there I should add that the 13F don t show what has happened in the last month and a half or so amp x200B PRPL 10K https preview redd it 0bgxf9ri1fb71 png width 909 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 048acab1b888af60001925fcf4bc52588c83a67e I believe to the best of my knowledge NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR that the low volume in the last several weeks support the 6 million shares statement As I mentioned above a worker tragically lost her life and if you are keen on value investing and or investing in companies that take steps to address employee safety then I believe PRPL is the company for you After the accident OSHA came and cleared the facility and what did PRPL do They did not immediately start up production again Even though according to the CEO everything they produce is sold they instead took even more time to ensure this tragedy does not occur again https kutv com news local 4 workplace safety issues reported this year at purple mattress facility where woman died https kutv com news local 4 workplace safety issues reported this year at purple mattress facility where woman died You might say but this will negatively effect earnings in August and you would be right But a wise person can make another argument instead and that would be that this means future accidents are mitigated and if the aforementioned statement by the CEO is true then we are going to see a well oiled machine from here on out If you listened to the June 28th investors conference then you would also recall how Megibow played coy when an investor asked if their are 3rd parties looking to partner with PRPL Joe smirked but didn t directly answer Any body language expert will tell you that his exchange with the investor was a sign of a person hiding something they really want to let out This is all conjecture of course but it helps with my conviction For the following statement I have no pictures In my experience watching PRPL I have noticed that anytime volume increases from the average the price starts to move up this I ve seen occur several times And this is why I say PRPL is coiled just waiting to bust If what I believe is true then I think with volume PRPL has the ability to skyrocket to 35 40 even 45 The options are dirt cheap super duper cheap but if I was a responsible person I would not buy em If I were a responsible person I would buy shares and wait a month or two But I am not a responsible person and I also have conviction That is why I have bought 55 8 20 40 dollar options with an average price of 44 currently trading at 13 lol If you have conviction then why don t you average down Well I might not be into TA astrology or even numerology but there s something I like about seeing numbers that just seem right 55 for 44 TLDR I have conviction baby Low float even lower free float Low market cap 1 8 billion Cheap options Analysts have 30 buy rating With volume equals rockets And as always don t just blindly invest DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AS WELL and remember no matter what you do in life DO IT WITH CONVICTION

context 3 All times are in PST West Coast of the U S My first trade of the day was a Put Debit Spread on WDAY Why do a PDS instead of straight Puts Because the day had just started and while I wanted to capitalize on the bearish price action in the stock I also did not know what SPY was planning to do or how WDAY would react to any changes in the market Besides it seems really fancy to start with an option spread WDAY CDS 230 225 6 46am for a 2 Debit Closed for 2 55 Credit 7 45am Profit of 55 per contract At this point 6 53am I added to ATOS a stock I was still holding At 6 53am I added more shares for 6 67 bring my average price on ATOS to 6 46 This turned out to be a brilliant move on my part as ATOS continued to drop Next up was AZN the vaccine that protects against everything except the dominant variant out right now apparently Stock was weak to the market but had what I thought to be support at 57 55 the SMA 50 I thought wrong as AZN blew right through that level later in the day Should have stuck with this one AZN Short 58 08 7 23am Closed at 57 88 7 52am Profit of 20 cents per share Managed to scratch my AAPL calls from yesterday at 7 32am Even though I could have taken profit on these calls at the open I am still happy that I got out at breakeven I was missing the cheap stocks and VERB caught my eye and once those cheap stocks catch my eye I am probably buying something and a lot of it This once is not a low float stock and actually has a decent daily chart on it So don t be lumping VERB in with all those other harlots VERB is better than that VERB Long 3 05 7 36am Closed at 3 14 8 03am Profit of 06 cents per share I broke my rule with RIDE and when you break your own rules in Day Trading you usually pay for it literally This was no exception RIDE has a terrible looking daily chart and as such I should not have taken the trade And then to make matters worse I averaged down repeatedly And now I have to live with myself as I sit here and think about what I ve done RIDE Long 9 02 7 58am 8 06am 8 58am 10 51am Closed at 8 84 Loss of 28 cents per share Now I am looking at red day due to all the bags I am holding not happy with myself over the RIDE trade and going into a dark place where all I wanted was to put on some Barry Manilow and eat chocolate pudding cups But did I No Because along came TSLA dropping through its SMA 100 like a spoon through the before mentioned pudding TSLA Short 653 52 Puts 8 04am Closed at 644 85 Profit of 4 15 per contract Out of my temporary funk and ready to make more money I notice that nobody wants toys

of a mood because my next trade might as well be called How can I give some of this back quickly AMKR pops on a takeover rumor but I did not wait to see if the green bar would hold Literally Day Trading 101 and I screwed it up Back to singing Mandy and chocolate pudding for me AMKR Long 23 44 8 39am Closed at 22 38 10 06am Loss of 1 06 Welcome to the first bag holder of the day section of this update Although I do not mind holding this bag RCL The stock is very bearish weak against SPY on the daily chart but for some reason found some late day strength I am staying with this trade until it turns green because it will RCL Short 73 23 10 04am Still holding Stock currently at 74 21 We are not done with the bag holders so here is another one UNH Once again I do not mind this one

of real things like commodities is soaring , With inflation beginning to rage because of massive money printing real things like commodities and precious metals become a serious consideration for investment to help keep up with real inflation and preserve your wealth Massive money printing has increased the supply of money but the supply of commodities has not increased and in many cases has decreased due to supply constraints caused by the pandemic and when you have an increased supply of money chasing the same amount or fewer commodities the obvious response from the market is for prices to rise which is exactly what has happened with many commodities experience significant price increases well above the Governments declared inflation rates The price of typical inflation indicators like gold and silver has been suppressed but it is a completely different matter to suppress the price of industrial commodities which tend to react more readily to real market supply and demand dynamics The King USD cycle is over While the USD is rising commodities are psychologically linked to it and are not free to rise to the natural price set by innate supply and demand But when that cycle is over the gravity headwind inverts and becomes a tailwind With the DXY at about 93 the USD has stopped being the foot on the neck of all metals Below is just one example of a metal that is coming to life and benefitting from the covid effect and all the money printing by Governments is beginning to flow into previously ignored sectors like metals which have been undervalued for years Motorists drive up prices for battery metal lead LONDON July 6 Reuters A jump in demand for traditional lead acid car batteries and lingering freight problems have created shortages that have been felt most acutely in the huge U S automotive sector and driven up lead prices globally While other battery metals such as lithium and cobalt have been in demand for electric vehicles replacement batteries for vehicles powered by internal combustion engines account for half of global demand in the 12 million tonne lead market The United States accounts for 13 of global lead demand but consumption has been boosted by the end of COVID 19 lockdowns as motorists seek replacements for lead acid batteries that have failed after long periods without use Prices were also boosted last week by rumours of a lead refinery declaring force majeure analysts and traders said though no such news subsequently emerged The rumours pushed up prices but so far there has been no substance behind it said Wood Mackenzie analyst Farid Ahmed Demand for replacement batteries in the U S has been white hot and also strong in Europe Benchmark lead hit its highest since July 2018 at 2 344 a tonne on June 30 Wood Mackenzie expects demand for lead for replacement car batteries to rise 5 9 from 2020 to 6 5 million tonnes this year back to pre pandemic levels Ahmed said This jump in demand coupled with transport delays has boosted U S lead premiums which are paid top of benchmark LME prices in the physical market to a record high of 375 a tonne Robust demand and resulting shortages have also triggered draws on stocks in warehouses registered with the London Metal Exchange LME the world s biggest exchange for visible lead stocks Those stocks are down more than 40 this year at 72 250 tonnes In the first four months of the year the global refined lead market was in a surplus of 19 000 tonnes compared with 30 000 tonnes in the same period last year data from the International Zinc and Lead Study Group showed Part of the reason behind shortages is tight concentrate supplies This can be seen in treatment charges paid by miners to process concentrate into refined metal dropping to their lowest since September 2019 at 50 a tonne this month according to an assessment by Asia Metals The following pdf has valuation by Rawson Lewis that details effect from increased lead prices on value https boabmetals com wp content uploads 2021 07 BML Market Missing Impact of Rising Lead Prices Rawson Lewis 210709 pdf https boabmetals com wp content uploads 2021 07 BML Market Missing Impact of

clean lead silver concentrate free from deleterious elements to offset the closure of a number of lead mines in China They will probably sell most of it to their JV partner Henang Yuguang Gold amp Lead Co Ltd the biggest lead and silver smelterer in China They will likely be paid upfront through offtake agreements for a large whack of it to help them progress to production Yuguang has reaffirmed their strong appetite for the Sorby Hills Lead Silver concentrate and potentially increasing their offtake participation above that which they are currently entitled by virtue of their 25 joint venture interest in the Project The Joint Venture partners have agreed to accelerate the finalisation of the Sorby Hills Development and Operations Agreement to facilitate engagement with
