then they reported Q1 2021 results summarized in bullet points below Revenue increased 17 4 from Q1 2020 Gross margin increased 22 4 from Q1 2020 Adjusted net income per diluted share increased 300 from Q1 2020 Adjusted EBITDA increased 46 7 from Q1 2020 There are good reasons to use Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA metrics here I m not going to fully explain them management has a good

predicted impact over the foreseeable future what more do you want than a company who is providing health care services to the US population Biden and the dems are the exact kind of government support you want for this kind of play Even pre Biden AVAH has been able to accelerate growth and capitalize on COVID 19 and the introduction of the CARES Act through 1 Provider Relief Funds 2 State Sponsored Relief Funds 3 Deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes 3 Temporary reimbursement rate increases from various state Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care Programs and 4 Medicare Advances P S Ratio of 1 45 Whats the knock on the company They have a bunch of debt Proceeds of the IPO were used to pay down a good chunk but they still have 1 2B of debt while only 67M cash on hand Why shouldn t you care Because their revenue guidance for 2021 is at least 1 745B They are trading at an insanely low P S ratio of 1 45 And as you can see above gross margin is increasing significantly Upgraded Credit Ratings If you want even more boomer support Moody s and S amp P upgraded their credit ratings after AVAH paid down some of that debt Insider Buying There have been only

are a lot of other metrics that are involved One of the main metrics is the share float if there are a lot of shares available prices are less volatile and less susceptible to a squeeze But look at the screenshot above again do you see the float There are only 1 48M in the float I thought this was wrong until I looked at the prospectus gt In connection with this offering our officers directors

professional or financial advice These are just my personal observations Some technical terminology Bullish share prices rising Bearish share prices falling 1 Exponential moving average EMA What is what in the chart of share prices Purple line is EMA over past 20 blocks EMA 20 this shows a tighter trend since it averages over a shorter amount of time Light blue line is EMA over past 50 blocks EMA 50 Green line is EMA over past 200 blocks EMA 200 this shows a more general trend since it averages over a longer amount of time Significance Purple EMA 20 above blue EMA 50 which is above green EMA 200 bullish stock crossing or bouncing off an EMA line in UPwards direction bullish stock crossing or bouncing off an EMA line in DOWNwards direction bearish EMA lines can be good references for support and resistance 2 Trading volume These are the vertical bars lined up below the stock chart taller bar higher trading volume this is good for generating momentum 3 Relative Strength Index RSI This is the middle graph consisting below the main chart consisting of a blue squiggly line It signifies price momentum Basically closer to the top bar stock is more overbought closer to the bottom bar stock is more oversold 4 Moving average convergence divergence MACD This is the bottom most graph consisting of green bars red bars and 2 interweaving lines of blue and orange This graph also signifies momentum The two interweaving lines show the relationship between two moving averages of a share price Basically orange line ABOVE the blue line bullish momentum orange line UNDER the blue line bearish momentum Now applying these concepts to the following stocks SENS Increased 29 3 in past 5 days Short Volume Ratio 27 image https i postimg cc 85Rs2Tz3 Screen Shot 2021 06 13 at 12 22 29 AM png 1 The EMA lines on chart are aligned in bullish order purple over blue over green 2 There is relatively very high trading volume 3 RSI is not above the top bar indicating oversold which is great given the dramatic rise over the past several days 4 In the MACD the orange line is above the blue line bullish I drew a horizontal line at around 4 2 This has been a point of resistance a couple times in the past few days but the broke above it Friday and seems to have converted it into a point of support This appears bullish CLF Increased 23 9 in past 5 days Short Volume Ratio 33

good for momentum 3 There is momentum on the RSI towards selling but it is not above the top bar indicating being way oversold 4 In the MACD the orange line is over the blue line bullish I drew a horizontal golden line around 24 5 which was previously a point of resistance where the stock was rejected twice On Friday it looks like the stock had bullish momentum back to that line and may be able to consolidate and convert that line from resistance to support Vinco ventures Increased 13 5 in past 5 days Short Volume Ratio 23 image https i postimg cc zvq354Lf Screen Shot 2021 06 13 at 12 23 18 AM png 1 The EMA lines on chart are aligned in bullish order purple over blue over green 2 There is relatively high trading volume 3 RSI is in the middle meaning not oversold which is good given the recent uptrend 4 In the MACD the orange line is right on the blue line I drew a horizontal golden line around 4 7 which has been a point of resistance x2 then support then resistance It appears the stock just broke above the line which is bullish CLNE Increased 4 0 in past 5 days Short Volume Ratio 24 image https i postimg cc pLS980S0 Screen Shot 2021 06 13 at 12 24 48 AM png 1 It looks like the stock and purple EMA line EMA 20 is crossing the green EMA line EMA 200 This suggests bearish movement 2 Trading volume is less than previously in the week seems to be about its normal amount before the hype started 3 RSI is closer to the lower bar suggesting it may be somewhat undersold 4 In the MACD the orange line and blue lines are overlapping no upward or downward I drew a horizontal line golden line around 11 1 which was initially a point of support and now appears to be a point of resistance This is not convincingly bullish CLOV Increased 58 8 in past 5 days Short Volume Ratio

has not crossed but does not suggest bullish movement 2 Trading volume is still relatively higher than normal 3 RSI is in the middle not oversold or undersold 4 In the MACD the orange line and blue lines are overlapping hard to interpret I drew a horizontal golden line around 16 This has been a line of support in the past few days but now seems to be a point of resistance since the stock is now below it This is not convincingly bullish TLRY Increased 4 27 in past 5 days Short Volume Ratio 29 image https i postimg cc FzGzKGcV Screen Shot 2021 06 13 at 12 25 17 AM png 1 The stock and purple EMA line 20 are descending towards the green EMA line EMA 200 This does not suggest bullish movement Hard to determine since it is not crossed 2 Trading volume on Friday about the same as earlier in the week 3 RSI is in the middle not oversold or undersold 4 In the MACD the orange line is slightly above the blue lines suggesting some upwards momentum It appears a critical point is around 19 8 defined by the green EMA 200 line This was previously support the previous day but has become a point of resistance on Friday If it can break past this upwards that could suggest upwards movement WKHS

blue lines suggesting some upwards momentum It looks like there is currently support right at the purple EMA 20 line around 15 4 I drew a horizontal golden line at 16 2 which has been a point of resistance If the stock can break above that that would indicate bullish momentum to me WEN Increased 5 09 in past 5 days Short Volume Ratio 14 image https i postimg cc TPWKcVMT Screen Shot 2021 06 13

point of resistance suggests bullish edited EMA exponential moving average and RSI directionality thanks folks Probably should have proofread better Another comment I know some don t think technicals apply to meme stocks However I think they do still apply to meme stocks and give a better understanding of the current momentum and short term trends I would not personally buy shares of a stock without considering its current momentum past performance and trends We all know to buy the dip but these analyses can better inform us on what level of a dip would be a good buy These analyses are how day traders decide their entry and exit points I think a lot of traders would agree that technicals certainly apply to meme stocks and they use these to profit from the volatility and trade volume of these stocks I agree that technical analysis is less applicable for the long term Again all stocks even the best stocks have their ups and downs Again these are all very very short term predictions Things can certainly change within a day Come Monday any of these can start to look more bullish or bearish One thing you can do for your own confirmation is look back over the last few weeks of one of these stocks and look at the EMAs RSI and MACD and see how it correlates with the way the stock moves Or you re welcome to look elsewhere on the internet because many people are doing technical analyses for these stocks There are plenty on youtube I m certainly not a professional trader but I like to be objective and I thought it would be nice to provide some objective data and analyses in this subreddit A big reason GME was successful in January was because of the objective data and analyses put into it I do love the hype and enthusiasm but at the end of the day we should be making informed decisions for our money that are based on objective reasons not just subjectively based on how many posts or comments mention a certain stock Obviously feel free to disregard if you think technical analyses are irrelevant And thanks for the corrections Best of luck to all

s ratios HUYA CLOV GOEV and much more ,Hello fellow apes I spent the last days trying to come up with a mixed analysis of the group of high short interest stocks while performing also a Graham NCAVPS For those that are not familiar with this ratio it was developed by the big daddy of investing the real OG Mr Benjamin Graham amp x200B Picture for reference https preview redd it 4p4os1fvx2571 png width 654 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0fa44f2e9e9658d59374908d65ce52977c249245 Now I know this is not r stocks so I won t bother you this too many complicated ratios and explanations So to keep it simple I decided to apply this famous ratio from Graham NCAVPS to the most shorted stocks right now As you can imagine none of them fall under what would be considered acceptable by Mr Graham but I wanted to see if there was any undervalued stock that actually was shorted for no reason Hedge funds yes the evil guys actually play sometimes a very important role in keeping the stock market in order and when they short a company this can be a good thing basically removing cancerous companies from the market The problem is that during the last year they got too greedy and decided to basically short every single thing in the market Well this is not ok Disclaimer The only companies that passed the test are those with a positive result therefore those companies that have Current Assets gt Total Liabilities Plus be aware that some companies might have very high current assets due to a fresh injection of cash which needs to be interpreted and compared with the cash flow statement and the rest of the financial report amp x200B Here below my assumptions and changes to the NCAVPS formula I decided to use total float instead of outstanding shares this factor might influence a lot the final results I decided to go this way cause total float represents the most liquid group of shares while the outstanding ones include also shares by insiders and so on which are more rigid and very often less liquid than the float itself This is an adaptation of Graham s ratio which requires dividing the results of Current Assets Total Liabilities by outstanding shares Many other formulas like working capital and so on could be used I personally like NCAVPS cause it has demonstrated that it gives very good results I will present today the top 5 and publish tomorrow the rest of the list if there is interest by the community CLOV is part of the list The results 1 HUYA The only company trading below its real value Technology Services This Chinese company is actually

Behind a play against the hedge funds there must be some fundamentals and reasons why we bet against them I believe that stocks that are close to their real value by NCAVPS standards do provide a great opportunity Moreover I did not acknowledge many other ratios and variables which are extremely important My whole point was to just provide a simple mix analysis using NCAVPS Regarding the EV stocks here above is important to mention and understand their current assets might be inflated by recent cash injected into the company For all the companies do your own DD As usual This is not financial advice just my interpretation do your own DD and so on amp x200B amp x200B TLDR I decided to apply this famous ratio from Graham NCAVPS to the most shorted stocks right now top 5 options do

footing in a solid corner of the pet market Petco has 1500 stores in the states Over 100 of those have veterinary hospitals in them and 85 of them have neighborhood pet spa amp outlet locations Petco is poised for explosive growth as they shift into the pet wellness section with higher margins and away from things like simply pet food Because as we know you cant give you re four legged friend a

cents per share compared with a loss of 31 2 million or 15 cents a share a year ago Total revenue grew by 27 to 1 41 billion from 1 11 billion a year ago also outpacing estimates of 1 27 billion Petco

billion and 5 58 billion up from a prior forecast of 5 25 billion to 5 35 billion Petco said its partnership with DoorDash to offer customers same day deliveries has allowed it to compete with online retailers like Chewy because Petco s cost to deliver from its stores is lower than the cost to ship Do these look like the financials of a stock that has been trending downwards Do these look like the financials of a stock that should have 100 SI HELL NO They are shorting a high growth profitable company who by the way are actively investing money into the health and wellness of our pets They are

which also owns CHWY As WOOF has secured a market share have loyal clients and came out positive during a pandemic the likelihood of a systematic collapse is improbable Petco s growth is commendable but it may not have enough revenue to close out 2021 with positive cash flow It may encounter a roadblock in expanding the market for luxury pet food especially in the Midwest region which can provide an edge up for PetSmart to take a bigger foothold However the exponential growth of metropolitan areas and the preference densely packed locations have for Petco may provide enough buffer for Petco to dominate They will need to adjust to higher margin practices fast and become successful with them which they are in the process of doing amp x200B Charity work WOOF has done The Petco Foundation has contributed over 280M since 1999 to help animals Petco features a partnership with JustFoodForDogs bringing forward a luxury human grade meals market that has fought through COVID 19 impact They have

now projecting net profit instead of net loss EDIT NOTE Hello everyone it s me again Ragnaros My last DCF got a ton of feedback and I wanted to incorporate most of it in my next one So here is my DCF 2 0 an improved version of my last DCF Before I start posting my pictures of my DCF I want to explain a few things First of all I want to clear out that with lack of financial data and given it s a growth company at its early stages it was hard to do any kind of DCF therefore there were many educated and conservative assumptions made This time I performed 3 different DCFs for three difference scenarios i e Bear Base and Bull scenarios For simplicity the probability of each happening was assigned 25 50 25 respectively Moreover for each case above I have also done a sensitivity analysis based of different weighted average cost of capital WACC terminal value and also expected future dilution of shares More details on the sensitivities later Note I feel like I ve been somewhat conservative with my assumptions compared to what another analysts websites have been projecting for BNGO Oh and also Nanonozzle revenue hasn t been projected in this DCF Adding that would only affect the share price positively So here we go BASE https preview redd it is69p6rmz4571 png width 2814 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e713fdcbe55f15eb64559513a23200ec235bf4ad BULL amp x200B https

hope these all pieces are enough to support my claim Next up how am I differentiating between Bear Base Bull scenarios Well basically the differentiating factor in all cases is the re occuring revenue As per the CEO in Q4 2020 earnings transcript picture below he expects every Saphyr to produce 60K 150K every year I also believe he is not including Saphyr 2 0 revenues in it Well then it was easy for me to assign approx 80K in Bear case 110k to Base case and 140k to Bull case Hence my row in DCF called Re Occuring Revenue per Saphyr amp x200B https preview redd it 79j1kxr774571 png width 936

Sold COGS or the Gross Margin assumption is set to be more realistic I have increased it about 2 5 CAGR Only in Bull case I think they would increase it by 3 5 CAGR Operating expenses will be the biggest cost to Bionano for the next few years as they will be spending a lot for exponential growth And also as per the CFO he said to expect about 20 40 OPEX for the next couple of years amp x200B

we hit the 10k Saphyrs installed not sold mark you can see the Consumables Revenue is about 1 8B and total revenue collected from Saphyrs sold 2021 2030 is about 1 2B This all adds up to about 3B revenue which about right in between in what the CEO thinks hence my base case In my last DCF I also didn t include taxes Although taxes are 23 in the state of California not every company pays that amount They report expenses to get tax credits and as per my research they pay around 16 20 taxes For my DCF I have assumed 19 taxes in all scenarios Another thing I want to point out is if you read the analysis of the analyst in the SeekingAlpha link above he used a tax rate of 16 Overall taxes don t have a significant impact of DCF amp x200B Now to the juicy part the SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 1 WACC I chose WACC between 10 17 is to incorporate all cases that includes industry average future inflation fears that is going on Bionano s cost of equity or debt increases etc etc 2 Terminal Value Well this one has a significant impact on BNGO s current price target because this assumption takes care of forever growth of BNGO I do believe that even after 2030 the company will grow at a higher rate till 2050 2060 However for this study I chose 2 4 because 2 is to keep up with average inflation rate and 4 is because average GDP growth rate is 3 4 Therefore it made sense to make a range out of it amp x200B https preview redd it m73asty974571 png width 936 amp format png amp auto webp amp s aa0ae925722265531ebf86c079adf28a8ba951f4 I have done a sensitivity analysis for all dilution cases i e 1 No dilution This means the company will not dilute its share for the next 10 years or even more than that I think this case is highly likely because company has enough cash to last for the next several years I know they have already opened a contract for more offerings up to 350M but I don t think they will be doing it anytime soon So I guess that will be done when price is 10 or even 20 As a result about 17M 30M extra shares will be added to current outstanding which will not have a significant impact in share price amp x200B https preview redd it 2dja53ya74571 png width 936 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 11320269f0cc7581688806c993a09530b1bbf51b 2 25 dilution This means the in the next several years company will dilute 25 of its current outstanding shares i e 279M 1 25 349M new outstanding shares This means that about extra 80M shares will be added This will equal to about 800M 1 5B assuming offering at share price 10 20 worth of offering I believe this is unlikely because Bionano will most likely be net profit positive by 2024 and will be self sufficient The only case why I think BNGO will do this kind of offering is to acquire some other small business for growth purposes Other than that I don t see them doing such a big offering amp x200B https preview redd it qila36lb74571 png width 936 amp format png amp auto webp amp s d7c75fcc4f87f082d7ed7e2627d6c9ac44097336 3 50 dilution Similar to the point above this would translate to an addition of about 130M shares which equals to about 1 3B 2B assuming offering at share price 10 20 worth of offering This scenario is very unlikely to happen amp x200B https preview redd it xbftkwec74571 png width 936 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

price comes to 14 With 50 dilution my average price comes to 12 This is all assuming that chances of all WACC and TV are equally likely to happen With three different prices and assuming 40 40 20 for all dilution cases I finally come to a conclusion of a current price target of 15 Obviously I m not saying price should be exactly 15 but somewhere in the ballpark I would say anything below 10 is a steal and a buy and current price should be anywhere between 12 16 Furthermore to support my price target here are the analysts ratings from tip ranks below My price target is close to their 12 month s price target amp x200B I m no financial advisor or a financial analyst This is only for educational and entertainment purposes At this moment I m currently YOLO long position on BNGO stock amp x200B
