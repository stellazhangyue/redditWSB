67,obawi4,t2_9q2oo,1625101544,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obawi4/forget_the_trade_desk_buy_pubmatic/,1,Forget The Trade Desk Buy PubMatic,PubMatic is a small cap growth stock in the quite quickly growing adtech space which may be facing further tailwinds from the reopening and trends such as CTV Its valuation is lower than others in this space such as market darling The Trade Desk while also growing faster Large growth prospects and a reasonable valuation combined with a low absolute market cap provide a recipe for a successful investment Buy potential multi baggers while they re small Investment Thesis One of the core tenets of growth investing is a company s relatively small market cap in light of a potentially large long term opportunity A small company with a differentiated technology or product in a large market could deliver supercharged returns if it keeps growing This may exactly be the case with PubMatic PUBM The company operates an adtech platform has a reasonable valuation is growing fast and has the relatively small market cap that growth investors would look for I would contrast this stock with The Trade Desk TTD While they re not exactly competitors both operate in the adtech space However The Trade Desk has the opposite characteristics while the company also reports respectable growth it already has a much larger market cap and a high P S valuation Put differently though the investment thesis is that potentially PubMatic could replicate on the sell side of this market what The Trade Desk has accomplished both as a business and as double digit bagger on the stock market on the buy side Company overview As indicated PubMatic operates in the adtech space The company provides a sell side cloud infrastructure platform purpose built for digital real time programmatic advertising As such the company should benefit from general ad spend growth as well as some of the higher growth areas in this space such as programmatic CTV connected TV PubMatic also expects some acceleration tailwinds from the reopening In succinct terms PubMatic has created a sell side ad tech platform that leverages data driven algorithms and tools to help content publishers and app developers maximize the value of their ad inventory The reasoning behind such an infrastructure driven approach is that advertising is inherently data intensive and also real time Hence PubMatic can deliver increased value such as higher revenue for publishers and higher ROI for buyers and also innovate faster by controlling the full stack from hardware to software This also results in a cost advantage The alternative approach is using public cloud infrastructure which only allows for controlling the software stack PubMatic also claims it benefits from consolidation of ad budgets on fewer sell side platforms resulting in increased market share This occurs through Supply Path Optimizations or SPOs As evidence for this trend PubMatic disclosed that revenue from those arrangements nearly doubled in Q1 Lastly to come back to the term sell side This can be contrasted to The Trade Desk which is a demand side or buy side platform In simple terms the buy side are those who buy advertising inventory while the sell side are those who offer ad space anywhere on the internet As such the thesis really is that PubMatic may become both as company and as a stock on the sell side what The Trade Desk has become on the buy side Q1 results In Q1 PubMatic reported 43 6M revenue up 54 YoY In particular mobile and omnichannel video grew 83 and represented 63 of total revenue CTV grew 55 QoQ Gross margin also increased from 65 to 72 due to increased utilization This signals a scalable business PubMatic s accelerated growth over the last year is also evidenced by its increased TTM net retention which has expanded from 112 to 130 which is best in class for growth companies in general Guidance PubMatic has guided for 33 growth for the year While this implies a slowdown some part of it does seem like sandbagging or conservative guidance as discussed the net retention was 130 in Q1 and growth in mobile and video also grew markedly faster than the overall business Valuation PubMatic s valuation should be considered compelling At the stock s current 40 price the forward P S stands at 10x which is over 3x cheaper than The Trade Desk Obviously the bullish case would be that given that both operate in the same market PubMatic could deliver similar growth as the former which would result in both long term stock and valuation expansion Although PubMatic certainly does not yet have same multi year track record of elevated revenue growth yet as The Trade Desk this stark difference in valuation arguably well offsets potential execution risks At least in Q1 PubMatic was growing faster than The Trade Desk Risks PubMatic s growth has accelerated since COVID 19 and the company also expects continued tailwinds from the reopening which should result in increased ad spend However a risk would be if growth would slow down to pre pandemic levels obviously the best growth stocks including The Trade Desk are able to sustain elevated growth for years Another potential risk are some of the recent and ongoing changes in the ad space including changes in Apple s AAPL policy and the phasing out of third party cookies However PubMatic reports that the majority of its revenue comes from different identifiers than those two As such PubMatic actually views this is a competitive advantage similar to how The Trade Desk has been boasting about how the Open Internet will prevail over the walled gardens PubMatic is in fact investing in a portfolio of alternative solutions to the third party cookie including The Trade Desk s UID 2 0 as well as Google s GOOG GOOGL Privacy Sandbox which includes the contested FloC Note that The Trade Desk and PubMatic are not really competitors but rather partners as The Trade Desk is a demand side platform PubMatic says it is integrated with around 100 such platforms A last risk I found was that although PubMatic especially touts its infrastructure the company nevertheless seems to get more mixed reviews i e a lower rating than TTD This could imply it still has some way to go to truly become best in class Primer on ads and cookies This section serves for those who aren t all too up to date on some of the terms used here As I would describe it the core issues stem from privacy concerns regarding third party cookies and tracking This is leading to the phasing out of those cookies now planned for 2023 by Chrome However this causes issues for the digital advertising market which relies on targeted ads to increase their efficiency As such alternative supposedly more privacy friendly tracking solutions are being introduced One of the most well known is The Trade Desk s UID 2 0 Google for its part is backing on a collection of a few dozen of APIs which it calls Privacy Sandbox One of those is the controversial FloC even though it does more or less achieve its goal to provide privacy without sacrificing targeting accuracy Another point of dichotomy is regarding what some like to call the Open Internet vs the walled gardens The latter are the big ad platforms such as Google Facebook FB and Amazon AMZN The gist is that those walled gardens have a privileged position given that they have an enormous amount of first party data Hence they could survive the phasing out of third party cookies quite unscathed Some claim for example that it is in Google s interest to phase out those cookies which could put Google at a competitive advantage as others would lose the ability to serve targeted ads However one might note that this dichotomy isn t all that clear For example both Roku ROKU and Unity U and likely plenty others certainly wouldn t be considered walled gardens among the likes of Google and Facebook Nevertheless both companies have said that given their own first party data they deem themselves to be quite unaffected by those changes in the ad landscape Lastly given the observation that there are so many alternative tracking solutions being developed which may or may not conserve privacy ultimately there may be relatively little tangible changes in the ad landscape As such the bottom line may be that the recent rally by the likes of The Trade Desk due to Google s Privacy Sandbox delay is overblown Investor Takeaway PubMatic offers a compelling proposition both with its full stack technology as well as with accelerated business results In general the company operates in the growing digital advertising market and by being at the forefront with its technology and innovation seems to be well positioned for market share growth as well The company has reported high growth expanded margins and a high 130 net retention in Q1 PubMatic is also capitalizing on the latest trends such as CTV which grew 55 sequentially While no stocks are risk free these are definitely signs that the company is able to capitalize on the growth opportunity in its adtech space Just as importantly compared to other growth stocks I have covered both the company s market cap and P S valuation are rather low for growth stocks That implies the risk is reduced while the potential upside could be significant Hence bottom line is that PubMatic does not even have to exactly replicate The Trade Desk s performance to deliver solid or even significant long term investor returns As I said about another small company a while ago Sumo Logic SUMO buy potential multi baggers while they re small and cheap

month for a bullish position Date Open High Low Close Adj Close Volume Jun 01 2021 11 23 20 17 10 52 12 24 12 24 2 129 362 800 Jun 01 2020 4 64 5 84 4 59 4 89 4 89 142 716 000 Jun 01 2019 7 83 9 09 7 10 7 46 7 46 139 959 300 Let s assume you bought on the adjusted close in the following scenarios We will use 2020 as base year as it s the mid point between 2019 and 2021 One year prior in 2019 it was trading about 52 higher One year later it was trading 250 higher If you looked at 2020 as the bottom and held for a year then your assumption is it would improve back towards 2019 highs In reality it was about 5x times higher than your long thesis of a mere 50 gain To say the least that is a great return on investment I think the price point technicals are showing the true trajectory of BB If you used 2019 as your base year you lost 34 5 if you sold one year later in 2020 If you waited two years from 2019 then your return is 64 after 2 years If you just bought the average close and completely miss the high sale and hold then you will get your money back in a year The most important difference is look at the volume It is now about 14 92 higher than in 2020 It is 15 2 higher than in 2019 Who is buying Longs and shorts Are the shorts that much smarter than the longs Perhaps but probably not If you look at the short interest it is not remarkably higher Either short are covering a lot more in the day or some big entity like Canaccord Genuity https www canaccordgenuity com is shorting on the dark pool Why Because the majority of investors are not short oriented The majority buy and hold and usually sell when they hit a certain paper loss and thus sell creating actual loss FOMO or overbuying on leverage gets them into buying above a reasonable entry and they aren t willing or able to hold until they get a reasonable return Many traders thus cut on the first pass near their entry for a small gain or loss Buying the dip works if your stock has a reasonable chance of going above your entry Think of the folks that bought the highs of AMC in the upper 20s Some averaged down and some just held till it hit the 30s Blackberry is rapidly approaching a critical junction When it rips again then it will likely go well past this years all time highs Why Because the volume is picking up and more and more traders are seeing the incredible success with both GME and AMC Institutions are buying and yes they are selling at highs and buying lower down and will repeat the process They are buying the short position and the paper hand position The minute Blackberry hits anywhere above 28 and likely a minimum of 30 and holds then the story will instantly become the story of how Blackberry really was a great turn around Some monetization event will occur patent sale goes through and is disclosed or Blackberry monetizes part of its new revenue streams It will then head towards 75 and 100 Why Because the big time longs will be ready to make their real profits and start a new acquisition phase They will most certainly sell higher as shorts cover new longs enter in that buy in the new highs on the new momentum and the process repeats till it hits its final higher highs How much could Blackberry make it too Not going to lie I d love to see a GME scenario If it 420 69 and I m holding my current share size then I d have BB tattoo d with the price target and I m afraid of needles Possible Sure Likely who knows It can and will eventually hit again the 140s Why former high and yes professional traders and day traders love to buy and hold on the way to established levels If the GME scenario actually happened it would probably eventually base out in the mid 100s before getting back to the 200s Absurd you say At about twelve bucks if it went up 250 then that is 360 The big whales and institutions will make the same amount by percentage As more retail buyers show up then those are more sales for the big guys I m not BB to 1000 I m still kicking myself for letting NVDA go at 400 though Meh it s only money I ve been moderately well to do in my life and poor as dirt I m blessed and really think BB is going to make some long sided traders a lot of money I hope to be one of them Buy the dip buy the rip buy and hodl buy and yodel don t buy don t care Most of all do what works for you I m not an advocate for pump and dump I am an advocate for investing in stocks you like I am investing and taking profits along the way I like the underdogs Been one most of my life Heck I root for the Eagles and Panthers how much more underdog can you get than that Both though made it to the Super Bowl and won I think 100 bucks a share is an actual reasonable target for BB be it in 2021 2022 or 2023 The same people that said that was a pipe dream are the same ones that said it would never hit 28 or 20 this year They were wrong Time will tell if they are wrong again There is power in retail investors willing to buy and hold So are you saying yolo everything tomorrow on the open No I m not a financial advisor Check my profile I m just an ape investor I trade for a living and do IT I hopefully will start a doctorate in the fall in theology In other words don t bet your life savings on a YOLO play unless you know what you are doing I didn t yolo it I did invest a load of investment money on BB and other stocks I ve made money I ve lost money It happens Let me translate to ape Buy blackberries which are a yummy fruit that is not a banana HODL and sell and buy a lot of banana In other words if you don t paper hand then you make a ton

I have been losing lots of money on options since entering into the stock market and hearing about Ryan C s move on a particular well liked stock in December I got jacked titties hearing about everyone making money here on r wallstreetbets and I was like fuck if a bunch of retards on reddit can make millions hell so can I annnnnnnd I ve lost EVERY single option trade I have entered I ve made a few 10 returns on only stock trades but the returns from those trades were tossed back into FD and bi weekly s that all expired worthless YTD on my options trading throwing shit at the wall I have a verifiable 100 loss rate pretty sick huh https preview redd it eghxc915uj871 png width 4256 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5c2fd55c39f401506b19d0f15f5e4450f57ecc6d so after losing another K this last week a lot of money for me I am done losing fucking done amp x200B how you might ask using an option strategy of course called a gut spread strangle for those that don t know a gut spread strangle is where you buy an ITM call and an ITM put with identical expiration dates how a strangle can profit is typically one of two possible ways the stock rises in price enough to cover the call and put premiums aka money back or vice versa price falls enough to get all money back so essentially you are sacrificing one contract for the other by the stock either rising high enough OR falling low enough in price I can now slaughter which ever sacrificial option that gives me my money back now I have covered my initial investment and I still have one near worthless option left over the second step of this strategy that I will be personally attempting for you bow all is once the sacrificial option returns my initial investment I will then repeat the process by entering another gut spread strangle at current price ideally during a low volatility day to reduce the premium cost of the options during the second step of this strategy I now have an ITM call ITM put and an OTM option that should be nearly worthless and the reason for holding onto this OTM option is just in case the price moves back in the other direction I will then have a DEEP ITM option and the option that should be apart of my initial investment that should be worth a little somethin somethin the only way this strategy doesn t work is if there is no volatility or price movement to close either option before the options expiration dates now if this strategy doesn t work that would be pretty bizarre due to two reasons 1 if you place the contracts expiration dates out far enough months 2 use this strategy on any stock seen in Hot Top posts so what is negative divergence and what does this have to do with CLF amp x200B obv is on balance volume the numbers don t really mean shit but typically the obv and price action should follow similar trends this is fidelity s explanation on negative divergence with the OBV Negative divergence is when Price reaches higher peaks and OBV fails to make higher peaks https preview redd it opnvtijdsj871 png width 2718 amp format png amp auto webp amp s c6ff4538511324965cc86e2a72f0e9b85310a7a2 there you have the definition now onto why this relates to CLF take a look at the daily price action of Cleveland Cliffs from March 21 Today 2019 up till 2021 CLF s price had a strong correlation to the OBV pretty much doing the exact same trends amp x200B CLF price action trending up CLF obv trending down https preview redd it 3eqv4lrqtj871 png width 1398 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 6aebfd55c48a35053b9a9de5006251d1ad0c3d2b the green arrow price is clearly moving upwards month after month since March the red arrow obv is clearly moving downwards since March April if you look at the years before 2021 you see a strong correlation between the price and obv trends so why am I bullish on a stock that has a negative divergence well because it imposes further volatility of the price the price is BOUND to do something I don t know if it will continue the divergence with the price continuing to rise or whether it will fall in the following weeks due to obv dropping doesn t matter to me honestly the following are my main reasons for choosing this stock and this stock alone for this option strategy I think the steel industry is strong I heard talks about Biden with an infrastructure deal idkwtf that means other than construction money handouts the company has 17B in assets w an 80 debt to asset ratio company undervalued at 10B earnings date July 21 so yea price can go up and I ll be happy so yea price can go down and I ll be happy so yea if price doesn t move at all before exp date I swear to god I will tattoo FUCK MY LIFE onto myself amp x200B tl dr I m gonna make money in either direction or will tattoo myself out of embarrassment amp x200B k now fuck off amp x200B let me know if I have to vErIfIcAtIoN of my strangle trade on CLF

However the fact that Microsoft has partnered with Paysafe gives the copmany potential to grow along with the growth of the MS store and Xbox sales An additional potential boost will be the fact that the MS store will come by default and expanded in the new Windows 11 The downside is that Microsoft has the pricing power to dictate terms and Paysafe might need to settle for lower margins Debt Considering financial health and the company s direction one of the reasons Paysafe sought to go public was to raise enough capital from shareholders in order to pay out some of its outstanding debt Management has committed to and is following through with this goal The company has paid out close to US 1 4 b from its total US 3 5 b debt On the surface this looks like a stabilizing move but it may have some implications 1 Management made a possibly bad decision when leveraging a young growth company in the past 2 If the company had to be flipped private to public again by a third party that raises questions as to why wasn t the company able to outgrow the debt problem in the first place 1 Did they have bad management a wrong capital structure did they overestimate their growth capacity or were they early with their innovation and misjudged market demand The answers to these questions are crucial in shaping the way investors see this company If it was a management error then that is fixable with supervision transparency and governance In case they had the wrong capital structure then flipping the company by Blackstone NYSE BX https simplywall st stocks us diversified financials nyse bx blackstone group was the perfect move to get future returns If they overestimated their growth capacity things get dangerous because this means the company may not be able to enter a high growth phase and deliver more profits than the current or lower valuation Finally if they were early on their innovation they now have a second chance with a more mature market and fresh capital Check the operating expenses in the future for Paysafe Since this is a software company an increase in OpEx should be multiplicative for growth down the line this does not materialize immediately Also keep an eye on R amp D and SG amp A expenses Marketing and research amp development should drive multiplicative but not linear growth otherwise they are just spending money on cheap customer acquisition

some apes saw as a quick hype play It was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week after months of daily short attacks For months we saw all the tell tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow short volume massive block trades and 13F s showing institutions steadily loading up In this context just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders That s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn t matter because my plan is to hold PSFE long term There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor before all the rosy ER s come in With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and despite recent reports has similar growth to PayPal it s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de risked from a long term perspective The comprehensive DD below is for the diamond handed apes who may have been caught in the recent hype Know that you re not alone We saw the same thing right after CNBC s Jim Cramer called Paysafe the ultimate stock for this moment and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to 45 50 and then settle in before moving higher from there After initial spikes deep pocketed short sellers methodically crushed retail holders eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week But informed short sellers knew they couldn t push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb Third Point 41 5 million shares David Tepper Appaloosa Management 10 million shares Aaron Cohen Survetta Capital 13 million shares Dipanjan Deb Francisco Partners 20 million shares and Leon Cooperman personally owns 1 1 million shares A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo s several funds 12 million shares and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares 1 Also it s worth noting that since they all decided to invest Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase ESL Gaming Luckbox and Microsoft among others 2 With a presence in 120 countries Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor 1 global leader in iGaming 2 global digital wallet 4 globally in integrated merchant processing Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private they ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk increase margins and profits It s because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity Here are a few key points amp x200B In 2017 private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for 3 9 billion 3 Blackstone says their typical investment term is upwards of 7 10 years 4 which aligns with the investment time frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said There is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services away from the cash and cheques of our parents age adding that the private equity firms have a decade long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now 5 Under Blackstone CVC s stewardship Paysafe grew revenue 65 from 864 million to 1 418 billion 28 CAGR pre Covid Last year due to Covid related brick and mortar business and sporting event closures along with their long standing strategic decision to exit specific high risk Asian revenue channels 2020 revenue stagnated This is the reason they recently reported only 5 YoY quarterly growth In their Q1 ER management noted that without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the mid to high teens But even if you include 2020 s stagnant growth their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18 CAGR This is roughly the same as PayPal s current projected growth 6 7 A few months ago Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley Chairman of Fidelity The deal paid down 1 2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone CVC about 5 6 billion in cash and shares 8 The fact that Blackstone s recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares combined with statements from them and Paysafe s board indicates that they did this deal not for a mere 44 gain on a four year investment but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth Inorganic growth through M amp A is a major pillar of Paysafe s strategy going forward Bill Foley now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder is a proven M amp A synergy wizard particularly in the financial services arena Foley took Fidelity National Financial from 3 million market cap to 10 8 billion Yeah that s and m and a b Over just the last five years Foley grew Ceridian 3 3X 4 2B to 14B Dun amp Bradstreet 5 6X 2B to 11 3B and Black Knight 8 7X 1 6B to 14B Through his proven M amp A playbook Foley also grew FIS from 2 5 billion to over 91 billion market cap That s a 36x return He says Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe 6 9 Deleveraging increasing margins and profit Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of 1 53 billion in revenue 930 970 million in gross profit double digit growth and expanding 30 35 EBITDA margins and 103 billion in transactional volume Paysafe s already strong 362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29 growth in 2021 Notably their multi year projections don t include growth from their active M amp A pipeline and their ongoing US iGaming expansion projected at 55 CAGR Q1 s earnings disappointed some because as part of their restructuring they had 90 million in one time non recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down 1 2 billion in debt The company noted Results included interest expense of 58 5 million an increase of 53 compared to the prior year reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31 2021 Net loss also included share based compensation of 72 4 million compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction Take away the 90 million in one time expenses and rather than reporting a 49 million loss the company would have reported 41 million in quarterly net profit thereby beating all analyst estimates All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently In addition to paying down 1 2 billion in debt an improved Moody s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1 25 lower interest rate with an option to reduce it another 25bp 10 Foley says One of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe s leverage ratio to 3 6x Debt EBITDA Notably this Debt EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around 92 million annually This secures higher margins increased cash for M amp A and higher profits which in my view will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud based integration for easier migration between their platforms easier cross border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service having identified a 58 trillion TAM Highly competitve Unlike other payment processors Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics credit cards or even bank accounts the 1 7 billion unbanked globally to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries This segment grew 63 YoY Just today Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox

there first and to make sure we dominate Bill Foley amp x200B Paysafe is the 1 global leader in iGaming payment processing a space that is extremely difficult to enter due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape Paysafe s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT as discussed below Paysafe is often an integrated back end payment processor so most don t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75 of all US iGaming operators Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state legalized sports betting Bill Foley says It s going to be a land grab We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else we re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator The day a state opens up we are there ready from a regulatory perspective from a risk perspective and from a product perspective I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie ins with every major casino company that s headquartered or located in Las Vegas There will be money to be made for everybody We ve got a wide landscape we can attack It s pretty exciting In his letter to investors fund manager Dan Loeb said We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso who initiated coverage with a 19 price target noted PSFE operates in high growth verticals has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States adding we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state level legalization of iGaming 13 Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly Hogan likely to sign Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting Delaware igaming

schools Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think Canada legalizes single game sports betting amp x200B Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a Buy A few quotes RBC Capital 5 star analyst Daniel Perlin We believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop and integrated payments all focused on specialized amp complex end markets which creates a competitive moat and pricing power recent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE s business and the FTAC II transaction and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space PSFE has created a unique two sided network enabling merchants to accept online amp in store payments in specific niche verticals while also offering consumers a digital wallet amp eCash solution which converts cash heavy users to digital users We believe it s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs peers 14 BMO Capital 5 star analyst James Fotheringham PSFE is a global leader in iGaming online betting related to sports poker and other casino games as well as lotteries and bingo Indeed 36 of PSFE s revenues are from global iGaming That is far more than for any of its peers iGaming deposit volumes in the U S will grow at more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world with a 5 year CAGR compound annual growth rate of between 40 to 55 15 Evercore ISI analyst David Togut praised Paysafe for its robust risk management operation and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally including cash network stored digital wallet value and amount of partnered independent merchants 16 amp x200B MOAT robust risk management operation So why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1 7 billion globally who can t even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards Their industry leading multi jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter CEO Philip McHugh from transcript When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it s hard to copy We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk compliance and analytics That is very very rare in the payments space It s a real strength of ours We ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry including the former CRO from PayPal and we ve upgraded the team we ve built some real data capabilities and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others We can de risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can t do When you have that two sided network you change the conversation When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers we re not only talking about take rates and comps we re talking about revenue generation we re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem That s a really really powerful position to have 9 amp x200B Valuation A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal Square Nuvei Repay Shift4 Adyen Affirm BILL GPN and Paysign Paysafe reports 30 EBITDA margin mid to high teen EBITDA growth and 362 million in free cash flow now on track to increase 29 By comparison a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA half reported negative EBITDA growth and a third negative free cash flow Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt EBITDA ratio than 3 4 of them The group s collective growth rate of 12 5 is in the range of Paysafe s 10 13 projections but the company s estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their active M amp A pipeline Foley is apparently known for under promising and over performing As noted above Paysafe was growing 28 CAGR pre Covid but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid related business closures and strategic channel exits it grew at 18 CAGR a rate on par with PayPal s projected growth Given all the above factors it seems fair to look at Paysafe s potential price based on an average of peer multiples Paysafe s share price with average of sector peer multiples EV EBITDA ratio 122 09 EV Rev ratio 83 91 EV FCF ratio 87 86 Average 97 95 More realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over 100 EV EBITDA ratio 50 75 EV Rev ratio 44 64 EV FCF ratio 44 18 Average 46 52 In a nutshell the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe s conservative projections yet they trade at 350 750 higher multiples With Paysafe having better financials than most it is hard to argue that this is proportionate Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up While I don t necessarily agree with his time frame market analyst Steve Grasso s call for 45 55 may actually be quite reasonable amp

my plan is to hold PSFE long term There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor before all the rosy ER s come in With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and despite recent reports has similar growth to PayPal it s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de risked from a long term perspective The comprehensive DD below is for the diamond handed apes who may have been caught in the recent hype Know that you re not alone We saw the same thing right after CNBC s Jim Cramer called Paysafe the ultimate stock for this moment and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to 45 50 and then settle in before moving higher from there After initial spikes deep pocketed short sellers methodically crushed retail holders eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week But informed short sellers knew they couldn t push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb Third Point 41 5 million shares David Tepper Appaloosa Management 10 million shares Aaron Cohen Survetta Capital 13 million shares Dipanjan Deb Francisco Partners 20 million shares and Leon Cooperman personally owns 1 1 million shares A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo s several funds 12 million shares and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares 1 Also it s worth noting that since they all decided to invest Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase ESL Gaming Luckbox and Microsoft among others 2 With a presence in 120 countries Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor 1 global leader in iGaming 2 global digital wallet 4 globally in integrated merchant processing Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private they ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk increase margins and profits It s because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity Here are a few key points amp x200B In 2017 private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for 3 9 billion 3 Blackstone says their typical investment term is upwards of 7 10 years 4 which aligns with the investment time frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said There is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services away from the cash and cheques of our parents age adding that the private equity firms have a decade long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now 5 Under Blackstone CVC s stewardship Paysafe grew revenue 65 from 864 million to 1 418 billion 28 CAGR pre Covid Last year due to Covid related brick and mortar business and sporting event closures along with their long standing strategic decision to exit specific high risk Asian revenue channels 2020 revenue stagnated This is the reason they recently reported only 5 YoY quarterly growth In their Q1 ER management noted that without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the mid to high teens But even if you include 2020 s stagnant growth their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18 CAGR This is roughly the same as PayPal s current projected growth 6 7 A few months ago Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley Chairman of Fidelity The deal paid down 1 2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone CVC about 5 6 billion in cash and shares 8 The fact that Blackstone s recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares combined with statements from them and Paysafe s board indicates that they did this deal not for a mere 44 gain on a four year investment but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth Inorganic growth through M amp A is a major pillar of Paysafe s strategy going forward Bill Foley now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder is a proven M amp A synergy wizard particularly in the financial services arena Foley took Fidelity National Financial from 3 million market cap to 10 8 billion Yeah that s and m and a b Over just the last five years Foley grew Ceridian 3 3X 4 2B to 14B Dun amp Bradstreet 5 6X 2B to 11 3B and Black Knight 8 7X 1 6B to 14B Through his proven M amp A playbook Foley also grew FIS from 2 5 billion to over 91 billion market cap That s a 36x return He says Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe 6 9 Deleveraging increasing margins and profit Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of 1 53 billion in revenue 930 970 million in gross profit double digit growth and expanding 30 35 EBITDA margins and 103 billion in transactional volume Paysafe s already strong 362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29 growth in 2021 Notably their multi year projections don t include growth from their active M amp A pipeline and their ongoing US iGaming expansion projected at 55 CAGR Q1 s earnings disappointed some because as part of their restructuring they had 90 million in one time non recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down 1 2 billion in debt The company noted Results included interest expense of 58 5 million an increase of 53 compared to the prior year reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31 2021 Net loss also included share based compensation of 72 4 million compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction Take away the 90 million in one time expenses and rather than reporting a 49 million loss the company would have reported 41 million in quarterly net profit thereby beating all analyst estimates All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently In addition to paying down 1 2 billion in debt an improved Moody s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1 25 lower interest rate with an option to reduce it another 25bp 10 Foley says One of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe s leverage ratio to 3 6x Debt EBITDA Notably this Debt EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around 92 million annually This secures higher margins increased cash for M amp A and higher profits which in my view will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud based integration for easier migration between their platforms easier cross border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service having identified a 58 trillion TAM Highly competitve Unlike other payment processors Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics

there first and to make sure we dominate Bill Foley amp x200B Paysafe is the 1 global leader in iGaming payment processing a space that is extremely difficult to enter due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape Paysafe s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT as discussed below Paysafe is often an integrated back end payment processor so most don t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75 of all US iGaming operators Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state legalized sports betting Bill Foley says It s going to be a land grab We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else we re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator The day a state opens up we are there ready from a regulatory perspective from a risk perspective and from a product perspective I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie ins with every major casino company that s headquartered or located in Las Vegas There will be money to be made for everybody We ve got a wide landscape we can attack It s pretty exciting In his letter to investors fund manager Dan Loeb said We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso who initiated coverage with a 19 price target noted PSFE operates in high growth verticals has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States adding we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state level legalization of iGaming 13 Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly Hogan likely to sign Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting Delaware igaming

schools Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think Canada legalizes single game sports betting amp x200B Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a Buy A few quotes RBC Capital 5 star analyst Daniel Perlin We believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop and integrated payments all focused on specialized amp complex end markets which creates a competitive moat and pricing power recent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE s business and the FTAC II transaction and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space PSFE has created a unique two sided network enabling merchants to accept online amp in store payments in specific niche verticals while also offering consumers a digital wallet amp eCash solution which converts cash heavy users to digital users We believe it s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs peers 14 BMO Capital 5 star analyst James Fotheringham PSFE is a global leader in iGaming online betting related to sports poker and other casino games as well as lotteries and bingo Indeed 36 of PSFE s revenues are from global iGaming That is far more than for any of its peers iGaming deposit volumes in the U S will grow at more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world with a 5 year CAGR compound annual growth rate of between 40 to 55 15 Evercore ISI analyst David Togut praised Paysafe for its robust risk management operation and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally including cash network stored digital wallet value and amount of partnered independent merchants 16 amp x200B MOAT robust risk management operation So why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1 7 billion globally who can t even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards Their industry leading multi jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter CEO Philip McHugh from transcript When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it s hard to copy We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk compliance and analytics That is very very rare in the payments space It s a real strength of ours We ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry including the former CRO from PayPal and we ve upgraded the team we ve built some real data capabilities and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others We can de risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can t do When you have that two sided network you change the conversation When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers we re not only talking about take rates and comps we re talking about revenue generation we re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem That s a really really powerful position to have 9 amp x200B Valuation A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal Square Nuvei Repay Shift4 Adyen Affirm BILL GPN and Paysign Paysafe reports 30 EBITDA margin mid to high teen EBITDA growth and 362 million in free cash flow now on track to increase 29 By comparison a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA half reported negative EBITDA growth and a third negative free cash flow Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt EBITDA ratio than 3 4 of them The group s collective growth rate of 12 5 is in the range of Paysafe s 10 13 projections but the company s estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their active M amp A pipeline Foley is apparently known for under promising and over performing As noted above Paysafe was growing 28 CAGR pre Covid but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid related business closures and strategic channel exits it grew at 18 CAGR a rate on par with PayPal s projected growth Given all the above factors it seems fair to look at Paysafe s potential price based on an average of peer multiples Paysafe s share price with average of sector peer multiples EV EBITDA ratio 122 09 EV Rev ratio 83 91 EV FCF ratio 87 86 Average 97 95 More realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over 100 EV EBITDA ratio 50 75 EV Rev ratio 44 64 EV FCF ratio 44 18 Average 46 52 In a nutshell the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe s conservative projections yet they trade at 350 750 higher multiples With Paysafe having better financials than most it is hard to argue that this is proportionate Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up While I don t necessarily agree with his time frame market analyst Steve Grasso s call for 45 55 may actually be quite reasonable amp

selling stock Outlook CMC is anticipating that the strong demand expressed by the sector should support robust shipment levels of finished steel during the fourth quarter in both North America and Europe Construction activity is strong and the industrial sectors are growing in both the U S and Central Europe as both regions continue to recover from the pandemic CMC also expects 4th quarter margins over scrap on steel products in North America and Europe to be up modestly from third quarter levels 3rd quarter margins already up 74 per ton sequentially in North America up 84 in Europe CMC s stability of in their construction backlog and willingness of downstream customers in North America to contract new work point to continued demand strength The CEO stated that This view is supported by several widely monitored construction indicators that generally lead activity by nine to twelve months which have improved significantly in 2021 Biden Infrastructure Plan On June 24th President Joe Biden declared we have a deal on a major infrastructure initiative after meeting with a bipartisan group of senators The deal will pump 1 2 trillion into roads bridges tunnels and broadband These are

Positions 145 shares 91 The Play Buy shares or ATM leap calls amp x200B Introduction Peloton was one of the key winners during the coronavirus pandemic and has seen a recent hit to its stock price as the world reopens and Wall Street starts to bet against the company as things return to normal In this DD I would explain that Peloton is more than just a company that sells expensive workout equipment to stuck at home upper middle class housewives Instead it is more akin to a combination of a digital based subscription service and a fitness focused social media company All of this along with some external factors once taken into account will let Peloton carve out a key position in the broad fitness market even after Covid which in turn will translate into a higher stock price amp x200B Trend Towards Home Gyms Peloton was one of the companies that did exceptionally well during the pandemic as millions of Americans hunkered down and bought at home fitness equipment However the mainstream mindset is that as things reopen and we transition back to normal many of these Americans will return to their old habits of going back to physical gym locations and as a result Peloton will see significant headwinds to future growth I do not believe this will be the case I believe that despite gyms reopening recent trends point to a permanent change in consumer behavior that not enough Wall Street analysts are talking about Let me explain First off despite gyms being reopened studies have actually shown that a staggering 60 of adults enjoyed their at home equipment so much they do not plan on going back to physical gym locations link https www glofox com blog 10 gym membership statistics you need to know What s more is that other studies have also pointed to a favorable environment going into 2021 for Peloton and other at home fitness equipment manufacturers On the website RunRepeat link https runrepeat com fitness trends fitness trend hit the hardest in 2020 gym memberships it states that the number one fitness trend of 2021 among active adults are outdoor activities such as running cycling walking etc at 59 1 This is higher than the 51 6 stated in 2020 This is followed by the number two trend which is at home fitness equipment at 16 which is a lot higher than the 2020 consensus of 11 2 Gyms on the other hand comes in much lower at 8 2 in 2021 a stark decrease from 20 8 in 2020 What this shows is that there is a permanent shift in consumer behavior The idea of a monthly subscription access to a public gym appears to be coming to an end and consumers are more interested in either pursuing physical activities outside or investing into their own personal equipment The website also stated additional information that helps the case for Peloton It states that the fastest growing trend of 2021 is at home fitness equipment In the US for example the number of adults seeking at home equipment is up by a staggering 218 What is more shocking is that the percentage of adults who see gyms as the best way to stay healthy is only 8 5 This is a drastic decrease from the 20 4 we saw in 2020 In conclusion even after the pandemic Americans are now more invested than ever into at home work out equipment and are turning away in greater numbers from the traditional physical gym As the manufacturer of one of the most recognized brands for at home fitness Peloton is strategically placed to reap the rewards from this change in consumer behavior going into the near future In addition due to the recent launch of Peloton s Digital membership application the company can also benefit from the growth of outdoor activities as well This I will explain in greater detail in the next section amp x200B The Economics of Peloton Why Buying A 3 000 Bike Saves You Money At first glance it would appear that Peloton only targets really wealthy individuals since only those with some serious scratch in their pockets can afford their flashy workout equipment Just by going on their website Peloton sells their exercise bikes starting at 2 495 for their standard Peloton Bike https www onepeloton ca bike and treadmills starting at 3 295 https www onepeloton ca tread https www onepeloton ca tread This of course is on top of the monthly subscription fee of 49 if you decide to go with the All Access Membership which is available to those with the Peloton Hardware and the Digital Membership plan of 16 a month which is available to anyone even those without any equipment https www onepeloton ca membership https www onepeloton ca membership This option is tailored to those who prefer outdoor activities such as the ones listed in the prior section It essentially creates a studio like atmosphere while users do their daily jog bike outside etc This is the app I believe that will let Peloton capitalize on the growth of outdoor activities To state the obvious owning a Peloton is not cheap and it takes a special kind of person to fork over the staggering upfront cost plus the monthly subscription amount however that does not mean only wealthy individuals can find value within a 2 500 bicycle Believe it or not many people can actually SAVE money by buying a Peloton Let me explain The average cost of a boutique fitness class averages 35 per class in major cities throughout the US https www refinery29 com en us fitness classes cost expensive https www refinery29 com en us fitness classes cost expensive The average cost of a personal trainer can be between 40 70 an hour https lessons com costs personal trainer cost If you purchase a 2 500 Peloton you pay 49 a month and have access to unlimited classes Assuming you have two people who are fitness enthusiasts who attend classes twice a week let s compare how much they are going to spend on a yearly basis Person 1 will not have the Peloton and will go to her spin class twice a week the other person 2 has a Peloton and forked over the upfront cost and monthly subscription amp x200B Person 1 Person 2 Peloton 2 500 Yearly Classes Subscription Cost 35 2 52 588 or 49 12 Total Cost 3 088 2 988 amp x200B This shows that just by assuming a person goes to a spin class twice a week they can save around 600 in the first year by purchasing a Peloton If that individual has a personal trainer then the saving costs can be even larger amp x200B The Highly Addictive Atmosphere One unique aspect I keep hearing from Peloton users is how addictive the bikes are Although the idea that working out and sweating can be addictive sounds absurd at face value one look into the Peloton ecosystem can show us why that can be the case When you read the testimonials and reviews of Peloton one thing that will often pop up is how engaging the classes are The reviewers will often state that although they are working from home the Peloton coaches the music and the overall environment of the classes make them feel like they are in a personal spin class or with a personal trainer one on one Because of this plus the social media aspects of the app such as competing against your fellow classmates make Peloton classes a highly addictive environment for many of its users link https www worklifekids com blog 2018 11 22 i hate you peloton To drive this point home from another angle that is not anecdotal you can actually see the engagement percentage on peloton s website Right now the yearly engagement is around 94 yearly This means that 94 of people who bought the Peloton bike still subscribes to the 49 monthly subscription 1 year after purchase This is a big deal because Peloton does not make money selling bikes they make money selling subscriptions as I will show you in the next section amp x200B A Look Into Their Financials When I analyze the financial statement of a company I first focus on their balance sheet income statement then their cash flow I also focus on convertible stocks warrants or any other investment vehicles that will let insiders or any other interested parties sell their shares and dilute shareholder value Balance Sheet Balance sheet is useful in getting a quick snapshot into the overall health of the company Here I will look at their working capital to confirm that the company is indeed solvent amp x200B https preview redd it qvqzvbhczl871 png width 1889 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b3855a28fda017b37e23811abf3e4ae470d8d408 Net working capital is the sum of current assets minus current liabilities Since current assets outweigh current liabilities the company s solvency is not an issue Total assets outweigh total liabilities as well so the longevity of the company will not come into question Income Statement For the income statement three interesting things points out First is that the lion s share of company revenue comes from sale of fitness equipment and no the application subscription This is not surprising but it confirms where top line revenue growth is coming from The second point of interest is that in the operating expenses section the company invests heavily into marketing and R amp D R amp D tripled compared to this time last year which means the company will most likely increase their product lines SGA remains relatively steady which shows the company s management runs a tight ship and knows how to trim the fat around excess spending This is a good sign especially for a growing tech company and it shows in their positive net income for the 9 months ended period in the third column amp x200B https preview redd it szp7yz7ezl871 png width 1893 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e1e0318008cbebf51166911a67045cc6ff6f876d Another point of interest about their income statement is that even though subscription revenue accounts for about 16 of total revenue it accounts for about 34 of gross profit What this means is that Peloton does not make money selling the bikes they make money via their subscription fees The bikes are more so a tool to hook people in to the Peloton ecosystem where the real margins are made https preview redd it lsi147ngzl871 png width 1898 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5a83048fd953b02485ccf7caea537d63f7f7f134 Cash Flow Cash flow statements are broken into three sections Operating Investing and Financing Operating cash flow is useful for assessing the quality of the company s earnings If a company posts positive EPS they should also post positive operating cash flow as well Over here you can see the company is operating cash flow positive which is really good because it shows high earnings quality as well as the company s ability to bring in cash to the business This means the operations are actually viable and decreases the chance for future share and debt issuance which will erode current shareholder value amp x200B https preview redd it gb4m5hgizl871 png width 1896 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 6d7603bd672735c2d7698f38f8b21b53bddd757f Investing cash flow is useful to assess where the company is investing their money and it gives good indication on where the management wants to take the company amp x200B https preview redd it 4mkw58hjzl871 png width 1902 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 81b7a632577caefa4769fa72656e7702cfe9089f What stands out to me the most in this section is the first line purchases of marketable securities of 450m What this means is that this company is buying back 450m of their own shares per quarter which is really good because it increases the value of your stock holdings and elevates share price This is a practice that is mostly attributed to blue chip companies so a growth stock like Peloton buying back shares is really impressive What also stands out is that company increased their investment into PPE which shows that they are also invested into future growth which will really help long term potential Financing cash flow is useful to see if the company is taking on too much debt relative to earnings and if the company is either financing their operations through debt or equity issuance This section is important as a shareholder because it helps assess the value of your potential investment into the company amp x200B https preview redd it ukit8zjkzl871 png width 1895 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 05d00b45d506f74708e0b928ba677cdcac6c53d5 Over here you will see that this quarter the company did not issue out any convertible debt This is a plus for current shareholders because it will help decrease the risk for future share dilution This combined with their steady share buyback will help create a really positive outlook for this stock

Investment Summary Recently there has been a lot of buzz around Palantir however very few people actually understand what they do and how they operate As a result of this I have decided to take on the task of trying explain exactlywhat Palantir does and why they could be the best undervalued stock to buy now o I am no data engineer so this article contains my interpretations of what Palantir does some of my interpretations may be off so I would appreciate any helpful comments to clear some things up that I may have got wrong Based on the comparable analyses that I underwent Palantir is currently an undervalued stock and represents a great opportunity for a long term hold o The length of time that I plan on holding is subject to change due to their future financial reports and any news that may come out It is very hard to say what the upside potential of an investment into Palantir is which is why my investment plan found in the plan section is different than usual o There are various risks to this investment like there are to every investment these risks are highlighted near the end of this report under the risks section o Additionally there are also multiple different catalysts that can help Palantir s share price both in the short and long term s These catalysts are listed at the end of this report Overview of Palantir as a Company PLTR Palantir Technologies Inc https utradea com stocks PLTR was founded in 2003 after their fear anger after the events observed through 9 11 and started building their software primarily for government institutions and intelligence to assist in counterterrorism by any means possible At this point in time Palantir s only source of revenue was through secretive government contracts However since that point in time Palantir has expanded their operations into commercial enterprises as they noticed a lot of similarities and overlaps with their applications Now Palantir s revenue comes from both Government Contracts and Commercial Enterprise Contracts Palantir has 2 main software platforms Palantir Gotham and Palantir Foundry Palantir Gotham https www palantir com palantir gotham was their first software platform and was designed for defense intelligence use cases Palantir has stated that this kind of platform helps agencies find needles in thousands of haystacks They also noted that Gotham helped soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan https www palantir com wp assets wp content uploads 2014 03 Impact Study Palantir Defense During Drawdown pdf to map networks of bomb makers and insurgents through deep hidden patterns and datasets helping the army save time and lives Since this mission Gotham has expanded into defense operations and mission planning During this time Palantir found that Gotham could also be applied in Airbus business as their planes require millions of parts assembled in multiple factories in different countries However Palantir decided to make another software platform that is better tailored to commercial enterprises this platform was labelled Palantir Foundry Palantir Foundry https www palantir com palantir foundry transforms the way in which organizations interact with their information by creating a central operating system for their data Palantir enables their customers to construct their own models quickly and easily from countless sets of data points Palantir software is used by their 139 Government and Commercial Institutions enterprises in over 40 industries ranging over 150 countries Palantir works with the US Government and their several allies abroad as well as the worlds most important reliable companies Lastly Palantir has stated We are not in the business of collecting mining or selling data We build the software that enable our customers to integrate their own data that they already have Everything you need to know about Palantir and PLTR Palantir Foundry Foundry is essentially a data warehouse https panoply io data warehouse guide the difference between a database and a data warehouse that helps their commercial customers to collect and analyze their data Foundry s platform includes a graphical data interface https www omnisci com technical glossary graphical user interface that is extremely user friendly allowing their customers to get the most out of their data Furthermore Foundry provides statistical analyses through the use of their AI machine learning https www palantir com solutions ai ml networks that are able to consistently deliver efficient and accurate results Foundry helps to

analytics through their machine learning and AI systems to get the most value out of a company s data make quality insights so that their clients can gain a competitive advantage Foundries potential use cases are almost infinite Palantir Gotham Dubbed The Operating System for Government Decision Making Gotham helps to improve and accelerate decisions across all levels of Government operations Gotham is primarily used by the defense and intelligence sections of the Government to help them find what they are looking for Gotham collects data from millions of different sources and combines it all into one platform to identify hidden patterns and bring all of this data to life This allows their users to access this data and manage their operations to execute real world responses to threats that Gotham identifies Gotham is becoming a main data solution across various different government agencies There is not too much information that is publicly known about the actual uses of Gotham which makes sense due to the secretive nature of the organizations that they are in business with However what we do know is that these organizations have re signed contracts with Palantir which helps us to be confident that this platform is truly the real deal Lastly Gotham is also offered to select commercial customers primarily the companies that are investigating fraud in financial service industries Furthermore Palantir has been credited https www bizjournals com bizjournals news 2015 01 12 leaked documents bernie madoff convicted thanks to html with assisting in finding the largest Ponzi scheme ever Bernie Madoff s Ponzi Scheme Gotham helps the Defense and Intelligence sectors of the Government to pool their incomprehensible amounts of data into one place Palantir uses machine learning to quickly locate hidden pieces of data and key patterns so that these institutions can take swift action to the threats problems they face in real time Palantir s Approach Palantir believes that every large institution in the world has a problem in their approach to mass data analysis and Palantir believes that their platforms are best suited to help companies address this problem and make the most out of their data Palantir recognises that other companies sell features tools applications and or dashboards however these products are not built to maintain optimal performance in the long run if at all Palantir prides themselves on having the best all around software platform to have sustainable reliable and safe data solutions Palantir also groups their Foundry data from all of their companies into one large system of several large farms of data provided by each of their client companies By doing this Palantir is able to feed more data information into their machine learning AI and algorithms so that they can continue to be more reliable and efficient This also enables cross industry data pools https youtu be 7zqE8J4WKOU that can be used by their companies when they look to expand or for opportunities in other verticals Palantir Success Stories BP Perhaps the most notable success story that has come from Palantir is their partnership with BP British Petroleum https utradea com stocks BP BP and Palantir have been partners since 2014 and recently February 2021 BP and Palantir have extended their partnership https www fool com investing 2021 02 05 palantir deepens ties with bp with new 5 year deal for 5 more years Palantir has helped BP to transform their business into a more digital one and this extension of their partnership will ensure a further acceleration of their strategic digitization of their business Palantir s Foundry has already helped BP by streamlining and enhancing their hydrocarbon based workflows Palantir helped BP to analyze their drilling data and has helped them to increase their oil production in the North Sea by over 10 https www thetimes co uk article palantir the tech spooks who found bin laden are helping bp find oil 9qddfpv2r This increase in production helps us to visualize just how useful Palantir s software can be This is why their Foundry has been credited as a competitive advantage Other oil producing companies most likely would not have been able to uncover the data patterns and relationships that were uncovered by Palantir thus the companies that are not using Palantir may be losing out This type of publicity is fantastic for Palantir as companies may see this and contact Palantir because they too want a competitive advantage Palantir s best chance at becoming the next tech giant comes through the commercial applications contracts This is because there are infinite uses for Palantir so theoretically they can get it in the hands of every business which would help revenues to soar National Institute of Health NIH and Britain s National Health Service NHS Palantir has historically been a rather controversial company through their help in government agencies like ICE However recently Palantir has been getting good press which has helped their company image Since the start of the pandemic some institutions like the NIH and NHS have signed contracts with Palantir for Palantir s assistance with their fights against COVID 19 and their vaccine distributions This is good for Palantir as it shows them in a good light and shows that they can help provide the world with help and safety during a crisis like COVID 19 The NIH agreed to a 36M contract https www palantir com pt media nih palantir contract to gain a partnership with Palantir Their NIH s mission is to build the largest centralized COVID 19 patient database in the world and Palantir has helped them to do this with massive success Palantir was able to assist the NIH in building their N3C data platform https covid cd2h org This platform has come a long way since they teamed up with Palantir and now has over 7 1B rows of data from 6 5M patients from 57 different databases Without the assistance of Palantir analyzing this amount of data would have been no easy feat however Palantir has provided the NIH with advanced analytics in the matter of minutes thank to their machine learning capabilities Additionally in December of 2020 Palantir signed a 2 year 31 5M deal https www businesswire com news home 20201223005018 en Palantir Continues Vital NHS Work With 31 5M Contract with the Brittan s NHS This partnership requires Foundry to provide a secure reliable and timely platform to process data while protecting patient privacy to ultimately improve patient care Both of these partnerships highlight the need for Palantir during a crisis and having these large Government Health Institutes choosing Palantir as their first options is a great deal and shows their confidence in Palantir s software Sources The power of data in a pandemic Technology in the NHS blog gov uk https healthtech blog gov uk 2020 03 28 the power of data in a pandemic Strengths Built in Privacy Controls By having privacy controls https youtu be 7zqE8J4WKOU in place Palantir is able to operate in places that other data companies cannot go This is especially true for Foundry where companies individuals can request cross industry data from other Palantir clients to help them in a variety of ways This request for external data needs to be accepted by a representative of the other company to be allowed This helps Palantir leverage all of the data that they have on their Operating System which essentially makes their platform a cross company cross country collaborative workspace for all As Palantir attains more clients the more attractive extensive their database is for potential clients This should help Palantir to expand quickly once they get the ball rolling Palantir truly values this privacy and has integrated data legibility audit logs access controls quality checks and requirements to attain external data Government Grade Security As we know Palantir started out in just the defense and intelligence spaces This required Palantir to have elite level security from the get go Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced This is no easy feat however Palantir managed to achieve this which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies This is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data Furthermore Palantir currently has IL 5 clearance https simplemoneylyfe com palantir stock analysis with the Department of Defense DoD which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance alongside Oracle Salesforce and SAP However it has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL 6 clearance which has never been done before as it is the storage processing of classified information This level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir s technology truly is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with Expansion into the Commercial Sector Palantir currently has a huge opportunity ahead of them as they continue to increase their presence in the commercial sector partnering with some of the largest enterprises in the world Palantir plans to provide these businesses with the software that they need to do their jobs as efficient as possible and sees large growth potential in this industry Palantir has said that they are focusing on building partnerships with enterprises that are willing to undergo structural changes within the organization operations Palantir has a huge market ahead of themselves in the commercial sector and their stock should do well on the news breaking of new partnerships between Palantir and commercial enterprises Government Contracts Do you remember what I said earlier about what happens once Palantir gets the ball rolling If so you will know where I am headed with this section Between 2008 2018 10 years Palantir was able to generate 51 9M in revenue from government contracts However in the 2 years following this they earned 179 9M in Government contracts this can be found under the US Government section of their SEC 10 K report https sec report Document 0001193125 21 060650 tx65934 1 Once Palantir was able to get the ball rolling with these agencies Palantir was able to both expand and renew existing contracts to earn more revenue I believe that the same thing will happen with Palantir s commercial operations Once they start to get a large number of big enterprises renewing their contracts for bigger bucks I believe that Palantir will start to grow their revenues extremely quick and attract new clients left right and center These contract renewals are so important because essentially they mean that Palantir met and or exceeded expectations and these companies now believe that Palantir is vital to their business operations so look out for news around renewals Business Model Palantir has developed a business model that focuses on acquiring contracts and expanding their services and has 3 main phases 1 Acquire Customers Palantir has expanded their sales force largely over the past couple of years and actively purse negotiations with companies that they can provide long term value to To acquire these companies Palantir gives them a short demo to see how effective and user friendly their software is Palantir provides this service for a loss However they are willing to incur these proportionately small losses to potentially acquire large contracts with these companies This phase runs at a loss but helps Palantir set up clients for the next phase 2 Expand Once Palantir has a potential customer on the hook they move them along to the expand phase Palantir installs their software in these enterprises and teaches them the ropes of course this requires a large investment from Palantir to incorporate it These customers often sign a short contract with Palantir for a cheap cost Palantir takes a loss on this phase as well however clients are able to truly unlock Palantir s software during this phase and see what it has to offer If they like their software they will be moved along to the next phase scale which is Palantir s bread and butter 3 Scale These clients tend to sign longer term deals with Palantir for their software after they have got a good feel for their software The companies in this stage are also generally hands off meaning that they can operate the software without much help Companies tend to find the most value in this stage and Palantir makes the best margins on this stage In 2020 Palantir made 613 4M in this stage with a margin of 70 Financial information All of this information can be found in their SEC 10 K filing https sec report Document 0001193125 21 060650 tx65934 1 Financial Performance Good In 2020 Palantir increased their gross profit by 47 97 and increased their gross margin to 81 from 71 Palantir reported their first net income excluding stock based compensation ever and increase their net revenues by 47 15 Financial Performance Bad In 2020 Palantir s loss from operations increased by 103 61 their stock based compensation increased by 425 15 their General and Admin expenses increased by 108 59 and their net loss increased by 101 22 Their biggest problem in 2020 was their large stock based compensation which will be addressed later Convertible Preferred Stock In 2020 Palantir issued a total of 797 771 675 shares of common stock through conversion of their previous convertible referred shares This one factor of dilution caused an estimated dilutionary effect of Palantir s stock of 137 19 This is a huge form of dilution and I have never seen anything like this before however I have an explanation for this so stay tuned for that Repurchase of Common Stock In 2020 Palantir repurchased 808 201 shares back This is a measly amount compared to the amount of dilution from preferred stock however any buyback is good to see as an investor This buyback caused an inflationary effect on existing shares of 0 14 which is not much but we will still take it Stock Warrants In 2020 Palantir experienced an additional 7 631 329 shares on the market through the exercising of warrants The exercising of these warrant had a dilutionary effect on Palantir s stock of 1 31 Common Stock Net of Issuance Costs In 2020 Palantir unloaded 206 500 523 common shares onto the market from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs I believe that this means that Palantir had to fork out additional shares to cover the investment needed to take their shares public I could very well be wrong on that and if anyone can pitch in and explain this to me that would be great Anyways this caused a dilutionary effect of Palantir s common stock of roughly 35 51 This is a large portion of dilution however it does not even factor in other factors of dilution which is worrying Stock Options In 2020 Palantir added 120 617 527 common shares to their shares outstanding through the exercise of options These options were exercised and thus converted into these common shares and had a dilutionary effect of 20 72 Once again this is a large amount of dilution and should be considered by investors RSU s In 2020 Palantir issued 82 429 575 shares through their vesting of Restricted Stock Units RSU s This had a dilutionary effect on their stock of 14 18 which is a lot of dilution Modification to Stock Options In 2020 Palantir technically bought back 3 500 0000 shares through modifications to stock options for the settlement of employee loans accounted for as modifications to stock options Confusing right This technical buyback resulted in a share inflation of 0 6 Total Share Dilution in 2020 In 2020 Palantir experience an overall share dilution of 208 19 This is the most dilution I have ever seen in a stock that I have analyzed however there are some potential answers as to why there was so much dilution in 2020 Explanation of Share Dilution Once again all of the below information can be found in Palantir s SEC 10 K filing https sec report Document 0001193125 21 060650 tx65934 1 On September 30th 2020 Palantir completed their Direct Listing of their Class A common shares on the public markets on the NYSE Part of this listing involved the redemption of all of Palantir s convertible share into common shares This was the largest single source of dilution in Palantir 137 Additionally this Direct Listing involved the exercise of al outstanding warrants which resulted in dilution of 1 31 Another part of their Direct Listing was the common stocks issued net of issuance price to complete the direct listing which had a dilutionary effect of 35 51 Lastly Palantir was forced to create new common shares that would hold the place of the unvested RSU s which cause a dilutionary effect of 14 18 Without these factors of dilution Palantir would have only experienced an overall dilution of 20 This means that due to the Direct listing Palantir had to increase their shares outstanding by 188 19 to meet the requirements to be eligible for the listing Overall Thoughts on Dilution Palantir is a very weird stock in terms of their dilution and I have not seen anything quite like this before Their overall level of dilution is unprecedented and very worrying for investors However we know that these levels of dilution were inflated due to the requirements of undergoing a Direct Listing However how does Palantir dilution excluding the effects caused by their Direct Listing compared to their dilution in previous years For starters Palantir exhibited a 20 share dilution in 2020 when eluding the dilution caused by the Direct Listing However historically Palantir has experienced an average share dilution of 5 18 between 2017 2019 So even excluding the effects caused through the Direct Listing Palantir still experienced a comparably high level of share dilution However 20 of dilution is significantly different than the 208 19 of dilution which would be crazily high This 20 is relatively normal for an undervalued growth stock such as Palantir so currently I would not be too worried However investors should keep up with their financial reports and look for their dilution in 2021 because ultimately that will tell us more about Palantir s dilution after going public than their past share dilution as a private company Competition In order to undergo my comparable analyses which will be discussed later on I needed to select 4 companies that I can compare to Palantir ZS Zscaler Inc https utradea com stocks ZS ZScaler is a security as a service company that helps company adapt to cloud technologies and provides their cybersecurity services through the cloud ZScaler provides their services to both commercial enterprises and governments similar to that of Palantir Furthermore ZScaler offers their service primarily in the USA but also has smaller international operations again like Palantir SNOW Snowflake Inc https utradea com stocks SNOW Snowflake like Palantir is a software and technology company that primarily focuses on data Snowflake provides data cloud services such as data engineering data science data applications data sharing and data warehouse This is very similar to the applications and functions available on Palantir however Palantir offers other functions that differentiate themselves Snowflake also provides services for both commercial enterprises and government organizations similar to that of Palantir SPLK Splunk Inc https utradea com stocks SPLK Splunk provide software platforms that deliver insights derived from their clients data in the USA and internationally Splunk offers their Ecosystem solutions that consist of data inputs workflows reports dashboards data visualizations actions and methods and help their clients customers to make the best out of their data All of this sounds eerily familiar to the description of Palantir making it one of the closer competitors Splunk also offers their services to the public sector as well as the government making their business model resemble that of Palantir so much more TYL Tyler technologies Inc https utradea com stocks TYL Tyler technologies is probably the company in this list that least resembles that of Palantir this is because they provide management solutions accounting systems billing systems and other solutions geared toward the public sector Tyler technologies works primarily with governments of all types Federal State and Municipal and education institutions However the one thing that Tyler has that makes them comparable to Palantir is their data and insight solutions Their data insights software enables collaboration displays data visualizations measurements and generates insights for their human operators to act on Q1 2021 Updates All of the below information can be found in Palantir s Q1 Investor Presentation https investors palantir com files Palantir 20Q1 202021 20Business 20Update pdf Recently on May 11th 2021 Palantir released their Q1 earnings report When looking at Palantir s financial performance I did not take this into account which means that this section will be packed with new information that will help us to understand Palantir s trajectory even more First and foremost this quarter was the first quarter in which Palantir has reported positive earnings This is a big milestone for Palantir as a public company and it helps to gets investors excited about the potentially profitable future of Palantir In Q1 Palantir reported a free cash flow of 151M was 290M in Q1 2020 with a 44 adjusted FCF margin they grew revenues by 49 YoY 341M and they grew billings by 248 YoY 362M which means that Palantir is acquiring new customers and negotiating higher contracts These financials are great and show a promising future ahead for Palantir which should excite their investors Furthermore during this quarter they also disclosed their investment in a SPAC This SPAC is QELL Qell Acquisition Corp https utradea com stocks QELL which merging with Lilium Lilium is an eVTOL transportation company with this investment they also came to a deal with Lilium to use Foundry for design engineering testing production quality logistics and operations A while back I looked at another eVTOL SPAC Archer ACIC Atlas Crest Investment Corp https utradea com stocks ACIC which has great upside and has a similar business model to Lilium so if you want to read that to be more informed about Liliums potential performance click here https utradea com positions Take a SHOT at Archers SPAC ACIC In Q1 Palantir was also awarded with a 5 year 90M contract https www businesswire com news home 20210405005238 en Palantir Selected by the National Nuclear Security Administration for 5 year 89 9M Contract for SAFER Project from the National Nuclear Security Administration NNSA in which Palantir will provide the operational platform for their SAFER Safety Analytics Forecasting and Evaluation Reporting project This is big news as this is one of Palantir s bigger contracts and it shows the level of confidence of the NNSA in Palantir s software and their cross enterprise data integration capabilities On the topic of Palantir and Government Organizations the DoD used Palantir s software in all 11 of their Combatant Commands for globally integrated intelligence This high level of usage from the DoD definitely means that Palantir is doing something right and if the DoD likes it so much then it should be more than enough for commercial enterprises Lastly in Q1 Palantir won 15 contracts worth over 5M and 6 contracts worth over 10M with an average duration of 3 7 years 4 6 for commercial customers This is fantastic for the company as they gained an additional 11 new commercial customers from this and I will be keeping up to date with these contracts and others as they come up for renewal negotiations Additionally Palantir was able to grow their gross margin to 83 from 75 Q1 2020 and their contribution margin to 60 from 41 in Q1 2020 This shows that Palantir business partners are maturing into their 3rd phase the scale phase which enables Palantir to grow their margins PLTR Palantir Investment Valuation Comparable Analyses I decided to undergo 2 different comparable analyses in order to get a variety of valuations or opinions if you will Preferably I would like both of these results to be consistent in terms of their fair value estimate however if they are not consistent I will take the average result I was only able to find 2 multiples ratios that I could actually analyze due to the nature of these businesses and their lack of positive financial ratios multiples EV Revenue This is a very common multiple among companies that are not profitable in their operations yet like Palantir and some of these other comparable companies By comparing Palantir s EV Revenue multiple to that of their competitors listed above on the competitors section of this report I found that Palantir has a fair value of 32 85 share which implies an upside to this investment of 23 31 This implies that given Palantir s current price they are undervalued and the upside is very reasonable however I decided to undergo the next comparable to see if this result maintains P B By comparing Palantir s P B ratio to that of their competitors I found that Palantir has a fair value of 24 87 share which implies that there is a downside risk of 6 64 to such an investment As you have probably noticed these results are not consistent therefore I have decided to take the average result to get one final price target Average Comparable By taking the average result from the 2 comparable analyses underwent I found that Palantir has a fair value of 28 86 share which implies an overall upside of 8 36 to this investment This also implies that Palantir is in fact an undervalued growth stock that has the potential to be one of the best undervalued stocks on the market My Plan for Investing into Palantir My plan for this investment is a little different from usual I see anything between 24 87 share Fair Value of P B ratio and 28 86 share average comparable as a good chance to buy Palantir at or below its fair value This helps to limit our downside risk of this investment However I think the best way to play an investment in Palantir is over the long run 3 years I would attempt to buy in at the above prices and hold for these 3 years During this time I would re evaluate my investment with every new financial report and piece of news to decide if it is still worth holding Potential Risks to Palantir s Stock PLTR Dilution Over the past year Palantir has experienced a lot of dilution however we have already attributed a great deal of this dilution to their Direct Listing However the 20 of dilution that was not derived from the direct listing is still quite high As investors we should keep an eye on their future levels of dilution to recognize any patterns increases that we should be weary of If these levels of dilution persist potential investors may be scares off and current investor might sell their positions which will hurt the share price Financial Performance This year s financial performance was not one to be overly happy about Although they were able to increase some pretty important aspects of their balance sheet Palantir was still yet to make a profit and increased their net losses by over 100 If this poor financial performance continues and they keep digging themselves into a bigger and bigger hole investors will run away from this stock and never look back However the Q1 financial performance gives investors hope for a more profitable future which will be discussed later Bad Press Historically Palantir has not been looked at through a positive lens by many people investors and non investors alike Their first public backlash came through their involvement in deporting immigrants through Palantir s partnership with ICE https www bbc com news business 54348456 Palantir quicky spoke out against this backlash by saying ICE took advantage of their software without proper oversight and that they are looking into the issues furthermore they have since declined some potential partnerships with other border agencies to avoid further backlash There have also been numerous smaller controversies and protests that have damaged Palantir s reputation and if there are more large controversies Palantir s stock could get hurt as a result of it Potential Catalysts that can Help Palantir s Stock Price Share Buybacks Over the past year Palantir has bought back both directly and indirectly in a sense over 4 300 000 of their common shares This is good to see as an investor especially this early in the company and not too long after their Direct Listing This gives me hope that Palantir will continue to repurchase more shares in the future This will be good for the share price as it will increase the value of existing shares and it will be especially good for the stock price if they continue to buyback more shares each year Financial Performance Palantir s 2020 financial report was not favourable as discussed previously however there were definitely some good to take out of it Palantir increased their revenue gross profit and margins by a hefty amount which is good to see as an investor however there was bad aspects of this report as well that made the report unfavourable However their newly released Q1 2021 financial report has so much more to offer in terms of good aspects of a financial report Positive Press As previously mentioned Palantir has had their fair share of bad press that has had a small effect on their share price However recently Palantir has been getting better press through helping organizations like the NIH and NHS in their fight against COVID 19 and their vaccine distribution efforts Partnerships like this help to display the positive impacts that can be derived from Palantir s technology Future events where Palantir can use their software for a good cause can help to combat the negative stigma around Palantir and attract more people to invest in their company This should help their share price in the short term after these articles are released Success Stories Since Palantir have gone public they have had a few success stories come out I mentioned some of these stories throughout the article These success stories show how impactful Palantir s software can be and can show companies that they can increase revenues production etc just by using Palantir s software Any future stories like this that come out highlighting the benefits of Palantir can help the stock soar and potential clients to reach out and start business inquiries with Palantir Renewing Contracts I have mentioned that the renewal of contracts can help Palantir s share price a couple times throughout this article but why is this the case This is because these companies that are renewing have already been through Palantir s 3 stage business model and have experienced their software firsthand for numerous years After their time with Palantir s software expires they decide to renew the contract This is good because it shows that Palantir s software was effective enough to their business in the time they had it that it is worth these 5 15M contract renewals Furthermore these companies that are renewing already have underwent Palantir s installation and these clients will provide Palantir with the highest margins which will reflect well on Palantir s future financial reports New Partnerships Contracts and the expansion of commercial enterprise segment Every time that Palantir or its partners release news that they have entered into a contract agreement this will help Palantir s stock This is because Palantir needs to keep expanding their software into new companies in order to meet their expected growth projections Furthermore as more commercial enterprises try Palantir s software and hopefully enjoy it the more willing other companies might be to give Palantir a shot I see their biggest potential for growth and to become a large company in their expansion of their commercial enterprise segment through Foundry Every time Palantir gets more new clients on board it is fantastic and shows the feasibility of this segment and as more contracts role in more enterprises will take an interest Furthermore when Palantir signs these enterprises to a contract it will help to increase their revenues which will show up on their financial reports and hopefully help the to beat estimates This analysis took a long time and is one of the most comprehensive that I have seen so I would greatly appreciate if you followed me here https utradea com member

Investment Summary Recently there has been a lot of excitement around Palantir however very few people actually understand what they do and how they operate As a result of this I have decided to take on the task of trying explain exactly what Palantir does and why they could be the best undervalued stock to buy now o I am no data engineer so this article contains my interpretations of what Palantir does some of my interpretations may be off so I would appreciate any helpful comments to clear some things up that I may have got wrong Based on the comparable analyses that I underwent Palantir is currently an undervalued stock and represents a great opportunity for a long term hold o The length of time that I plan on holding is subject to change due to their future financial reports and any news that may come out It is very hard to say what the upside potential of an investment into Palantir is which is why my investment plan found in the plan section is different than usual o There are various risks to this investment like there are to every investment these risks are highlighted near the end of this report under the risks section o Additionally there are also multiple different catalysts that can help Palantir s share price both in the short and long term s These catalysts are listed at the end of this report Overview of Palantir as a Company PLTR Palantir Technologies Inc https utradea com stocks PLTR was founded in 2003 after their fear anger after the events observed through 9 11 and started building their software primarily for government institutions and intelligence to assist in counterterrorism by any means possible At this point in time Palantir s only source of revenue was through secretive government contracts However since that point in time Palantir has expanded their operations into commercial enterprises as they noticed a lot of similarities and overlaps with their applications Now Palantir s revenue comes from both Government Contracts and Commercial Enterprise Contracts Palantir has 2 main software platforms Palantir Gotham and Palantir Foundry Palantir Gotham https www palantir com palantir gotham was their first software platform and was designed for defense intelligence use cases Palantir has stated that this kind of platform helps agencies find needles in thousands of haystacks They also noted that Gotham helped soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan https www palantir com wp assets wp content uploads 2014 03 Impact Study Palantir Defense During Drawdown pdf to map networks of bomb makers and insurgents through deep hidden patterns and datasets helping the army save time and lives Since this mission Gotham has expanded into defense operations and mission planning During this time Palantir found that Gotham could also be applied in Airbus business as their planes require millions of parts assembled in multiple factories in different countries However Palantir decided to make another software platform that is better tailored to commercial enterprises this platform was labelled Palantir Foundry Palantir Foundry https www palantir com palantir foundry transforms the way in which organizations interact with their information by creating a central operating system for their data Palantir enables their customers to construct their own models quickly and easily from countless sets of data points Palantir software is used by their 139 Government and Commercial Institutions enterprises in over 40 industries ranging over 150 countries Palantir works with the US Government and their several allies abroad as well as the worlds most important reliable companies Lastly Palantir has stated We are not in the business of collecting mining or selling data We build the software that enable our customers to integrate their own data that they already have Everything you need to know about Palantir and PLTR Palantir Foundry Foundry is essentially a data warehouse https panoply io data warehouse guide the difference between a database and a data warehouse that helps their commercial customers to collect and analyze their data Foundry s platform includes a graphical data interface https www omnisci com technical glossary graphical user interface that is extremely user friendly allowing their customers to get the most out of their data Furthermore Foundry provides statistical analyses through the use of their AI machine learning https www palantir com solutions ai ml networks that are able to consistently deliver efficient and accurate results Foundry helps to enables all of their users regardless of their technical abilities to work meaningfully and act with the data that they collect Foundry provides a suite of applications that help combine data analytics and business logic helping them to deliver superior data integration Foundry s front end what the user sees enables their users to take advantage of all of the data collected by their organization to make informed decisions Foundry also has a fantastic application for inter organizational collaboration this helps a team to build on each others work Foundry brings all of an enterprises data together onto their platform however there are access controls in place to define what individuals get control over which dataset s From there Foundry is able to deliver advanced analytics through their machine learning and AI systems to get the most value out of a company s data make quality insights so that their clients can gain a competitive advantage Foundries potential use cases are almost infinite Palantir Gotham Dubbed The Operating System for Government Decision Making Gotham helps to improve and accelerate decisions across all levels of Government operations Gotham is primarily used by the defense and intelligence sections of the Government to help them find what they are looking for Gotham collects data from millions of different sources and combines it all into one platform to identify hidden patterns and bring all of this data to life This allows their users to access this data and manage their operations to execute real world responses to threats that Gotham identifies Gotham is becoming a main data solution across various different government agencies There is not too much information that is publicly known about the actual uses of Gotham which makes sense due to the secretive nature of the organizations that they are in business with However what we do know is that these organizations have re signed contracts with Palantir which helps us to be confident that this platform is truly the real deal Lastly Gotham is also offered to select commercial customers primarily the companies that are investigating fraud in financial service industries Furthermore Palantir has been credited https www bizjournals com bizjournals news 2015 01 12 leaked documents bernie madoff convicted thanks to html with assisting in finding the largest Ponzi scheme ever Bernie Madoff s Ponzi Scheme Gotham helps the Defense and Intelligence sectors of the Government to pool their incomprehensible amounts of data into one place Palantir uses machine learning to quickly locate hidden pieces of data and key patterns so that these institutions can take swift action to the threats problems they face in real time Palantir s Approach Palantir believes that every large institution in the world has a problem in their approach to mass data analysis and Palantir believes that their platforms are best suited to help companies address this problem and make the most out of their data Palantir recognises that other companies sell features tools applications and or dashboards however these products are not built to maintain optimal performance in the long run if at all Palantir prides themselves on having the best all around software platform to have sustainable reliable and safe data solutions Palantir also groups their Foundry data from all of their companies into one large system of several large farms of data provided by each of their client companies By doing this Palantir is able to feed more data information into their machine learning AI and algorithms so that they can continue to be more reliable and efficient This also enables cross industry data pools https youtu be 7zqE8J4WKOU that can be used by their companies when they look to expand or for opportunities in other verticals Palantir Success Stories BP Perhaps the most notable success story that has come from Palantir is their partnership with BP British Petroleum https utradea com stocks BP BP and Palantir have been partners since 2014 and recently February 2021 BP and Palantir have extended their partnership https www fool com investing 2021 02 05 palantir deepens ties with bp with new 5 year deal for 5 more years Palantir has helped BP to transform their business into a more digital one and this extension of their partnership will ensure a further acceleration of their strategic digitization of their business Palantir s Foundry has already helped BP by streamlining and enhancing their hydrocarbon based workflows Palantir helped BP to analyze their drilling data and has helped them to increase their oil production in the North Sea by over 10 https www thetimes co uk article palantir the tech spooks who found bin laden are helping bp find oil 9qddfpv2r This increase in production helps us to visualize just how useful Palantir s software can be This is why their Foundry has been credited as a competitive advantage Other oil producing companies most likely would not have been able to uncover the data patterns and relationships that were uncovered by Palantir thus the companies that are not using Palantir may be losing out This type of publicity is fantastic for Palantir as companies may see this and contact Palantir because they too want a competitive advantage Palantir s best chance at becoming the next tech giant comes through the commercial applications contracts This is because there are infinite uses for Palantir so theoretically they can get it in the hands of every business which would help revenues to soar National Institute of Health NIH and Britain s National Health Service NHS Palantir has historically been a rather controversial company through their help in government agencies like ICE However recently Palantir has been getting good press which has helped their company image Since the start of the pandemic some institutions like the NIH and NHS have signed contracts with Palantir for Palantir s assistance with their fights against COVID 19 and their vaccine distributions This is good for Palantir as it shows them in a good light and shows that they can help provide the world with help and safety during a crisis like COVID 19 The NIH agreed to a 36M contract https www palantir com pt media nih palantir contract to gain a partnership with Palantir Their NIH s mission is to build the largest centralized COVID 19 patient database in the world and Palantir has helped them to do this with massive success Palantir was able to assist the NIH in building their N3C data platform https covid cd2h org This platform has come a long way since they teamed up with Palantir and now has over 7 1B rows of data from 6 5M patients from 57 different databases Without the assistance of Palantir analyzing this amount of data would have been no easy feat however Palantir has provided the NIH with advanced analytics in the matter of minutes thank to their machine learning capabilities Additionally in December of 2020 Palantir signed a 2 year 31 5M deal https www businesswire com news home 20201223005018 en Palantir Continues Vital NHS Work With 31 5M Contract with the Brittan s NHS This partnership requires Foundry to provide a secure reliable and timely platform to process data while protecting patient privacy to ultimately improve patient care Both of these partnerships highlight the need for Palantir during a crisis and having these large Government Health Institutes choosing Palantir as their first options is a great deal and shows their confidence in Palantir s software Sources The power of data in a pandemic Technology in the NHS blog gov uk https healthtech blog gov uk 2020 03 28 the power of data in a pandemic Strengths Built in Privacy Controls By having privacy controls https youtu be 7zqE8J4WKOU in place Palantir is able to operate in places that other data companies cannot go This is especially true for Foundry where companies individuals can request cross industry data from other Palantir clients to help them in a variety of ways This request for external data needs to be accepted by a representative of the other company to be allowed This helps Palantir leverage all of the data that they have on their Operating System which essentially makes their platform a cross company cross country collaborative workspace for all As Palantir attains more clients the more attractive extensive their database is for potential clients This should help Palantir to expand quickly once they get the ball rolling Palantir truly values this privacy and has integrated data legibility audit logs access controls quality checks and requirements to attain external data Government Grade Security As we know Palantir started out in just the defense and intelligence spaces This required Palantir to have elite level security from the get go Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced This is no easy feat however Palantir managed to achieve this which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies This is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data Furthermore Palantir currently has IL 5 clearance https simplemoneylyfe com palantir stock analysis with the Department of Defense DoD which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance alongside Oracle Salesforce and SAP However it has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL 6 clearance which has never been done before as it is the storage processing of classified information This level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir s technology truly is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with Expansion into the Commercial Sector Palantir currently has a huge opportunity ahead of them as they continue to increase their presence in the commercial sector partnering with some of the largest enterprises in the world Palantir plans to provide these businesses with the software that they need to do their jobs as efficient as possible and sees large growth potential in this industry Palantir has said that they are focusing on building partnerships with enterprises that are willing to undergo structural changes within the organization operations Palantir has a huge market ahead of themselves in the commercial sector and their stock should do well on the news breaking of new partnerships between Palantir and commercial enterprises Government Contracts Do you remember what I said earlier about what happens once Palantir gets the ball rolling If so you will know where I am headed with this section Between 2008 2018 10 years Palantir was able to generate 51 9M in revenue from government contracts However in the 2 years following this they earned 179 9M in Government contracts this can be found under the US Government section of their SEC 10 K report https sec report Document 0001193125 21 060650 tx65934 1 Once Palantir was able to get the ball rolling with these agencies Palantir was able to both expand and renew existing contracts to earn more revenue I believe that the same thing will happen with Palantir s commercial operations Once they start to get a large number of big enterprises renewing their contracts for bigger bucks I believe that Palantir will start to grow their revenues extremely quick and attract new clients left right and center These contract renewals are so important because essentially they mean that Palantir met and or exceeded expectations and these companies now believe that Palantir is vital to their business operations so look out for news around renewals Business Model Palantir has developed a business model that focuses on acquiring contracts and expanding their services and has 3 main phases 1 Acquire Customers Palantir has expanded their sales force largely over the past couple of years and actively purse negotiations with companies that they can provide long term value to To acquire these companies Palantir gives them a short demo to see how effective and user friendly their software is Palantir provides this service for a loss However they are willing to incur these proportionately small losses to potentially acquire large contracts with these companies This phase runs at a loss but helps Palantir set up clients for the next phase 2 Expand Once Palantir has a potential customer on the hook they move them along to the expand phase Palantir installs their software in these enterprises and teaches them the ropes of course this requires a large investment from Palantir to incorporate it These customers often sign a short contract with Palantir for a cheap cost Palantir takes a loss on this phase as well however clients are able to truly unlock Palantir s software during this phase and see what it has to offer If they like their software they will be moved along to the next phase scale which is Palantir s bread and butter 3 Scale These clients tend to sign longer term deals with Palantir for their software after they have got a good feel for their software The companies in this stage are also generally hands off meaning that they can operate the software without much help Companies tend to find the most value in this stage and Palantir makes the best margins on this stage In 2020 Palantir made 613 4M in this stage with a margin of 70 Financial information All of this information can be found in their SEC 10 K filing https sec report Document 0001193125 21 060650 tx65934 1 Financial Performance Good In 2020 Palantir increased their gross profit by 47 97 and increased their gross margin to 81 from 71 Palantir reported their first net income excluding stock based compensation ever and increase their net revenues by 47 15 Financial Performance Bad In 2020 Palantir s loss from operations increased by 103 61 their stock based compensation increased by 425 15 their General and Admin expenses increased by 108 59 and their net loss increased by 101 22 Their biggest problem in 2020 was their large stock based compensation which will be addressed later Convertible Preferred Stock In 2020 Palantir issued a total of 797 771 675 shares of common stock through conversion of their previous convertible referred shares This one factor of dilution caused an estimated dilutionary effect of Palantir s stock of 137 19 This is a huge form of dilution and I have never seen anything like this before however I have an explanation for this so stay tuned for that Repurchase of Common Stock In 2020 Palantir repurchased 808 201 shares back This is a measly amount compared to the amount of dilution from preferred stock however any buyback is good to see as an investor This buyback caused an inflationary effect on existing shares of 0 14 which is not much but we will still take it Stock Warrants In 2020 Palantir experienced an additional 7 631 329 shares on the market through the exercising of warrants The exercising of these warrant had a dilutionary effect on Palantir s stock of 1 31 Common Stock Net of Issuance Costs In 2020 Palantir unloaded 206 500 523 common shares onto the market from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs I believe that this means that Palantir had to fork out additional shares to cover the investment needed to take their shares public I could very well be wrong on that and if anyone can pitch in and explain this to me that would be great Anyways this caused a dilutionary effect of Palantir s common stock of roughly 35 51 This is a large portion of dilution however it does not even factor in other factors of dilution which is worrying Stock Options In 2020 Palantir added 120 617 527 common shares to their shares outstanding through the exercise of options These options were exercised and thus converted into these common shares and had a dilutionary effect of 20 72 Once again this is a large amount of dilution and should be considered by investors RSU s In 2020 Palantir issued 82 429 575 shares through their vesting of Restricted Stock Units RSU s This had a dilutionary effect on their stock of 14 18 which is a lot of dilution Modification to Stock Options In 2020 Palantir technically bought back 3 500 0000 shares through modifications to stock options for the settlement of employee loans accounted for as modifications to stock options Confusing right This technical buyback resulted in a share inflation of 0 6 Total Share Dilution in 2020 In 2020 Palantir experience an overall share dilution of 208 19 This is the most dilution I have ever seen in a stock that I have analyzed however there are some potential answers as to why there was so much dilution in 2020 Explanation of Share Dilution Once again all of the below information can be found in Palantir s SEC 10 K filing https sec report Document 0001193125 21 060650 tx65934 1 On September 30th 2020 Palantir completed their Direct Listing of their Class A common shares on the public markets on the NYSE Part of this listing involved the redemption of all of Palantir s convertible share into common shares This was the largest single source of dilution in Palantir 137 Additionally this Direct Listing involved the exercise of al outstanding warrants which resulted in dilution of 1 31 Another part of their Direct Listing was the common stocks issued net of issuance price to complete the direct listing which had a dilutionary effect of 35 51 Lastly Palantir was forced to create new common shares that would hold the place of the unvested RSU s which cause a dilutionary effect of 14 18 Without these factors of dilution Palantir would have only experienced an overall dilution of 20 This means that due to the Direct listing Palantir had to increase their shares outstanding by 188 19 to meet the requirements to be eligible for the listing Overall Thoughts on Dilution Palantir is a very weird stock in terms of their dilution and I have not seen anything quite like this before Their overall level of dilution is unprecedented and very worrying for investors However we know that these levels of dilution were inflated due to the requirements of undergoing a Direct Listing However how does Palantir dilution excluding the effects caused by their Direct Listing compared to their dilution in previous years For starters Palantir exhibited a 20 share dilution in 2020 when eluding the dilution caused by the Direct Listing However historically Palantir has experienced an average share dilution of 5 18 between 2017 2019 So even excluding the effects caused through the Direct Listing Palantir still experienced a comparably high level of share dilution However 20 of dilution is significantly different than the 208 19 of dilution which would be crazily high This 20 is relatively normal for an undervalued growth stock such as Palantir so currently I would not be too worried However investors should keep up with their financial reports and look for their dilution in 2021 because ultimately that will tell us more about Palantir s dilution after going public than their past share dilution as a private company Competition In order to undergo my comparable analyses which will be discussed later on I needed to select 4 companies that I can compare to Palantir ZS Zscaler Inc https utradea com stocks ZS ZScaler is a security as a service company that helps company adapt to cloud technologies and provides their cybersecurity services through the cloud ZScaler provides their services to both commercial enterprises and governments similar to that of Palantir Furthermore ZScaler offers their service primarily in the USA but also has smaller international operations again like Palantir SNOW Snowflake Inc https utradea com stocks SNOW Snowflake like Palantir is a software and technology company that primarily focuses on data Snowflake provides data cloud services such as data engineering data science data applications data sharing and data warehouse This is very similar to the applications and functions available on Palantir however Palantir offers other functions that differentiate themselves Snowflake also provides services for both commercial enterprises and government organizations similar to that of Palantir SPLK Splunk Inc https utradea com stocks SPLK Splunk provide software platforms that deliver insights derived from their clients data in the USA and internationally Splunk offers their Ecosystem solutions that consist of data inputs workflows reports dashboards data visualizations actions and methods and help their clients customers to make the best out of their data All of this sounds eerily familiar to the description of Palantir making it one of the closer competitors Splunk also offers their services to the public sector as well as the government making their business model resemble that of Palantir so much more TYL Tyler technologies Inc https utradea com stocks TYL Tyler technologies is probably the company in this list that least resembles that of Palantir this is because they provide management solutions accounting systems billing systems and other solutions geared toward the public sector Tyler technologies works primarily with governments of all types Federal State and Municipal and education institutions However the one thing that Tyler has that makes them comparable to Palantir is their data and insight solutions Their data insights software enables collaboration displays data visualizations measurements and generates insights for their human operators to act on Q1 2021 Updates All of the below information can be found in Palantir s Q1 Investor Presentation https investors palantir com files Palantir 20Q1 202021 20Business 20Update pdf Recently on May 11th 2021 Palantir released their Q1 earnings report When looking at Palantir s financial performance I did not take this into account which means that this section will be packed with new information that will help us to understand Palantir s trajectory even more First and foremost this quarter was the first quarter in which Palantir has reported positive earnings This is a big milestone for Palantir as a public company and it helps to gets investors excited about the potentially profitable future of Palantir In Q1 Palantir reported a free cash flow of 151M was 290M in Q1 2020 with a 44 adjusted FCF margin they grew revenues by 49 YoY 341M and they grew billings by 248 YoY 362M which means that Palantir is acquiring new customers and negotiating higher contracts These financials are great and show a promising future ahead for Palantir which should excite their investors Furthermore during this quarter they also disclosed their investment in a SPAC This SPAC is QELL Qell Acquisition Corp https utradea com stocks QELL which merging with Lilium Lilium is an eVTOL transportation company with this investment they also came to a deal with Lilium to use Foundry for design engineering testing production quality logistics and operations A while back I looked at another eVTOL SPAC Archer ACIC Atlas Crest Investment Corp https utradea com stocks ACIC which has great upside and has a similar business model to Lilium so if you want to read that to be more informed about Liliums potential performance click here https utradea com positions Take a SHOT at Archers SPAC ACIC In Q1 Palantir was also awarded with a 5 year 90M contract https www businesswire com news home 20210405005238 en Palantir Selected by the National Nuclear Security Administration for 5 year 89 9M Contract for SAFER Project from the National Nuclear Security Administration NNSA in which Palantir will provide the operational platform for their SAFER Safety Analytics Forecasting and Evaluation Reporting project This is big news as this is one of Palantir s bigger contracts and it shows the level of confidence of the NNSA in Palantir s software and their cross enterprise data integration capabilities On the topic of Palantir and Government Organizations the DoD used Palantir s software in all 11 of their Combatant Commands for globally integrated intelligence This high level of usage from the DoD definitely means that Palantir is doing something right and if the DoD likes it so much then it should be more than enough for commercial enterprises Lastly in Q1 Palantir won 15 contracts worth over 5M and 6 contracts worth over 10M with an average duration of 3 7 years 4 6 for commercial customers This is fantastic for the company as they gained an additional 11 new commercial customers from this and I will be keeping up to date with these contracts and others as they come up for renewal negotiations Additionally Palantir was able to grow their gross margin to 83 from 75 Q1 2020 and their contribution margin to 60 from 41 in Q1 2020 This shows that Palantir business partners are maturing into their 3rd phase the scale phase which enables Palantir to grow their margins PLTR Palantir Investment Valuation Comparable Analyses I decided to undergo 2 different comparable analyses in order to get a variety of valuations or opinions if you will Preferably I would like both of these results to be consistent in terms of their fair value estimate however if they are not consistent I will take the average result I was only able to find 2 multiples ratios that I could actually analyze due to the nature of these businesses and their lack of positive financial ratios multiples EV Revenue This is a very common multiple among companies that are not profitable in their operations yet like Palantir and some of these other comparable companies By comparing Palantir s EV Revenue multiple to that of their competitors listed above on the competitors section of this report I found that Palantir has a fair value of 32 85 share which implies an upside to this investment of 23 31 This implies that given Palantir s current price they are undervalued and the upside is very reasonable however I decided to undergo the next comparable to see if this result maintains P B By comparing Palantir s P B ratio to that of their competitors I found that Palantir has a fair value of 24 87 share which implies that there is a downside risk of 6 64 to such an investment As you have probably noticed these results are not consistent therefore I have decided to take the average result to get one final price target Average Comparable By taking the average result from the 2 comparable analyses underwent I found that Palantir has a fair value of 28 86 share which implies an overall upside of 8 36 to this investment This also implies that Palantir is in fact an undervalued growth stock that has the potential to be one of the best undervalued stocks on the market My Plan for Investing into Palantir My plan for this investment is a little different from usual I see anything between 24 87 share Fair Value of P B ratio and 28 86 share average comparable as a good chance to buy Palantir at or below its fair value This helps to limit our downside risk of this investment However I think the best way to play an investment in Palantir is over the long run 3 years I would attempt to buy in at the above prices and hold for these 3 years During this time I would re evaluate my investment with every new financial report and piece of news to decide if it is still worth holding Potential Risks to Palantir s Stock PLTR Dilution Over the past year Palantir has experienced a lot of dilution however we have already attributed a great deal of this dilution to their Direct Listing However the 20 of dilution that was not derived from the direct listing is still quite high As investors we should keep an eye on their future levels of dilution to recognize any patterns increases that we should be weary of If these levels of dilution persist potential investors may be scares off and current investor might sell their positions which will hurt the share price Financial Performance This year s financial performance was not one to be overly happy about Although they were able to increase some pretty important aspects of their balance sheet Palantir was still yet to make a profit and increased their net losses by over 100 If this poor financial performance continues and they keep digging themselves into a bigger and bigger hole investors will run away from this stock and never look back However the Q1 financial performance gives investors hope for a more profitable future which will be discussed later Bad Press Historically Palantir has not been looked at through a positive lens by many people investors and non investors alike Their first public backlash came through their involvement in deporting immigrants through Palantir s partnership with ICE https www bbc com news business 54348456 Palantir quicky spoke out against this backlash by saying ICE took advantage of their software without proper oversight and that they are looking into the issues furthermore they have since declined some potential partnerships with other border agencies to avoid further backlash There have also been numerous smaller controversies and protests that have damaged Palantir s reputation and if there are more large controversies Palantir s stock could get hurt as a result of it Potential Catalysts that can Help Palantir s Stock Price Share Buybacks Over the past year Palantir has bought back both directly and indirectly in a sense over 4 300 000 of their common shares This is good to see as an investor especially this early in the company and not too long after their Direct Listing This gives me hope that Palantir will continue to repurchase more shares in the future This will be good for the share price as it will increase the value of existing shares and it will be especially good for the stock price if they continue to buyback more shares each year Financial Performance Palantir s 2020 financial report was not favourable as discussed previously however there were definitely some good to take out of it Palantir increased their revenue gross profit and margins by a hefty amount which is good to see as an investor however there was bad aspects of this report as well that made the report unfavourable However their newly released Q1 2021 financial report has so much more to offer in terms of good aspects of a financial report Positive Press As previously mentioned Palantir has had their fair share of bad press that has had a small effect on their share price However recently Palantir has been getting better press through helping organizations like the NIH and NHS in their fight against COVID 19 and their vaccine distribution efforts Partnerships like this help to display the positive impacts that can be derived from Palantir s technology Future events where Palantir can use their software for a good cause can help to combat the negative stigma around Palantir and attract more people to invest in their company This should help their share price in the short term after these articles are released Success Stories Since Palantir have gone public they have had a few success stories come out I mentioned some of these stories throughout the article These success stories show how impactful Palantir s software can be and can show companies that they can increase revenues production etc just by using Palantir s software Any future stories like this that come out highlighting the benefits of Palantir can help the stock soar and potential clients to reach out and start business inquiries with Palantir Renewing Contracts I have mentioned that the renewal of contracts can help Palantir s share price a couple times throughout this article but why is this the case This is because these companies that are renewing have already been through Palantir s 3 stage business model and have experienced their software firsthand for numerous years After their time with Palantir s software expires they decide to renew the contract This is good because it shows that Palantir s software was effective enough to their business in the time they had it that it is worth these 5 15M contract renewals Furthermore these companies that are renewing already have underwent Palantir s installation and these clients will provide Palantir with the highest margins which will reflect well on Palantir s future financial reports New Partnerships Contracts and the expansion of commercial enterprise segment Every time that Palantir or its partners release news that they have entered into a contract agreement this will help Palantir s stock This is because Palantir needs to keep expanding their software into new companies in order to meet their expected growth projections Furthermore as more commercial enterprises try Palantir s software and hopefully enjoy it the more willing other companies might be to give Palantir a shot I see their biggest potential for growth and to become a large company in their expansion of their commercial enterprise segment through Foundry Every time Palantir gets more new clients on board it is fantastic and shows the feasibility of this segment and as more contracts role in more enterprises will take an interest Furthermore when Palantir signs these enterprises to a contract it will help to increase their revenues which will show up on their financial reports and hopefully help the to beat estimates This analysis took a long time and is one of the most comprehensive that I have seen so I would greatly appreciate if you followed me here https utradea com member

there is currently unmet demand for DRAM due to end market strength and we expect the DRAM market to remain tight into CY 22 Expect CY 21 NAND industry bit demand growth in the mid 30 range with NAND supply below demand we also see the NAND market as tight into CY 22 Long term DRAM bit demand growth CAGR of mid to high teens Long term NAND bit demand growth CAGR of approximately 30 Micron Targeting to align our long term bit supply growth CAGR with the industry bit demand growth CAGR across DRAM and NAND CY 21 DRAM and NAND Micron bit supply growth expected to be below industry demand growth Placed orders for multiple EUV tools from ASML as part of long term agreement FY21 Capex revised to somewhat above 9 5 bn mostly from areas that don t impact CY21 and CY22 bit growth such as EUV pre payments construction spending and other R amp D and corporate items Now during the call analysts seemed to really dig in deep into Sanjays comments re purchasers shifting from just in time models to just in case models They think this indicates previous purchases were above actual consumption and intended to raise inventory As such they expect weakening demand and pricing moving forward I disagree with their fears Sanjay guides in a way so that he can smash at ER He has done this for Micron and he has done with Sandisk before they got bought out at WDC Have a look at previous earnings and whether they beat or not expand table to see more dates on links below https www streetinsider com ec earnings php q sndk https www streetinsider com ec earnings php q sndk Sanjay for all

surprise so he guides low Hes also been in Semi industry forever Hes not an idiot So when he says guidance is X I take guidance to be X extra for the beat I dont freaking think I need to discount the guidance because purchasers increasing inventory Sanjay has priced that shit in So thats inventory and guidance What about the sale to Texas Instruments Thats not linked to RAM or NAND really Kinda but not really Thats them giving up on 3dx point Intel Octane There was no market for it so keeping the plant was costing them 500 mil a year since it was under utilised However they kept all the IP from Octane in case it comes back to life later on Its basically non volatile RAM which can be used as storage sounds really cool but I am guessing its expensive AF so people dont want it yet Again selling this plant is basically good for micron We want higher margins to run a slick operation I dont really like toms hardware but this article explains the sale the best Other news stories on it say there was a sale but doesnt really tell you much about about the background https www tomshardware com uk news micron to sell 3d xpoint fab to texas instruments for dollar900 million https www tomshardware com uk news micron to sell 3d xpoint fab to texas instruments for dollar900 million What is driving increasing margin Well Micron is using DUV deep ultra violet with computational lithography and multiple masks to achieve smaller resolution on DRAM Samsung are achieving same resolution with EUV EUV costs a bunch and ASML are the only supplier You should probably get into ASML at some point as well WSB but thats a post for another day As such Microns margins for latest tech DRAM is way lower than Samsung SK Hynix is the third player in RAM and they are playing catchup seem a bit fucked to me personally Nanya is the 4th player and realllllly small and think they are just screwed Dont have the money to get into EUV so next few generations they will be so far behind they just get bought out if any competition regulatory body allows it at near bankruptcy stage is my guess Now Micron is starting to invest in EUV which is good and they have given themselves a lead time for 2 years which feels about right to me In 2023 we will see if they are still at cutting edge of RAM vs Samsung who will have a 2 year head start into EUV production This is the only concern to me In this time they will gain the benefit of reduced pricing for EUV tech and additional expertise from ASML who will be helping Micron to achieve results I am hoping they can transplant their specialist know how from DUV to EUV that everyone else didnt manage to do at this resolution but at this stage my science ability is woefully unable to track it meaningfully Lets look at Microns plan for EUV and the interim releases until then https blocksandfiles com 2020 12 01 micron dram node shrink roadmap https blocksandfiles com 2020 12 01 micron dram node shrink roadmap So you can see we are currently at 1 alpha node for 10nm in 2021 We have 1 beta and 1 gamma to go planned still using DUV before 1 delta which is when EUV should kick in Thats a new node every year still using DUV Thats sweet if it works out In the interim Micron gets to print money like nobodys business higher margin from DUV and continue hiring R amp D people with EUV knowledge from Korea and Japan I have a small long position in micron I dont really care about short term price movements I expect this to be higher in 3 to 6 months Thats what I care about I expect it to be higher in 12 months Beyond that I want to see how their 1 beta and 1 gamma nodes are coming along with updates as to 1 delta using EUV We are trading at price levels from Jan Feb this year We have had 2 great ERs since then I dont see TAM in RAM or NAND dropping any time soon or pricing thesis of tacit collusion as to supply pricing in oligopolies we arent cyclical market anymore because 3 market players control like 98 of the DRAM production in the world its why they are not dumping on capex its intentional this is good price to buy but dont expect results in a week or even a month We might trade sideways for a while Shake out the paper hands before funds buy back in at discount and ramp up for next ER You cant time the ramp up you just have to be in the stock at a decent price like now and then wait for it to happen

Management Mitt Romney Bain Capital Tom Steyer Farallon Capital Paul Singer Elliott Management Foster Friess Friess Associates Donald Sussman Paloma Partners and Robert Mercer Renaissance Technologies These are just a few names on the long list of individuals who made a fortune as investors before becoming key players on America s political scene While this list includes both Democrats and Republicans survey evidence and academic research highlights some important differences between partisans in how they approach investing as well as in the returns they earn on their investments gt 66 of Republicans invest in risky assets compared to only 45 of Democrats Who Is More Likely to Invest in the Stock Market Before choosing which stocks to buy an individual must first decide whether they are willing to expose their hard earned savings to the stomach churning ups and downs of the stock market This decision to invest in the stock market is critically important for building wealth as the stock market has outperformed lower risk investments like bank savings accounts or Treasury Bills by an average of 7 per year over the last century The evidence shows that Republicans and supporters of right wing parties overseas are more likely to participate in the stock market and earn this large equity premium than Democrats and other left wing party supporters In a recent paper entitled Left Behind Presidential Cycles and Partisan Gap in Stock Market Participation https papers ssrn com sol3 papers cfm abstract id 3384406 Da Ke reports survey evidence from 1994 2016 showing that 66 of Republicans invest in risky assets compared to only 45 of Democrats Much of this gap is due to differences in other demographics but even after controlling for age gender race education income wealth etc there remains a difference of 5 5 percentage points As a result of this participation gap and how it varies over the presidential cycle the average Republican earns a higher lifetime cumulative return and accumulates wealth faster than the average Democrat Another paper entitled Stock Market Aversion Political Preferences and Stock Market Participation https www sciencedirect com science article abs pii S0304405X10002539 that was published in 2011 in the Journal of Financial Economics showed similar results in Finland with a typical left wing voter 17 20 less likely to own stocks than a typical right wing voter What explains this partisan participation gap Since one s partisan affiliation is not random it must be due to differences in attitudes or values that cause certain people to choose one party over the other One theory is that Republicans and members of other right wing parties are less risk averse than Democrats although the study from Finland attempts to control for attitudes toward risk Another explanation is that the left has been more skeptical of capitalism and big business than the right although this might be changing with the rise of right wing populism Whatever the correct explanation the partisan gap in stock market participation gives Republicans a major leg up in achieving a higher rate of return on their savings Verdict Republicans are more likely than Democrats to invest in risky assets like stocks leading to faster accumulation of wealth gt Republican managed mutual funds outperformed Democratic managed funds by an average of 0 5 per year a difference which is NOT statistically significant Who Earns Higher Returns on their Stock Portfolio One of the difficulties in comparing investment performance of different groups is that people tend to wear rose colored glasses when it comes to their own portfolio In other words self reported returns are almost always higher than true returns However there are two groups that are required to report their actual returns fund managers who are managing other people s money and members of Congress Portfolio Managers In a 2012 paper entitled Red and Blue Investing Values and Finance https www sciencedirect com science article abs pii S0304405X11000304 in the Journal of Financial Economics Harrison Hong and I compare the portfolios of mutual fund managers to learn about partisan differences in approaches to investing We categorize managers as Republicans or Democrats based on their campaign contributions which are publicly available We find that Republican managed mutual funds outperformed Democratic managed funds by an average of 0 5 per year a difference which is not statistically significant After controlling for differences in portfolio holdings characteristics such as firm size the partisan gap in returns goes away completely Thus the small difference in performance is due to Republicans extra exposure to factors rather than stock picking skills akin to the Republicans higher returns due to more stock market participation discussed above Members of Congress Members of Congress are required to report their stock trades and several papers have shown that their access to insider information shows up in higher than expected returns on those trades see graph below This provided the impetus for the passage of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge STOCK Act in 2012 which prohibited Senators and Representatives from trading on information obtained from their official positions After the passage of this law the high performance of Congressional investments has mostly gone away The evidence on which party s members are better at stock trading is more mixed In 2020 North Carolina Republican Senator Richard Burr was the target of a criminal investigation for his trading right before the start of the Covid pandemic although he was not charged Going beyond anecdotes one paper https www cambridge org core journals business and politics article abs abnormal returns from the common stock investments of members of the us house of representatives BC6C6A524BBE96738BB94D37EF0FD1A5 found that trades of Democrats in the House of Representatives significantly outperformed those of Republicans while another paper https onlinelibrary wiley com doi 10 1111 fire 12180 found that powerful Republicans achieved the highest returns These two results are not contradictory and they study different periods but overall it s hard to conclude that members of one party are better at taking advantage of their access to private information than the other Verdict No significant gap in portfolio performance gt Democrats are more attentive to whether the stocks in their portfolio are consistent with their values Whose Portfolios are More Socially Responsible In addition to comparing returns we can also examine whether there are differences in the types of companies that Democrats and Republicans choose Research shows that Democrats are more attentive to whether the stocks in their portfolio are consistent with their values In the Red and Blue Investing paper discussed earlier we also compare mutual fund allocations to politically sensitive industries such as tobacco gun manufacturing defense contractors and natural resources firms such as mining and energy Democratic fund managers significantly under weight these sectors as if they were running socially responsible mutual funds It is somewhat amusing that there are no partisan differences in portfolio weights of alcohol and casino stocks A related 2019 paper in Management Science entitled Do Politicians Put Their Money Where Their Mouth Is Ideology and Portfolio Choice https pubsonline informs org doi abs 10 1287 mnsc 2018 3175 found that more liberal members of Congress hold stocks with higher social responsibility ratings with environmental performance and employee relations being the two most important qualities Since these politicians know that their portfolio holdings are public information it s impossible to tell if they are buying these stocks for show or because they care that their portfolios align with their values Interestingly Democrats are likely sacrificing at least some returns for their values as a 2009 paper https www sciencedirect com science article abs pii S0304405X09000634 found that sin stocks have historically generated higher returns i e they are underpriced because many investors prefer to exclude them from their portfolios Verdict Democrats care more than Republicans about investing in stocks that are consistent with their values Conclusion Many models look at investors as optimizing robots or blindfolded chimpanzees but the truth is that our values and beliefs which determine our political affiliation also affect our investment decisions including decisions on which stocks to buy or whether to invest in stocks at all The evidence described above suggests that on average Republicans earn higher rates of return on their savings than Democrats It s not that Republicans have better stock picking skills but that they are more likely to invest in riskier assets like stocks which provide higher returns as compensation for higher risk and that they are less likely to avoid companies whose products are socially irresponsible As is often the case the correct approach depends on why you are investing in the first place

with a record backlog that is poised to break out once the supply chain issues are sorted out Company Overview La Z Boy is one of the world s largest residential furniture producers and have been around since 1927 They became well known after designing the reclining chair which was an instant hit and gave birth to a new generation of lazy TV junkies whose ability to communicate slowly drifted away as they did while relaxing on a soft comfy chair Since then they have expanded to manufacturing importing and selling a wide array of residential furniture including sofas loveseats chairs sectionals modulars ottomans and sleeper sofas in over 60 countries They operate through three segments The upholstery segment the Casegoods segment and the retail segment The upholstery segment is their largest segment and is responsible for manufacturing and importing furniture to sell directly to La Z Boy furniture gallery stores and other major furniture dealers The Casegoods segment imports markets and distributes casegoods wood furniture through three brands American Drew Hammary and Kincaid The retail segment sells furniture directly to the consumer through 354 company owned La Z Boy galleries and an additional 561 independent Comfort Studio locations Financials Overall La Z Boy s finances are very solid thanks to an amazing recovery year post COVID https preview redd it

operations at the beginning of 2020 due to COVID but they still did comparatively well as they are above pre COVID levels Taking a closer look we can see a few causes for concern primarily in their margins In their latest 10 K the company says In the short term the company expects a temporary negative impact to profit margins versus very strong fourth quarter results due to dramatic raw material price increases which will only be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its backlog in the back half of the year We can already see the trouble brewing as their largest segment the Wholesale segment saw their operating margin decrease from 11 1 the prior year to 10 2 in 2021 All other segments operating margins were up but expect them to decline in the short term but we ll touch on this later Comparing the Competition There are not that many publicly traded furniture manufacturers retailers with a similar market cap in the U S but here are two of their

DCF analysis over the next 6 years I get a present value of 36 88 which is inline with the current price However I believe La Z Boy s actual growth will outpace even more liberal estimates as they Successfully fill their backlog of orders Expand manufacturing capacity Continue to increase Joybird s profitability Continue their share buyback program 3 4 million shares available under current program Take advantage of positive economic and housing trends I have a 1 year price target in line with other analysts at 46 Outlook La Z Boy smashed earnings so why did the stock tank Because of foreseen supply chain issues President and CEO Melinda D Whittington said Global supply chain disruptions and headwinds related to raw materials and freight costs will cause some volatility in results She admits that profit margins will take a hit as a result and delivery times will increase due to the supply issues Fine but does that warrant a 15 dip in the stock price considering how well they performed Not in my opinion for one margin declines can be somewhat offset with price increases which I think consumers are expecting at this point anyway besides if you buy a house you HAVE to furnish it right I believe the supply chain will sort itself out sooner rather than later Almost all of their financials are up YoY dramatically and they have orders coming in non stop While the CEO didn t mention any specific details she consistently mentions record backlog throughout the latest earnings report La Z Boy is also doing what they can to increase their production capacity The CEO states The company anticipates ongoing incremental increases in manufacturing capacity throughout fiscal 2022 that will enable higher delivered sales We can see this right in their cash flow statement with 38M spent on capital expenditures for FY 21 Some other bullish highlights include The company repurchased 1 1 million shares for 44M Paid 17M in dividends Joybird an e commerce furniture retailer purchased in 2018 has become profitable The current housing boom shows no signs of slowing down and people who buy houses need furniture According to simplywall st which aggregates data from analysts the fair value for the stock is 48 72 meaning a 30 upside from the current price of 37 23 92 institutional ownership with Blackrock and Vanguard owning 16 and 10 respectively We Americans are LAZY and love sitting on comfortable things that become even more comfortable with a lazy action like pulling a lever Check out what analysts think about La Z Boy and the price targets according to marketbeat

backlog that is poised to break out once the supply chain issues are sorted out Company Overview La Z Boy is one of the world s largest residential furniture producers and have been around since 1927 They became well known after designing the reclining chair which was an instant hit and gave birth to a new generation of lazy TV junkies whose ability to communicate slowly drifted away as they did while relaxing on a soft comfy chair Since then they have expanded to manufacturing importing and selling a wide array of residential furniture including sofas loveseats chairs sectionals modulars ottomans and sleeper sofas in over 60 countries They operate through three segments The upholstery segment the Casegoods segment and the retail segment The upholstery segment is their largest segment and is responsible for manufacturing and importing furniture to sell directly to La Z Boy furniture gallery stores and other major furniture dealers The Casegoods segment imports markets and distributes casegoods wood furniture through three brands American Drew Hammary and Kincaid The retail segment sells furniture directly to the consumer through 354 company owned La Z Boy galleries and an additional 561 independent Comfort Studio locations Financials Overall La Z Boy s finances are very solid thanks to an amazing recovery year post COVID Financial changes YoY https preview redd it

operations at the beginning of 2020 due to COVID but they still did comparatively well as they are above pre COVID levels Taking a closer look we can see a few causes for concern primarily in their margins In their latest 10 K the company says In the short term the company expects a temporary negative impact to profit margins versus very strong fourth quarter results due to dramatic raw material price increases which will only be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its backlog in the back half of the year We can already see the trouble brewing as their largest segment the Wholesale segment saw their operating margin decrease from 11 1 the prior year to 10 2 in 2021 All other segments operating margins were up but expect them to decline in the short term but we ll touch on this later Comparing the Competition There are not that many publicly traded furniture manufacturers retailers with a similar market cap in the U S but here are two of their

DCF analysis over the next 6 years I get a present value of 36 88 which is in line with the current price However I believe La Z Boy s actual growth will outpace even more liberal estimates as they Successfully fill their backlog of orders Expand manufacturing capacity Continue to increase Joybird s profitability Continue their share buyback program 3 4 million shares available under current program Take advantage of positive economic and housing trends I have a 1 year price target in line with other analysts at 46 Outlook La Z Boy smashed earnings so why did the stock tank Because of foreseen supply chain issues President and CEO Melinda D Whittington said Global supply chain disruptions and headwinds related to raw materials and freight costs will cause some volatility in results She admits that profit margins will take a hit as a result and delivery times will increase due to the supply issues Fine but does that warrant a 15 dip in the stock price considering how well they performed Not in my opinion for one margin declines can be somewhat offset with price increases which I think consumers are expecting at this point anyway besides if you buy a house you HAVE to furnish it right I believe the supply chain will sort itself out sooner rather than later Almost all of their financials are up YoY dramatically and they have orders coming in non stop While the CEO didn t mention any specific details she consistently mentions record backlog throughout the latest earnings report La Z Boy is also doing what they can to increase their production capacity The CEO states The company anticipates ongoing incremental increases in manufacturing capacity throughout fiscal 2022 that will enable higher delivered sales We can see this right in their cash flow statement with 38M spent on capital expenditures for FY 21 Some other bullish highlights include The company repurchased 1 1 million shares for 44M Paid 17M in dividends Joybird an e commerce furniture retailer purchased in 2018 has become profitable The current housing boom shows no signs of slowing down and people who buy houses need furniture According to simplywallst which aggregates data from analysts the fair value for the stock is 48 72 meaning a 30 upside from the current price of 37 23 92 institutional ownership with Blackrock and Vanguard owning 16 and 10 respectively We Americans are LAZY and

posted any due diligence and this is my first ever post on reddit ever I Decided to do CLOV for the lolz Please enjoy and let me know any ways to improve my current findings Introduction Clover Health Investments Corp operates as a Medicare Advantage insurer in the United States The company through its software platform provides preferred provider organization and health maintenance organization health plans for Medicare eligible consumers Clover Health Investments Corp was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Franklin Tennessee Clover Health has shown greater signs of revenue improvement over the past 5 years and is approaching a positive figure on the income statement The company puts heavy emphasis on health outcomes as well as competitive pricing that seems to make the company stand out among the competition CLOV caught my eye about a week and a half now I have been researching and analyzing the company over the past week and compiling this document the last few days This analysis is an evolving document depending on research that I have compiled from various sources My initial examination will focus mainly on the financial statements and not on technical analysis although if you have some good information where an aspiring Finance student can obtain the info please let me know This is not financial advice I do this for fun and to get better at security analysis I m here to help you understand the risks This is extracurricular for me and I m just sharing my information for further advice and guidance Overview Clover Health is not without its risk but I will be dividing the analysis into two parts The Good and The Bad The first part The Good will point out bullish sentiments of the financial statement This information is completely up to you if you wish to use as THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE but a research project The second part will include The Bad part of the financial statements or the risks associated with the stock This will be my bear case of the stock and I do this to bring more conversation into the future of the stock My information is all sourced from either the 10k of Clover Health Investments I will not be doing technical analysis on the stock prices themselves because honestly I don t have enough experience to legitimize my analysis It s extensive and something I don t know how to do with confidence I eat crayons Well anyway with introductions out of the way let s get into it The Good Bullish Signals Balance sheet The company itself has seen explosive growth just over the past 7 months The asset growth has seen an increase of 224 31 since last December This is impressive especially when we look at the 35 65 decrease in Total Liabilities within those 6 months These two corresponding changes in their 12k is a definite head turner as the company has seemed to be able to sustain this growth spurt without having to take out little to any debt Breaking down these assets even further will unveil a steady accumulation in Investments Debt Securities and Other Investments Short Term I mean Further Investments has increased 280 million dollars which is great sign for future revenue Although amortized the Debt Securities will lose value due to interest payments over the years I don t believe this to be super alarming as this method is completely normal and the Investment in Debt Securities doesn t have a huge amount in it On the other hand The Short term Investments has been increased by a HUGE amount since 12 31 20 We re talking 6 707 increase in 6 months and has a chance to return some real revenue from investments upon maturity This 279 1 million could have a real turn around and should be considered while anticipating future cash flows The company is 47 debt to equity and with that 35 decrease in liabilities since 12 31 20 shows that Clover Health can pay off its debt quickly I am a huge advocate for companies to reduce their liabilities to improve investor sentiment Going even further the current ratio of Clover Health is x5 51 which means they can pay off their debt easily Income Statement I have a mixed opinion upon the income statement but I will do my best to keep on track with the Bullish sentiments With the business itself seeing an increase of 32 44 net income from Mar 31 2021 from Dec 31 2018 we see a steady increase in business and an increasingly bullish sign year after year This is just the beginning as the total revenue has increased 156 44 since 2018 The company itself is seeing many growth patterns that signify this Clover Health should be seeing an increase in stock price for years to come if future stock price reflects the increase in revenue Another great thing about Clover Health is that they are constantly working on new ways to get service to their customers and using systems that cut down expenses This correlation into the earnings per share has given the EPS a boost of 34 89 since 2018 These bullish signs are great signals for growth while we anticipate future earnings The revenue increase will be something needing to be focused on heavily from now until Q4 2021 and into the next year If they keep shrinking their expenses with newer technology then there is no doubt in my mind that the company will outperform the market in the years to come While analyzing the Net income over the past 3 years it seems that last year 2020 was Clover Health s best year I believe that Covid helped expose Clover Health to the older generation and was able to utilize remote patient visits to secure these older generations did not get into contact with anyone This sudden increase of revenue from 2019 2020 signals that increase of consumer base Average increase of revenue per year is 204 5 Million and has been sustaining itself over the past 3 year These constant trends really solidify long term growth potential in Clover Health Statement of Cash Flows Statement of cash flows always is a great indicator of management decisions and to see Clover Health s is impressive With 274 9 Million bought in securities this year and 17 Million made from AFS securities I see management is making some bold moves The company itself is making decisions that will benefit later growth and has set itself up a very health financial moat Planting seeds to sow in the future by attaining investment assets These signs give me hope the company will continue to grow at a consistent rate year after year If the securities pay off then Clover health will take off and we could be seeing the start of a great bull run The bad Clover Health investments has been taking bold moves over the past few years and has set itself up to grow steadily over the next few years If management continues to make decisions to shrink Policy Expenses the company will really be looking great for future net income Unfortunately no company is perfect and I must include the risks within my analysis These risks give me a better insight into the future of the company and some hiccups to look for This also helps me analyze future events to see if a Catalyst event occurs and we see explosive growth or decline These are a few of the issues I have found with investing into the company 1 P B RATIO IS 8 83X The stock appears to be priced well but isn t a fundamental value investor play Usually what I look for while value investing is to look for a P B ratio that is less that 3x the book value of the stock What does this mean Stock is issued at a certain price from the underwriters of the stock issuers usually big banks This price effects equity but more importantly helps raise additional equity in the Paid in capital in excess to par account on the financial statements In my opinion this number is relatively still low for what it should be fair price value is lt 4 33 and is trading at 12 97 as of 6 26 2021 2 Negative Net Income The negative net income is a giant signal that the company is bleeding money and still not profitable Although this is the bad section of the analysis I just want to remind the reader that there has been an increase in both equity and revenue stream over the past years so unless management really poops the bed then I don t think this should be the biggest issue while investing but there is still huge risk This is something to keep an eye on in the future as the stock can go through a correcting and this will really drag the price down If you have long term vision within the company then just buy the dip If not you might want to consider the volatility of this stock before sticking your money into CLOV Remember don t invest anything you re not willing to part with the stock market is a risky place This negative net income directly corresponds with earnings per share so if earnings are negative then earnings per share is also negative and raises risk 3 94 increase in operating expenses Policy Benefits increased by 136 Mar 31 2021 over Dec 31 2018 I ve been researching this company for a week so far and this is just the beginning of my due diligence into the stock but I may need help on this one to clear up what this account exactly is Under my google searches it seems that this has to do with life insurance The expenses here seem to be coverage of actual life insurance policy benefits These expenses have jumped considerately but it seems to me that they did so because you re also seeing a raise in revenue streams and is in place due to customer healthcare plans The expenses seem a bit excessive and if the company itself can mitigate operation costs better then Clover Health has a real chance of explosive growth I would like to see this part of the Cash Flows be worked on but I don t have enough experience in healthcare I m still researching into the sector because I think there s immense amount of opportunity into it If anyone with more experience here please let me know and I will add it to my due diligence report Conclusion and my opinion Clover Health has the set up for a beautiful long term investment strategy With year after year of major revenue growth and a strong adaptation to remote healthcare they have stood the test of Covid and now position themselves into the future I am buying this stock after this analysis with a target rate of at least 20 over the next year I have already bought a small amount and will be buying more as time goes on buying the dip and buying bigger and bigger if the price point keeps getting closer and closer to 4 22 There is a huge short interest percentage on the stock itself I don t have the numbers but see dozens of posts about it and this wasn t included upon this analysis or buying selling schedule This isn t a short term play for me but I will adapt if need be The plan will be to buy the dips along a 1 3 year period hold and accumulate and hopefully be selling in a 5 8 year period This again is just my opinion as there is so much more to review with Clover Health This is the first step in my

REIT that owns and leases a flurry of gambling centric properties They were originally spun off from Caesar s in an effort to reduce taxes and got their start buying Caesar s Harrah s Las Vegas property for 1 1B and leasing it back to them for 87 5M per year in 2017 The next few years they went on a buying spree loading up on casinos and racetracks often below replacement cost while leasing them back to operators at a substantial yearly rake In 4 short years they went from their first 1 1B property to now holding over 17B in assets with a take of 374M in gross revs Thesis VICI s short life so far has yielded extremely aggressive acquisitions and expansions Their double digit YoY increases on net revenues has had a strong upward pressure on their dividend yield of which they are bound to give 90 away because of their REIT status This increase has historically been met with a matching upward pressure in their underlying share price VICI has recently acquired The Venetian and increased their revenues over the pandemic My hypothesis is that their normal business operations will significantly increase their dividend by 0 06 to 0 09 per share per quarter combined with a Venetian upshot These combined will push prices up to the mid 40 s by Jan of 2022 Research Financials VICI swings 17B in assets with 7 4B in liabilities This debt load is best in class for a gaming centric REIT For comparison we can look at MGM ticker MGP which has 10B in assets for 4B in liabilities or Gaming amp Leisure Properties ticker GLPI which has 9B in assets and 6 3B in debt As a REIT VICI utilizes the AFFO Adjusted Funds From Operations metric as their primary measure of cash ingress There s a strong correlation between their AFFO share and their distribution of dividends since they are bound to give most of their cash away As of Q1 2021 they announced that AFFO per share increased 23 7 to 0 47 for the quarter more on AFFO and what it means for us later Analyst Coverage

LVS LVS all of the land and real estate assets associated with the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center located in Las Vegas Nevada collectively the Venetian Resort for 4 0 billion in cash representing a 6 25 cap rate An affiliate of certain funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management Inc the Apollo Funds has agreed to acquire the operating assets of the Venetian Resort for 2 25 billion subject to customary closing conditions Simultaneous with the closing of the transaction the Company will enter into a triple net lease agreement for the Venetian Resort with an affiliate of the Apollo Funds The lease will have an initial total annual rent of 250 0 million and an initial term of 30 years with two ten year tenant renewal options LVS has agreed with the tenant to provide lease payment support designed to guarantee the tenant s rent obligations under the lease through 2023 with early termination of such lease payment support if the tenant achieves a certain 3financial milestone or a tenant change of control occurs The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed by year end 2021 In summary they bought the Venetian for 4B in cash sold the operating rights for 2 25B and then charged the operator on a triple net lease 250M per year Genius Including the proceeds from the operating rights that they sold back to the operator this property is pushing a 14 cap rate Holding Acquisitions vs Dividend Yield vs Share Price Dividends We can see here that we got a

closing of the transaction we entered into a master triple net lease agreement for JACK Cleveland Casino and JACK Thistledown Racino with subsidiaries of JACK Entertainment We funded the transaction using a mix of cash on hand and a portion of the proceeds raised in our November 2019 senior unsecured notes offering The master lease has an initial total annual rent of 65 9 million and an initial term of 15 years with four five year tenant renewal options The tenant s obligations under the lease are guaranteed by Rock Ohio Ventures LLC Rock Ohio Ventures Additionally we made a 50 0 million loan to affiliates of Rock Ohio Ventures secured by among other things certain non gaming real estate assets owned by such affiliates and guaranteed by Rock Ohio Ventures The loan bears interest at 9 0 per annum for a period of five years with two one year extension options On July 20 2020 the Company announced the completion of the transactions contemplated in the Master Transaction Agreement with Caesars Entertainment Inc Caesars formerly known as Eldorado Resorts Inc or Eldorado in connection with Eldorado s acquisition of Caesars Entertainment Corporation originally announced on June 24 2019 Per the terms of the Master Transaction Agreement VICI Properties acquired the land and real estate assets associated with Harrah s New Orleans Harrah s Laughlin and Harrah s Atlantic City and modified certain provisions of the Caesars lease agreements for total consideration of approximately 3 2 billion in cash Combined rent under the Las Vegas Master Lease and Regional Master Lease between VICI Properties and Caesars increased 252 5 million per annum Price Interaction on Div Increases As we get dividend increases in September and my play is based on LEAPs that expire Friday of Jan I m going to be measuring Price Increase by the 3rd Friday of Jan after div increase vs VNQ the Vanguard Real Estate ETF VICI 9 28 2018 1 18 2019 21 62 gt 21 11 2 36 VNQ 9 28 2018 1 18 2019 80 68

see a general out performance of VNQ during this highlighted play period post dividend increase Estimating the new dividend The primary properties that determine the new dividend is 1 the fact that the REIT is required to give out 90 of taxable income 2 Taxable income 3 Future increases in taxable income from new business For 2018 Q1 AFFO Adjusted Funds from Operation aka VICI s preferred measure instead of EBITDA of 0 36 per diluted share Established dividend started at 0 16 and ramped up to 0 2875 by Q4 For 2019 Q1 AFFO per share 0 37 Increased quarterly cash dividend by 3 48 to 0 2975 in Q4 For 2020 Q1 AFFO per share 0 38 Increased quarterly cash dividend by 10 9 to 0 33 in Q4 For 2021 so far AFFO per share increased 23 7 to 0 47 so far for Q1 We have a fat acquisition of The Venetian incoming The Company estimates AFFO for the year ending December 31 2021 will be between 1 010 0 million and 1 035 0 million or between 1 82 and 1 87 per diluted share about 0 45 to 0 47 share quarter We can see a high correlation between AFFO and dividend output where they try to stick as close to AFFO without going over Now we increased AFFO by 9 cents and we haven t even gotten the Venetian yet The company itself believes that it s first quarter results are going to be about the same for the rest of the year I m estimating a 0 06 0 09 18 27 increase in div yield and higher if they manage to close the Venetian early Technicals amp x200B https preview redd it xvuxxibdkn871 jpg width 4272 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s ba632093f52e4d7f28d66682ef2ab9771bdeae0e The grey boxes drawn highlight bounces off of the 100SMA on the daily candles I consider this rock solid support and I believe we are unlikely to breach below this short of a market downturn Extending the 100SMA yields a LOWER bound price target of 33 91 by September and about 38 65ish by the middle of Jan Risks Besides the generic risk of securities the fact that VICI is a REIT bears the extra burden that REIT s are considered less attractive than growth stocks during bull runs As we get into a reopening phase AND with the backing of the Fed AND the tail winds of inflation pushing up asset prices REIT s might suffer more than usual Safeguards VICI s business model has no interest in the actual operation of these properties and simply seeks to collect rent from the property itself The transactions often involve getting a discount on the property by selling back the operating rights of the subject property to the original sellers This has the dual effect of lessening their net cost while also making sure that they are renting to someone that just got a fresh infusion of cash This model proved to be COVID resistant and will likely be resistant to any potential future shutdowns from new variants Play Summary I believe the dividend yield is going to be closer to the top end of the estimate which gives us just under a 1 3 increase Given current price previous reactions to dividend yield increases and the lower bound from technicals pushing us above 38 65 I m estimating price in the mid 40 s by Jan 2022 hence my Jan 2022 40 strike calls But what do I know I just draw lines on charts to feel smart

rates may have been by design and is probably transitory,This article first appeared on SchiffGold on Monday https schiffgold com exploring finance the fed in a box part 2 they cannot end quantitative easing https schiffgold com exploring finance the fed in a box part 2 they cannot end quantitative easing It also appeared on zero hedge this morning 3 Key Takeaways 1 If the Fed tapers QE it may reveal waning appetite for long term treasuries 2 The Treasury may have used its cash balance reserve to anchor inflation expectations 3 If inflation persists the Fed may have to increase rather than decrease QE Note By definition inflation is an expansion of the money supply In this article inflation will be used interchangeably with rising prices usually as a result of money supply expansion Introduction When the economy was shut down in March 2020 the government responded with massive fiscal and monetary support The fiscal stimulus totaled 4T in relief packages All of this spending was paid for with debt being issued by the Treasury The Treasury mostly issued short term debt With rates being held at zero by the Fed and strong demand for short term debt it made sense to quickly raise cash using Treasury Bills as interest free loans The Fed monetary policy was two fold slash short term rates to zero and inject 1 5 trillion into the long term debt treasury market The effect was to bring down interest rates across the entire yield curve After the initial debt binge QE changed to auto pilot buying about 80B a month in long term debt plus another 40B in Mortgage debt Over the last year the Treasury has continued to issue long term debt averaging more than the 80B the Fed has been buying This has caused long term rates to rise All of this fiscal and monetary stimulus is not without cost Historically this type of activity almost always leads to higher inflation The Fed may have recently indicated they want higher inflation but this is not true This stance simply provides cover for them to not act in the face of rising prices To actually fight inflation the Fed would have to increase short term rates above the rate of inflation Part 1 https schiffgold com exploring finance the fed in a box part 1 of this series went into detail about how US short term debt has doubled from 2 5T to 4 5T This makes even small changes in short term rates an immediate risk to the federal government not to mention the much higher rates needed in a true inflation fight In theory the Fed could leave short term rates at 0 but end QE and even shrink its balance sheet pushing long term rates up to combat inflation In the short medium term the Treasury can mathematically handle higher long term rates because it takes time for the higher rates to work its way through long term debt See the chart below that shows how the last tightening cycle worked its way through the average interest rate across debt instrument Specifically look at Notes compared to Bills The average weighted interest rate on Bills moved very quickly where the rate on Notes barely had time to increase before rates dropped again amp x200B Figure 1 Source Treasurydirect gov https preview redd it ybpclrezrn871 png width 4000 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 9ceb2ff7480cce2ee3ba1651d9049259f95098a7 Although the Treasury could handle rising long term rates even if the economy and mortgage market cannot the Fed has another problem Rising long term rates send an important message rising inflation expectations While inflation is first and foremost a result of monetary policy higher inflation expectations quickly exacerbate the problem This is why the Fed has been messaging they are okay with higher inflation and also why they have been pounding the table that inflation is transitory They need to keep inflation expectations low If inflation expectations were to rise especially at this critical juncture it would be game over for the Fed as they would have to raise short term rates devastating the Treasury and economy in order to save the dollar and squash inflation With the economy opening up in March of this year things were getting very precarious as inflation was rapidly rising along with surging long term rates Remember that rising long term rates indicate rising inflation expectations This could cause transitory inflation to be much less transitory In summer 2020 the Treasury issued enough debt to build up a significant cash reserve In response to rising long term rates in Q1 2021 it appears the Treasury strategically used its cash reserves to slow down the issuance of long term debt With total short term debt outstanding already so high the cash balance gave the Treasury ammunition to decrease debt issuance just as a 1 9T stimulus bill was passed and inflation was set to explode higher This would have been perfect timing to support the Feds narrative that inflation is transitory to keep expectations from snowballing out of control If inflation doesn t slow in the coming months the Fed may be forced to step in With the Treasury poised to issue more debt it can no longer rely on its one time use of excess cash reserves This will put more pressure on the Fed to clamp down long term rates by increasing rather than decreasing QE Yes the Fed may decide to print more money leading to higher prices to fight rising inflation expectations higher long term interest rates Understanding recent fiscal and monetary maneuvers Last year when the pandemic hit the US Government started spending Trillions of dollars Massive spending plans were approved in the name of stimulus and Covid relief Because the Government does not have much money on hand and taxes cannot quickly be raised the Treasury issued trillions in debt The markets can easily absorb short term US Treasury Bills so when the Fed abruptly cut rates to 0 the Treasury responded by issuing short term debt to the tune of 2 4T from March to June 2020 See figure 1 below amp

trillions of dollars in US Debt but the Fed was buying on the long end of the curve while the Treasury was issuing debt on the short end This caused long term rates to collapse The Fed purchased enough long term debt to absorb more than a years worth of long term debt issuance The chart below shows how the month over month and cumulative change in the Feds balance sheet compared to the

Fed Buying and Treasury issuance of long term debt for each individual month since Jan 2020 These values are not cumulative The right Y Axis shows the the month end interest rate of the 10 year bond

be seen as interest rates fell from 1 5 to 6 during the initial buying spree After the initial burst the Fed put QE on auto pilot buying only 80B a month in long term treasuries However because the Treasury was issuing more than 80B a month as depicted by the positive bars starting in June 2020 interest rates started rising This trend started to accelerate in November of 2020 as long term debt issuance was outpacing Fed Buying by around 200B Things really started to escalate in the first quarter of 2021 as Treasury Debt issuance surpassed Fed buying by 286B in March right as interest rates were crossing above 1 7 Then suddenly long term debt issuance started falling in April and was almost even with Fed buying in May This consequently led to a fall in long term rates which are now hovering back around 1 5 How did this happen just as Biden was pushing through a 1 9T stimulus package Unlike 2020 when short term debt issuance was used to plug the gap Figure 1 above shows that Short Term debt issuance was actually turning negative blue bars What gives One look at the Treasury Cash Balance sheet in the chart below tells almost the entire story This was first highlighted by a SchiffGold article https schiffgold com commentaries why are us treasury bond sales are about to spike published June 16 The chart below shows a massive surge in Cash reserves by the treasury last year Since March of this year the cash balance has plummeted by over 1T amp x200B Figure 5 Source Treasurydirect gov https preview redd it r9lgft9asn871 png width 4000 amp format png amp auto webp amp s dcca55babdd806926c9f16992667df9065bc1729 Inflation Expectations Why such a massive and sudden draw down in the cash balance In truth there could be lots of reasons but it does seem extremely sudden One would think the Treasury led by Yellen would be very deliberate and thoughtful about how to use up 1T in dry powder For the past 3 months the Fed has been shouting from the rooftops that inflation is transitory At the June FOMC press conference Powell stood up and explained how long term inflation expectations remain well anchored A proxy for inflation expecations is long term interest rates Had interest rates continued to rise similar to the recent trajectory climbing from 8 in Nov to 1 7 in March this would have been a difficult narrative to push The Fed needs inflation expectations to remain in check or else inflation will be anything but transitory Thus the perfect time for the Treasury to pause issuance of long term debt would be April June 2021 just as the economy is re opening and the Fed is forecasting inflation to be at its worst before coming back down While this is speculation it would be a very strategic move from both Powell and Yellen Regardless of the intention though the problem is that the Treasury has now spent its large cash balance It could return to the short term debt market but the outstanding balance is still sitting above 4T see part 1 https schiffgold com exploring finance the fed in a box part 1 It needs to be converting that short term debt to long term debt while long term interest rates are still low and the Fed is still buying But the Fed is simply not buying enough at 80B to convert all that debt If inflation persists beyond a few months then interest rates are going to rise in a hurry as the market demands higher rates Adding fuel to the fire will be the Treasury debt issuance overwhelming the 80B Fed buying as it did from November to March Then what Who is absorbing the long term debt to keep interest rates from returning to the upward trajectory from Aug 2020 Mar 2021 International creditors have had little appetite for US Debt lately The chart below shows the total outstanding debt held by foreign governments In the past 15 months while the Treasury has issued over 4T in new debt the net amount bought by foreign governments is close to zero amp x200B Figure 6 Source https ticdata treasury gov Publish mfh txt

will have to issue more than 80B in long term debt to continue funding all the massive spending If inflation expectations stay low maybe the market will have enough firepower to ingest some of the new debt but not all of it With the Fed planning to begin tapering at the end of the year someone will need to fill the void of 80B This does not even consider the possibility of shrinking the Fed balance sheet which should be considered impossible at this point The chart of the international holders above brings to mind the image of the Wiley Coyote running off a cliff With 10 year interest rates hovering near 1 5 one could argue there is strong demand for long term Treasury debt Unfortunately foreign creditors have turned off their debt purchases It took decades for them to accumulate 7T in Treasury debt The Fed alone has accumulated more than half that 4 5T over the last decade The Fed is making the market seem strong but as shown above there might be nothing but air if they were to exit the market With a thumb on the scale no one is getting an accurate reading of true demand for US long term debt Figure 8 Source Warner Brothers https preview redd it 08jw2u3jsn871 png width 700

This makes sense as T Bills mature in less than a year so these investments are perceived as nearly risk free In fact it could be argued that the recent Treasury Bill issuance hiatus Figure 1 blue bars turning negative could be causing the stress in the Reverse Repo market The chart below shows the current Reverse Repo market Based on past quarter end data it s very possible that Reverse Repos could exceed 1 5T by this coming Wednesday June 30th before coming back down amp x200B Figure 9 Source https fred stlouisfed org series RRPONTSYD https preview redd it qfjcv8olsn871 png width 4000 amp format png amp auto webp amp s aeab7d71e0b13b6363a48b9f51359d3c416390dd Many articles have been written to explain this phenomenon without providing exact clarity on what s actually going on The current understanding seems to be that the banks are awash with cash So much cash they are hitting the limits in terms of how much cash they can hold on balance overnight This is cash that should be invested on behalf of money market funds but with so much cash in the system if it were to all be invested in short term debt instruments it could drive rates negative To avoid negative rates the Fed is lending banks assets on its balance sheet overnight in exchange for cash It is critical to avoid negative rates to ensure money market funds never experience a loss and result in breaking the buck https www investopedia com terms b breaking the buck asp Maybe this is a leap too far but it seems another solution to the Fed reverse repurchase activity could be for the Treasury to issue more short term debt So why has the Treasury been drawing down its cash balance and letting short term debt mature when there seems to be strong demand in the market The Treasury must recognize the risk in having too much debt in short term instruments and is trying to lengthen the duration of its debt outstanding Unfortunately this abundance of cash in the repo market is in search of low risk short term debt so will not provide demand for long term debt If this is the case it has created quite the pickle for the Treasury By issuing too much short term debt the Treasury is by default putting pressure on the Fed to not raise short term interest rates However by issuing too much long term debt the Treasury is by default putting pressure on the Fed to maintain or even increase Quantitative Easing To reiterate this is why it is imperative the market believes inflation is transitory The Treasury cannot stop issuing debt which leaves the Fed unable to raise rates or taper QE without wreaking havoc in the bond market Additionally if the Fed has to fight inflation then it s not just the Treasury facing its Wiley Coyote moment but the entire US economy Wrapping up With the economy reopening the treasury deployed its cash balance at the most opportune time unless of course inflation numbers continue to increase which based on all the data anecdotal evidence and liquidity in the repo market seems like a strong possibility Unfortunately for the Fed the Treasury will have to begin re issuing debt again Will it lean towards short term debt hoping the Fed keeps interest rates low or long term debt hoping the Fed will expand QE The Fed may be constrained either way because it has its own problem though Powell must be praying that inflation readings come in low AND job numbers disappoint If both don t occur then tough questions will be asked to justify more stimulus Yellen and Powell may be best buds but simple coordination will not be enough They will need magic and luck to keep the course steady heading into 2H 2021 and 2022 If the Fed is lucky enough to get low inflation readings out of its rigged CPI it may provide cover to begin tapering Rising long term rates won t have the same compounding effect on inflation expectations in a low inflation environment Unfortunately though long terms rates will not be tenable over the medium term as the government has to finance more and more debt As the market this year has indicated when issuance surpasses Fed buying rates have gone up So what happens to rates when the Fed leaves the market entirely Presumably they go up a lot How high will the Fed let rates go before re entering Just because something is inevitable US Debt spiral does not make it imminent however the next six months of data may shine a bright light on all the irresponsibility over the last 12 years if inflation proves not so transitory Chances are the only thing transitory will be talking about talking about tapering US Debt interactive

rates may have been by design and is probably transitory,This article first appeared on SchiffGold on Monday and also appeared on ZeroHedge this morning 3 Key Takeaways 1 If the Fed tapers QE it may reveal waning appetite for long term treasuries 2 The Treasury may have used its cash balance reserve to anchor inflation expectations 3 If inflation persists the Fed may have to increase rather than decrease QE Note By definition inflation is an expansion of the money supply In this article inflation will be used interchangeably with rising prices usually as a result of money supply expansion Introduction When the economy was shut down in March 2020 the government responded with massive fiscal and monetary support The fiscal stimulus totaled 4T in relief packages All of this spending was paid for with debt being issued by the Treasury The Treasury mostly issued short term debt With rates being held at zero by the Fed and strong demand for short term debt it made sense to quickly raise cash using Treasury Bills as interest free loans The Fed monetary policy was two fold slash short term rates to zero and inject 1 5 trillion into the long term debt treasury market The effect was to bring down interest rates across the entire yield curve After the initial debt binge QE changed to auto pilot buying about 80B a month in long term debt plus another 40B in Mortgage debt Over the last year the Treasury has continued to issue long term debt averaging more than the 80B the Fed has been buying This has caused long term rates to rise All of this fiscal and monetary stimulus is not without cost Historically this type of activity almost always leads to higher inflation The Fed may have recently indicated they want higher inflation but this is not true This stance simply provides cover for them to not act in the face of rising prices To actually fight inflation the Fed would have to increase short term rates above the rate of inflation Part 1 https schiffgold com exploring finance the fed in a box part 1 of this series went into detail about how US short term debt has doubled from 2 5T to 4 5T This makes even small changes in short term rates an immediate risk to the federal government not to mention the much higher rates needed in a true inflation fight In theory the Fed could leave short term rates at 0 but end QE and even shrink its balance sheet pushing long term rates up to combat inflation In the short medium term the Treasury can mathematically handle higher long term rates because it takes time for the higher rates to work its way through long term debt See the chart below that shows how the last tightening cycle worked its way through the average interest rate across debt instrument Specifically look at Notes compared to Bills The average weighted interest rate on Bills moved very quickly where the rate on Notes barely had time to increase before rates dropped again amp x200B Figure 1 Source Treasurydirect gov https preview redd it y67gsfsntn871 png width 4000 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 03abb3684cd9e77a39a9b9a8d66aed14eeb5de4b Although the Treasury could handle rising long term rates even if the economy and mortgage market cannot the Fed has another problem Rising long term rates send an important message rising inflation expectations While inflation is first and foremost a result of monetary policy higher inflation expectations quickly exacerbate the problem This is why the Fed has been messaging they are okay with higher inflation and also why they have been pounding the table that inflation is transitory They need to keep inflation expectations low If inflation expectations were to rise especially at this critical juncture it would be game over for the Fed as they would have to raise short term rates devastating the Treasury and economy in order to save the dollar and squash inflation With the economy opening up in March of this year things were getting very precarious as inflation was rapidly rising along with surging long term rates Remember that rising long term rates indicate rising inflation expectations This could cause transitory inflation to be much less transitory In summer 2020 the Treasury issued enough debt to build up a significant cash reserve In response to rising long term rates in Q1 2021 it appears the Treasury strategically used its cash reserves to slow down the issuance of long term debt With total short term debt outstanding already so high the cash balance gave the Treasury ammunition to decrease debt issuance just as a 1 9T stimulus bill was passed and inflation was set to explode higher This would have been perfect timing to support the Feds narrative that inflation is transitory to keep expectations from snowballing out of control If inflation doesn t slow in the coming months the Fed may be forced to step in With the Treasury poised to issue more debt it can no longer rely on its one time use of excess cash reserves This will put more pressure on the Fed to clamp down long term rates by increasing rather than decreasing QE Yes the Fed may decide to print more money leading to higher prices to fight rising inflation expectations higher long term interest rates Understanding recent fiscal and monetary maneuvers Last year when the pandemic hit the US Government started spending Trillions of dollars Massive spending plans were approved in the name of stimulus and Covid relief Because the Government does not have much money on hand and taxes cannot quickly be raised the Treasury issued trillions in debt The markets can easily absorb short term US Treasury Bills so when the Fed abruptly cut rates to 0 the Treasury responded by issuing short term debt to the tune of 2 4T from March to June 2020 See figure 1 below amp

trillions of dollars in US Debt but the Fed was buying on the long end of the curve while the Treasury was issuing debt on the short end This caused long term rates to collapse The Fed purchased enough long term debt to absorb more than a years worth of long term debt issuance The chart below shows how the month over month and cumulative change in the Feds balance sheet compared to the

be seen as interest rates fell from 1 5 to 6 during the initial buying spree After the initial burst the Fed put QE on auto pilot buying only 80B a month in long term treasuries However because the Treasury was issuing more than 80B a month as depicted by the positive bars starting in June 2020 interest rates started rising This trend started to accelerate in November of 2020 as long term debt issuance was outpacing Fed Buying by around 200B Things really started to escalate in the first quarter of 2021 as Treasury Debt issuance surpassed Fed buying by 286B in March right as interest rates were crossing above 1 7 Then suddenly long term debt issuance started falling in April and was almost even with Fed buying in May This consequently led to a fall in long term rates which are now hovering back around 1 5 How did this happen just as Biden was pushing through a 1 9T stimulus package Unlike 2020 when short term debt issuance was used to plug the gap Figure 1 above shows that Short Term debt issuance was actually turning negative blue bars What gives One look at the Treasury Cash Balance sheet in the chart below tells almost the entire story This was first highlighted by a SchiffGold article https schiffgold com commentaries why are us treasury bond sales are about to spike published June 16 The chart below shows a massive surge in Cash reserves by the treasury last year Since March of this year the cash balance has plummeted by over 1T amp x200B Figure 5 Source Treasurydirect gov https preview redd it stucdov9un871 png width 4000 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 44c7ce2c570ed26e4db39863bf1cfd6a2d5f3bdc Inflation Expectations Why such a massive and sudden draw down in the cash balance In truth there could be lots of reasons but it does seem extremely sudden One would think the Treasury led by Yellen would be very deliberate and thoughtful about how to use up 1T in dry powder For the past 3 months the Fed has been shouting from the rooftops that inflation is transitory At the June FOMC press conference Powell stood up and explained how long term inflation expectations remain well anchored A proxy for inflation expecations is long term interest rates Had interest rates continued to rise similar to the recent trajectory climbing from 8 in Nov to 1 7 in March this would have been a difficult narrative to push The Fed needs inflation expectations to remain in check or else inflation will be anything but transitory Thus the perfect time for the Treasury to pause issuance of long term debt would be April June 2021 just as the economy is re opening and the Fed is forecasting inflation to be at its worst before coming back down While this is speculation it would be a very strategic move from both Powell and Yellen Regardless of the intention though the problem is that the Treasury has now spent its large cash balance It could return to the short term debt market but the outstanding balance is still sitting above 4T see part 1 https schiffgold com exploring finance the fed in a box part 1 It needs to be converting that short term debt to long term debt while long term interest rates are still low and the Fed is still buying But the Fed is simply not buying enough at 80B to convert all that debt If inflation persists beyond a few months then interest rates are going to rise in a hurry as the market demands higher rates Adding fuel to the fire will be the Treasury debt issuance overwhelming the 80B Fed buying as it did from November to March Then what Who is absorbing the long term debt to keep interest rates from returning to the upward trajectory from Aug 2020 Mar 2021 International creditors have had little appetite for US Debt lately The chart below shows the total outstanding debt held by foreign governments In the

will have to issue more than 80B in long term debt to continue funding all the massive spending If inflation expectations stay low maybe the market will have enough firepower to ingest some of the new debt but not all of it With the Fed planning to begin tapering at the end of the year someone will need to fill the void of 80B This does not even consider the possibility of shrinking the Fed balance sheet which should be considered impossible at this point The chart of the international holders above brings to mind the image of the Wiley Coyote running off a cliff With 10 year interest rates hovering near 1 5 one could argue there is strong demand for long term Treasury debt Unfortunately foreign creditors have turned off their debt purchases It took decades for them to accumulate 7T in Treasury debt The Fed alone has accumulated more than half that 4 5T over the last decade The Fed is making the market seem strong but as shown above there might be nothing but air if they were to exit the market With a thumb on the scale no one is getting an accurate reading of true demand for US long term debt amp x200B Figure 8 Source Warner Brothers https preview redd it c90czu1jun871 png

on what s actually going on The current understanding seems to be that the banks are awash with cash So much cash they are hitting the limits in terms of how much cash they can hold on balance overnight This is cash that should be invested on behalf of money market funds but with so much cash in the system if it were to all be invested in short term debt instruments it could drive rates negative To avoid negative rates the Fed is lending banks assets on its balance sheet overnight in exchange for cash It is critical to avoid negative rates to ensure money market funds never experience a loss and result in breaking the buck https www investopedia com terms b breaking the buck asp Maybe this is a leap too far but it seems another solution to the Fed reverse repurchase activity could be for the Treasury to issue more short term debt So why has the Treasury been drawing down its cash balance and letting short term debt mature when there seems to be strong demand in the market The Treasury must recognize the risk in having too much debt in short term instruments and is trying to lengthen the duration of its debt outstanding Unfortunately this abundance of cash in the Repurchase market is in search of low risk short term debt so will not provide demand for long term debt If this is the case it has created quite the pickle for the Treasury By issuing too much short term debt the Treasury is by default putting pressure on the Fed to not raise short term interest rates However by issuing too much long term debt the Treasury is by default putting pressure on the Fed to maintain or even increase Quantitative Easing To reiterate this is why it is imperative the market believes inflation is transitory The Treasury cannot stop issuing debt which leaves the Fed unable to raise rates or taper QE without wreaking havoc in the bond market Additionally if the Fed has to fight inflation then it s not just the Treasury facing its Wiley Coyote moment but the entire US economy Wrapping up With the economy reopening the treasury deployed its cash balance at the most opportune time unless of course inflation numbers continue to increase which based on all the data anecdotal evidence and liquidity in the Repurchase market seems like a strong possibility Unfortunately for the Fed the Treasury will have to begin re issuing debt again Will it lean towards short term debt hoping the Fed keeps interest rates low or long term debt hoping the Fed will expand QE The Fed may be constrained either way because it has its own problem though Powell must be praying that inflation readings come in low AND job numbers disappoint If both don t occur then tough questions will be asked to justify more stimulus Yellen and Powell may be best buds but simple coordination will not be enough They will need magic and luck to keep the course steady heading into 2H 2021 and 2022 If the Fed is lucky enough to get low inflation readings out of its rigged CPI it may provide cover to begin tapering Rising long term rates won t have the same compounding effect on inflation expectations in a low inflation environment Unfortunately though long terms rates will not be tenable over the medium term as the government has to finance more and more debt As the market this year has indicated when issuance surpasses Fed buying rates have gone up So what happens to rates when the Fed leaves the market entirely Presumably they go up a lot How high will the Fed let rates go before re entering Just because something is inevitable US Debt spiral does not make it imminent however the next six months of data may shine a bright light on all the irresponsibility over the last 12 years if inflation proves not so transitory Chances are the only thing transitory
