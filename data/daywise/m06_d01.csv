financially responsible They aren t aiming to do flashy deals They won t win by trying to outspend the big guys but they already know this as it s a situation that they ve already been through Instead they re growing their numbers organically with their customer focus So what s this huge catalyst that I spoke of The Legalization of Mobile Sports Betting in Canada where theScore Media app is a household name will likely take place https nationalpost com news politics here are the liberal bills likely to pass this spring and others that could be doomed by an election within the next 3 weeks or earlier Last week bill C 218 passed its 2nd reading in the Senate this is often where the biggest risk lies Tomorrow it will be studied by a Standing Committee After passing that stage it will then move to 3rd reading before becoming law The bill is supported by provincial bodies by every major sports league https www gamblingnews com news cga major sports leagues support the push for single event wagering and even sports broadcast companies as their viewership numbers continue to decline It just so happens that the Deputy Chair of the reviewing committee https sencanada ca en senators smith larry w also served as Commissioner of the Canadian Football League CFL https www tsn ca cfl video cfl hopes for the pass of bill c 218 in order to boost future revenue 2205144 The opportunity presented by this bill passing is forecasted to be US 4 to US 5 billion at maturity TheScore is actively preparing for this opportunity and extremely well positioned to benefit long term as Canada s leading mobile sports media brand 10 penetration of the Canadian Market US 400 Million15 penetration of the Canadian Market US 625 Million20 penetration of the Canadian Market US 850 Million The current market cap is valued at US 843 647M which indicates that this legalization is not currently priced in as it wouldn t take into consideration everything else that theScore has built The stock s technicals have bottomed out and we can finally see that the trend is reversing All of this combined with SCR s low float will mean an explosive next few weeks Bonus info about eSports Gen Z is half as likely as millennials to watch live sports and 2x more likely to never watch 35 of Gen Z identify as eSports fans a higher percentage than NASCAR MLB and NHL There s a potential for 6 million new bettors with an outsized affinity for eSports over the next five years 495 million people watched eSports online or on television in 2020 worldwide and viewers are projected to grow to 646 million by 2023 eSports betting will be one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long term if not the biggest theScore eSports has the 1 esports media following with 186 5 million reported video views in their most recent quarter which represents a 139 YoY growth and an average social media reach of 88 million a month Guess who s actively seeking and preparing opportunities to enter this space TLDR APES amp DEGENERATES LIKE GAMBLING ON SPORTS AND ESPORTS SCR the 1 Canadian Sports Media app entered Sports Betting and is seeing encouraging results They re also the leading eSports media brand and are actively seeking to enter esports betting which will eventually become one of the biggest betting categories Legalization of Canadian Sports betting in the next weeks US Sports betting expansion means that this company is extremely undervalued for its future potential in a US 22 Billion industry

CBG at UNDER 500 kg with no trace of THC , Summary amp x200B Amyris AMRS is a synthetic bio company they are a platform for programming the DNA of micro organisms to make them into living machines These organisms consume sugar and convert it to virtually any molecule cannabinoids proteins mRNA vaccine adjuvants vanillin etc They sell rare molecules to companies as a manufacturer amp x200B In less romantic terms and extremely simplified Yeast breaks down sugars from grain to make beer yeah beer is yeast poop Beer is relatively low value Amyris twiddles yeast DNA so that when the yeast eat sugar they will poop PURE CBG out of those micro booty holes CBG is a rare and high value molecule amp x200B Its modern day alchemy instead of turning lead to gold they turn sugar into rare molecules amp x200B Why are they worth so little if they are so magical amp x200B To the market Amyris looks like an old broken down synbio company that is grasping at skincare and clean beauty for life No hedgie would give a dead company such a deep dive It would be absolutely retarded of anyone to look at that balance sheet and decide to do constant research on a dying company for 6 years and that s where I come in amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B The market is focused on new synbio companies that are going public which have a focus on cellular programming machine learning Ginkgo and Zymergen Amy was one of the original older synbio companies that was focusing on biofuels 10 years ago It wasn t profitable and then they went silent During their silence they were burning a hole in their pockets by dumping in 70M into research every year And then they solved it They made one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs in modern history they could repeatedly program and optimize yeast to produce molecules at true commercial scale where the production cost approaches the price of sugar Their science was amazing but they got stuck because the company was in a 2B hole from all the research They have been clawing their way up since The market is completely unaware of this giant who is 8 10 years ahead of its competition and valued the lowest of the three They are unaware of Amy s technological might because on the outside it looks like a washed up biofuel company trying to do skincare This is a chance to beat the market to an extremely undervalued stock amp x200B Amyris is turning the corner to profitability and is already producing 13 molecules at commercial scale CBG being one of them amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B FAQ Why are they so focused on Skincare Clean Beauty It has disgusting margins for them they make so much profit from it because it is high value and low volume The fermentation game is all about capacity by choosing skincare they maximized the money their single fermentation plant could make They are using these margins to claw themselves out of debt and it will eventually fully fund their operation amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B If you are interested you can follow along the Conference Call breakdown below where I will summarize the call If people like this sort of thing I may do more in the future amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp

key 2ae2690d24 amp x200B 2 35 13 commercialized molecules 24 in the pipeline 250 molecules where they have already engineered yeast to produce the molecule effectively amp x200B 07 00 Amyris and Ingredion join in a 100M deal to produce RebM and other sweeteners Amy steals Ingredion s heart by being so darn sweet Info RebM is a rare molecule found in Stevia its sweetness profile is the closest to real sugar RebA is a shittier version of RebM that has some bitterness but is more available in the plant PureCircle produces RebA and RebM via plant extraction and is the dominant player in that market Ingredion bought 75 of PureCircle for 263M in 2020 One day Ingredion notices that it is losing customers to Amyris a skincare company They find out Amy is producing RebM at 30 lower cost than the plant extraction method from AND at a higher purity less bitter taste Ingredion offers Amyris 100M to manufacture RebM and develop other sweeteners for them They forked out that 100M a year after they bought PureCircle for 263M you know they weren t happy lol amp x200B This is how disruptive Amyris is Ingredion benched PureCircle for Amy Amy turned one of the market leading producers of RebM into what will probably be only a RebM sales distribution channel for Ingredion I m sure PureCircle has some useful data that Amy can use too amp x200B 16 00 On the left is Amyris Sandalwood derived from fermentation and on the right is plant extracted Sandalwood The discoloration is due to impurities that oxidize and create off notes in the scent Fermentation derived Sandal wood is cheaper to make more pure and easier to formulate due to its purity The scent also lasts 2x longer amp x200B Amyris partners with Industry leaders who already know the market and demand for rare molecules Amyris manufactures the molecules through fermentation and the Industry leaders market it or formulate it into a product amp x200B Amyris expects its business to generate 60 70 gross margins in a sustainable way into the future amp x200B 20 35 Throwing shade on competitors Because Ginkgo and Zymergen are going public more data on them is public Amyris claims to be 8 10 years ahead of any synbio company across the world Gingko and Zymergen are not really making any product yet and they don t have Amyris experience in scaling John wants to step on the gas more to keep the lead They have been investing 70M into their core platform since 2011 even while everyone thought they were going out of business Amyris goal is a single design of a target chemical to commercial production in a single step It currently takes them 12 months or less to get a molecule to commercial scale and it costs 1M side note they did CBG in 9 months amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B 31 15 CBD is only mainstream because it is available at a lower cost In the same way RebA is a shitty version of RebM we are seeing that CBD is a shitty version of CBG when it comes to inflammatory properties Amyris is currently producing more volume of CBG at scale than any one else in the world They plan on going after the other minor cannabinoids as well Amy is producing CBG at the market cost of CBD currently and will soon be producing it at under 500 kg Amyris uses directed evolution they are constantly optimizing their yeast or other micro organisms to have higher yields which improves their costs over time They can get their prices extremely low due to their experience with biofuels Cannabinoids produced by precision fermentation have no detectable amounts of THC making it easier to get by regulatory hurdles amp x200B They will be using this CBG to create a breakthrough new acne treatment Their plan is to own the CBG market before they open up and supply CBG to the rest of the world amp x200B note how low can the cost go amp x200B As of 2015 Amyris produced farnesene at 1 75 L it originally cost 16 L I have a hunch they produce farnesene at under a dollar by now A few months ago Amyris was producing CBG at 1500 L and they have already improved to the 500 range amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B If you would like more information on Amyris here is some more DD amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Parts 1 3 https www

producing pure CBG at UNDER 500 kg with no trace of THC Amyris is also involved with sweeteners vaccines plant based proteins monoclonal antibodies and more amp x200B Summary Amyris AMRS is a synthetic bio company they are a platform for programming the DNA of micro organisms to make them into living machines These organisms consume sugar and convert it to virtually any molecule cannabinoids proteins mRNA vaccine adjuvants vanillin etc They sell rare molecules to companies as a manufacturer In less romantic terms and extremely simplified Yeast breaks down sugars from grain to make beer yeah beer is yeast poop Beer is relatively low value Amyris twiddles yeast DNA so that when the yeast eat sugar they will poop PURE CBG out of those micro booty holes CBG is a rare and high value molecule Its modern day alchemy instead of turning lead to gold they turn sugar into rare molecules Why are they worth so little if they are so magical To the market Amyris looks like an old broken down synbio company that is grasping at skincare and clean beauty for life No analyst would give a dead company such a deep dive It would be absolutely retarded of anyone to look at that balance sheet and decide to do constant research on a dying company for 6 years and that s where I come in amp x200B The market is focused on new synbio companies that are going public which have a focus on cellular programming machine learning Ginkgo and Zymergen Amy was one of the original older synbio companies that was focusing on biofuels 10 years ago It wasn t profitable and then they went silent During their silence they were burning a hole in their pockets by dumping in 70M into research every year And then they solved it They made one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs in modern history they could repeatedly program and optimize yeast to produce molecules at true commercial scale where the production cost approaches the price of sugar Their science was amazing but they got stuck because the company was in a 2B hole from all the research They have been clawing their way up since The market is completely unaware of this giant who is 8 10 years ahead of its competition and valued the lowest of the three They are unaware of Amy s technological might because on the outside it looks like a washed up biofuel company trying to do skincare This is a chance to beat the market to an extremely undervalued stock Amyris is turning the corner to profitability and is already producing 13 molecules at commercial scale CBG being one of them amp x200B FAQ Why are they so focused on Skincare Clean Beauty It has disgusting margins for them they make so much profit from it because it is high value and low volume The fermentation game is all about capacity by choosing skincare they maximized the money their single fermentation plant could make They are using these margins to claw themselves out of debt and it will eventually fully fund their operation amp x200B If you are interested you can follow along the Conference Call breakdown below where I will summarize the call If people like this sort of thing I may do more in the future amp x200B Morgan Stanley Amyris CEO John Melo Conference Call Breakdown Highlights Link https morganstanley webcasts com viewer event jsp ei 1460586 amp tp key 2ae2690d24 https morganstanley webcasts com viewer event jsp ei 1460586 amp tp key 2ae2690d24 2 35 13 commercialized molecules 24 in the pipeline 250 molecules where they have already engineered yeast to produce the molecule effectively 07 00 Amyris and Ingredion join in a 100M deal to produce RebM and other sweeteners Amy steals Ingredion s heart by being so darn sweet Info RebM is a rare molecule found in Stevia its sweetness profile is the closest to real sugar RebA is a shittier version of RebM that has some bitterness but is more available in the plant PureCircle produces RebA and RebM via plant extraction and is the dominant player in that market Ingredion bought 75 of PureCircle for 263M in 2020 One day Ingredion notices that it is losing customers to Amyris a skincare company They find out Amy is producing RebM at 30 lower cost than the plant extraction method from AND at a higher purity less bitter taste Ingredion offers Amyris 100M to manufacture RebM and develop other sweeteners for them They forked out that 100M a year after they bought PureCircle for 263M you know they weren t happy lol This is how disruptive Amyris is Ingredion benched PureCircle for Amy Amy turned one of the market leading producers of RebM into what will probably be only a RebM sales distribution channel for Ingredion I m sure PureCircle has some useful data that Amy can use too 16 00 On the left is Amyris Sandalwood derived from fermentation and on the right is plant extracted Sandalwood The discoloration is due to impurities that oxidize and create off notes in the scent Fermentation derived Sandal wood is cheaper to make more pure and easier to formulate due to its purity The scent also lasts 2x longer Amyris partners with Industry leaders who already know the market and demand for rare molecules Amyris manufactures the molecules through fermentation and the Industry leaders market it or formulate it into a product Amyris expects its business to generate 60 70 gross margins in a sustainable way into the future 20 35 Throwing shade on competitors Because Ginkgo and Zymergen are going public more data on them is public Amyris claims to be 8 10 years ahead of any synbio company across the world Gingko and Zymergen are not really making any product yet and they don t have Amyris experience in scaling John wants to step on the gas more to keep the lead They have been investing 70M into their core platform since 2011 even while everyone thought they were going out of business Amyris goal is a single design of a target chemical to commercial production in a single step It currently takes them 12 months or less to get a molecule to commercial scale and it costs 1M side note they did CBG in 9 months amp x200B 31 15 CBD is only mainstream because it is available at a lower cost In the same way RebA is a shitty version of RebM we are seeing that CBD is a shitty version of CBG when it comes to inflammatory properties Amyris is currently producing more volume of CBG at scale than any one else in the world They plan on going after the other minor cannabinoids as well Amy is producing CBG at the market cost of CBD currently and will soon be producing it at under 500 kg Amyris uses directed evolution they are constantly optimizing their yeast or other micro organisms to have higher yields which improves their costs over time They can get their prices extremely low due to their experience with biofuels Cannabinoids produced by precision fermentation have no detectable amounts of THC making it easier to get by regulatory hurdles They will be using this CBG to create a breakthrough new acne treatment Their plan is to own the CBG market before they open up and supply CBG to the rest of the world note how low can the cost go As of 2015 Amyris produced farnesene at 1 75 L it originally cost 16 L I have a hunch they produce farnesene at under a dollar by now A few months ago Amyris was producing CBG at 1500 L and they have already improved to the 500 range amp x200B If you would like more

https constine substack com p pressclub with mark zuckerberg daniel Have a listen Facebook CEO talks about the 400 000 000 creators and businesses on his platforms and Spotify s CEO talks about the soon to be 50 000 000 creators on his platform They talk with Shopify CEO about how all 3 companies need to work together to enable a 360 omnichannel experience for creators and businesses so they can connect with their audiences in different ways and in different places share content in different ways tell their stories in different ways monetize themself everywhere and lower friction for them How many of these 450 000 000 creators and businesses on Facebook and Spotify plus on many more such platforms do you think Shopify can enable to help merchants connect to all such platforms over the next 1 2 5 10 15 years 50 000 000 100 000 000 Imagine when Spotify artists like Eminem who uses Shopify seen here https shop eminem com adds a Shopify BUY button on Spotify Eminem has 22 MILLION followers on Twitter https twitter com eminem 32 MILLION followers on instagram https instagram com eminem 47 MILLION subscribers on YouTube can t post YouTube links here 91 MILLION followers on Facebook https m facebook com eminem 555K followed in tiktok https vm tiktok com ZMeU2vtCU HUGE SALES for musicians on Spotify when they add a Shopify BUY button there Coming soon based on what Spotify s CEO said How about when podcast creators large and small add a Shopify BUY button on Spotify Joe Rogan uses Shopify seen here https www higherprimate com How many sales is Joe and other such podcasters are going to make when they add a Shopify BUY button in Spotify This is what Spotify CEO said in the podcast in the link above about this topic Daniel Ek And our view just in the space of audio just a few years ago we had about 3 million creators on our platform 00 08 45 And today that number s over 8 million and we ve said by 2025 we think of will grow to about 50 million creators So just the explosion of the people who want to be creative and who are expressing themselves through music through podcasting through audio it s just staggering And what s fascinating to me as we spoke about is this notion about making it so that more of these people can live off of their passion and live off of their art that they re creating 00 09 17 And what s interesting I feel is that it s very much of an omni channel expression by these creators So it used to be before that if you were a musician as an example you just put out music That was the thing that you were doing But almost every successful creator now is omni talented and in omni channels 00 09 42 That means that they are on YouTube putting up videos They are on Instagram They are perhaps putting together brands and putting it on Shopify but they re also putting out music and merchandise on Shopify and music on Spotify of course and touring And so they re really just doing a multitude of different things and connecting with their fan bases across many different platforms 00 10 05 And so I think it s a super super interesting early stage but there s a lot of friction still of being a creator and managing your fan base across all of these different platforms that I think will be considerably easier in the coming years And even this distinction between what a casual fan is and what a super fan is I think will dramatically change in the coming years 00 11 02 Yeah I think we re still in the early days of creating deeper fan engagement between creators and fans 00 11 10 And it s definitely a sort of big theme that we re investing behind And as you said I think when I look at streaming the early innings were all about just access and just having access to the content and moving more and more of these minutes that was being spent in traditional offline radio or broadcast radio on to online on demand 00 11 31 And as as more and more people now have started doing that And we have hundreds of millions of people around the world that are streaming music every single day The engagement profile means that we are creating a lot of fans and we re creating a lot of super fans too So far music has been a one size fits all where we ve just monetized it through the streaming revenues in itself 00 11 56 And you had to as a creator figure out how to monetize that fan base off of other platforms But I think the future is that we will become a lot better at monetizing your fans and your super fans even on Spotify And I like to think and hope that platforms like Shopify and others can then interact with Spotify 00 12 18 And likewise you can have Spotify content beyond Instagram or Facebook in order to drive that 360 experience No wonder Cathie Wood form ARK Invest bought around 1 2BILLION SHOP

with mark zuckerberg daniel Facebook CEO talks about the 400 000 000 creators and businesses on his platforms and Spotify s CEO talks about the soon to be 50 000 000 creators on his platform They talk with Shopify CEO about how all 3 companies need to work together to enable a 360 omnichannel experience for creators and businesses so they can connect with their audiences in different ways and in different places share content in different ways tell their stories in different ways monetize themself everywhere and lower friction for them How many of these 450 000 000 creators and businesses on Facebook and Spotify plus on many more such platforms do you think Shopify can enable to help merchants connect to all such platforms over the next 1 2 5 10 15 years 50 000 000 100 000 000 Imagine when Spotify artists like Eminem who uses Shopify seen here https shop eminem com adds a Shopify BUY button on Spotify Eminem has 22 MILLION followers on Twitter https twitter com eminem 32 MILLION followers on instagram https instagram com eminem 47 MILLION subscribers on YouTube can t post YouTube links here 91 MILLION followers on Facebook https m facebook com eminem 555K followed in tiktok https vm tiktok com ZMeU2vtCU It s a very big opportunity for Shopify when musicians on Spotify can add a Shopify BUY button there Coming soon based on what Spotify s CEO said How about when podcast creators large and small add a Shopify BUY button on Spotify Joe Rogan uses Shopify seen here https www higherprimate com How many sales is Joe and other such podcasters are going to make when they add a Shopify BUY button in Spotify This is what Spotify CEO said in the podcast in the link above about this topic Daniel Ek And our view just in the space of audio just a few years ago we had about 3 million creators on our platform 00 08 45 And today that number s over 8 million and we ve said by 2025 we think of will grow to about 50 million creators So just the explosion of the people who want to be creative and who are expressing themselves through music through podcasting through audio it s just staggering And what s fascinating to me as we spoke about is this notion about making it so that more of these people can live off of their passion and live off of their art that they re creating 00 09 17 And what s interesting I feel is that it s very much of an omni channel expression by these creators So it used to be before that if you were a musician as an example you just put out music That was the thing that you were doing But almost every successful creator now is omni talented and in omni channels 00 09 42 That means that they are on YouTube putting up videos They are on Instagram They are perhaps putting together brands and putting it on Shopify but they re also putting out music and merchandise on Shopify and music on Spotify of course and touring And so they re really just doing a multitude of different things and connecting with their fan bases across many different platforms 00 10 05 And so I think it s a super super interesting early stage but there s a lot of friction still of being a creator and managing your fan base across all of these different platforms that I think will be considerably easier in the coming years And even this distinction between what a casual fan is and what a super fan is I think will dramatically change in the coming years 00 11 02 Yeah I think we re still in the early days of creating deeper fan engagement between creators and fans 00 11 10 And it s definitely a sort of big theme that we re investing behind And as you said I think when I look at streaming the early innings were all about just access and just having access to the content and moving more and more of these minutes that was being spent in traditional offline radio or broadcast radio on to online on demand 00 11 31 And as as more and more people now have started doing that And we have hundreds of millions of people around the world that are streaming music every single day The engagement profile means that we are creating a lot of fans and we re creating a lot of super fans too So far music has been a one size fits all where we ve just monetized it through the streaming revenues in itself 00 11 56 And you had to as a creator figure out how to monetize that fan base off of other platforms But I think the future is that we will become a lot better at monetizing your fans and your super fans even on Spotify And I like to think and hope that platforms like Shopify and others can then interact with Spotify 00 12 18 And likewise you can have Spotify content beyond Instagram or Facebook in order to drive that 360 experience No wonder Cathie Wood form ARK Invest bought around 1 2BILLION SHOP shares over the last 6 months and
