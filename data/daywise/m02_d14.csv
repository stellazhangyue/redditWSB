6,ljdboy,t2_7iq6oz9y,1613263025,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljdboy/nok_nok_whose_there/,1,NOK NOK WHOSE THERE , Current Status Report Nokia has benefited largely from the ban of Huawei and ZTE due to them being targeted by Trump during his anti China campaign Nokia has since netted around 40 50 of these outstanding contracts due to the absence of these prior competitors Nokia fumbled early entry into the 5G space because of a bloated and expensive product line This is now all changing and ReefShark management s answer to this mistake is now taking off ReefShark is a new chipset and subsequent product line that promises better margins for the company 75 rollout by EOY 2021 100 by EOY 2022 The new CEO as of last August is Pekka Lundmark This man has demonstrated incredible financial responsibility and a very disciplined leadership modality He is significantly more competent than the last CEO Rajeev Suri meaning the company s future is probably stable for now Unfortunately Pekka is also an old dog you should not expect him to make any exciting or ambitious plays anytime soon There is some price erosion in the North American market meaning that there are currently bidding wars going on here leading to reduced margins for Nokia In addition the U S dollar is also dropping compared to the Euro thanks to free money from the federal reserve leading to reduced top line figures for Nokia Every other market has remained relatively stable The Bull Case ReefShark is mostly coming online by EOY 2021 This has potential to kickstart a significant bull run for Nokia OYJ Nokia OYJ is a profitable company a rare thing in this economy of overinflated tech stocks and overly optimistic COVID recovery plays Nokia OYJ has a solid balance sheet that consists of more than 10 12 billion dollars of liquid assets e i cash short term investments Half the company s net worth is basically in cash Nokia OYJ NOK 23 67B is significantly undervalued compared to relevant competitors such as Cisco Systems CSCO 199 61B and Ericsson Systems ERIC 41 94B despite having a sizable market share in one of the world s most important tech markets 5G communications is set to skyrocket due to higher demand via IOT and next gen technologies such as self driving cars Nokia OYJ is worth only about 60 of Ericsson Systems despite having nearly identical balance sheets and income statements Ericsson indeed has a lead on Nokia in terms of profitability margins and secured contracts but the importance of both is overstated without context Increased profits of a few hundred million when you are dealing with tens of billions in overall revenue is an absolute joke As for the additional 5G deals Ericsson has Ericsson is agreeing to them at a loss in hopes that they will be a loss leader in order to secure and lock down clients to their tech stack Again maybe but ever since the banning of Huawei and ZTE clients have insisted on more and more flexibility in terms of cloud service alternatives thereby negating any early bird advantage Nokia OYJ is important politically financially and strategically to Europe and North American interests You can expect help from politicians in the future Nokia OYJ is already at the very bottom At 4 per share this company is trading as if it were in the same industry as hot dog vendors in terms of cash flow and price to earnings This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that at 3 3 5 per share Nokia had to take actions to prevent itself from being bought outright in a hostile takeover bid Nokia OYJ has one of the highest number of outstanding option contracts in the entire market This has the potential to lead to some very funky market driven events such as the company hitting 9 75 per share on January 27th 2021 Prominent hedge funds were holding major positions in this stock at 4 per share at the end of December Have they sold already during last week s high Who knows But what it tells us was that even without that weird peak on January 27th hedge funds felt that 4 per share was an absolute bargain The Bear Case Nokia is in a highly competitive market with low margins Even with Huawei and ZTE out of the picture Samsung poses a significant risk as the Korean conglomerate can easily undercut Nokia s margins Samsung unlikely to be met with the same restrictions due to South Korea s diplomatic ties with North America and Europe Nokia is late to the game of 5G with their earlier fumble under the mired leadership of Rajeev Suri Why bet on the underdog when you can bet on the incumbent that is Ericsson By investing in Nokia you might be losing out on better investment opportunities that have been severely discounted due to COVID 19 Summary Recommendations If you are bullish Buy more and hold You currently own a safe haven asset that is unlikely to be affected by further market downturns related to COVID 19 Unemployment is still sky high and the rest of the market hasn t realized the consequences of this yet If you are bearish Hold until at least March or April Recent sell off is the market reacting irrationally to Pekka Lundmark saying the forbidden words of price erosion and difficult year in the same sentence even though the fault of this is largely due to American companies engaging in bidding wars and the U S dollar shorting itself into the ground All in all the earnings report was still good and I expect a rebound

to get some money back from GME I know I do Now before i get downvoted to hell this is not an options only play I just happen to be buying calls cause it seems very undervalued to me and the calls are cheap You can 100 buy shares and do well I picked up 640 10c for feb 19 They were 5 each The stock is at 8 99 as im writing this and up 40 from yesterdays low These are cheap as shit This is a very low volume stock and i havent seen it mentioned on r wallstreetbets r stocks or r options So im mentioning it there in all 3 This is not financial advice and you should do your own research before buying anything let alone short dated options You dont have to buy them for this play im just explaining how undervalued they are 10c for 3 19 42 days are 20 12 5c for 3 19 are 10 Now onto the DD for Celestica Market cap 1 15B Free float 108m Avg Volume 310 000 Institutional ownership 69 Many of our good friends such as Citadel are even increasing their positions Other notable institutions JP morgan Vanguard Goldman sachs and Morgan stanley Source https www nasdaq com market activity stocks cls institutional holdings They have over 24 000 employees brought in 5 88B revenue in 2019 and have 35 manufacturing and design locations worldwide Theyve been in business for 27 years https www celestica com news media information Their most recent earnings released jan 26 2021 show an earnings of 0 16 per share as opposed to a loss of 0 05 per share last year This means that they were profitable during covid and found ways to adapt and overcome the challenges the pandemic brought to many companies They have an undrawn 450M revolver as they put it on their site or 464M in cash https corporate celestica com static files e9830936 130f 44f6 9f73 3127402c00d5 So what do they do Yes Celestica Inc Celestica inc Is a provider of supply chain solutions The company operates in electronics manufacturing services The company offers a range of services to its customers including design and development engineering services supply chain management new product introduction component sourcing assembly and testing complex mechanical assembly systems integration precision machining order fulfillment logistics and after market repair and return services Its products and services serve a range of applications including servers storage systems optical equipment aerospace and defense electronics healthcare products and applications semiconductor equipment and a range of industrial and alternative energy products including solar panels and inverters It designs manufactures and tests solar panels for residential commercial and utility scale markets Im in this for the clean energy innovative tech supply chain and aerospace Theyre involved with lots of other things as well that make them a good play imo We all know biden has lots of plans for clean energy looking at you ICLN gang and that its a main focus of many governments around the world They have 6 locations in China 2 locations in South Korea and 3 locations in Japan These countries are leading the world in tech and clean energy They also have 4 locations in California and a few other locations throughout the US Basically theyre positioned perfectly for exposure to tech funding and innovation I can also see this being added to a few of the ARK ETFs including the new space one ARKX Their linkedIn page is full of jobs they are looking to hire many different types of engineers and employees for product solutions They pay their staff relatively well avg 60k per year with 32k yr being minimum for warehouse staff The reviews from employees seem decent with an average of 3 5 stars on Glassdoor and 3 9 on indeed Theres also real pics on there of people wearing lab coats in front of some fancy looking tech shit which is very promising I dont know how to add pictures The only reason the chart dipped recently was due to the GME situation there was no bad news and they are already back to approaching highs since pre covid Im assuming a certain few institutions had to sell to cover their margin call Before the march crash the stock peaked at 9 29 At the bottom of the crash it was trading at 2 63 Since then they have rebounded back to over 9 per share and are approaching pre covid highs Their 2019 earnings were negative 0 05 per share and their earnings for 2020 were 0 16 per share Again this means that they went from losing money pre covid to being profitable during Reasons I believe the stock is undervalued Very low volume in such a promising tech stock to me means that not many people know it exists or that the company is dogshit This company is not dogshit A dogshit company is not spread globally with over 20k employees bringing in nearly 6B year in sales CLS holds a P E ratio of 8 86 while its industry has an average P E of 17 83 CLS has a P B ratio of 0 77 The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities This stock s P B looks attractive against its industry s average P B of 1 79 This alone makes them very undervalued CLS has a P S ratio of 0 19 This is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue or sales This is a useful metric on low volume unheard of stocks because revenue can t really be manipulated so sales are often a truer performance indicator CLS has a P S ratio of 0 19 This compares to its industry s average P S of 0 31 CLS has a P CF ratio of 5 83 This metric takes into account a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 6 35 Please let me know if you find more better information or if something ive said is incorrect Edit 1 Found an interview with the CFO about which sectors of their business improved and declined in the last quarter and some things they plan to do moving forward If you dont want to watch it their aerospace sector declined heavily due to grounded planes due to covid while their cloud and data sector grew heavily and they expect it to continue to perform well https www bnnbloomberg ca canada video we are well positioned to benefit from the buy american plan celestica cfo 2127135 Tldr CLS is a tech clean energy company involved in many promising industries They are undervalued in every sense of the word and their options even more so They have extemely low volume due to being unknown but are by no means a dogshit penny stock Stock is currently trading at 9 03 and 10c for 2 weeks out are 05 Yesterday they opened at 8 73 found resitance at 8 60 and climbed to 8 95 at close Positions again 640 x CLS 10c 2 19 CLS GME

craziness of a couple weeks ago I still am and have been accumulating under 5 pretty heavily Average is right around 4 50 Disclaimer I own 2500 shares of NOK and 65 Jan 2022 10C I am fully aware that P E valuation isn t the best method of valuation for a stock but I did some rough math to set a PT for myself I m very long on this stock and I don t foresee myself selling a majority of my position anytime in the life cycle of 5G networks Anyway in my math I realized a wild undervaluation IMO on NOK P E Breakdown these numbers are a bit old as I did the math earlier this week and my first attempt to post this got removed for some reason Currently NOK has a P E ratio of just under 14 it got down to just above 13 at it s low on Thursday The most applicable comparator stock we can us is ERIC which has a PE of 20 29 The telecom provider industry as a whole has a PE of 21 26 Trailing EPS is 31 and this is where it gets a bit interesting Their previous ER yielded an EPS of 17 The previous CEO instilled a methodology to increase profitability and free cash flow and the current CEO has been pursuing that relentlessly These efforts were yielding results even in the midst of COVID If you forecast out a moderate EPS of 17 for the next 3 quarters and keep the PE the same The stock price would be 9 52 I m aware that they may not achieve this amount of EPS per ER going forward but I think that is a decent perhaps conservative baseline to operate off of One gap I see that the market is missing on the entire industry is giving it a very conservative outlook As 5G networks mature and transition into 6G and beyond the opportunities for steady cash flow and increasing margins and revenue will abound in this industry Going forward I feel that a ratio of 25 applied to the industry NOK operates in would be appropriate and again perhaps conservative For reference Apple s current PE is 37 and AMD s is 82 Not good comparators but everyone knows these companies and what they do so they can draw their own conclusion If we were to apply the conservative 17 EPS x 4 and the new industry wide PE to NOK stock we would yield a PT of 17 2 Things that could change the equation in a hurry 1 Reinstate Dividends In their previous ER they said they would give an update on their dividend reinstatement by March 18th when they hold their annual Capital Markets Day event I m on WSB so you know I m a betting man and if there were a place to wager if they were or were not going to reinstate dividends I would be all in on that they are going to reinstate They stopped dividends to pump up R amp D into 5G and probably 6G and to increase FCF If they do reinstate dividends just on a cursory glance of an ETF database there is close to 2 5B AUM in EU Dividend focused ETFs I would assume a large number of these ETFs would pick up NOK and if they are market cap weighed they will pick it up heftily I m sure there are a number of US based ETFs with a dividend focus that would add NOK as well This accumulation would definitely kick start a movement in the price and could change the way boomers HFs view NOK 2 Infrastructure Stimulus There is no doubt that some massive stimulus packages in the EU US will be passed at some point this year on top of the 1 9T that is currently in process Both the Biden administration and the ECB chair Christine Lagarde are big fans of infrastructure stimulus 5G is literally mentioned on the Biden website https joebiden com clean energy https joebiden com clean energy In the time since trying to post this and now this article came out about Biden China infrastructure Remember when Biden says infrastructure 5G is a big part of that https www bbc com news business 56036245 https www bbc com news business 56036245 In a time where such data intensive processes are on the forefront of the economy transition to alternative currencies autonomous cars etc there will be a desire to invest heavily into networks that can meet those data demands There has been no signal that the US is going to pivot away from the Huawei ban giving NOK and other companies a chance to pick up huge swaths of market share https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 02 04 biden commerce pick sees no reason to pull huawei from blacklist https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 02 04 biden commerce pick sees no reason to pull huawei from blacklist That should give you comfort that NOK s ability to compete and be an oligopoly esque player in mobile networks going forward in the US On top of that Nokia was chosen to lead the EU s project researching 6G networks https www nokia com about us news releases 2020 12 07 nokia to lead the eus 6g project hexa x https www nokia com about us news releases 2020 12 07 nokia to lead the eus 6g project hexa x TL DR NOK s future is bright both long term and short term The current fundamental valuation on the company is deeply flawed and undervalued Will we have in the short term IDK I think we will but definitely in the long term

think Trivago could be a great play for 2021 For those that know about Trivago it essentially serves as a price comparison tool for multiple travel sites and it allows you to book hotels This is a recovery play that may or may not pan out I believe that the floor for Trivago is probably around 2 00 right now so you may see those prices should this fail to pan out Also Expedia is a large owner in Trivago and Trivago is a European based company Trivago is a cost per click business that essentially puts multiple pricing on the same site and lets the customer compare With Leisure travel picking back up and companies desperate for cashflow Trivago might find companies being more aggressive on customer acquisition Trivago may benefit with these surges I am buying shares and selling covered calls A 5 00 I believe 5 00 is my exit price for the stock as of right now If something big happens like an adjacent expansion then this might move but I am going to sell monthly covered call

shorts won t show up in next short interest ,THEORY 1 Robinhood and others block the buying Then limit the buying to a couple of shares 2 hedge funds 1 combine forces together and sell naked GME stock with delivery in 2days T2 3 because retail is limited to buy a couple of shares the shares sold are 90 bought by a friendly hedge fund 2 4 hedge fund 2 sells again those shares at a lower price to hedge fund 1 hedge fund 1 delivers the naked short shares to the clearinghouse before T2 ends no new short interest is recorded or will be added to the 2 weekly short interest 5 due that the naked short shares are back delivered before T2 no high borrowing interest needs to be paid And this game does cost them nothing CONDITIONS This game above works only perfect if the naked short shares sold do NOT LAND IN TO OTHER HANDS then those of the hedge funds gang Otherwise they can not be given sold back to hedge fund 1 to give back before T2 HOW 1 Block and after limit retail investors from buying more shares as those will be lost in this closed circle between hedge funds The deal has to be done across all brokerages This is mass scale manipulation 2 Block retail investors from shorting shares as that would provide a buying spree if prices go up again ZERO COST The above closed circle of naked short selling to other hedge funds is a zero cost except the the little shares lost to retail buyers on the min purchase price no high borrowing interest to be paid so in theory they could do this as long as retail is limited to buy new shares AND stimulated to sell their shares PARALLEL CHAIN Although the above game does cost them nothing their need to be a gain of getting cheap shares out of the pockets of the retail holders HOW step guide 1 Lower the margin value of GME stock so you can not buy other things by just holding on your GME stock You need to sell them to create cash that can be used to buy other things THEY place in your mind as a good buy And this part is the following 1 DISTRACTION Divide the retail group power munition create hype in other things as Silver Nokia etc so the retail Wallstreetbeds gang shoots their arrows on other targets Less arrows left less munition for the real battle GME 2 Create a link with the distraction group and the main target GME So they all belong to the same investment ideas Even if they have nothing to do with each other People will later link them in their mind Nesasary for the next steps 3 Pull retail investors back in to the Original Gamestonk TESLA Interview with Musk in Clubhouse who invites Vladimir Tenev CEO of Robinhood Price target upgrade for TSLA of 120 by Piper Sandler why sundenly comes with this upgrade a week after an earnings miss when all other analyst came out a week before with no changes in their PT and it worked the same morning TSLA started to go up GME went down And the same for the next day 4 Media has to publish stories that the Reddit group investors are selling a story to justify the price decline and or moving to other targets as silver and Nokia 5 Let the DISTRACTION group fall because before media has tagged correlated linked the distraction group to the main target GME the fall of these distraction group tricks your mind thinking that your main target GME will fail also A psychology mind trick Although they are not the same your mind will feel it as the same and makes you nervous that your investment GME is next to fail With as goal you can not hold the stress and give up your shares REMOVE RETAIL investors arms Every retail investor is focussed on the short interest publication What is published every 2 weeks and with delay It s only a snapshot of ONE DAY this can also be gamed One day before the snapshot hedge fund 2 sells naked new shares and hedge fund 1 buys them Delivers them back to the clearinghouse and they will publish it as a lower outstanding short interest Hedge fund 2 that sold naked has 2 days to clear their naked shorts before they will be marked as short interest They follow the above playbook All above is IMO of what I have seen It is not an investment advice But it could give your mind some peace and Birdseye view on all what is happening around you now so you make calculated decisions on your investment and can leave emotions out of it Although for us retail investors it s harder to know what your fellow army members will do as you can not see them Compare to the hedge fund gang they do know each other and have agreements And we do not know if management of GME is on our side they could do a secundaire offering Our strength is the millions of ants that are fighting an elephant gang If the paper loss at the moment is very small in amounts not of each retail investor who believes and KNOW the plan of the elephant elephant gang We could win Even the small amounts of shares that each retail is allowed to buy that is so small they even do not care if they lose it multiplied by millions of ants nibbling on the shares the hedge fund gang sell naked and buy back between each other will increase the short interest over time As you can see this all is so interesting games played by 2 different camps that they

post from friday but with all the edits baked in Enjoy I m borrowing from other DD posts including my own on this post trying to put all the information in one spot POT STOCKS ARE OVERHEATED Now that I ve offended all of you lets ask our selves what could possibly be disruptive in the recreational marijuana and edibles markets who stands apart from literally every other company out there Read on to find out You ll notice a lack of rocket emojis in the title That is because this stock is better than that Where we re going we don t need rockets We re going to the future excerpted from u intrudingturtle below thank you for your colorful language and take on the stock Lets talk a little about CBD Maybe your douchey new age friend was vaping it to look cool or maybe aunt Becky was talking how it helped with dogs anxiety Well big pharma heard about it and this shit is about to blow up Everyday researchers are discovering new applications for CBD and other cannabinoids This includes cancer Huntingtons Disease appetite stimulation epilepsy and much more According to a recent research study the market for CBD alone is 300M and by 2024 its projected to be 1 2B Now that we ve established how big of a fucking deal this is lets move onto how we currently make it Current production of CBD CBG SUCKS Currently our cheapest method of making cannabinoids is growing large fields of high CBD ratio hemp and extracting it with either liquid hydrocarbons isopropyl butane which quite often leaves residues such as chlorophyll The more expensive but superior way is using CO2 extraction You re left with a cleaner product but the initial cost of set up is MUCH more expensive Either extraction method you use you still have to grow the weed in the first place With the price or land increasing environmental restrictions the fact it takes months to grow and cost of food going up its a major pain in the wallet for these companies Not to mention the environmental conscience of these hippies gargling this shit before their Tuesday night hot yoga session with their polyamorous partners As the market floods with unregulated cannabinoid products we hear about tons of stories of people failing drug tests pesticide contamination and inconsistent potency due to poor quality control Now federal regulators are trying to play catch up and crack down While vendors are starting to get slightly more reputable and the cleaner CO2 extraction method becomes more common play there are still are no guarantees There has to be a simpler better way Well there is Thank god for these fucking egg heads They literally found a way to genetically alter yeast to shit out this gold Basically they put the yeast in a vat along with some other precursors and the yeasts produce cannabinoids They have multiple strains that produce CBD CBG worth 30k 50k a kilo and as of recently THC Holy mother of god You can now make a substance worth almost as much as gold IN A VAT This process only takes a few days and could be 50 500 times more efficient than farming and extracting like some caveman Not to mention that pharma companies would much rather have a biosynthesized version over mongoloid version What does this mean for the current cannabinoid market Well I am glad you asked Complete Fucking Takeover This means there s millions and soon to be billions on the table to be taken I m sure some fuckstick who doesn t wear deodorant and picks his teeth with ethically farmed toothpicks will reach for the natural CBD in the future market but as far as the MLM s pharma and health food sector is concerned yeasty CBG is the cheap and consistent way to go About our friends at Willow Bioscience Just look at this guy https www willowbio com static 6f01e57a227a77486c9a7026f2fb3487 c1afe trevor peters willow biosciences webp These guys fuck They have crushed every deadline they made I ve been invested in these guys over a year and already met every goal they set early Lets take a moment to stroke Willow s meat for a bit 12 20 Detailed plans for commercialization 09 20 Successful scaled 500l production of 99 pure CBG 01 21 Partnering to enter the market This is a company with its ducks in a row They just announced accelerated warrant expiry on February 28 and warrants are trading at parity with the stock Exercise Price Warrant price Current Stock Price Enough of the bullshit more of the stonk This stonk has been on a steady uptrend for a while At the start of the year it was trading at about 0 45 and recently took a rocket up to 1 70 There has been some buzz about US legalizing which caused a market wide rally on Tuesday which lead the stonk up to 1 52 After another golden day up to 1 70 which included what looks to be some institutional buying The best is yet to come This stock has yet to make a dime Back in July they hired a sales and marketing exec Profit is coming This means in the next few months we should see a HUGE increase in stock price if everything continues to roll smoothly NOW BACK TO ME Why do I like the stock These guys are delivering what no one else has yet done They are able to make pharmaceutically pure molecules using genetically modified yeast Their most recent news stated that they can make THC from 50 times to 500 times more efficiently than growers can 50 to 500 TIMES https www willowbio com press releases 2021 01 19 willow biosciences advances its work on thc plans to launch in the canadian market Can you imagine just how disruptive it is to be able to deliver pure THC or CBG crystals 500 times more efficiently than current technology can The real hidden value of this company are the patents they hold on the production method What is better than proprietary production method that is cheaper than anyone else can pull off in a company just about to launch commercial sales Literally NOTHING is better I d bet my life These guys are positioned to serve the Canadian recreational market this year and the US recreational market should Indica Joe make it so Analysts have set a 5 price target for within 12 months I m even more bullish but of course I am https atbcapitalmarkets com insights initiating coverage on willow biosciences inc TLDR IN SUMMARY Why should you care Willow is extremely disruptive genuinely undervalued based on analyst estimates and straight up fundamentals and these guys could be the future of the recreational and pharmaceutical marijuana markets They have cash to get to production they have proven technology and they have patents on the production method and they ll be flooding the Canadian recreational market with cheap MJ related molecules later in the year US market is ripe for expansion once recreational takes off there Position Of course I m long 52

Forever is a Very Good Idea That Cannot Go Tits Up and why Slum Lords really aren t that bad if don t worry about ethics ,Hello there fellow degenerates gamblers and regarded gentle people Today I m talking about this wacky boomer concept called diver fish fry cation And not through some boring ass boomer stock that doesn t have triple digit IV that s for impotent donkey faced losers I m talking about the glamorous world of real estate now here s some emojis most of you can t read anyway WHAT THE FUCK IS A REAL ESTATE IS THAT LIKE A ROBLOX HOUSE FOR LOSERS Yes it s exactly like your dope Minecraft village but actual alive humans pay you money to live there Disclaimer I HAVE JUST BEEN INFORMED ITS NOT EXACTLY LIKE THAT AND THAT IF YOU FILL AN ACTUAL APARTMENT BUILDING WITH BEES and or LAVA YOU MAY INCURR LEGAL LIABILITIES and or BE CHARGED WITH CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IANAL your mom Ok so obviously there are some stupid limitations because of laws and ethics fucking but the demand for housing isn t going away any time soon and despite what the government said last week about how this is definitely not a bubble there is no war in ba sing sae some animals are more equal than others I can t read that might not be what they said at some point the eviction foreclosure moratorium is either going to be kicked forward again or will actually end why does this angry phantom keep screaming 2008 in my ear this is nothing https www investopedia com personal finance american debt mortgage debt like that And yes I know this bull market is going to run forever and our system is now Totally Secure Don t Worry but speaking as someone who s now lived through 3 once in lifetime financial calamities I m not entirely sold on the never ending prosperity thing This is a really long winded way of saying that rental property may not be a terrible investment in the near future to circle back to my original point BUT I DON T HAVE THE CAPITAL TO BUY A RENTAL PROPERTY OUTRIGHT AND THE BANK DOESN T RECOGNIZE MY INCOME FROM GIVING HANDJOBS BEHIND THIS WENDY S HOW CAN I BENEFIT FROM THIS There are a few ways to easily enter this market gt 1 Try to be born into a family where you can inherit a large sum of money this is a very good strategy and has paid off very well historically If you ve already done this skip to the next section good job gt 2 Have a large sum of money and or income from another source perhaps move to a country such as Amsterdam where there s a more progressive view of your chosen profession gt 3 A Face off situation where you steal a landlords identity I m sure you ve seen the seminal classic starring Nic Cage and John Travolta and it s not necessary to explain this reference any further TLDR this is called a barrier to entry WHAT THE FUCK DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH MONEY OR FORECLOSURES MY BRAIN HURTS FROM ALL THESE WORDS AHHHHH PLEASE JUST SHUT UP JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP Anyway while there s been a moratorium on foreclosures there hasn t been a moratorium on banks doing literally everything up to actually beginning the proceedings Which means that when the moratorium actually ends these cases are all free to be finished rapidly en mass coupled with an overall uptrend in housing prices this seems like it could create a buying opportunity because it doesn t seem like the balance of delinquent to current mortgages is enough to collapse the market not an expert I m an idiot this is speculative If housing prices rise you can charge more for rent If housing prices fall because of overall instability in the market you have a larger stream of potential tenants I see it as a win win My primary apprehension would be the bottom falling out of the market but it would most likely recover eventually and let s be real I m not talking about renting fancy lad houses with updated appliances and indoor plumbing or anything so just BTFD SO WHAT THIS IS SOME SORT OF YOLO FOR RICH PEOPLE MY NET WORTH IS 5 AND A USED CONDOM WRAPPER WHY THE FUCK WOULD I CARE more emojis so the folks who can t read don t lose interest I get it BANG going tits up hit you hard you maxed your credit card to buy GME 380 now your loan shark has repossessed your kidney and your first born child Maybe start a go fund me or an only fans for ape enthusiasts I don t know I m not your life coach Have you tried option 1 in that previous section I really recommend that one Maybe convince some of your roblox friends to go in on this investment with you But I digress Tldr foreclosures buy cheap houses happy economy sort of up charge on rent sad economy more people renting vs buying I m not entirely sure where I m going with this but it seems like this could be a really profitable market to jump into now especially if you re feeling the itis bonus points if you buy property that becomes beachfront thanks global warming All my love Pjorg

see another pump article on the next Chinese Tesla because deliveries I get triggered and have to put on chilled cow on spotify for 3 hours Although entertaining NIO is going to squeeze like GME all aboard comments on stocktwits is making my testicles feel like tiny furrowed cerebrums and not because it s cold AF outside So I had to put together some pleb research on TSLA NIO XPENG amp LI for you to scoff at This is NOT financial advice I just don t like these stocks 1 Positions https imgur com qKMQHBo https imgur com qKMQHBo Yeah my lazy ass needs to switch off A few more 2023s I just went sniping randomly yesterday Full disclosure I also hold and sell CCs on my Tesla shares so this play doubles as somewhat of a hedge for me Sorry not up to YOLO standards I m a lil biatch 2 The Chosen Ones NIO amp XPENG Did you ever look at TSLA and think god damn that shit is overpriced Then look at the price to sales and realize holy fuck it is Then looked at it a month later and the price doubled Well guess what NIO and XPENG are trading even higher than TSLA Current PS as of 2 10 2021 TSLA 25 NIO 40 XPENG 41 LI 19 It s because their flagship SUV is hybrid electric ICE insane PS reserved for pure bloods only Let s compare These guys aren t coding the next Gran Turismo 8 but let s look at high margin tech anyways NFLX 10 ABNB 28 PLTR 72 peter pan stock Actual automotives old

Before we get into the nuts and butts there is always the risk lotto upside in our case that macros choke and correct gt 20 because of some black swan I mean it s 2020s Murphy has been trying to prove a point When this happens we know what gets hit hardest the ones with the high forwarding looking rosy multiples These EV stocks will get beat up worse than that washed up highschool varsity prom king s girlfriend Some other lotto events include China stocks being delisted and who can forget the audit risk on those poorly cooked books but enough to win the Great Chinese Bake Off Can they grow Revenues though Let s look 3 Revenue Growth Stunted You might be one of those Stocktwats and you re thinking but but they ll ramp deliveries exponentially and grow Revenues just like TSLA did back in 2018 Smacks you in the face no they won t and here is why Chinese people love brand name shit I repeat Chinese people love brand name shit Quantitatively go look at LVMH sales in China The figures on Chinese tourists going on vacation spending without looking at the price tag naw they definitely check for them deals is incredible They re not there to look at some antiquated tower way better architecture back home they tryin to get those furry Gucci Slips on discount they are ugly AF btw Tesla is no different people worship Musk over there You could probably sell his panties online and some Chinese billionaire will pay millions for it just like they did for his Gene Wilder house in LA Qualitatively I called my cousins in China confirmed he couldn t stop jizzing at the slight mention of Tesla Why does this matter Owning a TSLA is like owning any other brand name shit in China social status Social status is EVERYTHING to much more of the population in China vs RoW The biggest difference is you re not going to be able to buy a knock off TSLA in some shady cigarette smoking thug s closet on the 2nd floor of a Chinese dumpling street stand TSLA just ramped the Model Y in China and started deliveries in Jan That shit sold out in a matter of days https electrek co 2021 01 06 tesla sells out model y electric suv china If you re not buying one you basically have to settle for an uglier wife this is probably not much of an exaggeration Well guess who has been selling mostly midsize SUVs without much competition from TSLA and achieving recording breaking deliveries up until now NIO 100 SUVs Xpeng 40 SUVs Brand aside some triggered specs nerd out there is thinking Well ultimately people will decide based on specs and value not brand alone Fine let s take a look at what aspects of an EV people care about Let s break it down apples to apples for these SUV EVs Tesla Model Y Price 52 800 Range 594 km Kilometers for the apes 0 100km Acceleration 5 1s Charger network 20 000 NIO EC6 Price 57 200 Range 430 km 605 if you pay 9k for a bigger battery 0 100km Acceleration 5 4s Charger network 290 Xpeng G3 520 Price 30 580 Range 520 km 0 100km Acceleration 8 6s Charger network 866 You may be thinking the G3 520 s price tag is looking pretty attractive Then you imagine the future wife you ll be banging yeah trade up for that Tesla boi But JJ NIO has battery swap tech It s perfect for China s dense cities If you know anything about product market fit battery swapping for EVs is like trying to bang a gerbil s anus First of all battery swap stations are way more expensive to build stock and maintain Crazy upfront build out costs and battery requirements kill your rate of expansion shit is important for demand Tesla superchargers are spreading like wildfire https www scmp com business companies article 3120578 tesla starts v3 supercharger production new shanghai factory and become recurring revenue generators over time while battery swap stations stay cost centers over time breakeven at best That s why NIO tries to charge a 150 subscription fee I d rather get pornhub subs for the whole family Oh btw you can t even do it yourself you have to give it to a service technician to do the swapping for you Be realistic these wealthy classist Chinese dirtbags I m Chinese and know some first hand don t want some lowlife service tech to sit on their mothball leather Back to battery swapping and product market fit Look Tesla tried this in 2013 https techcrunch com 2013 06 20 tesla shows off a 90 second battery swap system wants it at supercharging stations by years end guccounter 1 amp guce referrer aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8 amp guce referrer sig AQAAAE0JxnRip8JKTQ9hYnvdEiU EGgAt6RW47Mq0A7ZuzTcGFLVQKn NUtf1M3CkQ2cr8dUxg3JtIp

Great British Bake Off while you wait In 20 fuckin 13 some of you were still going through behavioral therapy and reading Robinhood as a picture book Lastly the people buying EVs above the 50k range have easy access to charging especially Tesla s network So battery swapping for cars above 50k is serving a niche market a handicap and a money losing operation But JJ China EV Market Growth They may have a smaller share right now but the Pie grows for everyone Maybe but if you look at the 2020 EV market growth https insideevs com news 481465 china plugin car sales december 2020 most of that came from guess who Tesla Oh and a 8k mini pretty much a golf kart that Tyrian would be uncomfortable in Solar amp batteries are money losing businesses right now for Tesla but people are pricing in some of those rosy projections into the valuation Nio and Xpeng haven t even hinted at the idea because people in China live in 3D printed skyscraper boxes Home solar and battery doesn t make sense but this also means no revenue opportunity Oh and let s not forget about autonomy no let s forget about it for now International expansion you say Sure Nio and Xpeng trying to expand oversees to Norway No way has the population size of a small Indian wedding Let s be honest here would americans buy a made in china EV over a Tesla or even Ford GM EV I m Chinese and I wouldn t even fuckin touch that shit Back to Cars to make matters worse for Chinese EV players Tesla has already designed a budget model https insideevs com news 486843 tesla confirms 25k car sold globally Unfortunately it ll be hard like wiping ass with sandpaper for Xpeng and Nio is follow suite in this space because of MARGINS Let s look at this next 4 Your margin is my opportunity JB Retiree History lesson how did China become 2 in GDP globally They industrialized their massive population kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports Sure quality suffered but everything was made in china at some point This is all to say you can always increase demand by reducing price and you can optimally reduce price if you have better margins than your competitors or have the cash to sustain a loss to not bleed out before they do Let s look at the current state of margins Q3 2020 Gross Margins Tesla 23 5 Nio 12 9 Xpeng 4 6 Li Auto 19 8 We ll have to revisit Q4 margins when everyone reports in a few weeks But wow it s not even close for Nio and Xpeng This is not even taking out Tesla s solar amp battery margins which are negative like when your mom finds out you YOLOed your college tuition on redacted at 400 But JJ that s not fair Nio and Xpeng are still ramping First of all so is Tesla just on a larger scale I mean they are building factories like Starbucks locations But fine just taking a peak at margins for Tesla in earlier ramp years 2017 18 9 2016 22 8 2015 22 8 This may not look right something must be wrong you re thinking Well let s we take a look under the hood you won t find Trayvon Martin Battery is the main cost of an EV Tesla has been working on battery tech from the beginning they invented and are retiring the skateboard design saying it s obsolete https www teslarati com tesla retires skateboard vs structural batteries because they got something better while Chinese EV companies are busy copying it Ay caramba For the batteries them selves just look at battery output distribution Both Nio and Xpeng rely on CATL for their batteries in China But so does everyone else at an Indian wedding including Tesla Either everyone is going to be supply limited or someone is going to have to pay more You can pay more when you have better margins to work with bleed cash At least Tesla will have their own way out soon enough https imgur com ZacBvhz https imgur com ZacBvhz Can you find Nio Xpeng or Li Waldo Tesla s electronics are industry leading Mario knows https www teslarati com tesla model 3 sandy munro analyst data video Neo and Xpeng on the other hand outsources most of the Chips Nvidia and hardware Mobile eye When you outsource you ultimately have less margin control speed and ability to freely synergize Tesla is also literally stamping entire cars https electrek co 2020 08 25 tesla start operations worlds largest casting machine like crispy cream donuts It s almost if Chinese EVs are trying to take on Megatron s fuckin Fusion Cannon with blow darts Nio on the other hand abandoned plans to make their own factory https www theverge com 2019 3 5 18252244 nio ev startup factory shanghai cancelled jac motors due to cash shortage and partnered with JAC https cntechpost com 2020 12 05 how does nio build cars A short term plat that won t help margins in the long run You know how Tim Apple gets a hard on every time he talks about service margins EVs have some of that too In car entertainment Tesla is building an app store while Nio and Xpeng outsources EV Charging Tesla has the biggest network Nio has losing battery swap while Xpeng relied on and pays government network Connectivity Startlink shrugs Autonomous driving Tesla is rolling out subs for FSD and I wouldn t trust Nio and Xpeng s software with your wife s boyfriend s life 5 Closing Look Nio is backed by Tencent and Bidu Xpeng is backed by Ali Their balance sheets pass the acid test with flying colors so they can bleed cash for awhile But Tesla has a meme lord at the helm Let s not forget some of the giant local players like BYD who is backed by Bigly Buffet himself There is also SAIC Great Wall Geely BAIC Chang Jiang Kandi and dozens more names you don t know just like the name of your cousin s mail in bride Tesla copy cats are literally coming out of the woodworks when buyers have a paradox of choice the clear pick defaults back to the trusted brand guess who CCP has already been 3 steps ahead of Biden I mean who isn t lol and EV bullish years ago Matter of fact EV subsidies which Nio and Xpeng survive off of like a bums on opioids in the streets of San Francisco are already getting cut by 20 in 2021 and phased out by 2022 https fortune com 2021 01 05 china electric vehicle subsidies sales tesla I ll let you figure out what happens to deliveries when subsidies get cut again comes back to magins and cash If it comes down to EV price wars I don t think it ll be Nio and Xpeng winning the bleed out It ll be more like Matrix 3 rather than 1 I m no voodoo magic chart nerd but Nio tested 65 resistance again yesterday and failed Xpeng in general looks like it s peaked Google search interest has spiked and all the little virgin armchair analysts on YouTube have pumped it 10 times over I ll wait for their earning numbers in a few weeks to take the temperature again I ll likely add more to the position then will update At the end of the day Nio and Xpeng may trade sideways for much longer than I can stay solvent but fuck it I ve spent too much time on this so sunk cost is set in hard change my mind TL DR Not sure when but bet on EV bubble popping with Puts on Nio and Xpeng Better to sit on the side lines for Tesla and Li Auto

Member Hello fellow degenerate gambler May I introduce you to the Reliable Mediocrity newsletter for the trading week ending on February 19th We hope that this email finds you well and not completely dead from last week s weed stock boom For those of you who haven t figured it out yet don t go in on a stock when it is already massively outside its moving averages While we are on that note I would not NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE pulling out gains from C C the Fourth MARA and RIOT to balance your earnings While all three may continue to rise always know how much of your unrealized gains that you are willing to lose I note this because last week was an absolute smoke show If you believe in the long term adoption of Voldemort keep your RIOT and MARA because they will likely dominate the next couple years From last week if you followed along and pulled your plays you definitely cashed in big time RIOT 76 MARA 44 C C the Fourth 15 CVS 4 31 This week we are going to be looking into some of our earnings plays that could give us a solid pop leading into announcements Personally I believe the meme stocks are dead and that earnings are going to be our plays for the next few weeks until there is notable news coming out of new sectors If you don t want to get off the meme stock bandwagon be prepared for some massive roadblocks Large institutions are riding the waves of meme stocks to cash in Do you really think that retail investors have the money to move TLRY from 28 64 in one week Of course they don t Big money hops in with major cash looking to get a quick buck They buy at 32 it pumps and then they dump it all for a fast guaranteed profit Are marijuana stocks going to rise through the Biden presidency YES But there won t be any movement that fast time and significant change in an organic way ACB Long Hold 1 21 2022 25 Strike I believe in weed stocks for real I do NOT believe that last week was anything to realistically expect in the future If you want to make big bucks in weed you need to pay for the Theta There is no guarantee on when federal legalization will occur but we all know it s coming with so many states already legalizing recreational marijuana I chose ACB because they re a stable business who has an extremely volatile stock If they can return to their 2018 highs we are going to cash in massively NOTE The TLRY APHA merger is tempting but buying APHA in hopes of cashing in on the arbitrage 83 86 of TLRY depending on who you believe The risk for APHA is obviously that the TLRY price drops near merger and absolutely screws your play That being said APHA is currently trading at 58 49 of TLRY so the numbers are on your side if the merger happens in the near future I have a feeling the merger won t happen until 4 20 at the earliest You think I m joking but imagine the news that would create Weed stonks merge on the most sacred of all days ARKF Yes specifically Fintech RIOT and MARA have been crushing lately but they re just one component of the financial technology future The real financial future will be diversified between normal fiat currency technology becoming more simplified through cloud based payment systems and digital wallets in general The digital wallet market has just opened up and this can be seen through the success of Square Apple Pay Shopify etc When the general population as a whole transitions to these which will happen the fintech market will absolutely explode Is ARKF a one week play absolutely not but it s almost guaranteed to continue its meteoric rise My play is HEAVY in shares The premiums for 1 21 2022 options are about 10 share ATM and 5 share OTM at 43 of current trading price Depending on what your goal here is I m going to say that shares are probably both safe AND a good investment for the future Worth noting ARKF is up 44 in the last 3 months If you re willing to gamble on that to continue those 1 21 2022 85 strikes are gold CCL 3 12 24 5 Strike Carnival Cruise Lines is boring as hell there is no denying this It s time that we finally admit that we all want to be in on the return of cruise lines Where are they going Up When is the question I m going a month out and here is why Dr Genius Fauci says it will be open season for vaccinations of the general public by April The reason I m looking at 3 12 is because people are going to start hopping on the stock given the future expectations If Fauci s promise is delivered in April it will be open season for cruises again this summer Can we make another play leading into June August for sure but the cost of Theta right now looks a bit steep Next why 24 50 I m shooting here because CCL hit 23 50 for absolutely no reason in early December and only pulled back to around 20 We were heading into all time highs for cases in the US and we all knew it was only going to go up through the holidays Next if you ve been watching the news you have seen the MASSIVE decline in new cases occurring throughout the US This is a massively huge moment for all travel and leisure related companies But most of all massive for cruise lines This makes it VERY likely that CCL will cruise its way back up to 23 24 If you want to be safe hit that 23 5 mark As always don t exercise your options Also if you re up 50 just cash out and move on to the next play Know your numbers and risk accordingly ZNGA Just hear me out 1 21 2022 20 Strike ZNGA has been recommended as a Best Buy through MF on multiple occasions The hype of that alone is enough to keep it rolling for months to come The MF followers buy and hold for long periods of time ZNGA is a massively successful mobile gaming company that is up 76 82 on the year They recently announced they would be moving into multi platform gaming to diversify their gaming experiences ZNGA makes most of their money from micro transactions that are small and frequent They have shown that they are going to control the majority of the mobile gaming market For the record this might hit it might not hit but the cost is only 0 40 at current position I m looking to play a bunch of these and pull out around 75 100 just keeping a few in hopes of a big OTM ITM play Notable Mentions More dangerous given their recent success C C the Fourth This guy is still a total toss up I m pulling some of my shares because if the acquisition doesn t happen I m not willing to risk it all That being said I m going to hold 20 ish on the off chance of a meteoric rise post acquisition RIOT amp MARA I truly believe in the technology here and I will continue to hold unless there is some sort of massive ban on their technology Also multiple large institutions have stated their interest in acquiring large sums of Voldemort for free cash holdings similar to Tesla s action last week If this occurs RIOT and MARA will continue to explode Sincerely Lehman Brothers Risk Management Department p s Watch CVS and PLTR cause they re about to pop but it s too late for you

market cap ,Hello again lazy slush brained degenerates I m putting rocket emojis just for you guys I know you love them TLDR There are a few short term catalysts that can propel this sleeper stock to the moon Buy INTC on Tuesday or wait till the end of the week and see if I am right and its at near 70 and buy then Or just wait till its already overvalued and spiked parabolically to enter as usual Yesterday I expressed but not nearly enough how Intel is like a beautiful meal You got an appetizer yesterday with Mobileye and today I planned on giving you a dessert focused on Intel s AI machine learning neural network play but ill leave that for another day like I will with the main dish Data Ill wait for the price to be more ripe which it will in the coming weeks to expose these valuable long term prospects for the legacy chipmaker I think you will take my valuations more seriously when INTC is around 70 per share Today I want to look at possible catalysts for INTCs 2021 bull run 1 The most obvious is one that is already partially in play and also partially responsible for INTCs 24 YTD returns The changing of leadership at Intel As you might know this Monday markets closed Pat Gelsinger officially takes over as CEO of Intel Catalyst 1 1 was his appointment catalyst 1 2 is him stepping in officially as CEO and his first announcements When he stepped in for the earnings call last month he mentioned he had many ideas and thoughts that he would share publicly when he was officially in the role and had a chance to look through things more carefully which he has been doing lately There is guaranteed to be interesting chatter in the grapevines this coming week If you believe Pat is one of the good ones this chatter is bound to be positive Ill leave your uncreative brains to think of the myriad possibilites of the things Pat can say in the first few days weeks that can tremendously impact the market price and corporate perception Small side note the leadership change is not exclusive to Pat there are several top silicon valley pros coming back at Pats request some returning from retirement INTC knows it has been hit and is rallying its troops All hands on deck to get this shit rolling back to the top These people don t fuck around and they bleed Intel 2 Semiconductor shortage As you may or may not know there is a relatively large chip shortage that is affecting many industries GM for example had to shut down two of its plants recently but this is not just affecting the auto industry it is affecting dozens of different industries some more than others What does this mean for Intel Well Intel makes chips They have the largest foundries in the world and there are at least a handful of ways a company like Intel can leverage this situation to their advantage 3 This one is at least in part linked to the second point but goes beyond that Biden administration intervention in the US semiconductor industry Last week the SIA Semiconductor industry association sent a letter to President Biden calling for governmental support of the industry Please read the one page letter and your conclusion will be the same as mine This rally call is exceptionally bullish for the industry https www semiconductors org wp content uploads 2021 02 SIA Letter to Pres Biden re CHIPS Act Funding pdf https www semiconductors org wp content uploads 2021 02 SIA Letter to Pres Biden re CHIPS Act Funding pdf It is especially bullish though for one of the signatories of the letter Intel Intel unlike AMD actually makes the chips and does not outsource the production to a foreign company a Taiwanese company for that matter risks associated with this I have discussed in another post Having an actual American fab is extremely big both short term and long term This is a national asset and Intels future and well being is intertwined with Americas Any Presidential administration will come to this conclusion What does this mean It is in the best interest of the United States for Intel to be bigger richer and more dominant than TSMC and there are many ways American top brass can go about this Expect tax breaks and subsidies soon that will asymmetrically impact Intel positively In fact as part of Covid relief packages you can expect executive action pretty here pretty soon 4 Look at the power of memes and momentum over the last year The market has been permanently tainted and so the unexpected can happen Intel is one of the few profitable tech companies that has not shot parabolically yet although from a technical standpoint its starting to hint at that this year Soon people especially retail will want a play that hasn t already been exhausted that can still give them strong returns I mean is it really appetizing to buy TSLA or even AMD after they have multiplied so much There is a cognitive bias for a pre parabolic company with potential and in a parabolic industry semis This bias may not be super rational but if price action continues to side with INTC it will be part of the reinforcement process for the potential parabolic play You get this stock to be memetic and it flies 5 Strong market correction As you know many smart and stupid analysts have been predicting a crash since last March They have all turned out to be wrong so far Last week though several bearish indicators started reappearing from bearish insider transaction numbers yield on the 10 year and the bizarre VIX action To be clear I do not think the market will crash anytime soon and I m quite bullish on all sectors for the coming months so long as the fed and white house play along and they have no reason to not until inflation actually passes 2 or something crazy happens with commodities including that coin that cant be named In any case in the event a crash happens INTC will be in a much better position than most Speculation in the stock is low for now large long term boomer holders The company has very little debt and is extremely cash rich It can self fund all its operations for years and even lose revenues Essentially Intel is an underleveraged company AMD and NVIDIA for example are much more leveraged companies as is normal with rapidly growing tech companies The reality is a market crash would damage the competition much more than it would INTC and it could even benefit Intel s market share Further if the correction is not a full blown panic it is quite possible that Intel may actually appreciate in price as the majority of the nasdaq depreciates again due to risk perception and lack of leverage Intel can easily be seen as a safehaven I get it its not easy for you to part with your emotional investment in NVIDIA and AMD besides they have treated you spectacularly especially the past year You like their product and are angry at the fact INTC has been treating their retail customers poorly the last few years You are sick of the machinations of the INTC leadership and their total focus on losing track of the most important thing product quality Don t let the past cloud your judgment for future investment opportunities You see Intel has its tentacles in everything that matters related to chips They truly are Chipzilla as you will discover in time Come back to this post when Intel opens Tuesday up 2 and closes the week up 10 sniffing 70 per share I reiterate my position 1700 shares 500 April 16 80 strike calls and 50 February 26 65 strike calls

There s a lot of chatter about AMC and whether it ll pop or it ll dive This is an attempt to establish the facts and figure out what s the roadmap to tendies from here on tl dr for those on a multicoloured crayon diet AMC is not dead nor will it die anytime soon There s plenty of positive catalysts coming up If you want to get in this play right away then better buy shares because IV is very high at the moment 5 seems like a price floor If you do want to buy calls I suggest Aug expiry between 7 9 or better yet LEAPS Jan 22 at 10 12 My position is 15 000 shares at about 2 40 I m waiting for IV to drop a bit before I buy LEAPS Let s start at the beginning AMC is the largest movies operator in the world It has 1 004 theatres and 11 041 screens worldwide The biggest by far They made 43bn revenue for movie studios in 2019 What we know from the Q3 2020 results After 5 months suspension of Operations theatres started to reopen First domestic theatres reopened 8 20 and int l ones as early as June However most of Europe has been in lockdown since Nov Dec 2020 and all domestics operate on a 20 40 limited capacity As of Oct 30th it operated 539 600 domestic locations and 261 358 int l locations Record high scores in cleanliness of theatres March 2020 raised 900m in debt and equity 1bn concessions from creditors and landlords 80m asset sales Q1 of 2020 drew down 325m from existing credit lines April 2020 issued 500m of debt due 2025 Suspended cash repurchase and dividends Received 7m in tax cash refunds July 2020 debt exchange reduced debt by 555m reduced interest expenses by 120m for one year up to July 2022 extended maturities on 1 7bn of debt until 2026 and issued 300m of new debt due 2026 August 2020 sold Baltic region theatres for 77m Sept 2020 sold 15m shares for 56 1m Oct 2020 sold another 15m shares for 41 6m Dec 2020 Prepared 50m shares for issuance should they need to Total shares outstanding on Dec 28 2020 were 164m Class A and 51 8m Class B Jan 2021 Total shares outstanding as of Jan 22 2021 were 287 276 58 Class A and 51 8m Class B Class B can t be sold unless converted to Class A Jan 27th SLA converts debt into equity and sells 600m worth of shares in the market Total shares added to float 44 4m Debt reduced by 600m Feb 5th 2020 Wanda converted it s class B shares to class A shares This means they can sell them in the market at any time now There is no specific on how many shares it converted but we know it owned 51 8m of Class B shares Operationally they proceeded with layoffs and a series of cost cutting measures renegotiated theatre leases eliminate contractor roles and all sorts of expenses This is important as these savings will persist throughout the reopening of the theatres so they will improve their profit margins going forward Cash position on 9 30 417 9m Total debt on 9 30 5 82bn Q amp A with myself Are people really returning to theatres Attendance was 6 5m tickets in Q3 2020 vs 87 1m in Q3 2019 representing about 7 5 of seating capacity which was limited to about 20 40 of total seats While this may look like they are not utilizing their existing seating capacity remember that theatre ops in USA were suspended for 2 3 of the 3rd quarter I am guessing no data a similar restriction at the international theatres Had ops not been suspended for 2 3 of Q3 then we d be seeing roughly 3x the tickets about 19 5m or 22 of total seating capacity That would suggest people were returning to cinemas before the end of Sept 2020 That s despite no blockbusters playing Only 2 films were released theatrically since mid March to end of Sept and theatres were open mostly on weekends so there wasn t much to watch anyway Are people spending at the theatres Average ticket prices in Q3 2020 were 9 37 VS 9 45 in Q3 2019 so pretty much the same In Int l markets ticket prices were actually higher at 9 80 vs 8 45 Spending on food and beverage was the same in USA at 5 35 patron in both Q3 2020 and Q3 2019 and higher in int l markets 4 10 patron vs 3 59 patron in Q3 2019 Again that s positive in relation to how customers feel about AMC managing the cleaning of its theatres and safety practices That level of spending suggests people are comfortable watching movies and eating drinking in the theatres From the Q3 ER call The critical movie leading markets of Los Angeles and New York City remain closed There has been massive focus on improving liquidity and deleveraging the balance sheet and cutting costs and spending A lot of those cost saving and spending cuts will continue even after revenue recovers which means higher profit margins which means higher EPS which means lower multiples to comps which means share price will go up as it will be perceived as cheap Stroke a deal with Universal for a PVOD window Basically that means that AMC will not exclusive rights to play movies for 74 days at theatres before the movie can go on video on demand The time window is shortened and after that you will have movies both on theatres and on demand online at the same time AMC will take a cut for any movies that go on PVOD before the theatrical release period ends As they said later in November they have made more money with the PVOD deal than the standard exclusive theatrical release Theatre count in Middle East tripled in 2020 and it will further double in the first half of 2021 Cash burn for Q3 2020 was 324m inclusive of the costs for raising capital 44 major film titles have been rescheduled to play theatrically only in 2021 Once theatres reopen say in summer there will be a blockbuster every single week and some more They have gotten out of 40 loss making theatres in USA as well by not renewing leases Breaking even In 2019 AMC sold 17 of their available seats and had the biggest revenue profit of any year ever It all hinges to NYC and LA reopening basically as other individual theatres break even at 25 capacity What this means is that you don t need COVID restrictions to lift fully before AMC starts making profits you only need LA and NYC to reopen This makes AMC a bit of a dark horse because most people will be waiting for full economy reopen before they jump at the stock but its financials will be in the black long before then and that means that it will most likely surprise upwards on ER going forward and exceed wallstreet s expectations Innovation Ok they will reopen but will they grow They have launched a private theatre rental program where you can book the whole auditorium They have had 80 000 incquiries about it and that s with a soft launch no press releases yet or advertising There have been a lot of articles in the second half of 2020 about Amazon or Netflix partnering or buying them out That would drive the price high instantly Bear in mind that the streaming giants are facing pressure on growing their market share and AMC makes perfect sense Also given their balance sheets the financial risk of buying AMC out at roughly 2bn market cap is negligible Won t streaming kill the movie theatres No absolutely not AMC provided 43bn of revenue to film makers in 2019 No studio will forgo that kind of revenue In fact from the pilot testing of PVOD they ve done it s actually more lucrative for both theatres and studios to have a short exclusive theatrical release followed by concurrent streaming than either or It s a new model of releasing movies and a much more profitable one In summary streaming will actually increase profits for AMC not take away any Ok that may be true for the big blockbuster Avenger type movies but what about smaller releases won t they be best stream only No they have tested the PVOD deal with small releases e g Kajilionaire which made under 10m revenue in cinemas and the combined profit for studios AMC was higher than the older model or what it d have done streaming alone Analyst ratings According to marketbeat 4 sell and 6 hold AMC has the lowest by far P E ratio against its competitors This means it is perceived as cheap Earnings date 25 Feb amp x200B Major shareholders Blackrock 2 9 increased it s position by 70 Vanguard 4 5 reduced its position slightly by 5 Mittleman 1 Norther Trust 0 5 increased position by 40 Stifel 0 2 increase position by 285 Bank of NY Mellon 0 2 Wells Fargo 0 15 Charles Schwab 1 increased its position by 10 Goldman Sachs 0 6 increased position by 160 Risks Further dilution in case AMC decides to sell more shares This can be avoided if theatres start reopening faster or attendance picks up With vaccinations underway in USA we should soon hear about LA and NYC reopening NYC already lifte some restrictions in hospitality People are worried about dilution but do remember that shareholders were happy to pay high prices for those shares so they believe they bought in cheap and they aren t all idiots Debt holders pushing hard on AMC However this is unlikely to their benefit as any restructuring will take forever and they stand to lose a lot through a prolonged asset sale It s preferable for debt holders to convert debt to equity and sell and for that they d need a good high stock price Further COVID lockdowns because of new variants or whatnot amp x200B Catalysts Definite Vaccination roll out means NYC and LA announce reopening of theatres soon Possible Esports partnerships Who knows Buyout or partnership with Netflix Amazon or Disney Other Short interest remains high I believe it was around 68 on 1 31 but someone may correct me if I got this wrong In any positive newsflow the shorts will be pressed a bit People are gagging to go to the cinema AMC has had it s best revenue year after year up to 2019 They are not a dying business by any stretch of the imagination amp x200B amp x200B Any error you see or
