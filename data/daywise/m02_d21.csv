should proceed forward operationally,Warning Disclaimer This shit is long Also not financial advice Hopefully it s ok to post this here I have lurked for a while recently actually joined the sub This is not as much market analysis as it is an analysis of how GameStop has failed as a company in the past and what we as investors should push GameStop to do in the future to encourage company growth If you like the stock I d like to think that this is a collection of reasons as to why you should like the stock I m going to try and simplify this as much as possible So I used to work at GameStop and was an assistant manager ASL for a while I will make it clear that this does not make me an expert on everything that goes on within the company and I make no claims to that kind of knowledge I just have experience with how the store operates on a day to day basis and how individual GameStop stores make money This is how GameStop stores make money in a nutshell Pre owned game accessory console sales Trades though this has lessened greatly due to stores halting trading due to Covid Collectible sales Think T Shirts Funko Pops statues Pokemon cards Upsells replacement plans PRP disc protection GPG pro membership and that s pretty much it Most everything else in the store has significantly smaller profit margins except maybe some accessories GameStop buys games at 59 95 and sells them for 60 pretty much At least as far as I know I m sure there are exceptions to this The problem with this model is that especially because of the pandemic the gaming market is rapidly becoming a digital playing field It was steadily becoming that even before Covid but Covid certainly accelerated this Most of my day at work was selling PSN and Xbox cards to people which we make basically nothing on and is also impossible to upsell Not only is this an issue but GameStop also has this vicious internal cycle with their employees It is well known they treat their employees not great This can be summed up into stores not meeting numbers because their upsells aren t really beneficial to the customer and also because employees see no cut of the success beyond a pat on the back and the fact that they get to keep their job Employees get chewed out if they don t meet what can seem like impossible expectations and this rapidly turns into employees sales tactics becoming forced and desperate which results in a negative relationship with the customer Stores are also very small physically with a very small amount of employees It s hard to sell well when you have 20 things to do that day that don t involve customer interaction This kind of store corporate relationship leads to high turnover and gamestop customers feeling uncomfortable during register interactions which lessens the amount of returning customers which makes numbers harder to hit Like I said vicious cycle So the question is how does GameStop fix these things I think that casting their net wider is something that has been suggested hinted at and something that they should be doing however I think they are wary to do so GameStop has tried this in the past they just cast their net in the wrong direction by purchasing companies like Simply Mac They shouldn t be investing in pre owned phones but if they want to keep the pre owned model and also have happier employees there is something they can do I think that the easiest way to explain this is to look at a company with a similar business model that is vastly more successful and has much better PR I also used to work for this company and the same disclaimer as GameStop above applies here as well Have you heard of Micro Center before If you live in the US you probably have they re a small retail chain that sells a wide variety of tech hardware and software but they re best known for selling PC components brick and mortar which is kind of a rarity these days For the most part everyone loves Micro Center Employees are knowledgeable and friendly they act like they actually want to be there and they sell cool stuff So what does Micro Center do right Commissioned employees and employee training that doesn t just involve around selling larger physical stores less stores in general and waaaay more employees per store their upsells actually make sense and benefit the end user Micro Center is a company that cast their net in the right direction Sure there is stuff they aren t very profitable on but they still continue to sell it in case a customer wants to buy it in the future They have a big enough selling floor that it s easy to hang onto years old inventory On the stuff they do sell their margins are razor thin but they make up for that by selling stuff alongside these items that have HUGE margins and that customers are almost guaranteed to buy think thermal paste with a processor or video cables adapters with a GPU or monitor purchase Not only is this beneficial to them but their upsells which are very similar to gamestop s just a little more complex are cheaper than gamestop s by the dollar are much easier to take advantage of and have better policies in general This makes more customers buy these upsells if they are presented properly Sales employees are also on commission Some people may see this as a downside but it is a big upside for the company and while it can inconvenience employees it s part of having a sales job Employees are competitive and very friendly with customers The business model for selling I won t get into the nitty gritty here encourages employees to help customers purchase within their budget or save money so there is not an issue of overselling for the most part The employees they attract are often usually enthusiasts who are genuinely interested in what they are selling and often excited to sell not just for the money but because it s fun for them and the customer They also delegate most operating tasks like the register and inventory to hourly employees who don t sell Micro Center isn t perfect by any means but they are coming out of the pandemic much better than GameStop In fact they grew during the pandemic some of this was just due to new hardware launches but it was also due to customers desperately needing equipment to work from home like laptops headsets microphones All in all they profited from the pandemic and they still did pretty well with social distancing cleanliness guidelines even if customers weren t that happy about it sometimes So what can GameStop learn from Micro Center Maximize profit product margin in any way you can Micro Center will literally buy out warehouses of old product to sell in stores even if it isn t necessarily part of their main market Last holiday they had a bunch of drone toys that were like 5 a pop They weren t great but they were 5 and they sold like hotcakes cuz they were five bucks They also sell drinks and snacks a lot of them being the kind of drinks and snacks that nerds tend to enjoy G Fuel Hi Chew and Pocky being excellent examples In lieu of the above GameStop needs to pinpoint its market and cater to it by selling shit they will actually buy Impulse buys are an important part of this stop selling so much third party stuff and sell lower quality stuff from your own brand name Not everything needs to be super fancy sometimes consumers just want say a 10 pair of earbuds with a mic versus a schmancy 50 headset I will admit to not knowing the intricacies of this but Micro Center cells Inland brand products which is their brand not only in the store but on Amazon as well and the margins on these products are incredibly high while still staying beneath what other places sell them for get bigger stores get less stores This way stores don t have to constantly move product around as much GameStop frequently has stores ship between each other to balance stock you can have more employees per store and you can also have the space to sell more obscure shit instead of sending it back to rot in your warehouse give your employees a cut even if it s not full commission give employees a percentage of upsells and profits and improve your upsells invest in what your dream customer base in interested in I E Esports game streams content creation enthusiast stuff GameStop TV sucks balls if you don t know it s a 45 ish minute stream of ads that runs on repeat Replace that shit with family friendly stream content Your employees will thank you and your customers will spend more time in your store And the last thing is what I was alluding to much earlier If GameStop wants to continue to utilize its pre owned model it needs to adapt to something that CANNOT practically be digital Pre Owned computer hardware Laptops full gaming PCs PC components Of course there are caveats to this Some components probably need to undergo rigorous testing but with larger stores this could very well be an option If they are able to refurbish consoles at their warehouse it is most certainly a possibility Regardless a place other than craigslist to sell pre owned computer stuff would have customers flooding gamestop stores to purchase well loved 1080s and 2016 era gaming rigs for half of what they were worth a couple years ago and GameStop can still make a profit from this A big one Computer parts hold value longer than console stuff and have a much wider market This This is what GameStop needs to do and it s why I fucking like the stock This would be Gamestop casting their net into what is basically a Scrooge McDuck level ocean of cash just waiting to be tapped into This is why you should like the stock As shareholders we NEED to push GameStop in this direction if it is going to survive the steady conversion of media to the digital format I want to see a day where hedge funds don t even want to try to short GME because they know it s got value Whether or not GameStop will do this or anything similar to it is up in the air but we most definitely have the power to influence it If you read all of this I m sorry you had to put up with my naive idealism for so long I don t have a lot of knowledge on the corporate level for these companies but I know what GameStop has done wrong on a store level and what could potentially be done to increase foot traffic profit and in the end how valuable the company is as a whole

1086,loxypj,t2_a01icsie,1613917100,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loxypj/cciv_lucid_fraud_warning/,1,CCIV Lucid fraud warning ,translated from korean article How do you think of 1 Lucid have already revealed all the cars right Lucid has a factory and introduces it as a design model at the headquarters The head office introduces the model and the factory only shows or covers the body frame The factory has never shown a finished car It s exactly the opposite of the way startups should You can only see the model at the headquarters such as the Intellectual Property Promotion Center The CNBC Arizona factory video is also well the back part is a replay of the recorded video they released in the past 2 But they still have a factory The Lucid factory seems to be doing something but if you look closely the employee just does anything such as wiping the dust and does not assemble the robot There may be a major flaw or no money so you can t proceed or for another reason you may be left without final assembly To lead customers you have to make a car now Watch a video that shows off how hard it is making before delivery of the first Tesla Model S customer 3 There are people who have already seen the car outside Lucid works very hard on decals and advertises but few people have seen it on the public road If you are interested in this level you should also be posted on Instagram but there is absolutely nothing You can only watch videos that are invited to an event and move for a while It s easy to build prototypes that don t have performance and move for a while The video that someone saw on the highway is also shown for a moment in poor quality at ultra low speed To pass it over to customers it has already been taken countless times by car paparazzi reporters during road testing and durability testing 4 But the test is real This is the typical behavior of a company with only designers and no engineers Compare Tesla s model S winter test video about 10 years ago with Lucid Air s winter test video Even though Tesla is a startup it tests how well it can slip run and avoid the snow Know exactly what to do On the other hand when you watch Lucid s video the visual beauty is overflowing The video was so full of beauty that I only shot videos where the car slipped and turned around nicely You say it s your AWD won t you sell it in the eastern United States It s unclear what you re doing and we ve made an action movie but let s enjoy the visuals directly 5 Lucid still have the technology Lucid travels twice as far with a smaller stronger motor than the Porsche Taycan the flagship vehicle of the Volkswagen Group s sports car brand which is the No 1 vehicle maker in sales and the No 1 electric car lineup And all these amazing abilities are veiled by the wunderbox When an American interprets the meaning of Bunderbox made in German with a British accent it is amazing box Larger motors produce greater torque unless new motors are invented Oh and the Taycan was the first electric vehicle to have a shifting concept 6 The battery technology The battery actually goes farther by loading it like Musk says As far as it goes the weight of the car becomes uselessly heavy and grows and narrows Therefore if the energy density improves to find and design the optimum point it can go further even in the same rechargeable battery However all lithium polymer batteries that increase energy density are made by companies we know Does Lucid make the battery itself In automobiles not only batteries but also cooling systems and side impact protection are equally important It shouldn t be fired because it s hot or broken But in the introductory material I can t find it so please find someone 7 517mi AER is fact Lucid s mileage was commissioned by FEV and proceeded in EPA mode and 517mi EPA estimated fuel economy is kindly explained on the website as the result of computer modeling happiness circuit FEV This is not a company that certifies fuel efficiency of finished cars but a company that develops motor performance or auto parts performance Will it come out well if it gets EPA fuel economy certification as a finished car Anyway I have doubts whether or not all engineering is left to FEV 8 Just Over spec Does Lucid have a crash test result Whether it s self or authentication you want to know the result of the crash Everyone wants a good car but first it has to be safe Why is it difficult to find a crash test that makes people really curious about the car that boasts so much Conclusion Lucid s videos are similar to commercials from Tesla 10 years ago What s changed is the 4K quality the fact that most of the vehicles have been replaced by CG and the beauty of California s wonderful nature However there is no video showing their car for a long time like Tesla I don t know if the vehicle hasn t been running on the highway yet and hasn t even tested driving To see a car you have to visit the head office to see the model and not the real car a car that is smaller than Tesla but has more interior than the Mercedes S Class an electric car that has a smaller motor than the Porsche Taycan but has a stronger and doubles the speed of the vehicle and is expensive It s a car that has a Lida but doesn t drive autonomously This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell stocks and investment is your choice

Goldman Sachs and Melvin were in the process of profiting from inside information obtained from GME real estate division , Edit They made me my own flair calling me a fgt so I m guessing I m onto something lmao So I was just poking around randomly on Google I found some interesting information that leads me to a retarded ape like conspiracy which by the end of this it will be clear as day to you that it is and it will SWELL conformation bias to the moon faster than TSLA Short end of it I think Gamestop was in the process of closing everything down and I think the real estate division were giving Melvin inside information which is why they went so heavy on the shorts to begin with Yes banks were cohesive in the thought that they would get first dibs at that JUICY small retail stores in

20Preferred 20Partners 20Book 202019 pdf CCIM is a commercial real estate group that basically just puts people together in a room and does conferences and shit I genuinely couldn t believe it when I found it I mean a real estate company trying to get investors and large financial institutions to invest in their products again wall street is just playing checkers while I m stuck trying to figure out why the square peg on the fun shape and pole thing at the pediatricians office in which I ve been going to for 20 years isn t working these guys are 10 steps ahead The PDF starts off innocently Just a thank you note President s Forward and random ads But then it begins to list a directory of members On Page 46 there s a strange coincidence 46 is also the current president we just got Its also 46 is the number that unlocks the Destiny spaceship on the Sci Fi TV show Stargate Universe https en wikipedia org wiki Stargate Universe Dr Rush discovers that the number 46 relates to the number of human chromosomes and begins sequencing different genetic codes to finally gain control of the ship s operating system The episode was called Humans coincidence wikipedia will have to answer for that but controlling the DESTINY space ship gamestop real estate via human chromosomes retards on this sub have extra seems extremely suspicious Gamestop s real estate leasing manager Christopher Morris is listed Right underneath is Scott A Morris of Citadel Partners LLC I was like holy shit when I saw that and I looked into it and Citadel Partners is a real estate group in Texas doesn t seem to be a connection to our evil Citadel overlords Just a really funny coincidence Maybe someone wrinklier brained than I can find an actual connection lol Becuase the connection I m making is two people listed in back to back order in an alphabetical ordered list have the same last name I know at this point your like OP this is beyond sound DD why would the mods flair as shitpost Well here is the smoking duck hunt gun sold for 99 used at gamestop but they will give you 03c store credit to trade one in then I did some other digging and found a RANDOM document https cases primeclerk com

Melvin s accounts It was crazy to me a large bank who is a prime broker handling and trading with a hedge fund this is some 2008 style interweaving that has me thinking its alot bigger than even I have tin foiled this also jumped out at me for a different as I looked into the numbers more fuel to the truth fire here so brace yourseleves https www reference com history 49th 50th states union

theory is these sick fucks literally got two more states ratified to squeeze out more real estate opportunities I looked further into it and found https aum13f com fund melvin capital ii ltd https aum13f com fund melvin capital ii ltd Custodian Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Morgan Stanley amp Co LLC JP Morgan Securities LLC Goldman Sachs amp Co LLC National Financial Services LLC Melvin is in publicly bed with Goldman and JP Morgan I seriously couldn t believe this after theorizing it above I did research and here we are say it with me A prime broker bank works with a hedge fund conducting trades INSANE And it just so happens Jason Butler of JP Morgan Chase bank is also listed in that CCIM real estate group directory I can t find anything about what Jason Butler does except this page which shows him as an analyst https invest arenapharm com analyst coverage https invest arenapharm com analyst coverage its crazy because they managed to get into this site and hack it They managed to change the JP morgan to the analyst BELOW Jason butler so he now works for Jay em Pee not JPM like Jessica Maye does 4d chess is the game now fuck checkers so they made it seem like Jason butler never even worked there So would it be impossible to think that Christopher Morris Gamestop s regional leasing manager Jason Butler an analyst at JP Morgan got together at any one of the events CCIM held in 2014 https www ccim com networking past meetings conferences https www ccim com networking past meetings conferences and had a little discussion about how Gamestop was considering bankruptcy as the digital age may be putting them in a bad position financially nah people talk so that theory is out the window And then at that point word got around to Melvin who s probably paying for information like this from any one of their insider analysts at Goldman or JP Morgan and decided it s a safe bet to start shorting Gamestop Or would a giant bank worth billions do their own fundamental research using tools unavailable to the average trader SPOILER its the latter Then all this shit hits the fan and now Gamestop is doing better than they ve ever done and now have no plans to continue that route of possible bankruptcy and Ryan Cohen swooping in to save the day destroying all of Melvin s hard insider traded tendies It s a cooky theory but plausible in a world where i shoved roughly 10

Frequently Asked Questions Aphria Inc amp Tilray Inc Reverse Acquisition What is a reverse acquisition gt In the press release it says that Aphria shareholders will own approximately 62 of the outstanding shares of Tilray on a fully diluted basis resulting in a reverse acquisition of Tilray gt gt Under the structure of the transaction at closing Tilray Inc Tilray will issue new shares of Tilray in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Aphria Inc Aphria and the Tilray and Aphria businesses will be combined It is a reverse acquisition because Aphria s shareholders will hold approximately 62 of the total equity in Tilray on a fully diluted basis with the existing Tilray shareholders holding approximately 38 gt gt In addition Irwin D Simon the current Chairman amp CEO of Aphria will become the Chairman amp CEO of Tilray Tilray s board of directors will be increased to nine directors seven of which will include Mr Simon and the other six current directors of Aphria representing a majority of the Board When is the transaction expected to close gt The transaction is expected to close in the second calendar quarter of 2021 What happens to my shares in Aphria gt When the transaction is completed each of your Aphria common shares Aphria Shares will be replaced with 0 8381 shares of newly issued common stock of Tilray Tilray Shares You will no longer own any Aphria Shares but instead will own Tilray Shares gt gt As an example if you owned 1 000 Aphria Shares on the closing day of the transaction after the closing you will own 838 Tilray Shares since no fractional shares are issued See the next question for how to value your Aphria Shares in the transaction gt gt We expect that going forward until the transaction closes Aphria s and Tilray s share prices will trade approximately in sync in a ratio of approximately 0 8381 such that for example the value of 1 000 Aphria Shares at any time will equate to the value of approximately 838 Tilray Shares Why am I receiving 0 8381 Tilray Shares for each of my Aphria Shares gt The agreed exchange ratio of 0 8381 reflects the expected ownership of the combined company taking into account the shares outstanding at the date of the announcement at the two companies Tilray currently has approximately 165 387 000 shares outstanding and Aphria has approximately 321 953 000 outstanding each on a fully diluted basis On closing Aphria shareholders will own approximately 62 of the outstanding shares of the enlarged Tilray and existing Tilray shareholders will own approximately 38 In order to achieve that result Tilray will issue approximately 269 841 400 new shares to Aphria shareholders 269 841 400 165 387 000 269 841 400 62 in exchange for their Aphria Shares Accordingly the exchange

value of the Tilray Shares that I receive gt The value of the Tilray Shares that you will receive on closing in exchange for your Aphria Shares will depend on the trading price of Tilray Shares on the day the transaction is completed To help you value what you will receive under the transaction for your Aphria Shares see the example below If you bought your Aphria Shares on the TSX then gt Step 1 Calculate the number of Tilray Shares that you will receive gt gt Calculate the number of Tilray Shares that you will receive on closing by multiplying the number of Aphria Shares that you own by 0 8381 which is the exchange ratio gt gt Step 2 Calculate the value of the Tilray Shares that you will receive in US gt gt Multiply the answer from Step 1 by the value of each Tilray Share which was US 9 33 based on the closing price of the Tilray Shares on the NASDAQ on December 16 2020 the transaction announcement date gt gt Step 3 Calculate the value of the Tilray Shares that you will receive in C gt gt Multiply the answer from Step 2 by the US to C foreign exchange rate since the Tilray Shares currently trade in US This will give you the value of the Tilray Shares to be received in C gt gt As an example assume that gt gt The value of each Tilray Share is US 9 33 1 US dollar 1 2756 Canadian dollar You own 1 000 Aphria Shares 1 000 Aphria Shares X 0 8381 838 Tilray Shares gt gt 838 Tilray Shares X US 9 33 per Tilray Share US 7 820 gt gt US 7 820 X 1 2756 C 9 970 or C 9 97 per Aphria Share that you own If you bought your Aphria Shares on the NASDAQ then gt Step 1 Calculate the number of Tilray Shares that you will receive gt gt Calculate the number of Tilray Shares that you will receive on closing by multiplying the number of Aphria Shares that you own by 0 8381 which is the exchange ratio gt gt Step 2 Calculate the value of the Tilray Shares that you will receive in US gt gt Multiply the answer from Step 1 by the value of each Tilray Share which was US 9 33 based on the closing

US 7 820 or US 7 82 per Aphria Share that you own How do Aphria shareholders benefit from the transaction gt On completion the transaction Aphria shareholders will own 62 of the shares of the combined company which will operate under the Tilray name This means that Aphria shareholders will benefit from 62 of the value expected by Aphria s management to be created by the combined company after closing In particular part of the value that is expected to be created for the Aphria shareholders should come from approximately C 100 million of annual pre tax cost synergies cost savings that are expected to occur in the next 24 months following the completion of the transaction as the businesses are combined Where will the Tilray Shares be listed on completion of the transaction gt Tilray Shares are currently listed on the NASDAQ and trade in US dollars In addition Tilray intends to apply to list the Tilray Shares on the TSX and trade in Canadian dollars so that following the closing Aphria shareholders can continue to trade their new Tilray Shares on either exchange in either currency Will Tilray be included the S amp P TSX Composite Index gt Aphria and Tilray will work with the TSX to determine if Tilray will be included in the S amp P TSX Composite Index following completion of the transaction Do I get to vote on the transaction gt Yes you will have a chance to vote on the transaction at a meeting of shareholders The transaction must be approved by at least two thirds of the votes cast by Aphria shareholders Full details of the transaction will be included in a management information circular of Aphria to be mailed to Aphria Shareholders in the coming weeks What happens if I hold my Aphria Shares in a RESP TFSA or RRSP account gt For Canadian shareholders that hold Aphria Shares in RESP TFSA RRSP or other tax deferred accounts and who have a realized a profit gain on those shares the shares should benefit from the tax deferrals intended for those plans That means you should not be immediately taxed on any net profit you may receive as a result of this transaction Further your new Tilray Shares will remain eligible for inclusion in RESP TFSA and RRSP or other tax deferred accounts gt gt For Aphria shareholders that are U S taxpayers we expect the transaction to be tax deferred gt gt However since your tax circumstances may be unique you should consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences of the transaction on you amp x200B These FAQs were copied directly from Aphria s website Yes I m lazy and just copied and pasted this information here for you However if you are actually reading this sentence right now then I have to assume that you might actually be the lazy one who got something out of this post If so please

s confident and goal set on long term In the Q4 Earnings Presentation Alex Karp started off by saying Palantir s numbers is an lagging indicator of the macro transition that is taking place The person who understand the business and company the most in this world is basically telling you to buy the fking stock as its value is not reflected He then said this software is going to be the future it was a luxury in the past but a necessity now and in the future as companies emerge as winners using Palantir Palantir also helps with company transitions Alex Karp then politely ask short term investors to f off and diss the wallstreet analysts who doubted palantir and how palantir time and time proven itself diss the other tech companies who serve wallstreet and thus failed and also not serving long term goals and average investors basically mentioned confidently on how Palantir is going to strive in the future which also means moon now in the short term due to how undervalued the price is now To end off he mentioned AT LEAST 45 revenue growth for the next 5 years 4 bil revenue or more by 2025 then For those who dont know in Q3 Alex Karp confidently mentioned AT LEAST 30 revenue growth and he delivered 47 revenue growth in Q4 cant post youtube videos Palantir CEO Alex Karp on Software amp Society Overlooked Underestimated Earnings Report amp Fake News This brings me to my next point i have no fking idea how all the media is publishing that PLTR has a 0 08 EPS falling short of expectation of 0 02 The true EPS of PLTR is 0 06 a 200 beat instead Anyway stock employee compensation should not matter when evaluating a growth company you are evaluating the company s performance and revenue performance Stock Employee Compensation is high when the share price is high and it will be reduced significantly as the employees compensation contracts expire in the future The future Earnings Report is going to look insane because since the media and everyone is factoring Employee Stock Compensation now which is a huge cost imagine the Earnings report with at least 45 revenue growth and reduction of Employee Stock Compensation Start of Foundry amp Apollo business Just the beginning

something lmao So I was just poking around randomly on Google I found some interesting information that leads me to a retarded ape like conspiracy which by the end of this it will be clear as day to you that it is and it will SWELL conformation bias to the moon faster than TSLA Short end of it I think Gamestop was in the process of closing everything down and I think the real estate division were giving Melvin inside information which is why they went so heavy on the shorts to begin with Yes banks were cohesive in the thought that they would get first dibs at that JUICY small retail stores in strip malls next to vape shops and INTENSLEY juicy small retail space in the rapidly growing industry of mall foot traffic check this google search of mall foot traffic since march 2020 youll see why

20Preferred 20Partners 20Book 202019 pdf CCIM is a commercial real estate group that basically just puts people together in a room and does conferences and shit I genuinely couldn t believe it when I found it I mean a real estate company trying to get investors and large financial institutions to invest in their products again wall street is just playing checkers while I m stuck trying to figure out why the square peg on the fun shape and pole thing at the pediatricians office in which I ve been going to for 20 years isn t working these guys are 10 steps ahead The PDF starts off innocently Just a thank you note President s Forward and random ads But then it begins to list a directory of members On Page 46 there s a strange coincidence 46 is also the current president we just got Its also 46 is the number that unlocks the Destiny spaceship on the Sci Fi TV show Stargate Universe https en wikipedia org wiki Stargate Universe Dr Rush discovers that the number 46 relates to the number of human chromosomes and begins sequencing different genetic codes to finally gain control of the ship s operating system The episode was called Humans coincidence wikipedia will have to answer for that but controlling the DESTINY space ship gamestop real estate via human chromosomes retards on this sub have extra seems extremely suspicious Gamestop s real estate leasing manager Christopher Morris is listed Right underneath is Scott A Morris of Citadel Partners LLC I was like holy shit when I saw that and I looked into it and Citadel Partners is a real estate group in Texas doesn t seem to be a connection to our evil Citadel overlords Just a really funny coincidence Maybe someone wrinklier brained than I can find an actual connection lol Becuase the connection I m making is two people listed in back to back order in an alphabetical ordered list have the same last name I know at this point your like OP this is beyond sound DD why would the mods flair as shitpost Well here is the smoking duck hunt gun sold for 99 used at gamestop but they will give you 03c store credit to trade one in then I did some other digging and found a RANDOM document https cases primeclerk com

49 and 50 something jumped out at me GOLDMAN SACHS amp CO F A O MELVIN CAPITAL MGMT LP ATTN PRIME BROKER ACCOUNT Idk if it s well known because I had no idea but apparently Goldman Sachs handles Melvin s accounts It was crazy to me a large bank who is a prime broker handling and trading with a hedge fund this is some 2008 style interweaving that has me thinking its alot bigger than even I have tin foiled this also jumped out at me for a different as I looked into the numbers more fuel to the truth fire here so brace yourseleves https www reference com history 49th 50th states union 1c4536c83198f9ac https www reference com history 49th 50th states union 1c4536c83198f9ac YUP the 49th and 50th states in the union are ones that aren t directly connected to the other 48 states My theory is these sick fucks literally got two more states ratified to squeeze out more real estate opportunities I looked further into it and found https aum13f com fund melvin capital ii ltd https aum13f com fund melvin capital ii ltd Custodian Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Morgan Stanley amp Co LLC JP Morgan Securities LLC Goldman Sachs amp Co LLC National Financial Services LLC Melvin is in publicly bed with Goldman and JP Morgan I seriously couldn t believe this after theorizing it above I did research and here we are say it with me A prime broker bank works with a hedge fund conducting trades INSANE And it just so happens Jason Butler of JP Morgan Chase bank is also listed in that CCIM real estate group directory I can t find anything about what Jason Butler does except this page which shows him as an analyst https invest arenapharm com analyst coverage https invest arenapharm com analyst coverage its crazy because they managed to get into this site and hack it They managed to change the JP morgan to the analyst BELOW Jason butler so he now works for Jay em Pee not JPM like Jessica Maye does 4d chess is the game now fuck checkers so they made it seem like Jason butler never even worked there So would it be impossible to think that Christopher Morris Gamestop s regional leasing manager Jason Butler an analyst at JP Morgan got together at any one of the events CCIM held in 2014 https www ccim com networking past meetings conferences https www ccim com networking past meetings conferences and had a little discussion about how Gamestop was considering bankruptcy as the digital age may be putting them in a bad position financially nah people talk so that theory is out the window And then at that point word got around to Melvin who s probably paying for information like this from any one of their insider analysts at Goldman or JP Morgan and decided it s a safe bet to start shorting Gamestop Or would a giant bank worth billions do their own fundamental research using tools unavailable to the average trader SPOILER its the latter Then all this shit hits the fan and now Gamestop is doing better than they ve ever done and now have no plans to continue that route of possible bankruptcy and Ryan Cohen swooping in to save the day destroying all of Melvin s hard insider traded tendies It s a cooky theory but plausible in a world where i shoved roughly 10

www proactiveinvestors co uk companies news 37036 rolls royce wins 1bn nuclear submarine contract from uk government 44277 html Weaknesses COVID 19 The business has taken a big hit from the pandemic as demand for many of the products it sells has fallen most notably in the aerospace sector This is coupled with the fact that now that many businesses are weakened financially they may not feel that the extra expense of RR products are worth it as they operate on a high price high quality pricing strategy it may be that businesses look to cut corners on a cheaper alternative Opportunities Increased focus on automation The company has really been investing in building self driven cars Self driven EVs look to be the future of auto travel and RR is at the cutting edge of the automation required to operate these vehicles It may be that this is deployed in their own line of cars or that the technology is sold to other car manufacturers Focus on green and hybrid vehicles predictably the company is focused on trying to build green and hybrid vehicles and the valuations of similar companies has risen dramatically as progress in this area is made If RR makes some progress catching up to established players such as Tesla then there could be a potential upside in share price New forays into space exploration RR has recently signed a contract with the UK Space Agency to look at the possibility of using nuclear power options in space exploration This is extremely exciting as it shows intent in a sector that looks to make some great growth in the coming years and RR seems to be close to the head of that Threats Focus on sustainability one of the issues with RR is that it does draw some of its income from civil aerospace Following on from the pandemic and the rise of zoom ideas such as the great reset are bringing air travel under fresh scrutiny it is possible that the industry will not recover to pre pandemic heights for some time due to the carbon footprint that flights cause Cost of raw materials some raw material costs rising have been a minor issue in the supply chain Potential upside Rolls royce seems focused on the future If they can mount a good recovery from the COVID crash it seems there could still be a long way to go in terms of share price A share currently trades for under a which shows a great investing opportunity as the stock may find its way back to the 3 4 per share range RR can also be seen as a very long term play This company is on the cutting edge of research and development and it is not inconceivable that new technologies such as electric aircraft may allow them to make leaps and bounds in the coming years Yahoo Finance analysts provide a very mixed bag of recommendations in the attached image although the analysts price targets show a very different story as the lowest estimate 675 is still far greater than the current 98 66 TLDR The company may ride the wave out of the pandemic in the short to medium term and looks great in the long term amp x200B If you found this helpful please consider joining r TrendTracker for regular reports You are also able to make requests for stocks that you would like

good deal of discussions lately on either to buy TLRY or APHA to take advantage of the upcoming price surges since there s going to be a lot of positive legalization decriminalization news releases coming over the next couple of weeks especially with TLRY being primed for a short squeeze Large spike in short interest lately As you all know due to the merger TLRY and APHA will be the same company in a couple of months Merge date will be Late April Early May I want to take this opportunity to break some speculations and to clarify any misunderstandings Under the terms of the deal Aphria shareholders will gain 0 8381 shares of Tilray stock for each Aphria share they own under the deal terms SO this means if you were to hold 120 shares of APHA it will convert to about 100 Shares of TLRY stock 120 APHA Shares x 0 8381 100 572 TLRY Shares Its important that you understand this since there s been some recent posts that said its the other way around lol I know that there s a partial share of 572 this would then be liquidated by your broker and converted to cash since most brokers do not allow partial common stock shares unless its apart of some dividend reinvestment program Currently the biggest argument out there for buying APHA over TLRY is because of the conversation value with such a large current price gap between APHA 20 25 and TLRY 29 21 This means if you currently own 120 shares of APHA worth 2 430 and uses the 0 8381 conversion ration to convert to 100 Shares of TLRY worth 2921 you ve just arbitraged a GAIN of 491 2921 2430 WOW aren t you so smart You should start a HEDGEFUND I hate to be the bearer of bad news but it doesn t really work that way well it does but it doesn t Let me explain YES there is a huge value based on the conversion of the CURRENT price gap between TLRY and APHA but the value is ONLY there and true if the companies merges TOMORROW It is ONLY a value buy if the price gap stays till the merger close date which more likely it won t There are still MONTHS until the merger date This means until then the two stocks will be trading differently and A LOT could still happen until we get to the merger date I m NOT saying the merger might not happen it will happen The deal is done they are just going through regulatory approvals in Canada and the US and most experts Including bear analysts who hate the stocks agree there are no foreseen issues on the merger that would cause any problems But lets go back to talk about the upcoming prices surges from news of positive legalization decriminalization news releases coming over the next couple of weeks or even TLRY s short squeeze Here s some stats for the two stocks from Yahoo Finance amp x200B https preview redd it 66y0f06ujwi61 png width 463 amp format png amp auto webp amp s af8fd31254ee742d85516bd83758ceabeccd1c42 The FACT is that APHA has significantly more float Shares available to the public as compared to TLRY which means that TLRY s prices will almost always move faster and higher than APHA s prices An comparative example would be a car race where TLRY is a Subaru Evo Car and APHA is a Dodge Caravan Family Van The Dodge Caravan APHA is just not built to sustain the heavy acceleration as the EVO TLRY The higher the float the bigger the vehicle This is why when TLRY hit a high of 67 00 APHA only hit a high of 32 29 and you will continue to see this large price gap as we get more price surges when we get more good news from the media Please understand this if you are buying APHA with anticipation that perhaps it may even exceed TLRY in price it won t As a matter of fact as an APHA shareholder you don t want to hold APHA shares through the conversion if the price of APHA ever exceeds TLRY because this means you would lose money So don t just buy APHA just thinking its cheaper and thinking that you are getting value You get what you pay for As far as that price conversion gap between TLRY and APHA goes as we get closer to the merger close date that gap will shrink until it becomes almost even in value between TLRY and APHA on the close date which would offset the value proposition of buying APHA over TLRY in the first place Meanwhile you would miss out on all the massive price surges for TLRY including the potential short squeeze by JUST holding APHA and waiting for the close date to get your TLRY shares Yes APHA currently matches TLRY s direction so you would gain as a APHA shareholder if TLRY goes up but you need to realize that it won t go up as high or as fast as if you were to own Tilray stock It will never catch up to Tilray s value until we get closer to the merger close date which is currently months away Price gaps usually closes within the last week Now I HOPE that the price gap stays since I also hold a large amount of APHA shares but knowing past history with other stocks in similar acquisitions mergers it almost never happens which the recent example being the TD Ameritrade to Schwab all stock conversion Schwab bought TDA The market is very efficient and there are reasons why a price gap based on the conversion ratio currently exist for TLRY and APHA If you plan to only buy and hold for the long term it does not matter which stock to buy since even though there s a price gap now there won t be much more on the merger close date But if you want to take the chance hoping that the market doesn t see this thing coming and that the price gap stays till the merger close date then buy APHA But if you want to take advantage of short term price surges for Canabis stocks then TLRY is your best bet I want to emphasize that the goal of this article is to offset any misunderstandings or just bad information on the conversion I m NOT telling you to sell your APHA shares just not to be mislead by the value proposition You should do your own DD into the matter and always remember you get what you pay for This is why I own more TLRY shares than APHA shares Diversification is key to being successful
