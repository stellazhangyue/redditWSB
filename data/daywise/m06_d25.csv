start this DD off by saying if you re looking for the disgusting little sq ze word then just keep it moving because I m not going to waste my time with that How is Corsair looking at the moment Over the course of the pandemic gaming has continued to explode With half the developed world locked away in their houses coinciding with the release of the Xbox Series X and the PS5 it s no secret that online gaming has continued to develop into one of the most lucrative businesses in the technology sector Every indicator of mobile console and PC gaming has been compounded from Twitch streams to console sales to purchases of PC parts everything s been pretty much nuts but you all know this The important thing here is that the pandemic is ending albeit slowly and a little later than expected This means that a significant amount of analysts have lowered their forecasts for the gaming industry as people get back out of their houses to go frolic in the flowers or whatever the fuck regular people do This prevailing narrative has led to Corsair s stock hitting around 46 dollars per share in the beginning of February and then sharply declining for the next 30 days to hit 31 dollars at the beginning of March Since then the stock has continued to bounce up and down in the range of roughly 30 to 34 dollars save for a brief dip under 30 and the brief spike to the high 30s a week and a half ago With 40 days until earnings Corsair s stock looks as stable as ever and has seemingly priced in a severe reduction in growth So you might ask why should you bet against the crowd Because they re stupid Gaming isn t going anywhere and that s clear to anyone who knows jack shit about gamers and people who game casually Is the field going to shift while things open up Certainly and anyone who thinks it won t is kidding themselves But let me tell you purely anecdotally every single person I know who purchased expensive consoles new headsets new gaming PCs new games They re absolutely still using them because they re going to get their money s worth Everyone out there who just dropped 1500 dollars on their new setup isn t just going to let it go to junk and stop gaming overnight Sales might not see the type of explosive growth they saw during the pandemic but there are a few reasons why they ll certainly keep rising Reason Number 1 E Sports E Sports were actually somewhat negatively impacted by the pandemic even with E Sports viewers in the US rising by 70 in 2020 The industry itself already a multi billion dollar industry saw a string of cancellations across the world that put a halt to the fastest growing sport yes a sport just go with it in the world E sports is slowly going mainstream with companies such as Red Bull Honda Coke Kraft Marvel Mercedes even the fucking Air Force sponsoring E Sports over this past year Forecasted to hit 474 million viewers In 2021 games such as Rocket League CSGO and League of Legends have drawn the attention of hundreds of millions of fans desperate for tournaments competitions records and streaming out the wazoo The primary importance of E Sports to Corsair in my personal opinion Accelerating the growth of gaming and competitive gaming as a mainstream activity rather than something viewed by boomers as a waste of time This industry s growth over the next decade will be explosive and Corsair is poised to profit handsomely off its growth Reason Number 2 Summertime Gaming This section is going to be short and sweet It s summer School is out Countless millions of children have suffered through another year of school and though many were online a lot of pandemic most kids went back to In person school this past year Now they re finally getting out and ready to spend 3 months straight pissing in soda bottles and playing Fortnite and League until the capillaries in their eyes burst Reason Number 3 Unemployment Stagnation Unsurprisingly gaming sales experience huge success during times of high unemployment because people need something to do and thankfully gaming is a great way to sit down and lose 12 hours of your life without remembering that you ve got rent due in 2 weeks with negative 14 dollars in your bank account and no job Good thing federal unemployment benefits are still pretty damn great right Some states may be gradually reducing these federal unemployment benefits and reinstating job seeking requirements for these benefits but that s to be expected in a reopening economy However if you hop on over to the United States Department of Labor statistics on Unemployment Insurance you ll notice something funky the decrease in unemployment claims has begun to stagnate as available jobs is at a record high but tens of millions of people stay unemployed This disparity is due to a variety of factors that I could write an entire other post about but I ll leave it at this from skills mismatch to federal unemployment benefits being higher than minimum wage in some cases means that the unemployment rate is going to stay above the pre pandemic unemployment rate and people will continue to game Fundamentals Fundamentals are fantastic I m not going to go into extensive detail but Corsair has a P E of 20 ATM which solid for the industry and doesn t indicate significant speculation for the future operating margin is great and their market cap sits at around 3 billion on nearly 2 billion in sales and 150 million of profit Their fundamentals have been explored to death in other posts so I won t continue to beat a dead horse but just wanted to establish that their fundamentals are solid Predictions for the future As I said before earnings are in 40 days To be honest I m sick of trying to hop in right before earnings on every stock after a significant runup has already occurred and I m sure you all re too So in preparation for another round of fantastic earnings I m getting in early this time I believe that earnings will be fantastic once again beating analysts reduced expectations for the reasons listed above with growth higher than many are expecting post pandemic The acceleration of E Sports over this summer and fall will continue to drive the share price back into the high 30s soon enough possibly even low 40s over the next 4 6 weeks Given the slightly longer time frame I ve bought a healthy mix of shares and leaps for the coming storm Positions or fuck off 55 shares yeah my portfolio s not that big I know Leaps 25C 1 21 22 This is not financial advice take it at your own risk

eventually became their youngest CEO in their 110 company history In 2009 she joined Lancome leading the brand to three years of up to double digit growth and a record turnover of 3 2B Her team and her also have extensive digital sales experience which Coty was lacking prior but will be significant as they continue to expand their global brand presence Prior to her there was high CEO turnover and poor management team which was reflected in the declining stock price and creates an opportunity for more upside with the new CEO Her transformation to enter the Asian Market and build an much better e commerce presence Lastly she has been quickly changing the board to bring on more industry experts 1 Costs are dropping margins rising Reining in expenses and boosting gross margin are both signs Coty is likely executing well on its strategic transformation with top and bottom line improvements slightly lagging Gross margin jumped 450 basis points year over year reaching 62 2 with CFO Laurent Mercier stating that regarding the gross margin improvement delivered this quarter we are confident that approximately half is structural and therefore can be maintained Mercier also highlighted that Coty s fixed cost reduction program has allowed us to redirect capital to accelerate our brands and focus on profit delivery with fixed costs dropping 15 year over year 2 Aggressive product mix improvements Rather than simply relying on its existing product mix to carry it forward Coty is actively cutting support to brands failing to deliver adequate returns while developing and supporting its profitable sectors This process is strengthened by the fixed cost savings from improved efficiency noted above with the company redirecting the money saved into investments in marketing CEO Sue Nabi noted a virtuous circle of stepping up our media spending and reinvesting behind our newly repositioned brands 3 Other metrics look bullish Driven in part by pandemic related lockdowns of retail during 2020 Coty is continuing the development of its e commerce segment E commerce sales jumped 30 in the fiscal third quarter led by consumer beauty 56 year over year growth but with good luxury sector sales improvements too 20 growth While Coty s e commerce sales are still only 10 of the total the company isn t ignoring this increasingly important channel either While New World sales fell 6 during the quarter Chinese sales soared by 27 7 though they remain roughly a third of sales in the Americas Women s Wear Daily reports This again indicates Coty is successfully pushing through one of its turnaround goals since increasing its presence in the massive China market is a key pillar in our strategy according to Nabi 4 The current CEO has a positive track record Nabi has been Coty s CEO since mid 2020 and is an experienced beauty sector executive with past successes at turning around cosmetics and personal care brands from faltering to growing and profitable Working at personal care company L Oreal SA from 1993 through 2013 Nabi reconfigured its Lancome brand focusing on the introduction of new luxury products to its line These included a 350 facial cream according to Vogue and the high profile La Vie Est Belle perfume According to Coty Nabi s management raised Lancome s turnover to 3 2 billion euros during a three year period with positive sales growth every year sometimes topping 10 While no single individual is a guarantee of business success Nabi s experience looks potentially well suited to developing the potential of Coty s other strengths The four

despite being like twice as long which just makes no sense at all I m sorry if anybody bought in and lost money But to anyone who was retarded enough not to buy in well now you get a 75 discount on calls and the situation is largely looking the same A lot of shit has happened in the last two days since that post So in this DD I go over media coverage the earnings blowback Goldman PTs updated charts and suggest Aug calls This was written in a rush and I was busy losing money so forgive me for the low quality TLDR The thesis still holds Pretty much everything in the previous DD https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments o5tbpf kbh theres no place like homo still holds except the stock is now 6 cheaper and the IV is way lower Cramer apparently follows my DDs religiously but is not a fan of green giant dildos KBH missed revenue by 2 5 and the market sold it off Their loss your gain KBH LEN gap widens offering even easier entry for those that are well endowed like you and me Goldman raises their 12m price target to 62 I got a copy of the report I m doubling down I Hi Jim Following my post on BGS BGS Green Giant Dildos and Cream of WSB https old reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nzszyd bgs green giant dildos and cream of wsb Cramer tweets this https twitter com jimcramer status 1404765462068707333 Then he goes onto Flashy Money or whatever CNBC s market opening show is and talks about Green Giant sex toys on live air https v redd it mncrdbzu49771 Shortly after posting the BGS DD I remarked that it d be amazing to see a newscaster talk about retail mania fueled by green giant dildos or something like that and it actually fucking happened with Cramer of all people Yeah that s going on the mantle Next following my post on KBH Mad Money s opening segment https www youtube com watch v iyo Zo1bSE8 t 52 the next day was all about residential construction I mean it was also the day that new home sales were posted and yeah the industry is on fucking fire but please accommodate my illusions of grandeur Jim s following in my footsteps Jim get off my dick buddy Now as much as the guy is a sell out he does tend to have a very solid understanding of the market Like savant level actually The fact he often uses his platform for shilling is another topic entirely and in my opinion makes him a hypocrite whenever he shits on WSBs The segment was decent so I ll recap it Sidenote Jim opens the segment with a bunch of crRaAAaZzZyY sound effects and flashing animations is that really the type of research we want Jim You want to play that game Ok onto the content of the opening segment on residential construction https www youtube com watch v iyo Zo1bSE8 t 52 Not nearly enough houses gt We used to build 2m homes a year when we had half the population Now we re doing half of that with double the population Jimmy aka pennyether numberone fan From Toll Brother s CEO gt It s going to take a long time for this pent up demand to be satisfied We think it s going to take years before we ever get back to anything close to the equilibrium that we had seen in a bunch of the prior decades Demand is here to stay From the LEN CEO gt New home construction cannot ramp quickly enough to fill the void of the production deficit that has persisted over the past decade The bottom line is that supply is short and is likely to remain that way for some time to come Other Jim makes some more salient points Probably because he read my DD 73m millennials entering their 30s and buying homes This is not like the last housing bubble because lending standards are much more stringent Last bubble was pre COVID COVID allows remote work people are fleeing cities etc Jim ignores KBH which I take as a personal attack Fuck you Jim This morning Jim mentions KBH good boy Jim From this morning https www youtube com watch v qlM2oKbO8IA amp t 130s gt To sell KB Homes here is to not recognize the longevity of what could be a secular trend and not a cyclical trend I ve always felt that home building was incredibly cyclical I can t say that now the numbers are just too good Couldn t have said it better myself because I already did fucking say it Two days ago II Earnings Panic KBH missed revenues by 2 5 and the market shit itself I don t fucking care what they do my conviction is only higher now and I m doubling down Earnings Listen to the King Stud https www

jeffrey mezger kb home n 59c145aee4b0186c22061a67 gt With a backlog value above 4 billion we are poised to deliver a substantial increase in revenue this year at solid margins that we anticipate will contribute to a return on equity of roughly 20 King Stud Commodity prices were of no concern as expected Margins widened gt Within homebuilding housing gross margin excluding inventory related charges improved 280 basis points bps year over year to 21 5 The increase was attributed to a favorable pricing environment due to robust housing market demand increased operating leverage on higher revenues and lower amortization of previously capitalized interest Zack s thanks for doing math New guidance gt In summary given the size and composition of our quarter and backlog of over 10 000 homes along with our expanded production capacity we expect further improvements in our financial resolves and return metrics in 2021 as compared to our expectations at the time of our last earnings call gt gt Using the mid points of our new guidance ranges we now expect a 45 year over year increase in housing revenues and further expansion in our operating margin to 11 75 This profitability levels should drive a return on average equity of approximately 20 for the full year King Stud Charts I ve updated some charts to include the new Q2 numbers First up orders deliveries and census gov housing starts

3cb289e0576d2cd04639ef94d79ecfa3315d0018 Ok so KBH didn t blow out orders They merely had one of their biggest quarters ever but not a blowout in revenue However looking at deliveries they were clearly unaffected by high commodity prices or material shortages their deliveries jumped up quite a bit nearly to pre COVID levels They also seem to be keeping good pace with the number of overall

2019Q2 is not The correlation is still inconclusive but I ll keep on eye on this the next quarter if I remain solvent that long III The Chart Here s a compelling chart for you It s full of crayons and

when all the residential constructors report earnings in mid late July IV Goldman PT Increased Goldman Sachs just today Jun 24 maintained their Buy rating and updated their 12m price target to 62 from 59 based on the earnings results Go and try to find this report yourself bet you can t I ve included selections of it below gt Beat Driven by Profitability Tax Rate Given this lower than expected HB and other revenue is supply related and comes as KB works to align sales to starts it is resulting in upside to pricing margins and returns As such even as seasonal norms kick in over the next few months moderating sales on a relative basis we believe the company remains well positioned to grow EPS through F2022 and maintain our Buy rating Bullish gt Robust Order Growth Drives Sales Pace Higher The sales pace of 7 month was the highest in over a decade Reflecting its confidence in the outlook YTD starts are running at 8 500 homes and KB reiterated its guidance for double digit community count growth in F2022 with upside to its 10 target as it works to balance supply and demand Bullish gt Maximizing Margins While Holding to Affordability Homes are priced relative to median local incomes in many cases below existing homes and mgmt highlighted interest lists remain extended with FICO scores improving through the quarter reflecting the financial health of its buyers Not a bubble Credit scores high Competitively priced and raking in the dough gt Healthy Balance Sheet Supports Investing in Growth It ended F2Q with nearly 77 500 parcels 45 of which are optioned the highest proportion since 2006 It is also leveraging its capital structure to enter new cities including Boise announced tonight in addition to Charlotte earlier this year Expansion gt Revising Estimates and Price Target Maintain Buy Rating In turn our 12 month price target goes to 62 from 59 which is based on 1 8x unchanged our NTM tangible book value forecast and we maintain our Buy rating Cool gt Investment Risks Downside risks to our Buy rating include 1 Higher interest rates could inhibit affordability 2 Increase in existing home market supply 3 Supply chain disruptions impacting cycle time and pressuring costs Delays or limitations around permitting inspections and other municipal related events and 4 Above average balance sheet leverage may limit expansion plan My thoughts 1 Rates increasing Not going to happen anytime soon and if it does it ll be by a small amount Demand is high enough to absorb this 2 Increase in home market supply Already happening at 2005 pace yet prices are going up 3 Supply Chain Cost Issues If it happens to KBH it happens to everyone Which means less prices of houses go up Also costs get passed on to buyers 4 Balance Sheet I don t know I m retarded with this If you say it s a risk I believe you I think the real issue with the risks is that the market will overreact on any news indicating any of the above I don t think it changes the fact KBH is

in My Aug calls are to capture this Sep are fine too and might actually be better as theta won t chew on them so hard as we wait for the Jul earnings to roll in Long term The above plus generally continued strength in home building summer home buying season showing up in Q3 earnings etc LEAPs are totally viable here There may be better home builders to be buying for long term so look around IVs are low on KBH and I love the risk reward on all of the above Other Notes I m a fucking retard so take nothing I said as financial advice I m also entirely delusional and believe I can impact how the market prices this stock and as such a lot of this is a bet on myself I write these DD s to highlight things I m seeing in the market and to express myself artistically Whether or not you choose

Boy have I got a DD for you Let me first introduce myself so y all know I m one of your smooth brains I m RST a long time follower of WSB a college student and a loser who sold all my GME stock at a loss after its first rocket enough comments and I ll post my rise from a few g s to a lotta g s then back down so I ve been looking to make enough money to get featured in the Gain Porn Tag Anyways after seeing the decline of quality DD posts since GME I swear it s only shorted stocks memes and Gold Silver nowadays I wanted to add my own DD to the gene pool in hopes of making some apes money I will admit the inspiration for this post did come from another WSB DD post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nqs1vh calls on l brands lb but all work afterward is from me researching everywhere with multiple cans of coffee This is my first post so I went all out like DFV and I would love to hear your feedback confirmation bias or some colorful insults P S Writing Formatting DD s is hard as sh t all the financial reports are hard asf to read amp Reddit s post feature is a glitchy mf I m going to split this into 2 because it s a lot a lot of work Without further ado let s stop the teasing and jump right into it TLDR at BOTTOM 1 So Let s Start With The Overview Company L BRANDS Ticker LB Owns Bath amp Body Works Victoria Secret Pink amp x200B https preview redd it tec8ssrzzc771 png width 225 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 63819e91de602429dcb6ad78805da4545eb895db The Play Short Term play banking on the Increased Valuation of Victoria Secret during the Spinoff Explanation So L Brands LB is a retail company that owns 2 popular companies gt Bath amp Body Works BBW and Victoria s Secret VS Perfect places to shop for your wife for her dates In recent years BBW has generally been a reliable moneymaker while Victoria s Secret has been in a rough decline So much so that L Brands wants to separate amp Spinoff VS into its own company to save itself and salvage VS It had plans to sell VS for 1 1 Billion but that deal fell apart during Covid as future prospects look grim and no one else would touch VS after that So LB decided to separate the companies and spinoff Victoria Secret so each business can focus on thriving After some much needed changes bumps in online sales and a clear future price the stock has been rising However the current stock price feels undervalued as it is most likely based on the low valuation of VS L Brands believes Victoria Secret could reach a 5 Billion a 5x increase valuation through the separation so when the valuation comes out in the coming weeks it could drive up the price With low OTM options it could be a seductive play Before we get to the fun stuff let s look at how bad things were 1 Founder Long Time CEO and Boardmember Lex Werner was basically the financier and BFF for the Dipsh t Epstein 2 Company culture was sexist toxic and reeked of Boomer think 3 Covid caused a big scare in this retail mall based brand 4 Generally shitty public opinion of the Company and its future that scared investors and sank the stock price during Covid 5 In a post Me Too world this company was literally trash that drew criticism and had little hope for future prospects Holy Moly This looks bad How can they possibly turn this around Well here are some of the steps they have taken 1 Fired their Founder Former CEO Board Member his Enablers at the Company 2 Completely cut him off from company and I m guessing they made him sell his shares since he s been selling all of it https www bloombergquint com onweb victoria s secret billionaire wexner sells 500 million in stock 3 Decided to separate the 2 companies into 2 publicly traded companies so L Brands Bath amp Body Works amp Victoria Secret amp Co VS They hope that remaking VS and spinning it off will reach a valuation of 5 Billion 5x the previous offer of 1 1 Billion 4 Step up their online store game which has seen record online growth 5 Completely change everything about Victoria Secret they have a person whose literal job is to make sure every aspect of the company is on message like every statement report corporate action amp store design So Victoria Secret is becoming a completely different company It will no longer be a male fantasy store your favorite place to shop for your wife but instead be a women focused brand This is a big complete 360 turn for a brand that hosts a Supermodel Annual Angels Event for guys to drool at imagine Telsa switching to gas only cars Here s a look at what they are changing plus good bizness stuff Replaced Filled the entire Board https www dispatch com story business 2021 06 16 donna james lead nearly all women victorias secret board 7721521002 so it s all women except for 1 guy the CEO Hire several accomplished prominent women as brand ambassadors Called the VS Collective https www victoriassecret com us thevscollective This collective will host a podcast give input into the company s choices as promote the company These women include famous professionals activists and entrepreneurs like Pro Soccer Star Megan Rapinoe amp x200B https preview redd it d4pfr6m00d771 jpg width 3049 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 769b31cc97044b5b5b864372c27001d86d5e97e0 Abandon their sole focus of Sexy for Men and instead focus on For Women gt this includes changing their products messaging and corporate actions to do so For instance they celebrated Mother s Day for the first time this year they used to say motherhood wasn t on brand and will start producing multi use clothes that have a function beyond style They are donating to women s causes such as breast cancer research They have done remarkably well in China becoming a notable brand in the short time span of 2 ish years They have huge brand recognition High levels of institutional ownership 81 2 Willingness to change any aspect of the company to make it more profitable fit in with the post Me Too world and become a global brand leader for Women Nice So this looks like a good turn around for the company with good long term growth prospects I m guessing the smart thing would be to buy and hold for the long term Is dis da way NOPE you pee brained noodle head amp x200B https i redd it jd4jee910d771 gif 2 Here s the Play Idea TLDR So L Brands LB is spinning off Victoria s Secret into its own company called Victoria Secret amp Co VS There won t be a big IPO rather shareholders of LB will get prorated shares of LB VS A During this time I believe this undervalued stock will rise to a fair market value a good analysis determined around 81 25 or higher it s a seeking Alph link reddit won t let me paste plus get a bump with all the excitement around the company makeover of VS The company filed a Form 10 with the SEC on Monday June 21 which will take effect 60 days I think hard to find the legal info on this after on August 20 if everything is approved by the SEC Investors orders which I think is for institutions to buy the stock before it goes public are due June 30 I ve been watching the 1 minute chart and 15 minute chart and have noticed an interesting pattern whenever the price hits its 52 weeks high around 72 amp change it hits resistance and lots of volumes brings the price down It s been like this for a few days so it makes logical sense that institutions would keep the price from passing that line until they lock their orders down on June 30 There is also high volume right before closing so I also see action stopping from it raising it too high Afterward when their bidding prices are announced in the following weeks the stock will jump and all OTM options will suddenly reachable near ATM This is my theory at least and knowing the Lemon Man Melvin Capital amp the big bad hedgies it seems like the shenanigans they would pull TLDR OF TLDR Price seems like it s being held down until June 30 investors orders due date Between then and the stock spinoff the stock price of LB will reflect both companies which I think will be higher than it is now I bought 100 contracts that expire 8 20 with a strike price of 95 to take advantage of the stock price jump OTM options are cheap right now and a sudden jump especially above the ATHs will see a wild ride Disclaimer Not financial advice First time DD poster Will follow up with more technical analysis in part 2 cause it s a lot of brain space This a repost because the first time I posted this it had a banned site link Seeeeking Alph

chemotherapy myelosuppression was recently approved by FDA and no doubt has a blockbuster potential Management has positioned the company to succeed in their commercialization efforts researches clinical trials and approval process passed smoothly On March 2021 COSELA was Added to Both the NCCN Treatment Guidelines for Small Cell Lung Cancer and the NCCN Supportive Care Guidelines for Hematopoietic Growth Factors it will definitely boost it s sales Massive sell off after FDA approval has created a buying opportunity in the stock If you ever met CANCER you must know how tough it is tough to fight with it tough to watch how your beloved struggle and sometimes the only thing that can help is chemo But chemo also not easy to go through thats why you need to know about G1 Therapeutics and Cosela Investing in a start up biotech company is an absolute roller coaster clinical trials can both bring highs and lows but not in G1 Therapeutics case beacuse it s key drug COSELA trilaciclib has been approved by FDA at 02 12 2021 Simple profit taking has snowballed into a huge sell off with the stock dropping more than 40 So COSELA is the only FDA approved therapy that helps proactively deliver multilineage myeloprotection to patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer being treated with chemotherapy Myeloprotective efficacy of COSELA resulted in reductions in the incidence and duration of severe neutropenia and impacted anemia and the need for rescue interventions such as growth factors and red blood cell transfusions M yelosuppression is the most serious and life threatening side effect of chemotherapy or damage to the bone marrow resulting in reduced white blood cells red blood cells and platelets Chemotherapy induced myelosuppression may lead to

undervalued against peak sales for only one of its usages and I feel that commercial success in the next few quarters will bring a revaluation in the stock price Management has itself positioned right and has the right group of leaders to really make a name for Cosela as well as make G1 a market darling over the next few years The Company expects its current financial position to be sufficient to

Boy have I got a DD for you Let me first introduce myself so y all know I m one of your smooth brains I m RST a long time follower of WSB a college student and a loser who sold all my GME stock at a loss after its first rocket enough comments and I ll post my rise from a few g s to a lotta g s then back down so I ve been looking to make enough money to get featured in the Gain Porn Tag Anyways after seeing the decline of quality DD posts since GME I swear it s only shorted stocks memes and Gold Silver nowadays I wanted to add my own DD to the gene pool in hopes of making some apes money I will admit the inspiration for this post did come from another WSB DD post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nqs1vh calls on l brands lb but all work afterward is from me researching everywhere with multiple cans of coffee This is my first post so I went all out like DFV and I would love to hear your feedback confirmation bias or some colorful insults P S Writing Formatting DD s is hard as sh t all the financial reports are hard asf to read amp Reddit s post feature is a glitchy mf I m going to split this into 2 because it s a lot a lot of work Without further ado let s stop the teasing and jump right into it TLDR at BOTTOM 1 So Let s Start With The Overview Company L BRANDS Ticker LB Owns Bath amp Body Works Victoria Secret Pink https preview redd it ku5nxkgv1d771 png width 225 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 90296d2d08eac3dcfe1862c1ac99255762198c6f The Play Short Term play banking on the Increased Valuation of Victoria Secret during the Spinoff Explanation So L Brands LB is a retail company that owns 2 popular companies gt Bath amp Body Works and Victoria s Secret Perfect places to shop for your wife for her dates In recent years Bath amp Body Works has generally been a reliable moneymaker while Victoria s Secret has been in a rough decline So much so that L Brands wants to separate amp Spinoff Victoria s Secret into its own company to save itself and salvage Victoria s Secret It had plans to sell Victoria s Secret for 1 1 Billion but that deal fell apart during Covid as future prospects look grim and no one else would touch Victoria Secret after that So LB decided to separate the companies and spin off Victoria s Secret so each business can focus on thriving After some much needed changes bumps in online sales and a clear future price the stock has been rising However the current stock price feels undervalued as it is most likely based on the low valuation of Victoria s Secret L Brands believes Victoria Secret could reach a 5 Billion a 5x increase valuation through the separation so when the valuation comes out in the coming weeks it could drive up the price With low OTM options it could be a seductive play Before we get to the fun stuff let s look at how bad things were 1 Founder Long Time CEO and Boardmember Lex Werner was basically the financier and BFF for the Dipsh t Epstein 2 Company culture was sexist toxic and reeked of Boomer think 3 Covid caused a big scare in this retail mall based brand 4 Generally shitty public opinion of the Company and its future that scared investors and sank the stock price during Covid 5 In a post Me Too world this company was literally trash that drew criticism and had little hope for future prospects Holy Moly This looks bad How can they possibly turn this around Well here are some of the steps they have taken 1 Fired their Founder Former CEO Board Member his Enablers at the Company 2 Completely cut him off from company and I m guessing they made him sell his shares since he s been selling all of it https www bloombergquint com onweb victoria s secret billionaire wexner sells 500 million in stock 3 Decided to separate the 2 companies into 2 publicly traded companies so L Brands Bath amp Body Works amp Victoria Secret amp Co They hope that remaking Victoria s Secret and spinning it off will reach a valuation of 5 Billion 5x the previous offer of 1 1 Billion 4 Step up their online store game which has seen record online growth 5 Completely change everything about Victoria Secret they have a person whose literal job is to make sure every aspect of the company is on message like every statement report corporate action amp store design So Victoria Secret is becoming a completely different company It will no longer be a male fantasy store your favorite place to shop for your wife but instead be a women focused brand This is a big complete 360 turn for a brand that hosts a Supermodel Annual Angels Event for guys to drool at imagine Telsa switching to gas only cars Here s a look at what they are changing plus good bizness stuff 1 Replaced Filled the entire Board https www dispatch com story business 2021 06 16 donna james lead nearly all women victorias secret board 7721521002 so it s all women except for 1 guy the CEO 2 Hire several accomplished prominent women as brand ambassadors Called the VS Collective https www victoriassecret com us thevscollective This collective will host a podcast give input into the company s choices as promote the company These women include famous professionals activists and entrepreneurs like Pro Soccer Star Megan Rapinoe https preview redd it pud91ehw1d771 jpg width 3049 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s faf9a813580bef67fe4006e95a50c5ece03d2002 1 Abandon their sole focus of Sexy for Men and instead focus on For Women gt this includes changing their products messaging and corporate actions to do so For instance they celebrated Mother s Day for the first time this year they used to say motherhood wasn t on brand and will start producing multi use clothes that have a function beyond style 2 They are donating to women s causes such as breast cancer research 3 They have done remarkably well in China becoming a notable brand in the short time span of 2 ish years 4 They have huge brand recognition 5 High levels of institutional ownership 81 2 6 Willingness to change any aspect of the company to make it more profitable fit in with the post Me Too world and become a global brand leader for Women Nice So this looks like a good turn around for the company with good long term growth prospects I m guessing the smart thing would be to buy and hold for the long term Is dis da way NOPE you pee brained noodle head amp x200B https i redd it pfj39znx1d771 gif 1 Here s the Play Idea TLDR So L Brands LB is spinning off Victoria s Secret into its own company called Victoria s Secret amp Co There won t be a big IPO rather shareholders of LB will get prorated shares of LB Victoria s Secret During this time I believe this undervalued stock will rise to a fair market value a good analysis determined around 81 25 or higher plus get a bump with all the excitement around the company makeover of Victoria s Secret The company filed a Form 10 with the SEC on Monday June 21 which will take effect 60 days I think hard to find the legal info on this after on August 20 if everything is approved by the SEC Investors orders which I think is for institutions to buy the stock before it goes public are due June 30 I ve been watching the 1 minute chart and 15 minute chart and have noticed an interesting pattern whenever the price hits its 52 weeks high around 72 amp change it hits resistance and lots of volumes brings the price down It s been like this for a few days so it makes logical sense that institutions would keep the price from passing that line until they lock their orders down on June 30 There is also high volume right before closing so I also see action stopping from it raising it too high Afterward when their bidding prices are announced in the following weeks the stock will jump and all OTM options will suddenly reachable near ATM This is my theory at least and knowing the Lemon Man Melvin Capital amp the big bad hedgies it seems like the shenanigans they would pull TLDR OF TLDR Price seems like it s being held down until June 30 investors orders due date Between then and the stock spinoff the stock price of LB will reflect both companies which I think will be higher than it is now I bought 100 contracts that expire 8 20 with a strike price of 95 to take advantage of the stock price jump OTM options are cheap right now and a sudden jump especially above the ATHs will see a wild ride Holding options after this date will be confusing due to the nature of spinoffs so it might be hard getting options past this but stocks would be safe Disclaimer Not financial advice First time DD poster Will follow up with more technical analysis in part 2 cause it s a lot of brain space

advisor and this is not a financial advice tldr varta is undervalued varta got strong potential in the battery business for electric cars the battery business for electric cars and the earnings are not calculated in the stock market price gt stock market price goal is minimum 260 gt he is telling that 1000 could be even passable in several years they will produce these batteries for Porsche every german car manufracturer has interests in vartas batteries there are conversations between them in the background varta got a short ratio at 30 varta is expanding varta raised their forecasts several times last year vartas quality is very good they supply the batteries for Apple air dods varta is about to calculate the overall demand to start building a plant for mass production they can start it as soon as the comversations come to an end Every information iam posting here about varta is from aktionaer de this is a german stock market magazine you can find them on Youtube spotify etc and there is a guy called maydorn He has been talking about varta since months and he predicted the business relationsship anouncement with Porsche And he also me is convinced that varta is the next big thing and Iam asking myself a lot why nobody knows how great their potential is All their videos and podcasts are in German so i tell you the facts why u should go in Let me start with a little company history Varta is a well known old company They produced batteries for normal use and for normal cars first After they sold this business they focused on microbatteries like the batteries for hearing aid bluetooth headphones in the premium segment Actually they supply Apple with the batteries for their air pods and Apple would never use batteries with a low quality Then they bought back their household batterie business so these aa aaa things you need for your gameboy gt and now comes the important stuff Varta managed to bring the technology from the microbatteries to a bigger size so they are useable for electric cars for instance gt People love varta the analysts hate varta There is actually not even one purchase recomendation from a analyst The dip in march 2020 Was not only caused by the corona pandemic it was also caused by short sellers Actually they say that their short ratio is still at about 30 The only argument the short sellers have is that the competetors from China will be able to produce these batteries at lower cost But first it didnt happen until now and second Daimler just cutted their business relations with a chinese producer because the quality was horrible and gt varta just anounced that they will produce batteries for porsches electric cars So varta is able to produce high quality batteries for electric cars Maydorn forecasted the relationsship between them months ago gt why is there no purchase recommendation The market is huge and vartas potential too But they dont value it Thats the huge thing that noone really ubderstand Alone the microbatterie and normal household batterie business is worth like 160 With the potential of the batteries for cars it should be a minimum of 260 Actual stock market price is 143 gt so the batterie business for electric cars is not reflected in the actual stock market price Its a little bit a german phenomenon that future earnings are not that considered as in USA In germany they are like oh yea theres huge potential but it could happen this and it could happen that But they raised their forecasts several times last year and their business is running very well They are expanding

advisor and this is not a financial advice tldr varta is undervalued varta got strong potential in the battery business for electric cars the battery business for electric cars and the earnings are not calculated in the stock market price stock market price goal is minimum 260 1000 could be even passable in several years they will produce batteries for Porsche every german car manufracturer has interests in vartas batteries there are conversations between them in the background varta got a short ratio at 30 varta is expanding varta raised their forecasts several times last year vartas quality is very good they supply the batteries for Apple air dods varta is about to calculate the overall demand to start building a plant for mass production they can start it as soon as the conversations come to an end Every information iam posting here about varta is from aktionaer de this is a german stock market magazine you can find them on Youtube spotify etc and there is a guy called maydorn He has been talking about varta since months and he predicted the business relationsship anouncement with Porsche And he also me is convinced that varta is the next big thing and Iam asking myself a lot why nobody knows how great their potential is All their videos and podcasts are in German so i tell you the facts why u should go in Let me start with a little company history Varta is a well known old company They produced batteries for normal use and for normal cars first After they sold this business they focused on microbatteries like the batteries for hearing aid bluetooth headphones in the premium segment Actually they supply Apple with the batteries for their air pods and Apple would never use batteries with a low quality Then they bought back their household batterie business so these aa aaa things you need for your gameboy gt and now comes the important stuff Varta managed to bring the technology from the microbatteries to a bigger size so they are useable for electric cars for instance gt People love varta the analysts hate varta There is actually not even one purchase recomendation from a analyst The dip in march 2020 Was not only caused by the corona pandemic it was also caused by short sellers Actually they say that their short ratio is still at about 30 The only argument the short sellers have is that the competetors from China will be able to produce these batteries at lower cost But first it didnt happen until now and second Daimler just cutted their business relations with a chinese producer because the quality was horrible and gt varta just anounced that they will produce batteries for porsches electric cars So varta is able to produce high quality batteries for electric cars Maydorn forecasted the relationsship between them months ago gt why is there no purchase recommendation The market is huge and vartas potential too But they dont value it Thats the huge thing that noone really ubderstand Alone the microbatterie and normal household batterie business is worth like 160 With the potential of the batteries for cars it should be a minimum of 260 Actual stock market price is 143 gt so the batterie business for electric cars is not reflected in the actual stock market price Its a little bit a german phenomenon that future earnings are not that considered as in USA In germany they are like oh yea theres huge potential but it could happen this and it could happen that But they raised their forecasts several times last year and their business is running very well They are expanding and building new plant what will be opened in the near future gt its the same Story as tesla Tesla was shorted heavily and analysts hated tesla because they didnt value the future potential of the company Its also because either the germans nore the americans like electric cars gt the batteries are in the epicentrum They are will be highly demanded not only for cars but also for solar plants

since I posted on WSB Tbh I got distracted and lost motivation to post Maybe it was the meme stock deliria Maybe it s because I have been hiding on TWTR Regardless I come to you all today with 5 stocks that will benefit from the infrastructure bill Biden announced yesterday that Congress has agreed on a deal for a 1 2 TRILLION bipartisan bill to renew the infrastructure of the United States The bill will be a two step plan that is linked with another bill focused on home healthcare and child care 1 2 trillion might seem like a lot but it falls grossly short of the 6 trillion that many progressives were hoping to secure to tackle all of the country s pressing issues and siphon billions to members of Congress ensure a brighter future Further it s likely that there will be more backlash from the right as the President declared there will not be one without the other both bills must pass In summary this bill is not guaranteed to pass and will likely face scrutiny from both sides in the coming months The eight year proposal contains 109 billion for roads bridges and major projects 73 billion for power infrastructure 66 billion for passenger and freight rail 65 billion for broadband access 49 billion for public transit and 25 billion for airports according to a White House statement That s roughly 400 billion Where the rest of the budget will be siphoned off to I do not know One thing I m sure of is that I ll be closely watching Nancy Pelosi s trades for the rest of the year So let s get to the stonks that could benefit the most from the large spending plan CAT

struggled for a long time due to weakness in commodity prices construction and mining projects and emerging markets activity All of this changed last year when investors warmed up to the idea of

surgical tools Now why is this important Google tried to do this shit like 8 years ago and nobody cared right Yes that s correct There s one other thing that s correct too Google s attempt absolutely sucked and they did not pursue improving their product Vuzix remains on the leading edge of smart eyeglass technology with over 146 patents So it s too late google you already lost this one amp x200B

college I m going to explain this technology to you The waveguide technology employed by vuzix deliver high quality full color images directly to your fucking eyeball Now these images are completely

VR this is actually a really cool company but their applications are more focused on digital production applications This wouldn t necessarily be a competitor at this time but since its along the same lines it should be mentioned amp x200B Time to look at some numbers for you viewers with more then 10 brain cells In 2020 Vuzix experienced very rapid growth This can be attributed to technology finally catching up to the product as well as a lot of new big orders from reputable companies In 2021 Vuzix saw sales increase 2 4 million dollars or 177 year over year Data interpreted from Vuzix website show Quarter 1 2021 results at a 49 improvement year over year Sales of their products show an improvement of 2 383 000 year over year as well So expenses Vuzix operating expenses reported in Q1 of 2021 were reported to be 7 654 000 Yes these rose compared to the same quarter last year where operating expenses were 5 339 000 Obviously this is related to increased production What does this look like per share Vuzix reported net loss per share of 12 Year over year this is a 06 improvement Vuzix is becoming more efficient With increased sales and lower operating costs this company is

this stock over the past few months Vuzix saw an amazing run up in their stock price following both their quarter 4 2020 results as well as the q1 2021 results Following q1 2020 the stock price rose an incredible 443 to an at the time high of 23 59 Q1 2021 results brought a slight dip in the stock price followed by another run up of 30 to an all time high of 30 57 Sounds like some real fomo territory right Following this impressive all time high this stock has seen a decrease of 43 It now sits at 17 48 per share A bit of a drop from its ATH aqua teen hunger force A drop in this territory is completely natural for a growing company During a press release on March 26 Vuzix announced that they were offering 4 1 million shares of its common stock at 20 50 a share compared to the stock price of 26 32 at this time This was beneficial for the company to raise funds to put towards further r amp d ranch and dicks Although this initially dropped the stock price it then rose to its ATH of 30 57 just 2 weeks later The following drop from all time high can be related to natural selling of the stock as well as a maxim group downgrade from a buy to a sell This downgrade was most likely due to a dude with a less than average sized dick It might also simply be attributed to the stocks very fast run up earlier this year and is based solely on valuation So where are we today Definitely not the Wendy s bathroom anyway Over the past five days the stock price seems to have bounced off of a new low of 15 64 on June 22nd back to a price of 18 05 on June 24th It has remained within this range over the past 3 days What am I driving at here Improvement in operating costs and increasing sales quarter over quarter show this company is becoming more efficient and are carving their name right into the fucking side of the augmented reality industry Personally I m expecting to see killer earnings in q3 2021 A new as of 06 02 2021 medical electrical equipment safety standard certification will push this equipment directly into the new remote medical environment created by the COVID epidemic Anyway I m running out of steam Maybe just ask Cathie Woods who bought the dip and added 13 5 million in Vuzix as of 06 01 to the ARKW etf She has previously added shares of Vuzix to the ARKQ fund as well I know she didn t buy the top which in of itself shows some real development of her

biodegradable plastics field DD ,I want to tell you a story it involves plastics Pepsi Skittles and David Einhorn beefing with a fat titted short seller But first Why Our Current Plastics Suck Ass gt Plastics currently take HUNDREDS of years to biodegrade in the environment gt Nearly 300 million tons of plastic wastes are produced annually with over 91 not recycled gt Just twenty companies are responsible for producing more than half of the single use plastic waste in the world gt Microplastics have recently been revealed to be in the placentas of unborn babies https www theguardian com environment 2020 dec 22 microplastics revealed in placentas unborn babies gt The chemicals in plastic are reducing our fertility it s reducing our birth weights and increasing cancer risk in all of us not to mention lung disease heart disease and diabetes The debate over plastic usage has veered into camps of people who debate paper vs plastic straws AND butch women complaining about birds in the ocean that have plastic soda rings around their neck people are complaining but it feels like nothing practical is being done to fix this issue Enter Danimer Scientific from here on DNMR What DNMR does DNMR manufactures a solution called NODAX it is a plastic that is 100 renewable and they use it to make their products cups straws bags containers which have been bought already by billion dollar companies more on this soon Their products are able to effectively biodegrade in both anaerobic and aerobic environments such as a waste treatment facility or the ocean Their PHA polymers is 100 biodegradable in the presence of bacteria in all environments Whereas most plastics take 300 years to biodegrade in the environment DNMR s takes 9 months tops How it s made They use plant based oil to create 100 biodegradable and compostable biopolymers Waste free processes utilizes 100 of the canola oil to ensure optimal sustainability It also meets their goal of full circle life cycle for plastics without relying on recycling Three Step Production Process seen here for people who like science words https imgur com a HzQuxHy Who are their clients 1 Pepsi in addition to bottled soda they also own the chips companies Frito Lays Ruffles and Gatorade I m getting hard etc Here s Pepsi recently giving a shout out to DNMR https twitter com pepsico status 1384252988823199753 lang en 2 Bacardi SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS 3 Mars Wrigley own Skittles Orbit gum freaking M amp M s etc 4 Mysterious Major partner DNMR only hinted at them in their last earnings call because the client is so big that they don t want their competitors to know what they re up to at this time Could be anyone Targeted hit piece by Spruce Point Capital on DNMR causes David Einhorn to flex The year was 2021 Danimer was riding high things were good a turtle somewhere was thinking about one day not being killed by plastic and then Enter Ben Axler the only hedge fund guy who could get cucked by Andrew Left This guy who looks like a diabetic parking cone released a smoking gun report about Danimer Claiming that Danimer had fudged their numbers Here s the video https www youtube com watch v P91YWxbeslI The guy is literally unable to speak and read His claims are so far fetched that they re hard to even articulate a rebuttal He lies about something that happened and then mischaracterizes a theory based on his lie so to argue against him you would have to force him to go back and admit that his initial thought was a lie which would never happen Really brain pounding stuff Never the less g y bears gonna be g y so the stock really nosedived after this short report it s crazy how Yahoo finance can report this stuff as fact and it gets gobbled up but I digress His report and overall demeanor was so shady that David Einhorn himself who has a position in DNMR called out Ben Axler https twitter com davidein status 1395751453189410816 The whole thing is worth a read but in closing Einhorn states these reports by Spruce Point Capital represent the worst elements of the short selling profession DNMR s percentage float shares that are shorted 16 75 A pretty decent amount Proof https imgur com a 8GEYTCS In regards to the shorting I think there s something so extra fucking bad about intentionally trying to take down a company that s literally making plastics so that less people will die and the environment will be better Financials gt In 2020 revenue jumped 46 to 47 3 million from 2019 driven by stronger demand and incremental PHA production capacity brought online last year gt The Winchester plant s annual 65 million pounds of capacity is sold out through 2022 gt Danimer s ultimate goal is to build two to three production facilities simultaneously each with production capacities of 250 million pound per year gt Danimer s CEO Stephen Croskrey owns nearly 5 1 million shares or 5 8 of the outstanding making him the second largest shareholder in Danimer after Vanguard according to Bloomberg data gt Danimer has a 3 to 5 year lead over competition gt They just completed their Kentucky facility debottle necking initiatives on time which will enable them to significantly scale up production from previous levels gt Pepsi has a board seat gt DNMR is joining the Russell 3000 index today gt Their CEO has long hair rare these days Mgmt Owns 5 5 gt Financial Summary https imgur com 9uynOPi gt Growth Plans https imgur com a QCJZMRH Gossip Jeffries who have given DNMR a Buy Rating with a target of 42 went on a tour of DNMR s Kentucky factory today and apparently some big boys from Coors and DuPont were there and were highly impressed https imgur com a gZXajs3 What s next In this current climate of social causes and companies wanting to do something about the environment I ve read that companies will soon begin listing facts about the plasticity of their products on the package itself like how they do with calories and stuff This means that companies who package their products using DNMR will get to brag about it on their products and in their adds Other companies will get jealous and want this as well The market of companies who want to better package their products raising environmental and social awareness is endless Position https imgur com a Cky5Vlc In closing Plastic People by Frank Zappa https www youtube com watch v

449149 New York June 23 2021 Moody s Investors Service Moody s upgraded Cleveland Cliffs Inc s Cliffs Corporate Family Rating CFR to Ba3 from B1 its Probability of Default Rating PDR to Ba3 PD from B1 PD its guaranteed senior secured note rating to Ba2 from B1 its guaranteed senior unsecured note rating to Ba3 from B2 and its senior unsecured note rating to B2 from B3 The company s Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating was upgraded to SGL 1 from SGL 2 Its ratings outlook remains positive The upgrade of Cleveland Cliffs ratings reflects the materially improved steel sector fundamentals which will support a robust near term operating performance and solid free cash flow generation and lead to a sizeable debt pay down and a strengthening of its liquidity profile and sustainably stronger credit metrics said Michael Corelli Moody s Senior Vice President and lead analyst for Cleveland Cliffs Inc Ratings Upgraded Issuer Cleveland Cliffs Inc Corporate Family Rating Upgraded to Ba3 from B1

Gtd Senior Unsecured Regular Bond Debenture Upgraded to Ba3 LGD4 from B2 LGD4 Senior Unsecured Regular Bond Debenture Upgraded to B2 LGD5 from B3 LGD5 Outlook Actions Issuer Cleveland Cliffs Inc Outlook Remains Positive RATINGS RATIONALE Cliffs Ba3 corporate family rating incorporates its inconsistent historical operating performance and free cash flow generation due to its exposure to cyclical end markets and volatile iron ore and steel prices but also considers our expectation for a significantly improved operating performance and substantial debt reduction in 2021 that will result in near term metrics that are strong for the rating The rating also presumes the company will maintain moderate financial leverage and ample interest coverage in a normalized steel price environment when supply and demand come back into balance Cliffs rating also considers the company s large scale and strong market position as the largest US flat rolled integrated steel producer in the US with flat rolled steel production capacity of about 16 5 million tons and the benefits of its position as an integrated steel producer from necessary raw materials through the steel making and finishing processes Cliffs has a strong position in the North American iron ore markets and the start up of its new HBI facility enables it to provide raw materials to growing domestic EAF producers given the freight cost savings relative to imported pig iron and also the option to sell this product to its own mills Cliffs rating also reflects the benefits of its contract position particularly with the automotive industry which provides a good earnings base Its performance won t benefit as much from a high steel price environment and the benefits will lag the rise in pricing due to the nature of the contracts and renegotiation periods but this does provide downside mitigants in a falling steel price environment Cliffs evidenced a weak operating performance in 2020 given the impact of automotive production shutdowns on the acquired AK Steel business and generally weak economic activity due to the impact of the coronavirus which resulted in weak steel demand and prices However its operating performance will materially strengthen in 2021 due to a quicker than anticipated recovery in steel demand along with the addition of ArcelorMittal s assets and the recent surge in steel and iron ore prices Cliffs expects to produce about 5 billion in adjusted EBITDA assuming hot rolled coil prices HRC average about 1 175 per ton during the remainder of 2021 This assumption could be conservative considering HRC prices are at a record high of about 1 700 per ton in June 2021 after declining to a 4 5 year low around 440 per ton in July 2020 due to the effects of the pandemic The price surge has been attributable to industry consolidation a temporary dislocation of supply and demand low steel inventories and rising iron ore and scrap prices Cliffs will also benefit from historically high iron ore prices which have surged to more than 200 per ton from below 100 per ton a year ago 62 Fe fines cfr Iron ore from Qingdao Steel prices are likely to remain elevated for the remainder of 2021 with industry consolidation improving competitive dynamics and capacity reductions and maintenance outages tightening supply Even if steel prices return to a more normalized historical level Cliffs will be able to materially reduce its outstanding debt and strengthen its liquidity position this year If it only pays off its revolver borrowings and no other debt in 2H21 this will reduce its adjusted leverage ratio debt EBITDA to around 1 0x and raise its interest coverage EBIT Interest to about 10 0x Cliffs Speculative Grade Liquidity rating of SGL 1 reflects the company s very good liquidity profile which is supported by an upsized 3 5 billion asset based lending facility ABL and our expectation for strong free cash flow this year The two notch upgrade of the senior secured guaranteed notes Ba2 and the senior unsecured guaranteed notes Ba3 reflects the expected pay down of the revolver borrowings as well as the company s sizeable unsecured debt and underfunded pension liabilities which provide an uplift The B2 rating on the senior unsecured notes reflects their junior position in the capital structure The positive ratings outlook incorporates our expectation for a significantly improved operating performance in 2021 that will result in credit metrics that are strong for the company s rating It also reflects the possibility of further ratings upgrades if the company continues to use its free cash to pay down debt as it becomes callable in 2022 FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS Cliffs ratings could be considered for an upgrade if steel prices and metal spreads remain above historical averages and the company demonstrates a clearly defined and more conservative financial policy and pursues further debt reduction Quantitatively if Cliffs sustains a leverage ratio of no more than 3 0x and CFO less dividends in excess of 30 of its outstanding debt through varying steel price points then its ratings could be positively impacted Cliffs ratings could be downgraded should leverage be sustained above 4 0x or CFO less dividends below 20 of its outstanding debt or it fails to maintain a good liquidity profile Headquartered in Cleveland Ohio Cleveland Cliffs Inc is the largest iron ore and flat rolled steel producer in North America with approximately 21 2 million equity tons of annual iron ore capacity and about 16 5 million tons of flat rolled steel capacity For the twelve months ended March 31 2021 Cliffs had revenues of 9 0 billion

June 23 2021 Moody s Investors Service Moody s upgraded Cleveland Cliffs Inc s Cliffs Corporate Family Rating CFR to Ba3 from B1 its Probability of Default Rating PDR to Ba3 PD from B1 PD its guaranteed senior secured note rating to Ba2 from B1 its guaranteed senior unsecured note rating to Ba3 from B2 and its senior unsecured note rating to B2 from B3 The company s Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating was upgraded to SGL 1 from SGL 2 Its ratings outlook remains positive The upgrade of Cleveland Cliffs ratings reflects the materially improved steel sector fundamentals which will support a robust near term operating performance and solid free cash flow generation and lead to a sizeable debt pay down and a strengthening of its liquidity profile and sustainably stronger credit metrics said Michael Corelli Moody s Senior Vice President and lead analyst for Cleveland Cliffs Inc Ratings Upgraded Issuer Cleveland Cliffs Inc Corporate Family Rating Upgraded to Ba3 from B1 Probability of Default Rating Upgraded to Ba3 PD from B1 PD Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating Upgraded to SGL 1 from SGL 2 Gtd Senior Secured Regular Bond Debenture Upgraded to Ba2 LGD3 from B1 LGD3 Gtd Senior Unsecured Regular Bond Debenture Upgraded to Ba3 LGD4 from B2 LGD4 Senior Unsecured Regular Bond Debenture Upgraded to B2 LGD5 from B3 LGD5 Outlook Actions Issuer Cleveland Cliffs Inc Outlook Remains Positive RATINGS RATIONALE Cliffs Ba3 corporate family rating incorporates its inconsistent historical operating performance and free cash flow generation due to its exposure to cyclical end markets and volatile iron ore and steel prices but also considers our expectation for a significantly improved operating performance and substantial debt reduction in 2021 that will result in near term metrics that are strong for the rating The rating also presumes the company will maintain moderate financial leverage and ample interest coverage in a normalized steel price environment when supply and demand come back into balance Cliffs rating also considers the company s large scale and strong market position as the largest US flat rolled integrated steel producer in the US with flat rolled steel production capacity of about 16 5 million tons and the benefits of its position as an integrated steel producer from necessary raw materials through the steel making and finishing processes Cliffs has a strong position in the North American iron ore markets and the start up of its new HBI facility enables it to provide raw materials to growing domestic EAF producers given the freight cost savings relative to imported pig iron and also the option to sell this product to its own mills Cliffs rating also reflects the benefits of its contract position particularly with the automotive industry which provides a good earnings base Its performance won t benefit as much from a high steel price environment and the benefits will lag the rise in pricing due to the nature of the contracts and renegotiation periods but this does provide downside mitigants in a falling steel price environment Cliffs evidenced a weak operating performance in 2020 given the impact of automotive production shutdowns on the acquired AK Steel business and generally weak economic activity due to the impact of the coronavirus which resulted in weak steel demand and prices However its operating performance will materially strengthen in 2021 due to a quicker than anticipated recovery in steel demand along with the addition of ArcelorMittal s assets and the recent surge in steel and iron ore prices Cliffs expects to produce about 5 billion in adjusted EBITDA assuming hot rolled coil prices HRC average about 1 175 per ton during the remainder of 2021 This assumption could be conservative considering HRC prices are at a record high of about 1 700 per ton in June 2021 after declining to a 4 5 year low around 440 per ton in July 2020 due to the effects of the pandemic The price surge has been attributable to industry consolidation a temporary dislocation of supply and demand low steel inventories and rising iron ore and scrap prices Cliffs will also benefit from historically high iron ore prices which have surged to more than 200 per ton from below 100 per ton a year ago 62 Fe fines cfr Iron ore from Qingdao Steel prices are likely to remain elevated for the remainder of 2021 with industry consolidation improving competitive dynamics and capacity reductions and maintenance outages tightening supply Even if steel prices return to a more normalized historical level Cliffs will be able to materially reduce its outstanding debt and strengthen its liquidity position this year If it only pays off its revolver borrowings and no other debt in 2H21 this will reduce its adjusted leverage ratio debt EBITDA to around 1 0x and raise its interest coverage EBIT Interest to about 10 0x Cliffs Speculative Grade Liquidity rating of SGL 1 reflects the company s very good liquidity profile which is supported by an upsized 3 5 billion asset based lending facility ABL and our expectation for strong free cash flow this year The two notch upgrade of the senior secured guaranteed notes Ba2 and the senior unsecured guaranteed notes Ba3 reflects the expected pay down of the revolver borrowings as well as the company s sizeable unsecured debt and underfunded pension liabilities which provide an uplift The B2 rating on the senior unsecured notes reflects their junior position in the capital structure The positive ratings outlook incorporates our expectation for a significantly improved operating performance in 2021 that will result in credit metrics that are strong for the company s rating It also reflects the possibility of further ratings upgrades if the company continues to use its free cash to pay down debt as it becomes callable in 2022 FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS Cliffs ratings could be considered for an upgrade if steel prices and metal spreads remain above historical averages and the company demonstrates a clearly defined and more conservative financial policy and pursues further debt reduction Quantitatively if Cliffs sustains a leverage ratio of no more than 3 0x and CFO less dividends in excess of 30 of its outstanding debt through varying steel price points then its ratings could be positively impacted Cliffs ratings could be downgraded should leverage be sustained above 4 0x or CFO less dividends below 20 of its outstanding debt or it fails to maintain a good liquidity profile Headquartered in Cleveland Ohio Cleveland Cliffs Inc is the largest iron ore and flat rolled steel producer in North America with approximately 21 2 million equity tons of annual iron ore capacity and about 16 5 million tons of flat rolled steel capacity For the twelve months ended March 31 2021 Cliffs had revenues of 9 0 billion

campfire kiddo s let me tell you about Good Ole Grandape Foley Many know the merits of Grandape Foley but lots of you young monkey like natural resource handed savages may not So let me paint the picture for you You think you have hands of Diamond Well let me tell you Grandape Foley has diamond hands of the highest kind Carats so large he doesn t only drag his knuckles his forearms scrape the floor too Here are some fun facts about Grandape Foley that will explain the legend behind the Ape He s 76 years old and still kicking wall street bankers in the dick He does things his own way and builds empires with his glorious diamond hands mostly from scratch I ll touch on that below He was born 4 months and 16 days before Hitler died 4 days short of a 420 Coincidence I think not As a young ape he lived in Texas papa and mama ape Foley were ranchers simple folks trying to make a living He didn t have a silver spoon in his mouth and he built everything he has from scratch He played something called Shinny https en wikipedia org wiki Shinny which is like informal Ice Hockey He used a fuckin broomstick on thin ice to play hockey Everyone should hail Grandape Foley for his large balls and come up from nothing In 1967 while still in school He made 40 000 in the stock market in his spare time In 1960 fucking 7 That s the equivalent of 322 000 today He made the equivalent of more than a quarter of a million in his spare time before your daddy and mommy were out of grade school Did I mention he wound up losing it all Sounds like one of us One of us One of us He went to the Air Force and left after getting bored of negotiating multi million dollar defense deals with Boeing Grandape Foley had other goals in mind So he took his diamond hands and diamond balls and got into business Foley got involved with Fidelity National Back when they were only doing 6m a year in revenue and grew the fuckin thing to a current 90B market cap Let that sink it Diamond hands if I ve ever seen any Grandape Foley is building his legacy from scratch everything he touches turns to gold with those glorious diamond hands Fast forward a bit and here s what he does next Remember when I told you he played Shinny informal ice hockey w a fucking broomstick Well he developed a lifelong passion for Ice Hockey So what does a rich self made ape do with his money and passion for Ice Hockey Well he buys an NHL team of course But this isn t just any old regular ape schmo we re talkin about here This is Grandape Foley He doesn t just buy the best team in hockey and take over the league That would be too easy Nope he starts a new team from scratch In 2017 Grandape Foley brings the Las Vegas Golden Knights into the NHL and in their 2nd year they re already in the finals for the Stanley Cup They didn t win but that s likely because Foley wasn t on the ice with his broomstick And now the most important part in the legend of Grandape Foley All the while he s been building an almost silent iGaming Empire And if there is anything we can learn from all of this it s that Grandape Foley is a winner He took PaySafe PSFE public around 6 months ago to not much fan fare But Grandape Foley doesn t give a fuck He s been silently moving his big balls all through the iGaming industry making large strategic moves Grandape Foley once said it was hard to handle poker chips in his hometown of Vegas because they fall out of his diamond hands So he s envisioning an entirely chipless casino industry in person and legally online While everyone is focusing on digital coins and old outdated movie companies getting eaten alive by Netflix Foley is building a new world in iGaming and doing it on the back of PSFE Here s some more DD on Grandape Foley incase you haven t heard He invested 100M in a strategic move in sightline payments https www youtube com watch v vWoEz9BeqGQ Which is bringing cashless payments to casinos Strategic typically means we intend on acquiring you Through another of his SPACS AUS he is bringing Wynn Casinos public https www fool com investing 2021 05 11 wynn resorts online gambling platform is going pub Synergy baby not to mention the ticker symbol AUS autists he s speaking to us PSFE is currently landing deal after deal with iGaming providers to be their payments platform This is a huge industry almost none of the big providers are touching because of the legal red tape on iGaming and supporting their payment flow So quietly Grandape Foley is building an empire through PSFE A couple of thought provoking questions to think on in your Monkey brains 1 Isn t it obvious what s going on here Foley is using the underlying payments platform PSFE to leverage his relationships in Vegas to completely dominate the iGaming industry 2 Good ole Grandape owns an NHL team in Vegas You better believe these Casino CEOs are coming to his owners box and talking business deals 3 Strategically investing in Sightline cashless casinos tech and Wynn a large casino in and around Vegas hmmm Finally and most importantly what caused me to YOLO hard into PSFE From one Diamond handed ape to another ask yourself Why would Foley who is 76 years old has all the money in the world and owns a major winning sports franchise waste his time messing around with PSFE and all the strategic plays if he didn t think this was going to be his biggest deal yet and maybe his life legacy I believe it will be I believe he knows exactly what he s doing You don t go from playing Shinny with a broomstick on thin ice and milking cows to becoming a multi self made billionaire if you don t know what you re doing I m betting on good ole Grandape Foley

campfire kiddo s let me tell you about Good Ole Grandape Foley Many know the merits of Grandape Foley but lots of you young monkey like natural resource handed savages may not So let me paint the picture for you You think you have hands of Diamond Well let me tell you Grandape Foley has diamond hands of the highest kind Carats so large he doesn t only drag his knuckles his forearms scrape the floor too Here are some fun facts about Grandape Foley that will explain the legend behind the Ape amp x200B He s 76 years old and still kicking wall street bankers in the dick He does things his own way and builds empires with his glorious diamond hands mostly from scratch I ll touch on that below He was born 4 months and 16 days before Hitler died 4 days short of a 420 Coincidence I think not As a young ape he lived in Texas papa and mama ape Foley were ranchers simple folks trying to make a living He didn t have a silver spoon in his mouth and he built everything he has from scratch He played something called Shinny https en wikipedia org wiki Shinny which is like informal Ice Hockey He used a fuckin broomstick on thin ice to play hockey Everyone should hail Grandape Foley for his large balls and come up from nothing In 1967 while still in school He made 40 000 in the stock market in his spare time In 1960 fucking 7 That s the equivalent of 322 000 today He made the equivalent of more than a quarter of a million in his spare time before your daddy and mommy were out of grade school Did I mention he wound up losing it all Sounds like one of us One of us One of us He went to the Air Force and left after getting bored of negotiating multi million dollar defense deals with Boeing Grandape Foley had other goals in mind So he took his diamond hands and diamond balls and got into business Foley got involved with Fidelity National Back when they were only doing 6m a year in revenue and grew the fuckin thing to a current 90B market cap Let that sink it Diamond hands if I ve ever seen any Grandape Foley is building his legacy from scratch everything he touches turns to gold with those glorious diamond hands Fast forward a bit and here s what he does next amp x200B Remember when I told you he played Shinny informal ice hockey w a fucking broomstick Well he developed a lifelong passion for Ice Hockey So what does a rich self made ape do with his money and passion for Ice Hockey Well he buys an NHL team of course But this isn t just any old regular ape schmo we re talkin about here This is Grandape Foley He doesn t just buy the best team in hockey and take over the league That would be too easy Nope he starts a new team from scratch In 2017 Grandape Foley brings the Las Vegas Golden Knights into the NHL and in their 2nd year they re already in the finals for the Stanley Cup They didn t win but that s likely because Foley wasn t on the ice with his broomstick And now the most important part in the legend of Grandape Foley All the while he s been building an almost silent iGaming Empire And if there is anything we can learn from all of this it s that Grandape Foley is a winner He took PaySafe PSFE public around 6 months ago to not much fan fare But Grandape Foley doesn t give a fuck He s been silently moving his big balls all through the iGaming industry making large strategic moves Grandape Foley once said it was hard to handle poker chips in his hometown of Vegas because they fall out of his diamond hands So he s envisioning an entirely chipless casino industry in person and legally online While everyone is focusing on digital coins and old outdated movie companies getting eaten alive by Netflix Foley is building a new world in iGaming and doing it on the back of PSFE Here s some more DD on Grandape Foley incase you haven t heard amp x200B He invested 100M in a strategic move in sightline payments https www youtube com watch v vWoEz9BeqGQ Which is bringing cashless payments to casinos Strategic typically means we intend on acquiring you he is bringing Wynn Casinos public https www fool com investing 2021 05 11 wynn resorts online gambling platform is going pub Synergy baby not to mention the ticker symbol AUS autists he s speaking to us PSFE is currently landing deal after deal with iGaming providers to be their payments platform This is a huge industry almost none of the big providers are touching because of the legal red tape on iGaming and supporting their payment flow So quietly Grandape Foley is building an empire through PSFE A couple of thought provoking questions to think on in your Monkey brains amp x200B 1 Isn t it obvious what s going on here Foley is using the underlying payments platform PSFE to leverage his relationships in Vegas to completely dominate the iGaming industry 2 Good ole Grandape owns an NHL team in Vegas You better believe these Casino CEOs are coming to his owners box and talking business deals 3 Strategically investing in Sightline cashless casinos tech and Wynn a large casino in and around Vegas hmmm Finally and most importantly what caused me to YOLO hard into PSFE From one Diamond handed ape to another ask yourself Why would Foley who is 76 years old has all the money in the world and owns a major winning sports franchise waste his time messing around with PSFE and all the strategic plays if he didn t think this was going to be his biggest deal yet and maybe his life legacy I believe it will be I believe he knows exactly what he s doing You don t go from playing Shinny with a broomstick on thin ice and milking cows to becoming a multi self made billionaire if you don t know what you re doing I m betting on good ole Grandape Foley amp x200B https preview redd it bo6nxqbe6g771 jpg width 1125 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s

high user engagement In other words being funny and not like other companies on social media is the most progressive advertising form that Wendy s has adopted and it s worked extremely well to the point of other companies following suit and copying the Wendy s example Wendy s has had interactions with other big meme stocks on twitter as well such as GameStop If Wendy s Twitter would acknowledge

301277399 html Myx Fitness A simple google search will show that MYX has the cheapest bike among competitors Cheaper is obviously not always better as a lot of times quality will suffer But in our situation it seems that it is cheaper and better in quality than most of the competition I have seen mostly good reviews and comments on social media about MYX bikes The most negativity I ve seen were complaints about shipping times but also that customer service has been very responsive about this issue A simple search will show you many people that dumped their old bike even it was more expensive for the Myx one Interestingly Myx has sold over 27 000 bikes in their first year of sales with the average user completing 15 workouts a month The attractive pricepoint of their bikes at 1 299 is 600 cheaper than peloton s basic bike Nutrition thats a big one Shakeology Shakeology is a superfood nutrition shake that can be a spark that prompts positive change in your life They ve also recently acquired Ladder in 2020 the sports nutrition company founded by LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger Ladder product is NSF Certified for Sport a third party certification trusted by all major sports governing bodies and verifies that products do not contain any of approximately 270 substances banned by major athletic organizations and that the contents of the product match what is printed on the label You can do a research on all of these on the official websites for more info Lets continue with Quick Financial Overview 1 1B est revenue for 2021 68 gross margins on that rev which is better than NFLX DIS PTON etc Digital subscriptions have 89 margins 43 YoY revenue increase for Q1 Added literally a million subscribers YoY 400M free cash on the books upon merger w no debt Also expanding to 10 countries globally in the future starting with Spanish and French from now Growth company and also tech company as you will see below in the post Beach body already has more than 2 6 MILLION paid digital subscribers We will talk about subscribers coaches and followers below All in all this is a financially solid company with plans for growth and expansion in an industry that is expected to have a CAGR of 33 by 2027 59B which happens to have a few meme like qualities and dont forget NO DEBT 2021 Q1 Financials Total Revenue 243M 43 increase YoY Total Subscriptions 3 2M 39 increase record high Not an actual earnings report assumed to be released after merger Q2 mentioned on interview will be even better Future Plans amp News Here s where they re really making moves Carl Daikeler CEO of BB and BeachBody has been operating on free cash flow and has been profitable for 20 years Upon this deal closing they ll have what they referred to as a war chest of 400M free cash with no debt on the books for M amp A marketing and expansion International Expansion The team has recently stated plans of expanding worldwide to 10 countries in the near future THATS IMPORTANT Lets make a break from facts and discuss numbers of followers and subscribers If you check company s website and social media and put all the followers together you will see that they have millions of followers almost 3 million paid subs thousands of coaches that each one have thousands of followers so again millions of people Celebrities backing this one Lebron Shaq and Arnold together have 70 million followers Insiders have also thousands of followers so here its good to say we speak about literally an army of people A cult that loves Beachbody Important also is that Carl is a so well organized CEO that knows that BB has thousands of followers so as he mentioned lots of times he has well organized groups and teams in order o connect with each other in order not to exist many groups on FB or any other social scattered all these people are well organized and managing thousands and millions of people subs and coaches to connect each other Lets talk about Tech in Fitness Anytime you throw tech into an industry or sector it instantly becomes more attractive This is exactly what BB MYX and OpenFit are doing 2020 saw a serious surge of fitness apps being downloaded OpenFit has good ratings on the app store 4 9 stars from 15k reviews App is also backed by Arnold and Lebron People like the idea of being connected in their workouts giving them the ability to compete with friends and strangers alike There is a YouTube account called Garage Gym Reviews this guy makes a living reviewing equipment and how that equipment will fit in your garage gym He recently reviewed Tonal and spoke on how tech connected fitness will be a huge market going forward Some people will obviously not be able to afford to build a garage gym or 3k Tonal or an expensive exercise bike This is where a 99 year BB subscription could come in What about Future of At Home Connected Fitness Why would people continue to workout from home after the pandemic is completely over This is a valid question but I fully believe people will continue to do so A study conducted by Wakefield Research in July 2020 concluded that 87 of 1000 participants who plan to return to the gym say they will continue to work out at home at least some of the time Links to those are here https www businesswire com news home 20200817005351 en The Future of Fitness Americans Embrace a Hybrid of Home Exercise and Gym Workouts and

during the pandemic and crucially 66 prefer it Among millennials the number is even higher 82 made the switch and 81 like it more Link to article here https www fastcompany com 90587575 gyms arent coming back heres how youll work out in the future Say the truth who prefers working at his own pace with his own music and great programmes instead of being next to people especially after pandemic waiting for his turn on the bikes Lets see if there is any Bear Case None Only thing bears came in mind was something about MLM scheme but i wont discuss it since Kevin and Carl answered already on all their interviews plus i wont mention MLM companies that their stocks are 50 100 pps because bears are getting nervous Finally most important PAY ATTENTION TO THE Short Squeeze summer lemonade

creating 20 short float on a proven highly profitable growth company and dropping over 50 of its value Now shares remaining are very low because most float is locked Shorts need aprox 8 days to cover and they getting trapped more and more every day and while trying to bash the stock everywhere in order to drop the price and get out since the dont have the shares to fight back the pressure Dont forget Monday BODY rings the bell and will attract more investors and retail plus all the cult behind this company as we mentioned above This can creat a massive squeeze with shorts covering IMPORTANT

Diesel touch along with the others turns to gold no need to mention other tickers we all know Who goes against these guys Everyone loves them Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs both former Disney execs will be staying on the BeachBody team to help with future growth post merge Kevin Mayer played a large role in the success of Disney also former TikTok CEO 1 billion revenue that Carl on interview said that we should add one or two zeros in the future on that without DEBT at all and with 400m on chest for marketing and promotion I dont want to post links to interviews and websites since we all know to google and search All are available in youtube and www and i dont want to make this thread longer The only thing i will say is this DD thread was to put your attention on this company that as CEO mentions along with all shareholders insiders and celebrities is the biggest online digital fitness subscription tech and nutrition company for the masses in the market Its the PTON for 99 and the Netflix of digital fitness all words from the all star team proven to turn into gold everything the worked with Some people say BODY to 0 5 20 30 50 100 i wont post or mention any pt but with so low float and so big Short float everything is doable with volume Share thoughts share anything like i shared mine and also i have to share my memeish feeling of the stock since day 1 First time such an all star team behind the wheel with so many followers behind them Shorts already seems to be in trouble into my eyes DEEP VALUE my fellow apes rangers Ogs whatever you like Everyone likes the stock it seems in social media and you know the power of social media from Kitty Tip gt No pumpers yet on BODY its a pure fundamental growth behemoth of a company that offers huge potential to investors in

to provide its members with openfit the all in one digital fitness nutrition and wellness platform 301277399 html Myx Fitness A simple google search will show that MYX has the cheapest bike among competitors Cheaper is obviously not always better as a lot of times quality will suffer But in our situation it seems that it is cheaper and better in quality than most of the competition I have seen mostly good reviews and comments on social media about MYX bikes The most negativity I ve seen were complaints about shipping times but also that customer service has been very responsive about this issue A simple search will show you many people that dumped their old bike even it was more expensive for the Myx one Interestingly Myx has sold over 27 000 bikes in their first year of sales with the average user completing 15 workouts a month The attractive pricepoint of their bikes at 1 299 is 600 cheaper than peloton s basic bike Nutrition thats a big one Shakeology Shakeology is a superfood nutrition shake that can be a spark that prompts positive change in your life They ve also recently acquired Ladder in 2020 the sports nutrition company founded by LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger Ladder product is NSF Certified for Sport a third party certification trusted by all major sports governing bodies and verifies that products do not contain any of approximately 270 substances banned by major athletic organizations and that the contents of the product match what is printed on the label You can do a research on all of these on the official websites for more info Lets continue with Quick Financial Overview 1 1B est revenue for 2021 68 gross margins on that rev which is better than NFLX DIS PTON etc Digital subscriptions have 89 margins 43 YoY revenue increase for Q1 Added literally a million subscribers YoY 400M free cash on the books upon merger w no debt Also expanding to 10 countries globally in the future starting with Spanish and French from now Growth company and also tech company as you will see below in the post Beach body already has more than 2 6 MILLION paid digital subscribers We will talk about subscribers coaches and followers below All in all this is a financially solid company with plans for growth and expansion in an industry that is expected to have a CAGR of 33 by 2027 59B which happens to have a few meme like qualities and dont forget NO DEBT 2021 Q1 Financials Total Revenue 243M 43 increase YoY Total Subscriptions 3 2M 39 increase record high Not an actual earnings report assumed to be released after merger Q2 mentioned on interview will be even better Future Plans amp News Here s where they re really making moves Carl Daikeler CEO of BB and BeachBody has been operating on free cash flow and has been profitable for 20 years Upon this deal closing they ll have what they referred to as a war chest of 400M free cash with no debt on the books for M amp A marketing and expansion International Expansion The team has recently stated plans of expanding worldwide to 10 countries in the near future THATS IMPORTANT Lets make a break from facts and discuss numbers of followers and subscribers If you check company s website and social media and put all the followers together you will see that they have millions of followers almost 3 million paid subs thousands of coaches that each one have thousands of followers so again millions of people Celebrities backing this one Lebron Shaq and Arnold together have 70 million followers Insiders have also thousands of followers so here its good to say we speak about literally an army of people A cult that loves Beachbody Important also is that Carl is a so well organized CEO that knows that BB has thousands of followers so as he mentioned lots of times he has well organized groups and teams in order o connect with each other in order not to exist many groups on FB or any other social scattered all these people are well organized and managing thousands and millions of people subs and coaches to connect each other Lets talk about Tech in Fitness Anytime you throw tech into an industry or sector it instantly becomes more attractive This is exactly what BB MYX and OpenFit are doing 2020 saw a serious surge of fitness apps being downloaded OpenFit has good ratings on the app store 4 9 stars from 15k reviews App is also backed by Arnold and Lebron People like the idea of being connected in their workouts giving them the ability to compete with friends and strangers alike There is a YouTube account called Garage Gym Reviews this guy makes a living reviewing equipment and how that equipment will fit in your garage gym He recently reviewed Tonal and spoke on how tech connected fitness will be a huge market going forward Some people will obviously not be able to afford to build a garage gym or 3k Tonal or an expensive exercise bike This is where a 99 year BB subscription could come in What about Future of At Home Connected Fitness Why would people continue to workout from home after the pandemic is completely over This is a valid question but I fully believe people will continue to do so A study conducted by Wakefield Research in July 2020 concluded that 87 of 1000 participants who plan to return to the gym say they will continue to work out at home at least some of the time Links to those are here https www businesswire com news home 20200817005351 en The Future of Fitness Americans Embrace a Hybrid of Home Exercise and Gym Workouts and here https www beachbodyondemand com blog home workouts future of fitness A survey of 3500 American by The New Consumer and Coefficient Capital found that 76 of people have tried working out at home during the pandemic and crucially 66 prefer it Among millennials the number is even higher 82 made the switch and 81 like it more Link to article here https www fastcompany com 90587575 gyms arent coming back heres how youll work out in the future Say the truth who prefers working at his own pace with his own music and great programmes instead of being next to people especially after pandemic waiting for his turn on the bikes Lets see if there is any Bear Case None Only thing bears came in mind was something about MLM scheme but i wont discuss it since Kevin and Carl answered already on all their interviews plus i wont mention MLM companies that their stocks are 50 100 pps because bears are getting nervous Finally most important PAY ATTENTION TO THE Short Squeeze summer lemonade POTENTIAL Check this image amp x200B 8 8 amp 37 only public shares https preview redd it xskpysamxg771 png width 362 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 6df6b236b85608bfa9915156f92830d05e92fe2d Monday BODY will have less than 30 milly shares available for shareholders that makes it a low float stock Already buying pressure from retail is obvious Already many tutes have positions with big names among them 74 total tutes 65 long only 1 short only 8 long short with a total of 9 million shares already As of 15 6 Short float was 20 in an already low floater Check this tweet for proof https twitter com ihors3 status 1404894383728730112 https twitter com ihors3 status 1404894383728730112 Stock already hit 18 back in February and since then shorts attacked it for several months creating 20 short float on a proven highly profitable growth company and dropping over 50 of its value Now shares remaining are very low because most float is locked Shorts need aprox 8 days to cover and they getting trapped more and more every day and while trying to bash the stock everywhere in order to drop the price and get out Dont forget Monday BODY rings the bell and will attract more investors and retail plus all the cult behind this company as we mentioned above This can creat a massive squeeze with shorts covering IMPORTANT Carl already told that he wont sell even 1 share of his 41 same the insiders lots of them forgot to mention are unknown Silicon Valley investors More MEMEish features BODY ticker hard to ignore This https www cnbc com 2019 10 01 stock picking buying a winner is easy just find a cool ticker symbol html article details a study that concluded that companies with cool tickers tend to outperform the market better than companies without Its summer anyways right Comparison to PTON Arnold Lebron and Shaq are all confirmed shareholders Collectively they have 128 7M followers on IG alone You can imagine what will happen if they start being vocal about their involvement in the company Dont forget anything big Diesel touch along with the others turns to gold no need to mention other tickers we all know Who goes against these guys Everyone loves them Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs both former Disney execs will be staying on the BeachBody team to help with future growth post merge Kevin Mayer played a large role in the success of Disney also former TikTok CEO 1 billion revenue that Carl on interview said that we should add one or two zeros in the future on that without DEBT at all and with 400m on chest for marketing and promotion I dont want to post links to interviews and websites since we all know to google and search All are available in youtube and www and i dont want to make this thread longer The only thing i will say is this DD thread was to put your attention on this company that as CEO mentions along with all shareholders insiders and celebrities is the biggest online digital fitness subscription tech and nutrition company for the masses in the market Its the PTON for 99 and the Netflix of digital fitness all words from the all star team proven to turn into gold everything the worked with Some people say BODY to 0 5 20 30 50 100 i wont post or mention any pt but with so low float and so big Short float everything is doable with volume Share thoughts share anything like i shared mine and also i have to share my memeish feeling of the stock since day 1 First time such an all star team behind the wheel with so many followers behind them Shorts already seems to be in trouble into my eyes DEEP VALUE my fellow apes rangers Ogs whatever you like Everyone likes the stock it seems in social media and you know the power of social media from Kitty Tip gt No pumpers yet on BODY its a pure fundamental growth behemoth of a company that offers huge potential to investors in early stages They target triple digits and they are capable of as a team Also dont forget BODY rings the bell this Monday 25 6 Big thanks fortaking some parts from the DD of Traditional Studio 5 and some other BB followers Any mistake i may not have seen please contact me to fix it asap since i double checked Sorry for any typos also Enjoy

There are a lot of people who understand the company better than I do but I really think this is worth looking seriously at and its up a little bit today so here s my first stab at DD Be advised I m not a sat com expert nor is this investment advice and I really have no Idea what I m doing here Also I should say Price Targets for GSAT range wildly I ve seen targets over 200 per share floated around with some pretty impressive analysis behind it but more conservatively I m in line with suggestions it COULD be 30 50 if and when all goes well in a very optimal scenario and it seems there s a much broader consensus on a 7 to 10 target in the near term GSAT owns c band and s band spectrum which with the push to 5G and Internet of Things has suddenly become incredibly valuable Recent FCC auctions will attest to this For years GSAT was waiting for FCC authorization on that spectrum but by the time they got it they had issues with debt and investors were wary to jump in without a clear Monetization plan for their spectrum The heavy debt situation has since been resolved giving them enough of a cash runway to continue in for the next three years Their business model during most of the past decade involved satellite phones and gps tracking which with their aging satellites and limited market for that kind of stuff was never meant to do much more than keep the lights on while they waited for the value of their spectrum to appreciate Their share price languished under 1 for a long time until 2021 when a couple things started to shift They partnered with Nokia to set up a secure redundant 5G node for the port of Seattle with more similar collaborations likely down the line Then most recently QCOM announced that their x65 next generation snapdragon modem which is the most popular smartphone modem in the world will connect to the n53 band specifically GSAT owns this band of spectrum nobody else QCOM obviously did that for a reason but as of now there s no widespread usage of that spectrum as it s not really being used except by GSAT SPOT devices and phones which is to say hardly at all Exactly what that means for GSAT is unclear but what it does mean is that within a few years millions of devices around the world will have the ability to connect to their spectrum There s a lot of DD out there breaking down price targets but the truth is nobody knows and the CEO and other execs have shown an incredible amount of patience and personal investment in terms of allowing their spectrum assets to appreciate while putting their own money on the line to keep things afloat over the years Starlink AT amp T Verizon should all be interested in buying and have probably all made offers or overtures but GSAT has not bitten even when they needed the money Which also suggests that the company is not interested in a sale And indeed leasing the spectrum might be far more lucrative than an outright sale and better for shareholders I won t bother describing the different possible monetization strategies here as I ve linked to a report published by Nokia at the bottom of this post that does a much better job than I could GSATs spectrum is sometimes compared to a large swath of undeveloped beachfront property in the middle of South Beach completely clean and unsullied in the middle of an increasingly crowded and frenzied space They look like a penny stock at first glance but they are far from it and it may be the ultimate 5G play You might ask What about Musk s Starlink Aren t they going to eat GSAT s lunch EDIT This is better addressed in a comment by u squishjonesjr Starlink use Ku band for their user terminal links and Ka for the gateway links they wont need any spectrum in C band Also doubt they would purchase spectrum to ensure others cant use it their main focus is not going bankrupt Their initial constellation will cost 10B and could be much higher if more sats are needed filed for up to 15k sats Not to mention their gen 1 sats have a useful life of 5 years so they will have to replace those soon after service start u squishjonesjr Starlink probably doesn t need GSAT spectrum and for our purposes GSAT is not really in competition with Starlink as their current business model which will be affected by Starlink is not the source of the stocks theoretcal valuation but if someone DID want to compete with Starlink they would need to access GSAT assets Which is another reason why Starlink might need to get there first not because they need it but because they dont want anyone else to have it Starlink is a possible buyer for GSAT not for their satellites but for their spectrum The value of GSAT is NOT in its satellites or the ground units its in the spectrum DISH is another possible buyer for GSAT Some people point to debt issues with GSAT It s true the company has diluted its shares quite a bit to remain solvent over the years but they currently have enough cash on hand to give them a three year runway It would make ZERO sense for another offering to occur BEFORE a major monetization event for the spectrum and since this is 5G that monetization event is going to happen WELL before they run out of cash Another issue often raised The FCC can just seize spectrum and reallocate it if they want that s what happened to insert late 90 s early 2000 s Sat company here These other companies from what I understand had major issues with solvency and so they basically went to the FCC to see what kind of deal they could get if they surrendered it to be reallocated BTW I ve learned that the correct way to talk about spectrum is not as something that GSAT owns or holds but as something they currently control Seems Risky Betting on the value of Globalstar spectrum WAS a risky play but now that QCOM has legitimized the value of the n53 band albeit not explicitly or specifically in terms of eventual use case by including it in the next gen snapdragon s connectivity ability the risk associated with the play has diminished a great deal The bear case of the QCOM aspect of all this is that including n53 connectivity is more of a marketing trick than something they imagine will actually get used but given that n53 is extraordinarily underutilized at this point even that scenario implies that QCOM expects to see expanded usage of that band in the short term Also I thought it was interesting that Nokia would publish this on their website https www nokia com blog case globalstar 6 ways leverage spectrum asset From Nokia Nokia customer Globalstar Inc a U S based provider of mobile satellite voice and data services is in the enviable position of having 2 4 GHz spectrum that works everywhere meaning it has been globally allocated 2 4 GHz spectrum is in the sweet spot from a physics perspective because it s good for both coverage and capacity Although it s not yet a 3GPP standardized spectrum band it has been approved by the Federal Communications Commission and recently in other countries It s remarkably clean meaning it s clear has no co channel interference and provides network benefits for both indoor and outdoor deployments Globalstar turned to Nokia to help determine the band characteristics for its available spectrum and identify potential application options Nokia s Network Planning and Optimization NPO team conducted a small cell network study of Globalstar s 2 4 GHz spectrum as compared to a similar HetNet network in 2 1 GHz The study proved the versatility of Globalstar s spectrum showing that operators with a small cell network could benefit from Globalstar s clean spectrum while those without small cell networks could benefit from its huge capacity In our study Globalstar s spectrum outperformed outdoor small cell deployments by 20 while requiring 33 less infrastructure For indoors in an urban office environment we were able to deploy approximately half the access points required since the band has no interference from macro towers operating in the same frequency The full report can be seen here The team went a step further to also provide six business model options for Globalstar to consider We were excited to work with Nokia s NPO experts to help determine how to best monetize and maximize the use cases of our spectrum asset so we can deliver the highest quality experience to the end users said Jay Monroe chairman and CEO of Globalstar 6 ways to monetize amp maximize the spectrum 1 Lease the spectrum to incumbent operators This provides extra capacity for operators and uses their own RAN equipment and services Operators can use clean spectrum without incumbrance and it supports standard capabilities like Carrier Aggregation roaming and redirection For Globalstar this is a simple revenue model without any operational burdens 2 Dedicated in building small cell spectrum The analysis clearly shows the difficulties presented by macro interference to small cell deployments Offering a dedicated clean spectrum band would dramatically improve the performance of these HetNets and significantly reduce the cost to deploy them Globalstar could lease the spectrum to one carrier nationwide or carriers in geographic regions that wanted to reduce the strain on their expensive macro tower infrastructure 3 Use the spectrum as a satellite service enhancement By deploying RANs in Globalstar s high use areas such as air terminals shipping ports military bases or cargo handling facilities Globalstar can both provide satellite offload and support high data rates and advanced applications Enhanced services are provided to customers where they normally congregate and for these customers there is a layer of satellite redundancy in the event of disruptions in terrestrial networks 4 Lease spectrum for private LTE systems to non carriers Cable companies are increasingly interested in pursuing wireless services themselves Globalstar s spectrum provides an opportunity to add a private LTE network on top of their dense cable plant Alternatively as the in building networks are further developed there may be an opportunity to include Globalstar s band as a private LTE service on top of neutral host models 5 Directly provide private services to enterprises By offering private LTE systems directly to enterprises Globalstar provides spectrum equipment and services to end user customers which provides direct control over the user experience and maximizes private LTE system revenue opportunities These deployments of Globalstar s spectrum could be done while several of these other options are pursued simultaneously 6 Mass market product enablement licensing Globalstar could license spectrum to ODM manufacturers for use in mass market This would include unrestricted use and products distributed globally This option could address the Internet of Things or Connected Car markets No matter what Globalstar decides to do Nokia will be there to partner with them in the U S and around the world We are also lending our support to the 3GPP standardization process and equipment manufacturing enablement which are critical for the spectrum s success

301277399 html Myx Fitness A simple google search will show that MYX has the cheapest bike among competitors Cheaper is obviously not always better as a lot of times quality will suffer But in our situation it seems that it is cheaper and better in quality than most of the competition I have seen mostly good reviews and comments on social media about MYX bikes The most negativity I ve seen were complaints about shipping times but also that customer service has been very responsive about this issue A simple search will show you many people that dumped their old bike even it was more expensive for the Myx one Interestingly Myx has sold over 27 000 bikes in their first year of sales with the average user completing 15 workouts a month The attractive pricepoint of their bikes at 1 299 is 600 cheaper than peloton s basic bike Nutrition thats a big one Shakeology Shakeology is a superfood nutrition shake that can be a spark that prompts positive change in your life They ve also recently acquired Ladder in 2020 the sports nutrition company founded by LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger Ladder product is NSF Certified for Sport a third party certification trusted by all major sports governing bodies and verifies that products do not contain any of approximately 270 substances banned by major athletic organizations and that the contents of the product match what is printed on the

than NFLX DIS PTON etc Digital subscriptions have 89 margins 43 YoY revenue increase for Q1 Added literally a million subscribers YoY 400M free cash on the books upon merger w no debt Also expanding to 10 countries globally in the future starting with Spanish and French from now Growth company and also tech company as you will see below in the post Beach body already has more than 2 6 MILLION paid digital subscribers We will talk about subscribers coaches and followers below All in all this is a financially solid company with plans for growth and expansion in an industry that is expected to have a CAGR of 33 by 2027 59B which happens to have a few meme like qualities and dont forget NO DEBT 2021 Q1 Financials Total Revenue 243M 43 increase YoY Total Subscriptions 3 2M 39 increase record high Not an actual earnings report assumed to be released after merger Q2 mentioned on interview will be even better Future Plans amp News Here s where they re really making moves Carl Daikeler CEO of BB and BeachBody has been operating on free cash flow and has been profitable for 20 years Upon this deal closing they ll have what they referred to as a war chest of 400M free cash with no debt on the books for M amp A marketing and expansion International Expansion The team has recently stated plans of expanding worldwide to 10 countries in the near future THATS IMPORTANT Lets make a break from facts and discuss numbers of followers and subscribers If you check company s website and social media and put all the followers together you will see that they have millions of followers almost 3 million paid subs thousands of coaches that each one have thousands of followers so again millions of people Celebrities backing this one Lebron Shaq and Arnold together have 70 million followers Insiders have also thousands of followers so here its good to say we speak about literally an army of people A cult that loves Beachbody Important also is that Carl is a so well organized CEO that knows that BB has thousands of followers so as he mentioned lots of times he has well organized groups and teams in order o connect with each other in order not to exist many groups on FB or any other social scattered all these people are well organized and managing thousands and millions of people subs and coaches to connect each other Lets talk about Tech in Fitness Anytime you throw tech into an industry or sector it instantly becomes more attractive This is exactly what BB MYX and OpenFit are doing 2020 saw a serious surge of fitness apps being downloaded OpenFit has good ratings on the app store 4 9 stars from 15k reviews App is also backed by Arnold and Lebron People like the idea of being connected in their workouts giving them the ability to compete with friends and strangers alike There is a YouTube account called Garage Gym Reviews this guy makes a living reviewing equipment and how that equipment will fit in your garage gym He recently reviewed Tonal and spoke on how tech connected fitness will be a huge market going forward Some people will obviously not be able to afford to build a garage gym or 3k Tonal or an expensive exercise bike This is where a 99 year BB subscription could come in What about Future of At Home Connected Fitness Why would people continue to workout from home after the pandemic is completely over This is a valid question but I fully believe people will continue to do so A study conducted by Wakefield Research in July 2020 concluded that 87 of 1000 participants who plan to return to the gym say they will continue to work out at home at least some of the time Links to those are here https www businesswire com news home 20200817005351 en The Future of Fitness Americans Embrace a Hybrid of Home Exercise and Gym Workouts and

coming back heres how youll work out in the future Say the truth who prefers working at his own pace with his own music and great programmes instead of being next to people especially after pandemic waiting for his turn on the bikes Lets see if there is any Bear Case None Only thing bears came in mind was something about MLM scheme but i wont discuss it since Kevin and Carl answered already on all their interviews plus i wont mention MLM companies that their stocks are 50 100 pps because bears are getting nervous Finally most important PAY ATTENTION TO THE Short Squeeze summer lemonade

BODY will have less than 30 milly shares available for shareholders that makes it a low float stock Already buying pressure from retail is obvious Already many tutes have positions with big names among them 74 total tutes 65 long only 1 short only 8 long short with a total of 9 million shares already As of 15 6 Short float was 20 in an already low floater Check this tweet for proof https twitter com ihors3 status 1404894383728730112 https twitter com ihors3 status 1404894383728730112 Stock already hit 18 back in February and since then shorts attacked it for several months creating 20 short float on a proven highly profitable growth company and dropping over 50 of its value Now shares remaining are very low because most float is locked Shorts need aprox 8 days to cover and they getting trapped more and more every day and while trying to bash the stock everywhere in order to drop the price and get out since the dont have the shares to fight back the pressure Dont forget Monday BODY rings the bell and will attract more investors and retail plus all the cult behind this company as we mentioned above This can creat a massive squeeze with shorts covering IMPORTANT gt Retail shareholders have high conviction and not selling shares Carl already told that he wont sell even 1 share of his 41 same applies for the insiders lots of them forgot to mention are unknown Silicon Valley investors More MEMEish features BODY ticker hard to ignore This https www cnbc com 2019 10 01 stock picking buying a winner is easy just find a cool ticker symbol html article details a

shareholders Collectively they have 128 7M followers on IG alone You can imagine what will happen if they start being vocal about their involvement in the company Dont forget anything big Diesel touch along with the others turns to gold no need to mention other tickers we all know Who goes against these guys Everyone loves them Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs both former Disney execs will be staying on the BeachBody team to help with future growth post merge Kevin Mayer played a large role in the success of Disney also former TikTok CEO 1 billion revenue that Carl on interview said that we should add one or two zeros in the future on that without DEBT at all and with 400m on chest for marketing and promotion I dont want to post links to interviews and websites since we all know to google and search All are available in youtube and www and i dont want to make this thread longer The only thing i will say is this DD thread was to put your attention on this company that as CEO mentions along with all shareholders insiders and celebrities is the biggest online digital fitness subscription tech and nutrition company for the masses in the market Its the PTON for 99 and the Netflix of digital fitness all words from the all star team proven to turn into gold everything the worked with Some people say BODY to 0 5 20 30 50 100 i wont post or mention any pt but with so low float and so big Short float everything is doable with volume Share thoughts share anything like i shared mine and also i have to share my memeish feeling of the stock since day 1 First time such an all star team behind the wheel with so many followers behind them Shorts already seems to be in trouble into my eyes DEEP VALUE my fellow apes rangers Ogs whatever you like Everyone likes the stock it seems in social media and you know the power of social media from Kitty Tip gt No pumpers yet on BODY its a pure fundamental growth behemoth of a company that offers huge potential to investors in early stages They target triple digits and they are capable of as a team Also dont forget BODY rings the bell this Monday 25 6 Big thanks fortaking some parts from the DD of Traditional Studio 5 and some other BB followers Any mistake i may not have seen please contact me to fix it asap since i double checked Sorry for any typos also Enjoy

301277399 html Myx Fitness A simple google search will show that MYX has the cheapest bike among competitors Cheaper is obviously not always better as a lot of times quality will suffer But in our situation it seems that it is cheaper and better in quality than most of the competition I have seen mostly good reviews and comments on social media about MYX bikes The most negativity I ve seen were complaints about shipping times but also that customer service has been very responsive about this issue A simple search will show you many people that dumped their old bike even it was more expensive for the Myx one Interestingly Myx has sold over 27 000 bikes in their first year of sales with the average user completing 15 workouts a month The attractive pricepoint of their bikes at 1 299 is 600 cheaper than peloton s basic bike Nutrition thats a big one Shakeology Shakeology is a superfood nutrition shake that can be a spark that prompts positive change in your life They ve also recently acquired Ladder in 2020 the sports nutrition company founded by LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger Ladder product is NSF Certified for Sport a third party certification trusted by all major sports governing bodies and verifies that products do not contain any of approximately 270 substances banned by major athletic organizations and that the contents of the product match what is printed on the

than NFLX DIS PTON etc Digital subscriptions have 89 margins 43 YoY revenue increase for Q1 Added literally a million subscribers YoY 400M free cash on the books upon merger w no debt Also expanding to 10 countries globally in the future starting with Spanish and French from now Growth company and also tech company as you will see below in the post Beach body already has more than 2 6 MILLION paid digital subscribers We will talk about subscribers coaches and followers below All in all this is a financially solid company with plans for growth and expansion in an industry that is expected to have a CAGR of 33 by 2027 59B which happens to have a few meme like qualities and dont forget NO DEBT 2021 Q1 Financials Total Revenue 243M 43 increase YoY Total Subscriptions 3 2M 39 increase record high Not an actual earnings report assumed to be released after merger Q2 mentioned on interview will be even better Future Plans amp News Here s where they re really making moves Carl Daikeler CEO of BB and BeachBody has been operating on free cash flow and has been profitable for 20 years Upon this deal closing they ll have what they referred to as a war chest of 400M free cash with no debt on the books for M amp A marketing and expansion International Expansion The team has recently stated plans of expanding worldwide to 10 countries in the near future THATS IMPORTANT Lets make a break from facts and discuss numbers of followers and subscribers If you check company s website and social media and put all the followers together you will see that they have millions of followers almost 3 million paid subs thousands of coaches that each one have thousands of followers so again millions of people Celebrities backing this one Lebron Shaq and Arnold together have 70 million followers Insiders have also thousands of followers so here its good to say we speak about literally an army of people A cult that loves Beachbody Important also is that Carl is a so well organized CEO that knows that BB has thousands of followers so as he mentioned lots of times he has well organized groups and teams in order o connect with each other in order not to exist many groups on FB or any other social scattered all these people are well organized and managing thousands and millions of people subs and coaches to connect each other Lets talk about Tech in Fitness Anytime you throw tech into an industry or sector it instantly becomes more attractive This is exactly what BB MYX and OpenFit are doing 2020 saw a serious surge of fitness apps being downloaded OpenFit has good ratings on the app store 4 9 stars from 15k reviews App is also backed by Arnold and Lebron People like the idea of being connected in their workouts giving them the ability to compete with friends and strangers alike There is a YouTube account called Garage Gym Reviews this guy makes a living reviewing equipment and how that equipment will fit in your garage gym He recently reviewed Tonal and spoke on how tech connected fitness will be a huge market going forward Some people will obviously not be able to afford to build a garage gym or 3k Tonal or an expensive exercise bike This is where a 99 year BB subscription could come in What about Future of At Home Connected Fitness Why would people continue to workout from home after the pandemic is completely over This is a valid question but I fully believe people will continue to do so A study conducted by Wakefield Research in July 2020 concluded that 87 of 1000 participants who plan to return to the gym say they will continue to work out at home at least some of the time Links to those are here https www businesswire com news home 20200817005351 en The Future of Fitness Americans Embrace a Hybrid of Home Exercise and Gym Workouts and here https www beachbodyondemand com blog home workouts future of fitness A survey of 3500 American by The New Consumer and Coefficient Capital found that 76 of people have tried working out at home during the pandemic and crucially 66 prefer it Among millennials the number is even higher 82 made the switch and 81 like it more Link to article here https www fastcompany com 90587575 gyms arent coming back heres how youll work out in the future Say the truth who prefers working at his own pace with his own music and great programmes instead of being next to people especially after pandemic waiting for his turn on the bikes Lets see if there is any Bear Case None Only thing bears came in mind was something about MLM scheme but i wont discuss it since Kevin and Carl answered already on all their interviews plus i wont mention MLM companies that their stocks are 50 100 pps because bears are getting nervous Finally most important PAY ATTENTION TO THE Short Squeeze summer lemonade POTENTIAL Check this image amp x200B amp x200B 8 8 amp 37 only public shares https preview redd it unkrgq17gh771 png width 362 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 6849de07ad327d6a808d1f44d4fc55147312d165 Monday BODY will have less than 30 milly shares available for shareholders that makes it a low float stock Already buying pressure from retail is obvious Already many tutes have positions with big names among them 74 total tutes 65 long only 1 short only 8 long short with a total of 9 million shares already As of 15 6 Short float was 20 in an already low floater Check this tweet for proof https twitter com ihors3 status 1404894383728730112 https twitter com ihors3 status 1404894383728730112 Stock already hit 18 back in February and since then shorts attacked it for several months creating 20 short float on a proven highly profitable growth company and dropping over 50 of its value Now shares remaining are very low because most float is locked Shorts need aprox 8 days to cover and they getting trapped more and more every day and while trying to bash the stock everywhere in order to drop the price and get out since the dont have the shares to fight back the pressure Dont forget Monday BODY rings the bell and will attract more investors and retail plus all the cult behind this company as we mentioned above This can creat a massive squeeze with shorts covering IMPORTANT gt Retail shareholders have high conviction and not selling shares Carl already told that he wont sell even 1 share of his 41 same applies for the insiders lots of them forgot to mention are unknown Silicon Valley investors More MEMEish features BODY ticker hard to ignore This https www cnbc com 2019 10 01 stock picking buying a winner is easy just find a cool ticker symbol html article details a study that concluded that companies with cool tickers tend to outperform the market better than companies without Its summer anyways right Comparison to PTON Arnold Lebron and Shaq are all confirmed shareholders Collectively they have 128 7M followers on IG alone You can imagine what will happen if they start being vocal about their involvement in the company Dont forget anything big Diesel touch along with the others turns to gold no need to mention other tickers we all know Who goes against these guys Everyone loves them Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs both former Disney execs will be staying on the BeachBody team to help with future growth post merge Kevin Mayer played a large role in the success of Disney also former TikTok CEO 1 billion revenue that Carl on interview said that we should add one or two zeros in the future on that without DEBT at all and with 400m on chest for marketing and promotion I dont want to post links to interviews and websites since we all know to google and search All are available in youtube and www and i dont want to make this thread longer The only thing i will say is this DD thread was to put your attention on this company that as CEO mentions along with all shareholders insiders and celebrities is the biggest online digital fitness subscription tech and nutrition company for the masses in the market Its the PTON for 99 and the Netflix of digital fitness all words from the all star team proven to turn into gold everything the worked with Some people say BODY to 0 5 20 30 50 100 i wont post or mention any pt but with so low float and so big Short float everything is doable with volume Share thoughts share anything like i shared mine and also i have to share my memeish feeling of the stock since day 1 First time such an all star team behind the wheel with so many followers behind them Shorts already seems to be in trouble into my eyes DEEP VALUE my fellow apes rangers Ogs whatever you like Everyone likes the stock it seems in social media and you know the power of social media from Kitty Tip gt No pumpers yet on BODY its a pure fundamental growth behemoth of a company that offers huge potential to investors in early stages They target triple digits and they are capable of as a team Also dont forget BODY rings the bell this Monday 25 6 Big thanks fortaking some parts from the DD of Traditional Studio 5 and some other BB followers Any mistake i may not have seen please contact me to fix it asap since i double checked Sorry for any typos also Enjoy
