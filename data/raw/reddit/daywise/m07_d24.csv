America spent 778 bilion U S dollars last fiscal year solely dedicated to the military The 2022 fiscal year budget is currently proposed and below I break it down for you section by section giving you the dirty numbers and what they mean for the future of military contracting companies as well as your money The Budget The 2022 National Defense budget was a proposed 777 9 billion dollars broken down as follows gt 740 3 billion for the Department Of Defense DOD gt 27 3 billion for the Department Of Energy gt 9 9 billion for Defense related Activities Outside NDAA Jurisdiction In the proposed bill there are some key important but brief highlights some of which are below gt Includes funding to support a 2 7 percent pay raise for both military servicemembers and the DOD civilian workforce gt Amends the Military Selective Service Act to require the registration of women for Selective Service gt Authorizes fiscal year 2022 active duty end strengths for the Army of 485 000 the Navy 346 200 the Marine Corps 178 500 the Air Force 329 220 and the Space Force 8 400 gt Extends and modifies the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and reiterates the committee s intent to improve our force posture in the Indo Pacific increase readiness and presence and build the capabilities of our partners and allies to counter the growing threat from and increasing aggression of China gt Authorizes an increase of more than 1 billion in funds available for science and technology programs that fund cutting edge research and prototyping activities at universities small businesses defense labs and industry including in critical areas such as artificial intelligence microelectronics advanced materials 5G and biotechnology gt Authorizes an increase of more than 500 million in funding for Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency s DARPA high risk high payoff research including in areas such as quantum computing and university research The Breakdown Here s a brief explanation of why each key point is important An increase in pay makes our military happy usually this is to account for inflation though it s a bit low this year This year the increase in pay is offset by a reduction in overall force The inclusion of women in the draft can be significant or it could be nothing depending on how you look at it I m heavily leaning on this being significant for a few reasons which have to do with how we see our enemies in the future near peer rivals see below As for total military personal Army active and reserve total 1 010 500 active only decrease 487 000 to 485 000 soldiers Navy decrease 407 329 to 404 800 with 343 450 active Marine Corps decrease 217 443 to 215 300 with 178 500 active Air Force increase 505 500 to 506 900 with 328 300 Space Force increase 6 400 to 8 400 A heavy emphasis is place on strengthening and increasing the readiness of the Indo Pacific region which is reiterated by the point that engagement is no longer focused on the Middle East but instead on Near Peer rivals This is a dramatic shift albeit expected from what we ve been doing for the past 20 years in the Middle East The document goes on to state that this strategic competition between the USA and China Russia is likely to intensify due to shifts in the military balance of power and diverging visions of governance models between China and Russia and the West An increase in funds for DARPA also emphasizes the above point we need newer and better technology rail gun etc because the next war is likely to be against someone who has more firepower and training than the middle eastern countries did Quanten Computing was emphasized which Leads me to believe it s being looked in to as the way to develop the newest communication technology or possibly it s used in decrypting valuable information But where do stocks come in to play Where s the money The answers are in the bowels of the document and here s where the money can be made The Army gt Authorizes procurement of AH 64E Apache helicopters Built by Boeing Ticker BA the amount in dollars and total Produzent numbers is undisclosed This means it s could range from a handful to hundreds gt Supports requested funding for rapid development and fielding of land based long range fires including Precision Strike Missile PrSM Medium Range Capability MRC and Long Range Hypersonic Weapon LRHW but requires a report on LRHW munitions costs and alternatives The PrSM MRC and LRHW are built by Lockheed Martin Corporation Ticker LMT gt Supports procurement of the Integrated Visual Augmentations System IVAS consistent with ongoing development and requires a post operational test report on system development functionality and suitability and the plan for continued iterative improvement Developed by Microsoft ticker MSFT this hardware has shown exceptional capabilities in the field already The Air Force gt Authorizes 4 285 billion for the F 35A program increase of 85 million for the procurement of additional an F 35A Built by Lockheed Martin Corporation ticker LMT gt Authorizes 201 6 million for the Skyborg program an increase of 75 million for the purchase of Valkyrie aircraft Extended name Kratos XQ 58 Valkyrie Built by Kratos Defense amp Security Solutions Inc ticker KTOS is an experimental stealthy unmanned combat aerial vehicle designed to assist the F 22 and F 35 on combat missions The Navy gt Authorizes 3 716 billion for Arleigh Burke class destroyers an increase of 1 7 billion to restore a second guided missile destroyer to the budget Built by Bath Iron Works Huntington Ingalls Industries with Combat System Integrated by Lockheed Martin Corporation ticker LMT gt Authorizes 270 0 million for expeditionary fast transport vessels Built by Austal Australian Company gt Authorizes the following 535 million to purchase an additional five F 35C aircraft 191 million to purchase an additional E 2D aircraft 305 8 million to purchase two additional C 130J aircraft 191 9 million to purchase an additional KC 130J tanker aircraft 250 0 million to purchase two additional CH 53K helicopters 323 0 million to purchase two MQ 4C Triton unmanned aerial systems 246 6 million to purchase additional F 35B spares and ground support Nothing of any significance like large orders etc Other Notable Items of Interest Missile Defense Programs gt Authorizes the Director of the Missile Defense Agency MDA to develop a highly reliable missile defense interceptor for the Ground Based Midcourse Defense system This may take a few years but we will likely see contracting bids from Lockheed Boeing Northrop Grumman etc for this at some point this is something to keep an eye on Miscellaneous The following don t have a direct impact on your money yet but they could have a significant impact in the near future as we move away from fighting in the Middle East and focusing on larger threats China and Russia The proposal states gt it shall be the policy of the United States to maintain the ability of the United States Armed Forces to deny a fait accompli against Taiwan in order to deter the People s Republic of China from using military force to unilaterally change the status quo with Taiwan Large words but this essentially boils down to the USA maintaining policy on Taiwan being free and China being unable to overtake Taiwan simply because they want too Fait accompli meaning to leave someone with no option but to accept it with it being the overtaking of Taiwan As proposed the USA will continue to provide security assistance and intelligence support to military and other security forces of the Government of Ukraine as well as supporting the Baltic states of Estonia Latvia and Lithuania as they build and invest in critical security areas Conclusion I hope you all found this helpful it took a bit of time to make so I do hope it was worthwhile As always I m not a financial advisor I just wanted to post what I read

come to Wallstreetbets today to have your terrible excellent well thought out investment decisions validated Are you scrolling endlessly searching in vein for that sweet sweet hit of confirmation bias Well my friend this is not the post for you Featuring the great horizontal line drawing skill you ve come to expect from a guy named Cbass with a free bonus of some non horizontal lines Wow So much value Wait THERE IS MORE Now for a limited time some rambling low effort DD that you ll probably just scroll past on your way to spamming rocket emojis amp x200B Table of Contents Part 1 Meme Status Part 2 Cum tastic Charts Part 3 Donkey Dicks Part 4 The Short Term Gamble Part 5 The Long Term Gamble Part 6 And now my Watch has begun amp x200B Part 1 Meme Status I ve stated elsewhere https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments oib6l8 the state of the meme a ta of all your favorite the definition of Meme Stock I use but in short it is thus Meme DDs get made amp price goes up gt Options Wizards buy options amp Thing happens gt idiots FOMO in at terrible prices then diamond hand gt diamond hands result in higher low gt repeat for next leg up Basically there are two kinds of plays around here True Memes and P amp Ds The True Memes have two distinguishing features 1 the involvement of the Options Wizards who buy all those options forcing the MMs to hedge and causing the Thing and 2 after the retracement the price action stabilizes at a higher low Obviously this could all just be me seeing bunnies in every cloud I m naught but a simple man with his intentions writ clear upon his trucker hat so take what you will from my ramblings However when comparing the likes of GME AMC BB and BBBY with things like RKT CRSR WISH WOOF etc it appears there are some tickers that have the follow through after the initial push and those are what I m calling the True Memes So is CLOV a True Meme Answer it s hanging on by a worn thread It remains my contention that a higher low is a requirement for the follow through on these plays After all if the ticker returns back to its pre meme price which for many of these is the all time low or worse goes even lower what then did the diamond handing accomplish Answer jack shit Think of it this way if a bunch of people flood into the stock and buy up enough of the float supply and demand dictate that the price should stabilize at a higher low Yes the stock market is full of fuckery and it s not as simple as all that but if the price just slides back to the low the simple conclusion is there are not as many of you as you think there are Also going back down to the pre meme low or worse is about as demoralizing as it can get Many so called apes are going to say fuck it I was had and dump their shares for a loss Further it is going to severally damage the image of the play making it look like nothing more than another P amp D Of course I could be proven wrong here CLOV could fall down and put in a new all time low before shooting the moon Who cares if your wrong as long as you still make money amp x200B Part 2 Cum tastic Charts First the daily chart with Cbass s patented horizontal lines Clov tastic https preview redd

should specifically be around the breakout level of the previous move We are way the fuck under that so I m just gonna toss that one out the window because it both makes me wrong and fills me with regret So I ve just applied Cbass s Second Law of TA When you re wrong just move the lines until you re right again Last week the ticker found some support at 8 Which is technically a higher low with the all time low being 6 31 That s 1 69 higher Impressive It was actually an obvious place to stabilize for a few days I mean everyone and their mother knows the 92 5 Fibonacci retracement level is like totally the real level and super duper important Next up I ve prepared two charts in accordance with Cbass s First Law of TA You can always find a chart amp indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear Sexy wedge breakout that totally means something https preview redd it 7l37izwj57d71 png width 1570 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 81806c9a7a1da78f165d2caad87c6c85459b1073 As you can see here I found the hidden downward wedge that we ve already broken out of and therefore the next logical stop is 100 share This is how TA is done I ve seen some posts by some fucking rank amateurs that I m pretty sure were referring to me when they claimed that there were people posting tons of shitty TA Bruh you wish you had these skills Cbass don t need no fuckin Bollinger bands Keltner somethings so called moving averages or any of that fancy bullshit I could do it all with horizontal lines but look here I figured out how to draw other kinds of lines Here s another example of my superior line skills Look at em skills and burn with jealousy https preview redd it mstskgyi77d71 png width 1570 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 9b988d3bf2c072f6e219e4dd7b95547e1bdd5ab4 Here you can see we were in a downward channel from the beginning of the month and we re now not in that downward channel Which means we can t possibly go down anymore Again 100 share imminent Furthermore the upper channel has clearly turned from resistance into support Bruh it just do get more bullish than this Except if I do this Drawing a sad face downtrend line https preview redd it flgwlice77d71 png width 1570 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 59d666de69e1bb228c5511f701266f7eb2a068a2 Here I just found a different line that maintains the bearish case In this world when the price gets back up to the red dashed line it will be promptly rejected to 0 But I own this stock and this outcome doesn t make me any money so for reasons this chart is wrong and we definitely do not exist in this version of reality amp x200B Part 3 Donkey Dicks Now I ve never done DD on anything until after I bought it Thus in keeping with tradition I ve taken a cursory glance at the underlying company of this wunderkind of a ticker after finding myself down 40 In short it s basically shit Someone right now is screaming Cathie Woodisms at their screen like disruptor innovator AI machine learning tech growth next gen etc Dude these guys sell insurance to old people Worse they only sell one kind of insurance Medicare Advantage Will they make money in the future Yeah sure But there is no fucking universe where this narrow category of business is going to command a premium like Tesla or whatever the fuck Cathie is pumping these days You can fantasize about the whole of the human species paying endless subscription fees for the privilege of being driven around in a self driving Tesla that smells like someone had sex in the back seat You re high but it is technically possible Clover Healthcare has a subset of the elderly in one country as their maximum consumer base And the government has their hand in the mix But their saving the government money with their software platform 1 The government doesn t actually give a fuck about saving money If the past two years taught you nothing else I hope this at least got through 2 Calling a computer program a software platform doesn t make it anything more than a program where you input information Is it really that much more than a fancy version of Microsoft Excel I doubt it but maybe if they gamify the button clicking they can get people hooked with the dopamine effect It just looks like advertising to me kind of like when the term computer program got replaced with app in order to make it sound like something more than just a program running on your phone Whatever before I ever get old enough to be on Medicare Advantage I m going out in a blaze of hookers and coke so I ll never get the chance to click those buttons CLOV gets compared to a lot of the mainline insurers e g United Health Care UNH UNH has a market cap literally 100x CLOV and yet people are like CLOV totally deserves to be valued like UNH UNH has an income of 14 5 B CLOV is at 55 M Even sitting at a market cap of 395 B UNH is only running a p e of 27 6 with a forward p e 19 4 They are a massive company that offers all varieties of insurance and they are making fucking bank thus their stock is steadily climbing to the moon You can point at the 80 20 rule and make the case that it is responsible for the spirally cost of health care in America and I ll nod my head and agree but that does not mean CLOV is riding into this dusty town to save the day They are in too narrow a category to have an appreciable effect on overall costs in my opinion assuming they have any effect at all But Clover is growing at double digits It s easy to grow double digits when you start with no customers After 2023 I believe the estimate is 5 7 per year It s not terrible but it s not going to take you to the moon If CLOV is able to expand out into the general insurance market and take away market share from the big boys then okay there s some case for the crazy valuations people are throwing around But I ve as much chance of snorting lines off the titties a Victoria s Secret model while raw dogging her on the hood of a brand new lambo parked on my yacht

827d4edb502eb6f0993de5c284bc6b9e2d2182b2 amp x200B Part 4 The Short Term Gamble So given that the TA on CLOV is a crap shoot as all TA is and the underlying company is less than amazing why the fuck would anyone in their right mind buy this ticker Simple gambling That is what CLOV was is and all it ever will be a gamble And you came here gamble because this is the fucking casino That s why I bought it I was wrong about an immediate turn around after the first launch and so now I m stuck sucking pond scum Such is life Is the short term gamble over No not yet As the charts show CLOV is bottoming out which means the next direction should be up Obviously because it s gambling down is possible but nobody came here to hear that Furthermore CLOV remains one of the top tickers sentiment wise A lot of eyes balls has the potential to materialize that sudden move upward that everyone is pretending they re not here for On top of that the SI remains high I think the importance of SI is way overblown but most people think otherwise and that belief alone will drive retail toward the ticker Finally it looks like the Options Wizard took one shot at this thing I don t know this for certain and there is a chance they will come back around to it if things start moving up Thus there remains the potential for a second massive launch So let s assume someone is looking at this and thinking Okay based on the charts I might take a stab at this The next question is Get in now or wait for 7 This is impossible to answer of course but if you are like me then if you buy now it will drop to 7 because the stock market exists to fuck with you specifically By the same rule if you wait then it will take off without you and you ll FOMO in at 25 Pick your poison Of course my theory of these plays states a breakdown back to lows ends the play If it does happen I will obviously just revise my theory so that I m still not wrong because I do TA how it s supposed to be done amp x200B Part 5 The Long Term Gamble Long term CLOV is still just a gamble The delusional idiots will tell you this is a can t fail investment All investments can fail including this one People like the fall back position i e I gambled on the short term jump and lost but that s okay because long term this is a 100 winner This is how you get delusional bagholders a cult At the current price level is CLOV a good long term gamble It s the definition of mediocre Will it be at 500 in ten years because that s where UNH is now Not unless JPow initiates hyperinflation in which case that new fleshlight you ve got on your Amazon wishlist is going to be a 1000 so you know bigger problems A more reasonable target is mid 20s low 30s at best within 2 5 years assuming there is no moon landing and the retail interest dies off and CLOV becomes just another ticker in the garden The current 12 month average price target is 10 30 Again This is gambling There are a bunch of believers for this stock like any ticker that gets its own sub reddit and I think if we end up in the long gamble much like poor Lord Stannis they will be in for some disappointment What you thought you bought vs What you actually bought https preview redd it giidi4f4q7d71 jpg width 1200 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s c200009a29a4702ba7ca271b799dd3dce03ade6c Part 6 And now my Watch has begun I m a bagholder I m not gonna

kill me first As you can see from my positions below I m not in the worst spot not in the best either My odds of break even are pretty good I might have to wait two years to get there but I think I ll

0 en iQiyi to Hold Second Content Showcase and Industry Panel Discussion With The Justin Poy Agency in North America html amp x200B amp x200B With all this said OK So why was I previously short then And why am I long now My previous short thesis was essentially that all of these good news coming from Iqiyi were coming almost constantly but the stock has been only going down underperforming other Chinese tech stocks even those with directly negative news catalysts like Doyu and Huya and Tencent Music Entertainment Basically the stock was moving down based on nothing despite being a stock that normally trades in a comfortable range of 18 to 28 I had expected factors to hold constant and a short volume to hold steady or decrease as the price went down with people beginning to take long positions and early losses so long as nothing happened after my entry date up to mid August earnings amp x200B But then the news regarding restrictions on tutoring companies came to pass and it smashed all Chinese tech stocks Unlike before where IQ would make downward moves independently of other American listed Chinese tech this move brought everyone down together If IQ stock had been following the prior trend this should have lost as much as if not more than Bilibili which fell 12 Instead IQ stock fell 6 6 around half the move While the flow of shares and options were undeniably bearish on Friday there were two more things I noted which made me close my puts The first was a 5 million dollar large block buy and a purchase of 10 000 December 17 12 5 calls at the ask for a little over 1 3 million dollars in premium Daily short volume has now exceeded 50 up from 40 when I posted a week and a half ago The selling and the put buying that was bringing IQ down Friday is not as potent as it was over the past 3 weeks 45 million shares were short as of June 30 2021 that s around 15 of the float of 310 million shares I have been watching the volume traded intraday since end of June and I am confident that that 15 has now gone up to 16 17 The diminishing effect of shorting China names can also be observed in the larger Chinese tech companies like Alibaba Tencent Baidu which owns most of iQiyi and JD The short iQiyi trade is now crowded Thus I closed my puts and have started accumulating calls despite my previous target price 7 5 not hitting IQ stock has upside risk in that it could rebound Earnings are expected to come out in around 3 weeks on August 12 Even a rebound from this drop can result in the start of an uptrend If the uptrend persists into earnings IQ s uptrends historically last for 5 6 weeks a strong earnings which is likely will smash through several technical levels and send the stock price upward potentially breaking back up into its old trading range of 18 Yes this is using downward moves as a contrarian indicator but for IQ stock it worked on the downtrend and I expect it to work for the rebound too amp x200B Thus I am willing to be aggressive My new position is IQ September 17 15 calls which I have started accumulating Friday after closing my same strike expiry puts Based on the prior moves I am targeting 19 23 by September

performed by E E on AMC yahoo message board He has been providing great info and regularly shares his research to help novice investors Hey Apes There are about 100M legal shares on loan I did some calculations to come up with the realistic AMC SP when all the legal shares are returned My calculations for the legal shares on loan when returned first Here it goes 1 AMC share price jumped from 35 to 72 with 30M legal shares returned on June 2nd 2 If 60M legal shares on loan are returned AMC SP should be about 109 3 If 90M legal shares on loan are returned AMC SP should be about 146 4 If all 100M legal shares on loan are returned AMC SP should be about 158 30 I estimated there are about 3B synthetic shares My estimate is low Wes Christian thinks 9B to 26B synthetic shares There may be more I will provide my calculations for AMC SP based on my 3B synthetic shares created 9B and 26B synthetic shares 5 If 3B synthetic shares are returned buy back covered AMC SP should be about 7 200 6 If 9B synthetic shares are covered AMC SP should be about 21 600 7 If 26B synthetic shares are covered AMC SP should be about 62 208 We will find out the numbers of synthetic shares when Chad amp Wes count them I believe there will be FOMO when AMC SP starts to run from 100 There are probably many paper hands that will jump in once we short squeeze starts The HIGH of AMC SP might be higher than 62 208 due to other variables FOMO Gamma Squeeze more than 26B synthetic shares etc The MOASS will happen Short HFs MMs can only delayed the inevitable It will come sooner or later I am HODL ING amp BUYING until these GREED CORRUPTED SHORT HFs cover These are only my research and opinions Do your own research before investing And some additional research by E E 1 AMC will likely surpass Volkswagen SP when it has its short squeeze Why a 5M Apes strong The numbers continue to grow each trading day b 80 Apes own AMC LEGAL shares 20 by institution c I believe there are about 2 5B 3B synthetic shares d There are more shorted AMC shares legal amp illegal than any other stocks when all the synthetic shares are officially counted e Apes own about 480 of all legal amp illegal shares f Short HFs MMs have been heavily shorting AMC for the past 3 months at about 10 Avg short position 2 Short HFs MMs used at least 7 different shorting tactics 2a They short in the Lit NYSE market 2b They massively bought in the Dark Pool amp sold those shares in the Lit Market to manipulate SP to strike stop losses amp get rid of paper hands 2c They short via the ETF any and all ETF with AMC stock 2d They short using Options 2e They short via converting convertible notes bonds death spiral debt into shares amp short those shares AA decided to withdraw 600M convertible bond to not give them any ammo 2f They short by FAKE selling among their many accounts to drive SP lower to strike stop losses 2g Even with SSR they have the ability to mark short shares as short exempt 3 Most if not all short HFs MMs are under water since the Avg short position was 10 about 3 months ago They are massive in over their heads They will have to cover their short position eventually It s a delay tactic to get as many paper hands out as possible before they cover But they have NOT covered it Instead they continue double triple quadruple down with their short positions Check the short interest It keeps going up 4 They own more than 50 of the media Be careful what you read The more under water these short HFs MMs are the more desperate they are amp the more FUD FUD FUD FUD FUD we see hear 5 They pump other stocks to get some paper hands to leave the AMC position to chase then dump those stocks The only 2 stocks with majority of Apes holding are AMC amp GME AMC continues to have more buying orders than selling orders even when it s on low volume day amp SP down Remember the 7 shorting tactics mentioned on item 2 6 I believe the market will likely crash due to AMC stock The banks know this Some are shutting down all existing personal lines of credit in coming weeks 7 AMC anticipates that this weekend Black Widow will beat F9 last week s opening The Poirier vs The McGregor fight will be shown at 95 AMC theaters this weekend 8 The CDC amp FDA think the current vaccination will likely be safe for the Delta Variance They do not think the booster shots are needed for the Delta Variance at this point This is great news for AMC 9 Short HFs MMs will likely go bankrupt if they continue to double down their short positions The Options T 35 Threshold Security Listing for 13 calendar days plus T 2 which mean next week last week of July Middle of August early September etc Start with June 25th count 13 calendar days from June 25 then add T 2 trading day We might be in this position until the end of 2021 or better half of 2022 due to all the call options and if AMC continues to be on the Threshold Securities List in the weeks and months ahead 10 I believe short HFs MMs will likely stop shorting at some point All the SEC amp FINRA rules have been put in place to stop this corrupted system for a more transparency amp level playing field for Retail Apes The short HFs MMs often choose to pay the fines rather than stop shorting The best case scenario I see is for them to short get in more deep water and start to go long or play some call options to recoup their losses It costs them about 1 billion a day with the CTB fees It costs Apes nothing to HODL They have not been covered yet I am HODL ing for as long as it takes until I see these short HFs MMs cover The Gamma Squeeze will eventually happen with all the Call Option Contracts The Mother of All Squeezes is inevitable and will likely trigger once Gamma Squeeze strikes 100 When the MOASS strikes we will likely see the most violent SP jumps Call options T 35 amp F T D of 13 calendar day plus T 2 will likely play out for weeks amp months This is the social amp culture movement play to bankrupt these short HFs MMs Anyone talking about the fundamentals or tell you about other shorted stocks is FUD to get you out of your game These are only my research and opinions Do your own research before investing And the latest Hey Diamond hand Apes It looks like the latest NSCC 2021 010 regards to naked shorting synthetic shares over leveraged amp liquidations by short HFs just passed Dark pool is a primary reason that led short HFs to this predicament total 7 shorting tactics as I previously mentioned These short HFs will NOT stop shorting or continue buying shares in the Dark pool amp selling in the lit NYSE exchange to manipulate SP to trigger Stop Losses to rid of AMC Paper hands Last week high percentage was 91 at one point in the dark pool It used to be 50 then 60 now Avg 70 It keeps going higher Peter Hann CFA indicates 5 000 per AMC SP in the dark pool Wes Christian estimated 9B 26B synthetic shares I estimated 3B synthetic shares conservative READ my previous posts to see my realistic AMC price target for 3B 9B amp 26B synthetic shares This is why we saw short HF bots told paper hands last week to sell at 300 350 when they see the fake squeeze AMC Paper Hands There are more FUD out there than ever before I suggest you choose carefully who you choose to listen to There are FUD amp more FUD by these short HFs amp the media Ask yourself why would short HF bots want you to sell at 300 350 when Peter Hann CFA indicates 5 000 in the dark pool or Wes Christian indicates 9B 26B synthetic shares Also Robinhood amp Webull route retail orders through Citadel Do not use Robinhood or Webull The Fed wants the short squeeze to take its natural course But they do NOT want to repeat the huge crash of 2008 They know that once the short HFs start to liquidate sell all their other positions to cover their massive AMC short positions the market will likely crash The longer this play out the worst the market crash will likely be The Fed DTCC will likely step in to enforce short HFs to start cover their short positions pretty soon imo The longer the Fed lets this goes on the worst for the short HFs over leveraged amp the bigger the market crash But the DTCC also know the short squeeze is inevitable amp the DTCC will have to bail out these short HFs I am continuing buying the dips amp HODL ING until the short HFs cover These are only my research and opinions Do your own research before investing

long so you might wanna grab a juice box and a handful of crayons to munch on in case you need a snack No links pretty charts or colors As I don t know what s gonna set off The Powers That Be I decided to go with a wall of text So apologies in advance If you want pretty colors save some of your snack crayons to draw on your own screens I ve written about Himax HIMX before Other folks as well have posted some DD on them and I won t repeat it all here as there s a lot of info That said a tiny sampling of background One of their biggest revenue sources is from ICs for flat panel screens They also make LCoS displays famously used in Google Glass a technology which also has the added benefit of being a main component in up and coming LiDAR systems for autonomous vehicles and they also look to be poised to take off with their flat panel tech for the automotive and trucking industry Suffice to say they make stuff that makes your tech toys more fun Lots of things in their favor but two that stand out are their negligible debt and the fact that the brothers Jordan and Biing Seng Wu secured fab time before COVID so they can make their goodies Hence they re gonna make money Which leads me to Dividend Yup they pay out a dividend Now that usually doesn t indicate rockets that will take us to the moon quickly but bear with me They paid out their dividend on Monday July 12 2021 based on their income from 2020 It came out to around 26 USA per share which closed on July 12 2021 at 15 39 USA each Here is why this is relevant 26 is approximately 1 7 of 15 39 This gives us numbers we can work with Maffs is hard but I ve tried to write this in Apeish so everyone can read and enjoy So let s dive in Now let s talk about the divvy for next year Scenario I Let s assume HIMX pays out a divvy at 100 next year as they did this year Let s also assume they re on target for their second quarter projected estimate but let s go with the figure in the lowest possible range given so that s gonna be 54 Now let s also assume they have a shitty rest of the year and make absolutely no more money So the total amount made for 2021 Quarter 1 2021 plus Quarter 2 2021 is approximately 92 This is the absolute minimum they can make for the year 2021 as of this writing and for the sake of our little exercise in Scenario I it s also gonna be the maximum Let s project forward to dividend payout date in 2022 If the percentage remains the same 1 7 of the share value then the price per share on the dividend payout date in 2022 which is typically in late June early July calculated from a dividend payout of 92 per share would give us a share price of around 54 12 USA Take a moment and let your smooth brain work on that one 15 39 USA to 54 12 USA in about one year s time An increase of approximately 352 Now a share price less than 54 12 would mean our percentage goes up because remember 92 dividend payout is for the sake of this exercise both the minimum and a constant So let s say the share price stays completely flat and is 15 39 USA on Divvy Payout Day 2022 That would mean the percentage on the payout of 92 would be approximately 6 To reiterate if one were to purchase HIMX at 15 39 around now and the price never moves up for a year in a year s time one would earn a minimum of 6 ROI with no downside it does not go tits up If the share price goes up our percentage return on the divvy goes down 92 being the constant but our shares are worth more AND we get a divvy payout Again no downside no tits up If the share price goes DOWN potential investors keeping tabs on HIMX have an OhShit Moment realizing they can get in on some sweet sweet divvy action and start buying driving the price back up to our purchase price and quite probably above it Again no downside no tits up As previously mentioned the heads of this joint secured fab time before COVID so they can make their goodies That means they re gonna make money for Quarters 3 and Quarters 4 of 2021 so the dollar figures for Scenario I are unlikely So onward to Scenario II Just for shits and giggles as they are gonna make more money than in Scenario I let s say they clear 78 combined for both Quarters 3 and 4 average of 39 USA per share for each quarter That puts our total profit for the year 2021 at 1 70 per share Again let s assume HIMX pays out a divvy at 100 next year as they did this year If the dividend percentage remains the same 1 7 of the share value then the price per share on the dividend payout date in 2022 again which is typically in late June early July would be 100 USA Sip on your juice box eat a crayon and contemplate that for a moment Scenario III Okay we ve been using data based on this most recent payout while also looking at some extreme examples of data Let s expand our data set and also start working with some reasonable numbers for next year to get what I feel will be a figure much closer to reality when the divvy pays out in 2022 Dividend Payment Date Payout Amount PPS on Payment Date Dividend as a of PPS on P Date 07 12 2021 0 272 15 39 USA 1 76 07 31 2018 0 10 6 61 USA 1 5 08 14 2017 0 24 8 29 USA 2 89 08 03 2016 0 13 8 77 USA 1 48 07 08 2015 0 30 8 465

calculate the percentage of the payout based on the previous year s EPS 2021 100 2018 62 5 2017 80 2016 86 6 2015 76 9 2014 75 2013 83 3 2012 100 2011 63 2010 114 dunno about this perhaps a special dividend payout 2009 57 2008 57 8 2007 51 Now here s some data I do not have in front of me the minimum percentage a publicly traded Taiwanese company must pay out for a dividend There are requirements for them to do a payout with some exceptions meeting some requirements Capex for example which is why HIMX did not pay out a divvy in 2019 and 2020 as they had Capex and met other requirements in both of those years but I don t think it has to be 100 As can be seen above it s been all over the map over the years As I don t know what the minimum would be and the laws did change in 2018 for Scenario III I m going to use 75 This allows HIMX to use 25 of their profits for Capex which I feel is reasonable Also instead of 1 7 for our divvy as a percentage of the share price ending on the payout date based on the Average Percentage after removing top and bottom outliers over the years we re going to use 4 07 Finally we ll use Nasdaq s Quarterly Earnings Forecasts to fill in the blanks for the rest of the year using the low EPS forecasts For Quarters 3 and 4 I feel their projections are way too low but as they re conservative and we re bound to hit them we ll go with them The Brothers Wu will be giving us better estimates for at least Quarter 3 come August 5 2021 Those numbers give us a total EPS for the year of 2021 at 1 31 per share Okay Based on this data which I feel is in a completely reasonable and realistic range we have the following Projecting forward to dividend payout date in 2022 if HIMX pays out a divvy at 75 next year on a percentage which is 4 07 of the share value then the price per share on the dividend payout date in 2022 which is typically in late June early July calculated from a dividend payout of 1 31 per share 75 of which is 9825 would give us a share price of approximately 24 14 Based off of the recent closing price of 15 39 this represents an upside of approximately 56 8 I feel this is an extremely realistic share price for the Dividend Payout Date in 2022 approximately one year from now as the absolute minimum it should be based on the data provided Additional thoughts Most people as well as institutions might not be interested in a stock for a 1 7 divvy payout but some might That return is far better than what a bank is giving on CDs these days That said at around a 4 return calculated from our historical data above institutional investors may start to sit up and take notice I feel based on the past performance 3 4 is probably the sweet spot for the return and as a result will entice more institutional investment This will also stabilize the share price historically HIMX has been owned largely by individual investors with a fairly low percentage of institutional investment This is actually why the divvy is so important not as a dividend but as a way to help stabilize the share price Reason as I wrote if the share price stays completely flat and is 15 39 USA on divvy payout date 2022 that would mean the percentage on the payout of 92 would be approximately 6 Again a share price less than that would mean our percentage goes up above 6 because remember 92 is for the sake of this exercise both the minimum and a constant So if you re an institution and you want need a place to park large amounts of cash something that s giving a a return on investment of 6 is fantastic Ergo institutions will be most interested in buying up HIMX thus driving the price back upwards and overall keeping it afloat and quite possibly preventing it from taking the massive dips it has in the past not to say it won t whipsaw again in the future but it may just not be quite as violent as it has in the past While I feel the price per share will reach approximately 24 by dividend payout date in 2022 it by no means is relegated to reaching that price or higher by next year In fact if history is any indication even with more institutional investment I suspect we may see wild price swings for the share price of HIMX between now and next year s dividend payout Now as indicated these might be tempered somewhat by the institutional purchases or individuals buying really large blocks of HIMX as described previously said purchases essentially stabilizing the price and preventing it from dropping significantly below its current price point That said an example of the possible upcoming action might be to see it run up to say 30 then drop back down to around 17 and finally stabilizing at 24 by Divvy Payout Day 2022 We haven t even begun to look at options yet If you re interested in options when they become available I d recommend looking at June July LEAPS buying calls or possibly selling puts Finally that s only for the next year As HIMX has more design wins and their newest bleeding edge technologies are adopted by more and more companies coupled with the current chip shortage that will last probably into at least 2023 they are poised to print for quite a few years to come Easiest thing to do right now is simply buy shares and hodl Get your divvy next year and if you want to sell do so and pay long term capital gains instead of short term Tendietown my fellow apes TL DR Maffs is hard so let s just say HIMX is gonna travel upwards and beyond over the next few years and pay you a divvy while it does so Buy and hodl and get a bucket of tendies either in the form of 4 divvy or a stock price that provides ROI at the very least 56 8 or greater probably much much more AND gives you a divvy Buckets of tendies for everyone on the planet of your choice
