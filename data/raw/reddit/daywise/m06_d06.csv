ZIPRecruiter ZIP is undervalued and in the sweet spot of a massive secular trend my DD has me convinced that this stock could break out First off it s important to realize that pretty much every employed person in America is considering a job change now that the pandemic is easing up For the past year and a half people have stuck it out in terrible jobs mostly because they were happy to have stable employment at the time and also nobody was hiring Now that the economy is taking off and companies are trying to hire again most workers are going to test the waters Recent estimates from Microsoft are that 40 of US employees will switch companies this year and other surveys found that at least 26 of workers leave their companies will find new work Experts are calling it the Great Resignation of 2021 The numbers are impossible to predict but just think about all the people in your own friend groups that have been complaining about their jobs for months and are trying to make a change https www techrepublic com article the great resignation of 2021 are 30 of workers really going to quit So if you agree that the labor markets are unfrozen and people will be taking advantage of it how can you make money off it Look at the software companies that will power enable this big trend Staffing recruiting companies that offer this as a service will benefit but they don t scale well If Manpower Group or Kelley Services has an extra 10 job applicants they may need to hire an extra recruiter costs go up as revenues go up With software platforms the new job applicants add volume with no incremental costs The biggest recruiting tool of all is LinkedIn but that s owned by MSFT and is just a sideshow to their main business Other large software players in the HR Tech space have recruiting tools such as GOOG SAP WDAY ADP CDAY etc but again the recruiting platform is on the periphery of what they do so not a core competency of any big players Besides these guys the market is fragmented There are thousands of job boards recruiting firms talent agencies and staffing companies that will help match applicants to companies but there is only one standalone software company that focuses on recruiting that is publicly traded ZIP https ideal com top recruiting software How does ZIP make money and why do they stand out The platform is free for individual people to look for jobs but companies will sign up for recurring accounts where they create jobs and post them into the platform ZIP is a job aggregator meaning it takes the job posting and replicates this on thousands of job boards across the world and then brings back quality candidates to the companies For employees it will match you with dozens of roles based on what you are looking for And because most jobs are virtual remote now this software opens up new roles and opportunities that previously a person wouldn t have considered Now here s where it really gets interesting ZIP went public a few weeks through a direct listing with no fanfare or hype Unless you really follow the HR software IPO market you wouldn t even know that this happened Shares currently trade around 24 and the company has a market cap of 2 5B ZIP has an EV Rev ratio of 9x which is under the big players above MSFT 10x CDAY 14x WDAY 11x etc meaning it s cheaper to buy a share of ZIP than a fully diversified software company that has products in multiple categories If recruiting is going to grow gangbusters this year as the economy rebounds how come ZIP is trading at a discount to larger companies that have smaller expected growth rates I m not a professional stock picker so this is just my speculation but I think there are 4 reasons why ZIP isn t getting any love yet 1 They are too small 2 5B market cap is a rounding error to a company like MSFT GOOG or WDAY 2 In 2020 ZIP had a negative growth year 2019 revenues of 430M went down 3 in 2020 to 418M Professional investors don t like that especially when every other software company went gangbusters in 2020 Well let s dig into that why did ZIP s revenue decrease in 2020 BECAUSE NOBODY WAS LOOKING FOR JOBS AND COMPANIES WEREN T HIRING NEW PEOPLE It was a pandemic and nobody was doing anything except watching netflix 3 The company had a Q1 earnings call in between filing the IPO paperwork but before the stock was trading Management had a lot of great things to say they basically argued that this is an unprecedented time in the recruiting market and they are well poised to capture it but I honestly don t think anyone was paying attention 4 On the earnings call the management said that Q2 is going to be huge 80 growth when compared to Q2 2020 but then the second half of the year could ramp down if people stop switching jobs Perhaps analysts didn t like that but isn t that obvious As long as the economy keeps picking up steam ZIP is going to do well TL DR ZIP is a stock worth taking a look at I feel they will fly under the radar until Q2 earnings when they will explode I m not a financial advisor so do you your own research too I LIKE THE STOCK I picked up 1200 shares last week

a thesis to present to all of you that could explain the price action we ve seen in over the last few days with AMC and GME and basically any other meme stocks This is not meant to replace or ignore any other factors influencing the price but I believe it does play an important factor The data used in this analysis is all publically available I ll do my best to explain below TLDR Options settlements on 1 and 0 DTE days to expire calls are what s causing selling pressures on Thursday and Friday not retail traders selling Diamond handers are hodling strong In order to understand this you need to know some option fundamentals There are plenty of resources online where you can learn this but to start here are some basic definitions Call option A contract between two parties which allows the buyer of the contract to purchase 100 shares of the underlying stock at a given price point strike price by a specific date The seller is obligated to sell the 100 shares at the strike price if the buyer exercises the contract Days to expire DTE The number of days left on the options contract before the contract expire Call options typically expire on Fridays A 0DTE call options means the contract expires today A 1DTE expire contract means the contract expires tomorrow Call option buyers sellers Anyone can buy or sell call options and that includes retail traders There are plenty of trading strategies out there that involve selling also called writing contracts However the vast majority or call writers are large institutions and market makers as you typically need a lot of collateral to write these options Buying a call option is considered bullish as you want the stock to rise Selling a call option is considered bearish as you want the stock to go down The Greeks Option contracts can get very complicated when trying to analyze risk There are a bunch of different variables that are typically used when trying to assess the risk referred to as the greeks I m not going to get into details here otherwise this thesis would be way to long However the important greeks we care about are Delta and Gamma Delta Delta is a measure of the change in an option s price resulting from a change in the underlying security Essentially call options that are far out of the money have a low Delta near 0 and call options that are far in the money have a high delta near 1 As the underlying stock price changes the Delta of the options will also change Delta can also be used to approximate the risk exposure you have to the underlying stock For example a Delta of 0 7 has a similar risk exposure as owning 70 shares 0 7 X 100 shares for the contract Delta Hedging Market makers MM job is to offer as much liquidity to the market as possible They make their money from the difference of the spreads bid vs ask on stocks and options Since there are millions and millions of transactions on the market daily MMs make a ton of money doing this They want to avoid risk when possible Whenever someone buys a call option hello Reddit YOLOs the seller of the call option is typically a MM However selling a call option automatically introduces risk As a result the MM will hedge against this risk by purchasing shares of the underlying The amount they purchase is typically equal to the delta of the option referred to as delta hedging Here is the important point to note here As the underlying stock increases Delta goes up which means to hedge against this risk the MM will purchase additional shares As the underlying stock decreases Delta goes down which means to hedge against this risk the MM will sell shares If the underlying stock goes up a lot that could pressure a ton of extra buying as MM need to cover their delta risk This also pushes other option contracts with a higher strike price in the money which also adds more buying pressure We ve seen this happen in the past and it is typically referred to as a Gamma Squeeze the rate of change in Delta is called Gamma Hodlers love this However on the flip side what happens if the underlying goes down Then delta decreases allowing the MMs to sell shares to match risk This adds selling pressure to the stock which further decreases delta This is bad If you look at the past history of AMC and GME call options are a hot commodity Lots of retail and likely big investment firms have been purchasing call options like crazy This forces MMs to buy shares to cover their risk Hello moon But what happens when the call options are near or reach expiry There are 3 potential outcomes 1 The strike price of the call option is above the stock price This means the call option expires worthless Any Delta hedging is no longer required so the MM can sell shares 2 The strike price is at or below the stock price The call option expires at or in the money and can be exercised This means the seller of the contract is obligated to hand over their 100 shares of the stock to the buyer and now we have a new hopefully diamond hander 3 By far the most common outcome The buyer of the option contract decides to close out the deal before expiry and sells their contract for a profit This in essence settles the deal and the call option is deleted from existence With no obligation to delta hedge anymore the MM is free to sell any of their shares into the market Options 1 and 3 will both add selling pressures onto the stock Option 2 adds buying pressure but doesn t happen nearly as often as the buyer of the call option needs enough cash to actually purchase 100 shares at the strike price Many call option holders don t have this ability and are only trying to make money on the option premium This is where my thesis comes from We have seen AMC and GME typically struggle on Thursdays and Fridays This is because so many people are buying call options earlier in the week As the options approach expiration the buyers are now closing out their positions adding a ton of selling pressure The more options that are traded the more potential selling pressure If all the option buyers instead exercised their contracts the reverse would happen and we would see huge buying pressure However the capital requirements to so this are massive and history has shown this is not happening that often So you now maybe asking Okay good thesis but what about some data to prove it Well look no further than AMC As of Wednesday June 2 AMC had 428 289 open interest in call options If you calculate out the number of shares based on the Delta of each strike price MMs would need approximately 36 339 000 shares to hedge their risk As of Friday June 4 AMC had 539 428 open interest in call options However if you calculate out the number of shares based on the Delta of each strike price MMs would only need approximately 17 356 000 shares to hedge their risk A difference of 19 million shares that were able to be sold NOTE Due to the lack of data I have available the above assumes that no additional call option contracts were closed after market close on Friday It s pretty much guaranteed that more call options were settled which means more shares could be sold Unfortunately my broker doesn t have all the necessary historical data to go deeper than this but hopefully a smart Ape among us can take a deeper dive to prove this even more I m sure the numbers are the same for GME but unfortunately I didn t record the call option data last week for GME Moral of the story The falling prices late last week were significantly impacted by call option contract settling Starting next week we will likely see the same cycle of the stock price increasing on Monday to Wednesday as more call options are purchased then falling back down at the end of the week as call options are settled excluding any other catalysts HOLD STRONG DIAMOND HANDS FOREVER As always this is not financial advice

legislative focus,Hello everyone here a DD focused on RNG and Natural Gas developments in the USA as previous one was more broad and had the intention to outline the state of the industry worldwide As you may know California has always been at the center of attention as the most advanced state in terms of decarbonization efforts Yet it seems that not all decisions paid back in terms of quality of life and certainty of business activity Californian Natural Gas power plants shut down electricity imported from other states Indeed California different from what someone would expect has not a good and reliable supply of electricity probably because it pushed too aggressively for the state s 100 electrification goal see attached picture During the most recent blackout in August 2020 some Electric buses were forced to shut down in order to reduce electricity demand In the next decade virtual power plants alike experiments will be more popular therefore it is reasonable to expect a better match between the demand amp supply of green electricity But it will take time and for safety reasons it would be better to rely on different sources of energy 2020 08 21 Washington Examiner California forced to defend green goals amid blackouts https www washingtonexaminer com policy energy california forced to defend green goals amid blackouts 2020 08 23 Oil amp Gas 360 Green California has the nation s worst power grid https www oilandgas360 com green california has the nations worst power grid The first question that arises reading these topics is about the never ending announcements of companies like Nikola NKLA very dubious business potential and Tesla TSLA amazing company with incredible potential about the incoming quick and easy electrification of Heavy Duty Transports Hydrogen Alternative Focus Nikola revealed its lack of technological breakthrough when it was revealed that General Motors had the intention to market a Hydrogen trucks with the Nikola brand and GM Fuel Cells The drama related to the CEO trials made the rest I am a huge fan of hydrogen but as Cummins CMI CEO confirmed hydrogen trucks have a long long way to go before being adopted on a large scale please note that Cummins acquired Hydrogenics in Sept 2019 https www cummins com news releases 2019 09 09 cummins closes its acquisition hydrogenics second global leader after BLDP in hydrogen fuel cells According to Cummins and others in the next years electrolyzer segment will grow first Note that the hydrogen fuel needed for hypothetical trucks on California s road would need green hydrogen thus it will put more stress on the grid Even if it is not focused on the US I recommend readers this report of David Fickling about global green hydrogen potential by 2050 According to David Fickling https www washingtonpost com business energy the hydrogen economys time is approaching 2020 05 08 383b1a04 9191 11ea 9322 a29e75effc93 story html hydrogen could meet 24 of the world s energy needs by 2050 but it would likely take 31 320 TWh of electricity to hit this level Last year the entire world generated just roughly 26 000 TWh of which 10 000 were coming from zero carbon sources By 2050 it may be achievable but there are shorter deadlines for the transport sector Actions today are required to match 2025 and 2030 emission targets If we want a high percentage of green hydrogen a huge amount of grid investments is required today high tension grid infrastructure needs 5 10 years to be completed therefore it is reasonable to say that hydrogen will be a sound reality for mobility from the late 2020 s on not earlier In addition the potential of exhausted salt mines that could store hydrogen for months is just theoretical for now It is worth to remember that the sources for electricity generation in Europe are diversified and are not ready for a 100 renewable energy scenario Germany renounced to nuclear power in 2011 and will renounce to coal by 2030 and the country is massively investing in gas pipelines so it is very likely that it will not renounce to Russian gas France relies heavily on nuclear power with some of these power plants being soon too old to remain active Therefore traditional gas generation will be a likely alternative to overcome this problem The UK closed all its coal power plants but decided to keep open nuclear and gas facilities Italy relies heavily on gas and does not have any nuclear power plant None of Europe s largest countries can afford a 100 green electricity sector that can satisfy both current demand plus the incremental demand coming from the green hydrogen sector Therefore some fossil fuel natural gas and nuclear plants are here to stay for the longer term BLUE HYDROGEN CANNOT BE IGNORED The argument is different if we include in the discussion blue hydrogen along with carbon capture In this scenario we would need massive incentives and research investments in carbon capture technology which now are still at an early stage According to the European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen who spoke at the World Economic Forum in January 2020 https www ft com content c93694c8 3d15 11ea a01a bae547046735 the EU will define the structure of a continental carbon tax by the end of this year pre COVID 19 intention very likely now that the details will be published in 2021 For this reason large trade partners like the US and China were advised to start their own studies on the tax if they do not want their goods to be taxed at the highest possible carbon emission rate HYDROGEN TRAIN FOCUS An interesting case in this regard is the Hydrogen train developed by Alstom and Hydrogenics now Cummins Inc whose adoption has been delayed considerably Alstom was able to sell its innovative product to some German and French regions Nevertheless in most of the cases hydrogen will come from fossil sources Rhyne region etc with cleaner alternatives being provided at a later stage In the region of Schleswig Holstein where the green potential was massive Alstom could have got the greatest commercial order for a hydrogen product worldwide however the green fueling station was at the heart of a controversy between the company and the tender offer authorities of Schleswig Holstein For this reason 52 trains were allocated to the battery train manufacturer and the Alstom Hydrogenics amp NEL consortium lost the tender offer The proposed fueling station was massive for the time being around 20 MW capacity but the cost of it was at the expense of the consortium https www ln online de Lokales Lauenburg Aus fuer die Wasserstoffzelle auf der Schiene BEV Infrastructure focus Tesla instead kept postponing the launch of its Tesla SEMI You can read again the last conference call transcripts which clearly states that the biggest issue from a product perspective is the fast charger technology whose time of realization and commercialization is yet unknown From a macro perspective instead is unclear how California may afford to charge thousands of Tesla SEMI with its current electricity grid How does CLNE fits into all this If you look at 2020 Q2 CC of CLNE management made a quite useful comparison for H2 fueling stations and BEV charging stations for heavy duty They told the story of a recharging facility in Los Angeles that was going to be built for 5 5 million to recharge 24 heavy duty trucks in a day s time in like 20 hour time using the equivalent of the electricity needed for 44 000 homes Thus it is reasonable to expect not many fleet operators to switch soon to BEV trucks About hydrogen refueling management commented on the experience they got operating a hydrogen station in California with on site hydrogen generation through electrolysis Get a load of this it requires about 20 gallons of water each gallon is 3 785 liters for every gallon of hydrogen you produce So march that out on a nationwide scale And the idea that we re going to do it with renewable sources at a station is going to be very daunting okay I think that as you look at commercial truck stops with hydrogen you re probably looking at something on the order of 15 million to 20 million or more per station So this is a very expensive proposition because you re basically creating a whole new network And really the most successful stations around the world and there s only a handful of hydrogen is you re reforming natural gas It is clear why some fleet operators are switching to Natural Gas Trucks Amazon in February and the Port of LA recently with the decision to equate BEV and other Zero Emission trucks to the Natural Gas ones US Congress Californification not so fast In the past legislative period there were some bipartisan attempts to support RNG and Natural Gas mobility US Congress has indeed shown some interest in the subject Last June a bipartisan effort was introduced in both the chambers of the US congress The bill is called Growing Climate Solutions Act https www virginiamercury com 2020 09 10 growing climate solutions act gives farmers a seat at the carbon market table and would allow farmers to generate revenue streams from different forms of carbon capture Most notably methane from livestock is mentioned in the legislation If enacted at the federal level decarbonized gas would receive a renovated interest from many different stakeholders Being a bipartisan deal https www audubon org news indiana senator mike braun discusses bipartisan climate solutions young leaders as farmers represent a prized electoral category it should be enacted regardless of the next election results President Biden needs to show to his party and the American people that he is doing something about the environment That is why he advertised the Ford BEV pickup and keeps saying that government s fleets will be electrified As always the political reality is much more complex than the headline announcements and RNG has a lot of room to grow in this space Already in 2020 RNG represented 53 of all Natural Gas used in transport in the USA https bioenergyinternational com markets finance rng surpassed ng accounting for 53 percent of us on road ngv fuel use in 2020 As noted in a previous DD in California RNG is 90 of NG used in transport Let me know if you have further questions

558,ntl3wv,t2_bfdwuva,1622984037,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntl3wv/what_if_amc_really_breaks_the_bank/,1,What if AMC really breaks the bank ,I wanted to post this on Thursday but as my first post I fucked it up Only the headline appeared it s my first post So one more try I have been following this community for a while and thought I d write a bit about how I see the situation now I ve been in the market for more than 20yrs both retail and as an ex banker trader and must say this is a really new and unknown situation with AMC In the past there have been events which changed how financial instruments have been priced who was able to write which business and maybe we are witnessing a similar event now Black Friday before Black Friday Option Skew hardly existed OTM put options were priced with Black Scholes normal distribution and no fat tails Black Friday changed that nowadays market tends to price a big skew specially for puts less so calls Great Financial Crisis Similar to above CDS were sold without pricing extreme events and based on simplified and wrong assumptions regarding correlation between defaults individual of mortgages CDS were written at nearly no cost for billions of dollars for getting a cheap yield pickup for banks Some banks used this to inflate their profits pre crisis The whole story is nicely told in Big Short probably the best trading movie ever So what is going on now If the information I have been reading on various sources and boards is correct as below then we could very well see a breaking the bank to speak and changing of the rules how equity options markets operate Regulators would need to look into the option market makers and the HFT outfits 10 years ago option market makers would be regulated banks or broker dealers while now has been taken over by weakly regulated high frequency boutiques and HFTs I have not fact checked all of the below but here s how I see the situation 1 Around 3 million individual retail traders own AMC shares I read this here This makes up a significant proportion of the float of the company This is very a unusual situation and means there are much fewer opportunistic institutional holders like funds out there who generally would be selling into rallies or make their shares available to the market as opposed to other heavily stocks such as Blackberry Nikola etc Since the ape movement with diamond hands has established itself vs the GME situation this situation could turn out more dramatic than GME 2 Short interest I am reading around 15 20 depending on source This is actually not so bad compared to other stocks and based on the daily volume easily can be covered in a day or two This is short interest of borrowed stock no naked or synthetic shorts However in combination with the above mainly retail traders holding stock it becomes an issue because of 3 Valuation insensitive investors AMC is overvalued I do not think anyone in finance would debate whether this is correct or not However us apes who sit on the shares with diamond hands do not care We do not sell A similar issue can be observed with other stonks such as Tesla for example This creates a problem because 4 We retail apes are not really float if we don t sell Its like some founding shareholder holding a chunk of the company like KOSS for example but there is no option market 5 So in the end if people don t sell their cash equity there is maybe 30 of float max accessible The shares which make up daily turnover in the tens of billions of dollars seems to be largely day trading and high frequency trading churning the stock multiple times a day And that s cash equities only Now enter the options problem 6 Options a lot of people here buy calls instead of cash equity because of leverage Now whoever is writing those calls market makers would typically write them naked They do not have enough inventory in shares to handle the volume of demand from us apes This is not forbidden and typical practise Looking at the open interest there at least an equivalent of 10m shares with strikes beneath 70 only expiring on 4 June tomorrow We ve now passed this date with opex and the price collapsing Just what saved the option writers for the past week We need to see how it turns out for next weeks opex On an individual firm level writing these naked puts is a good business for the market makers because the option premium is very high and writing and covering intraday especially with short dated options is not so much of a risk Any individual market maker can quickly balance their book because AMC shares are very liquid and most written calls are OTM However on an aggregate basis it s a huge problem because eventually SOMEBODY is naked short in the end if a gamma squeeze occurs 7 There seems to be a shortage of stock The issuance of shares in the market by AMC is the only way to solve the problem on aggregate or the price collapsing and apes selling It is not a problem for any individual market participant A fund who is short can cover in the market easily however they are just handing their shorts to somebody else In the end it is a game of musical chairs where there is a shortage of stock simply because there are maybe 30 available shares 20 were lent and shorted and 10 have been written by selling calls until 4 June only these are the visible numbers I m seeing Not even speaking about anything further out the calendar Most likely the problem is bigger and not visible because of syntactic shorts and swaps we don t see Don t underestimate how many smart funds are out there taking synthetic positions we have seen with Archegos 8 As long as the price keeps going up options move into the money and cause the said gamma squeeze where they would balance the book with buying stock in the market 9 AMC issuing stock seems to me a direct response to somebody knocking on their door saying we need stock in the market If apes on balance don t sell and keep buying calls and market makers keep writing said calls because they think it s a good business for them offloading the risk in the market to somebody else buying stock as a hedge whenever the price dips the game of musical chairs continues and the shortage of stock keeps increasing At the moment this seems what is happening every dip gets bought not only by apes but probably by some market makers trying to balance their options books Anyhow there seems to be already a persistent shortage of stock It will be interesting to see how this turns out next week if AMC keeps moving up AND again 10 of float is written in calls 10 AMC has issued stock twice over the last couple of days its hard to justify to keep this going AMC price dropping into opex on Friday was a huge relief for the writers of options but somehow I don t have the feeling this carousel propelling prices higher will continue from Monday because so many options have already been written and need to be immediately delta hedged if prices move up And then we see next week what skeletons are really hidden in the closet and tricks up the sleeves of Wall Street such as have seen with GME Another issue is collateral at brokers and counterparty risk which I am worries about mostly because its an issue for market stability In short the problem exists because after GME none of the market makers and shorters have learnt anything there is an imbalance in retail long institutional short AND keeping writing those options AND thinking its easy money because they can immediately pass the risk on to somebody else No one cares about the aggregate risk The problem gets worse the higher the price goes and the less stock is available

568,ntla9o,t2_3tg6jx6k,1622984594,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntla9o/sportemongo_is_a_scam/,1,Sportemongo is a scam ,Hello everyone I just want to warn you about a token that is called sportemon go Fellow degens We all like to make money but if you invest in a project like this you hate your self more than Nicolas cage in leaving Las Vegas First of all don t invest your money in a project where the manager looks like he s been on welfare longer than when the pouges released their first album Let me explain I was not there for the pre pre sale so I can t inform you about that But I was there for the second pre sale and they messed that up worse than Mclovin s first time buying alcohol What happened you say Well they were to release the contract address for their token at a certain time What they did was that they released the address for the second pre sale on dxsale at least 2 minutes late in the telegram chat and when anyone clicked it it was already sold out Yes you read that right They gave us a link for a pre sale that was already sold out because they had already been giving that token contract address to other people first to get in early so they can dump their coins for profit There was a massive protest in the voice chat and at a certain time it was more than 3 500 people there complaining about their lousy effort So to make this project look clean they did a poll to re do the pre sale What happened next is that the devs just chose a few people to get whitelisted for the second pre sale just to cover their backs and to make this project not look like a total fraud For the rest of the remaining people they had to wait for the real launch of the token They postponed the launch several times and people was sitting in the telegram chat waiting for several hours because they couldn t handle their own deadline The token adress was released AFTER they made sure that them self and everyone of their friends has bought in at a cheap price How long does it takes to deploy a new token contract adress Well I can do that on my phone In less than 10 minutes So there is no reason what so ever that they should use 5 hours unless it is what it is A fraud When they finally released the token adress the price was up 700 800 and after a few seconds the price plummets Why Because they dumped their coins immediately after launch to cash out their profit Their dev wallet had 33 og all tokens and it was not locked by a contract or a burn adress whatsoever If you go to bsc or etherscan you always see that a burn or liquidity address has plenty zeros in it or a icon before it Their wallet which was the second biggest one had none of that Then you can track their tx hash es to see any movement in or out from that wallet and without any doubt they dumped their coins hard So people in the chat started asking questions about that and they just said that they were moving liquidity and things over to a new wallet Then they closed the voice chat and right after that they closed the text chat as well Well fuck me but you re not moving your liquidity when you sell your own tokens on pancakeswap for bnb Things like that is always locked in a contract wallet BEFORE launch When people start asking questions about these issues they got banned immediately and permanently I can speak for my self when the only thing I did was posting their own wallet in the main chat just so people could see that they drained their own wallet Did they just ban me No no That s too simple They took the effort to make several devs not just banning me but report me flag me and get me kicked out of telegram permanently for a short while Just because I posted THEIR own wallet in the chat so people could see what was going on And I never got the chance to write anything either because it took less than 5 seconds to kick me out I have never sendt any spam or unwanted messages to anyone all the time I have been on telegram but I got banned from using telegram for 2 days because of this So do I have proof of what I m saying Of course I do I m not so retarded that I m the dev of sporteMONGO or anything Here s a gallery for you to enjoy of me getting banned one wallet that sold more than 500 bnb tokens without making any purchase price chart plummet immediately after launch their fake poll etc https imageupload io g l5cRz9kcyR And here s the wallet and TX hashes I was talking about https bscscan com token 0xe5d46cc0fd592804b36f9dc6d2ed7d4d149ebd6f a 0x2c9513a5315748175ff7412b85043438fa86ed9d You have to click some links and dig a bit but everything is there So to sum up this post Is sportemon go a total scam Well I would give them the benefit of the doubt and say I m only 95 sure it s a scam and the last 5 i might say that they would be wearing bicycle helmets indoors because they are fucking retarded and messed up everything But in the end only devs or the few lucky people that got in on the presale made any money from this People tend to say this is not a financial advice But I would say the opposite This is a financial advice just don t If you want to get rid of unwanted money faster than investing in sportemon go take your cash outside pour gasoline on it and light it on fire Take care degens and have a great Sunday

posting this mainly because I want to throw one of my best ideas into the ring But that s not the only reason I am writing this I also want to inspire those of you who are just getting started in this game For those who say that retail investors can t consistently make money in markets I present you with some recent gain porn for your viewing pleasure amp x200B https preview redd it gyvyzp0yln371 png width 1355 amp format png amp auto webp amp s bf56089ae7e9cff017cacdc546e9aa3c9e55f329 Look I won t lie making money investing is not easy lots of smart people are trying to do the same thing But the real challenge is having the emotional resilience to stick with your thesis and while not easy if you stick to basic math and only invest in what you know it is simple As retail investors we have a huge advantage over the big guys on Wall Street who need to hug the benchmarks satisfy investor demands for quarterly results and invest only where they can expect to generate acceptable risk adjusted returns where risk is bizarrely defined as volatility instead of permanent impairment of capital which is how I see it We can arbitrage these structural weaknesses in institutional portfolio management by making contrarian bets on stocks that are currently out of favor with the big guys provided we ve done our homework on the business and believe that it is undervalued Eventually if we are right about the trajectory of the business they will eventually be forced to buy us out at a huge premium when the results prove out and herd mentality kicks back in the other way I ve made a nice chunk of coin on several positions over the last few years which has enabled me to make bigger investments and I am currently up materially on my latest portfolio positions These are positions I have held for long time periods with Bed Bath and Beyond being the largest position the longest held and highest percentage gains In my view it also has the most upside so I want to share a bit more with you about my thesis Nothing I ve said or am about to say should be construed in any way as investment advice This is just me sharing my YOLO with an explanation for my thesis Bed Bath and Beyond was a successful business when it first arrived on the scene practically creating and defining the concept of Big Box Retail As so often happens in life their huge initial success bred complacency and the co founders Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein who continued presiding over the Board basically ran the company like it was their private piggy bank without regard for small or even large shareholders Under the leadership of Steven Temares the CEO they handpicked the business failed to innovate and keep up with basic changes taking place in retail such as the rise of e commerce BBBY began to see online giants like Amazon and even brick amp mortar mass merchants like Target and Lowes begin to eat their lunch Steven Temares along with the rest of the c suite continued to receive huge salaries and bonuses while the two co founders received generous perks like personal black car chauffer services all paid for by the company and therefore shareholders They also refused to answer basic questions posited by Wall Street research analysts on earnings calls seeing the investment community essentially as a nuisance to be tolerated but not proxies for the true owners of the business public investors Well the situation got so bad that finally circa mid 2019 in the year of our chimp lord a trifecta of activist investors led by Legion Partners founder was trained by legendary activist Nelson Peltz and John Duskin at Macellum Capital decided to wage war buying up 6 of the stock and filing a 170 white paper detailing all of the problems with how the company was being run and proposing to replace the entire Board of Directors and management team with its own slate of nominees the presentation is phenomenal and if you PM me I will email it to you They went so far as to create a website for their campaign restorebedbath com https restorebedbath com which they eventually dismantled after reaching a cooperation and settlement agreement with the Board of Directors This agreement effectively ceded control to the activists who proceeded to replace everyone It was a real Red Wedding style bloodbath I mean total scorched earth policy no respect for life While it s never pleasant seeing people get canned these people deserved it After years and years of unaccountable shareholder abuse someone finally came along and pulled out the game cartridge blew on it and hit reset on the console And they saw that it was good In November 2019 they announced Mark Tritton legendary Chief Merchandising Officer from Target who was the main person responsible for their massive success in developing private label owned brand programs would be taking the helm as CEO Since taking charge Mark has consistently been executing on the playbook laid out by the activists in their white paper which basically calls for making low risk high return changes to bring Bed Bath and Beyond up to modern retailing standards using well established best practices While some would argue that a turnaround of this magnitude carries high execution risk I would disagree at this time for several reasons 1 The changes they have been making are actually quite well established strategies for modern retailing with loads of case studies to pull from Best Buy Target Lowes etc 2 they have the best team you could ask for implementing these changes i e Mark Tritton and John Hartmann who became COO of BBBY after a highly successful run as CEO of True Value hardware chains 3 their compensation is heavily geared towards stock compensation so they only win if we all win and 4 most of the highest risk action plans like divesting of non core assets culling unproductive unprofitable stores reducing bloated headcount and liquidating stale inventories at reasonable valuations are all in the rear view mirror As of June 2021 Bed Bath and Beyond is at an inflection point with a strong focus on driving profitable growth from its core business lines This comes down to a few very important strategies 1 focusing on digital first omni always capabilities leading with the website and mobile app but making sure they are able to serve customers however whenever and wherever they want to shop think curbside pick up same day delivery and buy online pick up in store aka BOPIS 2 focusing on key destination categories where the company is seen as an authority in the home driving preference for BBBY over other chains and even national brands by defining its key categories using data and developing owned brands to fill out their assortment in those areas they have launched 6 so far this year with another 4 expected by end of year ultimately they expect 30 of their sales to come from the brands they have created This will help help them in multiple ways First the products are only going to be available at BBBY so they are re establishing their authority in the home and preference for BBBY as a brand and not just a venue to shop other manufacturers products this also means these items can t be bought online except for thru BBBY so it is Amazon defense playbook 101 Second these products have been strategically developed in areas where they had gaps in their assortment relative to the competitors they were losing share to As mentioned above development of these brands was informed by data including detailed line reviews and purchasing data Third and final these products are designed to cost and have very healthy margins that should improve the overall margin profile of the business as they are rolled out This fireside chat with Mark Tritton from January 2021 explains it all far better than I can and is well worth watching for curious apes https www npd com wps portal npd us news videos a fireside chat with mark tritton president and ceo of bed bath and beyond https www npd com wps portal npd us news videos a fireside chat with mark tritton president and ceo of bed bath and beyond So where does this all leave us today The company has successfully implemented its digital first omni always capabilities rolling out BOPIS curbside pickup and same day delivery just signed up deals with Instacart amp Doordash Digital sales were up 86 in the most recent quarter and 99 in the Bed Bath banner they also own Buy Buy Baby which is the largest national baby retail chain in the US with the bankruptcy of Babies R US this alone makes BBBY an interesting investment with tons of hidden value For the first time in years the company began posting positive same store sales for the last 3 quarters under Mark Tritton consistently comping up in the mid single digits This is a very positive sign of the changes taking place already Same store sales metrics are probably the most important data point for retailers as it basically tells you if consumers think they have a good reason to exist Quite frankly it is an extraordinary achievement by Mark and his team that after years of declining same store sales they are now positive for 3 consecutive quarters and I don t think this has gotten enough attention They have also begun launching their new owned brands with 6 already launched and another 4 or so on the way this year These brands have a strong focus on their top 5 destination categories bedding bath kitchen amp food prep indoor decor and organization I ve personally purchased and used these products and they are excellent quality at reasonable price points I think they will do great They are repurchasing 1bn of their own stock at least 375mm completed so far at an average price of 23 per share reducing their share count from 126mm to 109mm Normalizing their revenues for divested brands and culling of unprofitable lowest productivity stores in their footprint management has guided to 8 2bn of sales and 525mm of EBITDA this year with sales comping up in the low to mid single digits range for the next several years and EBITDA margins improving to high single digits low double digits resulting in EBITDA of 850mm 1bn by YE 2023 Applying simple mathematics and established standards of value I believe the evidence shows that businesses in this industry big box and specialty retail would typically be valued at 8 12x EBITDA which would imply an enterprise value value of the whole business not just the equity of 9bn at the midpoint which seems eminently reasonable for an iconic retailer under solid leadership with about 1000 stores and authority in key growing segments of the US economy Since they have virtually the same amount of cash as debt the enterprise value should be about the same as the equity value so 9bn at the midpoint above With 109mm shares outstanding today that puts implied equity value per share at 82 but where it gets even more interesting is if you factor in the share buybacks They ve still got 625mm of remaining authorized share repurchases under their existing program and depending on how cheap they are able to buy those shares they could materially reduce the share count further So why are the big institutional investors continuing to ignore this stock Why does everyone continue to ignore the insanely cheap valuation and upside potential under the extraordinary new leadership of Mark Tritton John Hartmann and the rest of the new team I can think of several possibilities but probably the main one is a backward looking bias because the memory of the old management team and their awful performance dies hard Their prolonged period of value destruction also gave rise to a narrative parroted widely by thematic investors and talking heads on CNBC basically a nonsense theory that all brick amp mortar would die and the consumer would only ever want to shop at Amazon somehow ignoring blatantly contradictory evidence provided by Target Lowes Walmart etc In this excellent interview with burgeoning hedge fund manager Dan McMurtrie aka Supermugatu he discusses the reality of how Amazon is killing bad retail not all retail and how certain investors the media have taken the the idea way too far as they so often love to do I cannot recommend this highly enough well worth watching beginning at 39 45 https www realvision com unmasking supermugatu how the pros find edge https www realvision com unmasking supermugatu how the pros find edge It might take some time for BBBY to shake off the worries created during the former management team s tenure Most of the time the stock market is forward looking but in this case investors have adopted a thesis that has them psychologically stuck in the past due to PTSD and the distractions in rear view mirror are blinding them to what is likely to happen in the next 6 12 18 months Eventually I personally expect BBBY to shock the market with positive results one of these quarters forcing a rapid seemingly unexpected valuation revision in the stock They have already begun to put up excellent numbers if you look at the underlying same store sales digital growth growth in top 5 destination categories for example However there has still been a lot of noise in the numbers from divestitures culling of store footprint COVID impact in 2020 etc and it appears that perception has not caught up yet with the new reality While I haven t focused on it much here the company also has an excellent balance sheet with over 1bn of cash no meaningful near term debt maturities solidly positive free cash flow generation amp very high short interest Even with all of the prevailing negative sentiment this has been a profitable investment for me so far I purchased heavily in periods where others abandoned hope over the last few years In my opinion the company is probably worth about 80 share as of today however with continued solid execution and more enthusiasm coming back into the name I could see this valued well into the triple digits So even with my sizeable gains I haven t sold one share and don t plan to anytime soon I am holding this baby to the end

indexes including the MSCI global small cap index and the russell 3000 There is I believe misinformation and debate on when and how this will effect the price going forward particularly with the timing of the russell 3000 addition The moral of the story is that ETFs tracking both indexes will have to rebalance their portfolios at some point and buy some shares of CLOV which will provide further upward momentum for the stock The current argument is whether these ETFs will be purchased before or after the June 25th addition I believe the rebalancing and purchasing of shares would be

December 31 2021 a growth rate of 17 21 as compared to year end 2020 This is consistent with our previous guidance that we discussed in our year end 2020 earnings call on March 1 For the Medicare Direct Contracting program while the Company expects to have access to up to 200 000 Medicare beneficiaries through its contracts with Participating Providers we believe we will end 2021 with between 70 000 100 000 total aligned beneficiaries Voluntary alignment will occur quarterly and the majority of voluntary alignments are expected to become effective in the fourth quarter Total revenues are expected to be in the range of 810 830 million inclusive of a preliminary estimate of approximately 20 30 million of revenue generated from Direct Contracting GAAP revenue estimates for Direct

shorters are quick to point out that Clover mislead investors by stating they already HAD 200 000 lives under contract in this program However this is overall a very small portion of their revenue as highlighted in the third section What matters most is Medicare Advantage membership growth which has been steadily increasing year after year My hesitation is that these increases are still fairly insignificant on the grand medicare stage and that while CLOV has been granted access in other states it is still significantly limited geographically in where they operate with I believe most of their members only in New Jersey They have access to many other states and counties but really haven t made any footprint into these areas They have consistent growth but with the amount of market available to them I believe it should be better Until these numbers have a dramatic increase it limits investor interest and catalysts against the current short interests amp x200B Conclusion This company has some positive catalysts with the index additions and consistent albeit slower than I would like growth revenue increases It also has massive squeeze potential but it has a heavy heavy

782,ntoz7c,t2_3o622itz,1622995335,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntoz7c/all_apes/,1, ALL APES ,For all of the new baby apes I know a lot of you have questions and I thought it would be helpful to provide you with some overall context to understand the significance of the movement you just joined Here s the cliff note version Covid hit last March and a couple of big hedge funds concocted a plan to drive AMC into bankruptcy by shorting it and make a ton of money in the process You short a company when you think the value of the stock is going to go down When the country locked down and AMC closed their doors and their revenue literally went to 0 overnight it was a no brainer play for the hedge funds So they started borrowing millions and millions of shares from brokers and sold them short at the market price at the time and they pocketed the cash from the sale The idea is that the stock price will drop you can buy them back later at a lower price and then return the borrowed shares to the broker and keep the difference If the company goes bankrupt the stock goes to 0 and they don t have to buy anything back at all and keep everything This is what they were banking on They ve done this to company after company over the years and they saw this as a sure thing as any Well a bunch of people on Reddit affectionately known as Apes noticed they were trying to drive AMC GameStop and many other retail brick and mortar stores into bankruptcy and banded together to buy up all the available shares driving up the share price This resulted in the mini squeeze in January But Apes didnt sell after that And the hedge funds didn t cover their short positions either I e buy back the millions of shares they had borrowed and sold short The Apes kept buying and buying and holding and holding and once the real shares were all bought up the hedge funds doubled tripled and quadrupled down on their short position and started making synthetic shares IOUs and selling those shares into the market trying to drive the price down When the price dropped instead of selling like the hedge funds wanted them to Apes said thank you very much for the discount and kept buying more and holding Nobody has sold for the past 5 months since the movement really got started in January and more and more people are jumping in and adding more everyday Now because of all of the synthetic IOU shares the hedge funds have created to keep shorting AMC us Apes likely own more way more shares than are actually supposed to exist as much as 6x 8x by some estimates But real or synthetic each share the hedge funds sold short is a liability on their books that must be bought back in order to close out their position They literally have hundreds of millions of shares possibly billions to buy back and we own them all They have to buy them back eventually and every day that the borrowed short shares are still on loan the hedge funds are paying interest to the brokers they borrowed them from Meanwhile it costs us nothing to hold Things started to come to a head a couple weeks ago because the interest rate on the borrowed shares was reported to be as high as 250 1 2 is normal for your average stock so the hedge funds are collectively paying hundreds of millions of dollars every day just to hold their position and a lot of them are starting to miss the payments and margin calls could be coming very soon That s when the fun starts At that point the broker forces them to buy back all of the hundreds of millions of shares they have borrowed and sold short because the broker doesn t want the hedge funds recklessness to fall onto them And remember the Apes own all the shares and aren t selling The hedge funds can only buy a share for what an Ape is willing to sell it for and us Apes really love our shares Once the margin calls start the computers just start buying back all of the shares at the best available price no matter what that price may be They all have to be bought back Everything must be settled And if the cheapest price an ape is willing to sell for is 1 000 or 10 000 or 100 000 well then that s what the hedge funds will be forced to buy the borrowed shares back for in order to close out their position Apes are going to hold and hold and hold driving up the price further and further to make the hedge funds bleed as much as possible until they are inevitably forced to buy back their millions of shares They will need to buy our shares and we set the price And remember it costs us nothing to hold This movement has been building for the past 5 months but you just heard about it yesterday One thing Apes don t do is set dates for the squeeze Nobody knows when it will happen all we know for sure is that the math says it s inevitable as long as we hold I only see three possibilities as to how this all plays out 1 AMC goes bankrupt and the hedgies win please note this is not going to happen AMC has enough liquidity to last them through 2022 and the most passionate shareholder base in the universe Not to mention a pretty badass CEO who has completely embraced the new shareholder base 2 Hedge funds are somehow able to meet their daily margin payments to avoid being margin called and they strategically close out their short positions over time causing a sustained Tesla type squeeze over a period of a year or more remember apes aren t selling until we re at the moon 3 Hedge funds will be margin called and forced to buy everything all at once and we ll have the most violent squeeze in the history of short squeezes The price is infinite as long as apes hold I wouldn t bet on 1 2 will require patience and 3 will be absolute insanity and in my personal non financial advisor opinion is the most likely outcome Either way we re winning the battle This beautiful movement is growing by the day and we can hold longer than they can Never before has anything like this happened where millions of regular people have been able to band together to take on the billionaires who have been screwing them over time and time again and be able to actually hit them where it really hurts It is the big hedge fund himself on the other side you know the one who has his hands in all the retail brokerage apps to make sure our orders get routed to him to fill And then they fill them with synthetic shares that they don t even have and dig themselves even deeper They created and marketed easy access to the stock market to the retail investor because they only saw the retail investor as prey Just another way to bleed us dry They never saw this coming Like I said everything will eventually have to be settled Margin calls are coming And the SEC has already enacted several rules to prepare as much as possible for the catastrophic fallout from this event and to make sure that something like this can never happen again The millions of little guys with an app in their hand are a threat now and I m sure they ll adapt to it So this could very well be a once in a lifetime opportunity here Although I m not a financial advisor copied

CLOV is a US health insurance company currently specialized in offering Medicare Advantage plans to elderly Americans As an elderly American seeking healthcare insurance one of the very first choices presented is whether to go with the federally run Medicare or the privately provided Medicare Advantage still federally funded though The difference is as follows Medicare allows the customer to choose what the plan covers They have Part A hospital care Part B doctor visits and services and Part D prescriptions Medicare Advantage is Part C a pre packaged plan which bundles together Parts A B and usually D Medicare Advantage includes all services that Medicare has plus some Medicare Advantage usually makes the process more streamlined and easier Depending on the plan it may even be cheaper than Medicare However the drawback is a much narrower physician network that s usually based around a local geography Thus if you travel anywhere else it will be difficult to find in network physicians for care CLOV attempts to innovate in this space with their software platform Clover Assistant This is a platform which synthesizes all the data available to healthcare insurance providers to provide better patient outcomes They do this through several features Evidence based Protocol using a data driven model the Clover Assistant can provide physicians clinical recommendations based upon the patient s unique situation history of disease allergies etc Early Disease Detection machine learning models can predict potential diseases even when the patient is asymptomatic It provides a list of what chronic diseases the patient may be at risk for so that the physician can conduct early screening if necessary Quality Gap Closure surfaces opportunities for additional services that the patient should perform The physician can take the visit as an opportunity to perform these services or to recommend these specific services to the patient for later By doing this they hope to achieve better early detection and preventative care within their customers which leads to less emergency room visits less unplanned procedures and prescriptions and less heart ache quite literally All this equates to less unplanned costs for CLOV and more revenue from their insurance policies With Medicare advantage plans the government provides a certain pot of money for covering customer Medicare benefits with certain incentives built in If all incentives are met and no additional services are needed then the insurance provider pockets all the remaining money as profit That s why CLOV is so focused on decreasing these unplanned costs and of course for the people Healthcare Lacks in appeal Medicare is currently only available to those over 65 though there are proposed regulations to change this which we ll review later This is CLOV s and other Medicare Advantage providers target demographic By 2040 adults in the US over the age of 65 is expected to more than double reaching 80 million Adults age 85 is expected to quadruple https preview redd it 9afneo9olo371 png width 740 amp format png amp auto webp amp s ce2d3c332eee871f02c6e955a409c6011622d981 amp x200B Moreover Americans are living longer which means that Medicare will need to cover more for a longer period In 2000 the average American male upon turning 62 could expect to live 19 years longer In 2040 it is estimated that they will live 22 years longer This estimate is even higher for females This necessitates an expansion of Medicare and Medicare Advantage providers to support America s aging population We can see this rapid growth within the national health expenditure NHE data that the government releases In 2019 NHE grew by 4 6 to 3 8T By 2028 it is expected to grow to 6 2T The largest expenditure for government spending in 2019 was in private health insurance spending which grew 3 7 to 1 2T 31 of total NHE If current spending ratios hold the 2028 expected spend on private health insurance will be 1 92T Beyond that enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans has been growing at faster rate every year since 2005 In 2020 nearly 40 of all Medicare beneficiaries were on a Medicare Advantage plan

increase in membership across its established markets over the previous three years https preview redd it r6qdc7kulo371 png width 1190 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 1e474994dead07b53f86c73ddd628ea4c96e40b0 amp x200B They currently serve more than 57 000 members across 34 counties However is this growth scalable Proponents of CLOV believe they can do this And certainly CLOV is tripling its footprint expanding out to 74 new counties Whether this translates to similar levels of growth within these counties is yet to be seen While capturing 50 of the growth within a county is impressive they are operating only with a network of less than 60 000 members Remember UnitedHealth Group serves over 6M members I can t conclude one way or another if this growth is scalable but certainly it will become harder and more competitive to scale as they continue growing They re primary moat is in Clover Assistant However AI in healthcare is not a new concept In fact 95 of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI 59 of these executives expect a positive return on the investments they have already made in AI Whereas the scope of their AI may be different than CLOV s it is hard to argue that CLOV will be able to maintain a moat when they have access to the same data and technology as their competitors and even less of it since they have less than 60 000 members Furthermore Hindenberg Research released a damning short report for CLOV While many of the points raised were addressed by CLOV some I still consider legitimate and should worry all potential investors CLOV did not disclose that its AI Clover Assistant is under active investigation by the Department of Justice This investigation regards 12 issues from kickbacks to predatory marketing practices to undisclosed third party dealings While I won t speculate on the severity of these allegations and the results of this investigation it is alarming that CLOV was not forthright with its investors in revealing this information CLOV has a large dependency on a broker called Seek Insurance which is 50 owned by CLOV While it is not uncommon for healthcare insurers to use independent brokerages it is very misleading for Seek Insurance to claim unbiased and independent advice with Medicare plans when they are owned by a Medicare Advantage insurer CLOV responded saying that Seek Insurance is independently operated but it is difficult to imagine that CLOV has no sway in them even though they own them CLOV s CEO Vivek Garipalli has a history of predatory price gouging and all around immoral business practices Prior to founding CLOV he owned CarePoint Health which operated 3 hospitals in New Jersey where he charged the highest emergency room service prices in the entire country Furthermore he was at the center of an alleged scheme to siphon 157M from his own business into his personal bank account through exorbitant management services charged by LLC s under his name to his own company Financials CLOV s financials paint a picture of a rapidly growing company Their revenues increased from 277M in 2018 to 680M in 2020 While their operating costs also grew it grew at a significantly lesser rate leading to lower net losses in general In 2018 CLOV reported net losses of 186M and in 2020 they had reduced this to 93M Their net income losses however follows a different trajectory Due to losses from continued operations their net income had losses of 200M in 2018 364M in 2019 and 136M in 2020 While 2020 does represent their lowest losses ever it is not entirely clear whether this is part of a trend or if it s a one off fluke Their balance sheet does not paint a pretty picture With total assets of 270M and liabilities of 430M it is clear that they must fund their continued operations through equity Remember they are losing over 100M per year as well Thus it is entirely possible that they will dilute their existing equity in order to fund continued operations So do I like CLOV The short answer is no CLOV is a small but fast growing insurer valued at 3 7B While they definitely have impressive AI technology it is not unique in the industry and will not be a moat for them Their CEO has been involved in shady dealings in the past and the fact that they cannot be forthright about active investigations into their business is concerning They are currently burning through cash without a healthy balance sheet to hold them through which means that it is likely they will issue additional equities to stay afloat The industry that they are in is certainly lucrative and if they can get a foothold they will justify their current valuation However for my personal conviction the cons outweigh the pros and I will be passing on this stock TLDR 1 CLOV first gained popularity as a short squeeze play versus being a fundamentally solid company with potential growth 2 Clover Health s moat lies in Clover Assistant which is a data analytics and AI platform used to better diagnose patients saving CLOV on unplanned costs and increases revenue from their insurance policies However AI in healthcare is not a new concept In fact 95 of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI 3 Hindenburg Research released a short report on the company that enlightens some facts and opinions for a bearish case It also discloses that Clover Assistant is currently being investigated for predatory marketing practices 4 Although the company has been having stellar revenue growth their costs associated with revenue have also increased exponentially Financially they don t have the best liquidity and are spending a lot of cash which raises concerns for potential share dilution down the road 5 Lastly their total addressable market is still quite small They are operating within a network of less than 60 000 members Although there is room to grow this market to members of a lower age you have to remember they are targeting medicare to elderly Americans

949,ntrhub,t2_7dkrpoxe,1623002346,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntrhub/friday_price_action_explained_options_settlement/,1,Friday Price Action Explained Options Settlement Thesis,Hello hodlers I have a thesis to present to all of you that could explain the price action we ve seen in over the last few days with AMC and GME and basically any other meme stocks This is not meant to replace or ignore any other factors influencing the price but I believe it does play an important factor The data used in this analysis is all publicly available I ll do my best to explain below TLDR Options settlements on 1 and 0 DTE days to expire calls are what s causing selling pressures on Thursday and Friday not retail traders selling Diamond handers are hodling strong In order to understand this you need to know some option fundamentals There are plenty of resources online where you can learn this but to start here are some basic definitions Call option A contract between two parties which allows the buyer of the contract to purchase 100 shares of the underlying stock at a given price point strike price by a specific date The seller is obligated to sell the 100 shares at the strike price if the buyer exercises the contract Days to expire DTE The number of days left on the options contract before the contract expire Call options typically expire on Fridays A 0DTE call options means the contract expires today A 1DTE expire contract means the contract expires tomorrow Call option buyers sellers Anyone can buy or sell call options and that includes retail traders There are plenty of trading strategies out there that involve selling also called writing contracts However the vast majority or call writers are large institutions and market makers as you typically need a lot of collateral to write these options Buying a call option is considered bullish as you want the stock to rise Selling a call option is considered bearish as you want the stock to go down The Greeks Option contracts can get very complicated when trying to analyze risk There are a bunch of different variables that are typically used when trying to assess the risk referred to as the greeks I m not going to get into details here otherwise this thesis would be way to long However the important greeks we care about are Delta and Gamma Delta Delta is a measure of the change in an option s price resulting from a change in the underlying security Essentially call options that are far out of the money have a low Delta near 0 and call options that are far in the money have a high delta near 1 As the underlying stock price changes the Delta of the options will also change Delta can also be used to approximate the risk exposure you have to the underlying stock For example a Delta of 0 7 has a similar risk exposure as owning 70 shares 0 7 X 100 shares for the contract Delta Hedging Market makers MM job is to offer as much liquidity to the market as possible They make their money from the difference of the spreads bid vs ask on stocks and options Since there are millions and millions of transactions on the market daily MMs make a ton of money doing this They want to avoid risk when possible Whenever someone buys a call option hello Reddit YOLOs the seller of the call option is typically a MM However selling a call option automatically introduces risk As a result the MM will hedge against this risk by purchasing shares of the underlying The amount they purchase is typically equal to the delta of the option referred to as delta hedging Here is the important point to note here As the underlying stock increases Delta goes up which means to hedge against this risk the MM will purchase additional shares As the underlying stock decreases Delta goes down which means to hedge against this risk the MM will sell shares If the underlying stock goes up a lot that could pressure a ton of extra buying as MM need to cover their delta risk This also pushes other option contracts with a higher strike price in the money which also adds more buying pressure We ve seen this happen in the past and it is typically referred to as a Gamma Squeeze the rate of change in Delta is called Gamma Hodlers love this However on the flip side what happens if the underlying goes down Then delta decreases allowing the MMs to sell shares to match risk This adds selling pressure to the stock which further decreases delta This is bad If you look at the past history of AMC and GME call options are a hot commodity Lots of retail and likely big investment firms have been purchasing call options like crazy This forces MMs to buy shares to cover their risk Hello moon But what happens when the call options are near or reach expiry There are 3 potential outcomes 1 The strike price of the call option is above the stock price This means the call option expires worthless Any Delta hedging is no longer required so the MM can sell shares 2 The strike price is at or below the stock price The call option expires at or in the money and can be exercised This means the seller of the contract is obligated to hand over their 100 shares of the stock to the buyer and now we have a new hopefully diamond hander 3 By far the most common outcome The buyer of the option contract decides to close out the deal before expiry and sells their contract for a profit This in essence settles the deal and the call option is deleted from existence With no obligation to delta hedge anymore the MM is free to sell any of their shares into the market Options 1 and 3 will both add selling pressures onto the stock Option 2 adds buying pressure but doesn t happen nearly as often as the buyer of the call option needs enough cash to actually purchase 100 shares at the strike price Many call option holders don t have this ability and are only trying to make money on the option premium This is where my thesis comes from We have seen AMC and GME typically struggle on Thursdays and Fridays This is because so many people are buying call options earlier in the week As the options approach expiration the buyers are now closing out their positions adding a ton of selling pressure The more options that are traded the more potential selling pressure If all the option buyers instead exercised their contracts the reverse would happen and we would see huge buying pressure However the capital requirements to so this are massive and history has shown this is not happening that often So you now maybe asking Okay good thesis but what about some data to prove it Well look no further than AMC As of Wednesday June 2 AMC had 428 289 open interest in call options If you calculate out the number of shares based on the Delta of each strike price MMs would need approximately 36 339 000 shares to hedge their risk As of Friday June 4 AMC had 539 428 open interest in call options However if you calculate out the number of shares based on the Delta of each strike price MMs would only need approximately 17 356 000 shares to hedge their risk A difference of 19 million shares that were able to be sold NOTE Due to the lack of data I have available the above assumes that no additional call option contracts were closed after market close on Friday It s pretty much guaranteed that more call options were settled which means more shares could be sold Unfortunately my broker doesn t have all the necessary historical data to go deeper than this but hopefully a smart hodler among us can take a deeper dive to prove this even more I m sure the numbers are the same for GME but unfortunately I didn t record the call option data last week for GME Moral of the story The falling prices late last week were significantly impacted by call option contract settling Starting next week we will likely see the same cycle of the stock price increasing on Monday to Wednesday as more call options are purchased then falling back down at the end of the week as call options are settled excluding any other catalysts HOLD STRONG DIAMOND HANDS FOREVER As always this is not financial advice

getting about Mr CLNE,Hello again WSB Are you enjoying a weekend of recovery from an unfortunate read 100 normal week of buying high and selling low WELL same here Now that I m awake from that Friday night bender it s Sunday I wanted to take a few minutes to do a couple of things 1 TL DR at the bottom but I do hope you take a second to skim it 2 Review some analyst predictions and price targets on CLNE 3 Talk to you about CLNE short activity that has taken place over the last couple of days 4 Update the room on the status of market conditions surrounding CLNE and just some sentiment If you want to learn more about CLNE I ve got a short DD post in my history from last week that you can check out it s an easy read Or recommended you can search for one of the more in depth DD s done here all great work Disclaimers 1 no images because auto mod kept screwing me last time 2 I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice 3 1 000 shares at lt 8 25 average dating back to first purchase in 2020 4 Thank you mom for turning my computer on and transcribing my incoherent mumbling into these words Let s start with a review of analyst price targets CLNE closed Friday at 9 31 5 analysts have offered 12 month price targets on CLNE Low estimate is 11 00 18 2 gain from Friday close High estimate is 27 00 190 gain from Friday close Median estimate is 20 00 114 8 gain from Friday close Cramer came out in May and said he doesn t like the stock aNaLyStS aRe DuMb AnD Ur DuMb ToO I know and I know AnD aMaZoN iS GoNnA dIlUtE tHeM sHaReS bRuThUr What Ok To quote Bill Nye consider the following There s a legitimate case to be made for the stock having an extended term floor of somewhere near 13 49 thanks to details of their partnership with little known company called Amazon As a part of the deal with Bezos Inc which also supports 46 CLNE fueling stations Amazon reserved the right to purchase up to 53 million shares on warrants at a strike price of 13 49 However only a quarter of these are exercisable immediately The rest are only vested after Jeff has made a certain amount of fuel purchases from CLNE This drastically detracts from the cost of the deal and the way CLNE runs those sales revenues will most certainly be pumped back into additional infrastructure investment see their earnings which are always dead on estimates and near 0 00 EPS In short Amazon has a huge stake pending in CLNE but only after significant additional expenditure and investment AKA PARTNERSHIP Moving on to the topic of shorts and activity I m not as fluent on this subject as I am some others like technical mumbo jumbo and early 2000 s pop punk emo music IT S NOT A PHASE MOM but I think you ll appreciate the information here and at least be able to connect the dots as to how this relates to the other popular stonk plays on this sub Over the last 10 trading days before Thursday Friday daily shares sold short sits at about 10 of volume On Thursday this rose to 26 8 on the day on Friday again to 32 on the day So what 26 or 32 isn t huge right Sort of The significance from the rise in ratio of shares sold short vs volume is the concurrent spike in volume In terms of absolute numbers shares sold short went from about 500 000 per day to 8 10 million on Thursday and 10 64 million on Friday The major short players on this stock have been Citadel and Blackstone Spoiler alert According to fintel short shares availability is only 8 6 million as of June 4th With an average daily volume of around 5 million again before Thursday Friday how many days to cover You do the math And some final thoughts about market conditions around CLNE and the options landscape I m not here to push any squeeze thesis just providing information to help you develop your own conclusions about what I believe to be a great stock play I ve been in since 2020 There is short and long term potential here in my opinion The now famous June 18th 13 strike call OI now sits at 29 544 an increase of about 25 since my last update and representing 2 95 million shares of exercisable calls This is about 60 of the average daily volume prior to the spike in volume on Thursday Friday A reddit user who I won t name because I haven t asked them who used to work in IR at CLNE indicated to me during chat discussion this weekend that the leadership team is aware of the recent uptick in interest sentiment and are excited that people are not only interested in the company but also believe in the product The DD content and general sentiment on here the last couple of days and months honestly has been positive The environmental side of the story is great Besides needing a decent business case and technicals never before in history my opinion has it been more important to have a good story mission to make people feel good about what your company is doing Our society is more social than ever amp x200B TL DR Do I think this is a one way ticket to the planet Uranus No Do I think this will make me an overnight millionaire No especially because my position is relatively small But I do think that there is a legitimate shot at some gains both short and long term here The company has a product sales partnerships a good story and now the backing of an army of passionate people read apes who quite simply like the stock Thanks and take care

5 analysts have offered 12 month price targets on CLNE Low estimate is 11 00 18 2 gain from Friday close High estimate is 27 00 190 gain from Friday close Median estimate is 20 00 114 8 gain from Friday close Cramer came out in May and said he doesn t like the stock aNaLyStS aRe DuMb AnD Ur DuMb ToO I know and I know AnD aMaZoN iS GoNnA dIlUtE tHeM sHaReS bRuThUr What Ok To quote Bill from science videos shown in elementary school class rooms whose last names happens to be the same as a small cap stock ticker consider the following There s a legitimate case to be made for the stock having an extended term floor of somewhere near 13 49 thanks to details of their partnership with little known company called Amazon As a part of the deal with Bezos Inc which also supports 46 CLNE fueling stations Amazon reserved the right to purchase up to 53 million shares on warrants at a strike price of 13 49 However only a quarter of these are exercisable immediately The rest are only vested after Jeff has made a certain amount of fuel purchases from CLNE This drastically detracts from the cost of the deal and the way CLNE runs those sales revenues will most certainly be pumped back into additional infrastructure investment see their earnings which are always dead on estimates and near 0 00 EPS In short Amazon has a huge stake pending in CLNE but only after significant additional expenditure and investment AKA PARTNERSHIP Moving on to the topic of shorts and activity I m not as fluent on this subject as I am some others like technical mumbo jumbo and early 2000 s pop punk emo music IT S NOT A PHASE MOM but I think you ll appreciate the information here and at least be able to connect the dots as to how this relates to the other popular stonk plays on this sub Over the last 10 trading days before Thursday Friday daily shares sold short sits at about 10 of volume On Thursday this rose to 26 8 on the day on Friday again to 32 on the day So what 26 or 32 isn t huge right Sort of The significance from the rise in ratio of shares sold short vs volume is the concurrent spike in volume In terms of absolute numbers shares sold short went from about 500 000 per day to 8 10 million on Thursday and 10 64 million on Friday The major short players on this stock have been Citadel and Blackstone Spoiler alert According to fintel short shares availability is only 8 6 million as of June 4th With an average daily volume of around 5 million again before Thursday Friday how many days to cover You do the math And some final thoughts about market conditions around CLNE and the options landscape I m not here to push any squeeze thesis just providing information to help you develop your own conclusions about what I believe to be a great stock play I ve been in since 2020 There is short and long term potential here in my opinion The now famous June 18th 13 strike call OI now sits at 29 544 an increase of about 25 since my last update and representing 2 95 million shares of exercisable calls This is about 60 of the average daily volume prior to the spike in volume on Thursday Friday A reddit user who I won t name because I haven t asked them who used to work in IR at CLNE indicated to me during chat discussion this weekend that the leadership team is aware of the recent uptick in interest sentiment and are excited that people are not only interested in the company but also believe in the product The DD content and general sentiment on here the last couple of days and months honestly has been positive The environmental side of the story is great Besides needing a decent business case and technicals never before in history my opinion has it been more important to have a good story mission to make people feel good about what your company is doing Our society is more social than ever TL DR Do I think this is a one way ticket to the planet Uranus No Do I think this will make me an overnight millionaire No especially because my position is relatively small But I do think that there is a legitimate shot at some gains both short and long term here The company has a product sales partnerships a good story and now the backing of an army of passionate people read apes who quite simply like the stock Thanks and take care

and why this stock is a must have ,Admittedly TELL and Liquid Natural Gas is not as sexy as weed stonks and meme stonks but that does not mean that TELL does not have a lot to offer This stock could be your ride or die and TELL is the kind of partner that will have hot tendies on the table when you get Fun Fact Did you know Liquid Natural Gas is used as Rocket Fuel Well it is and that is super neat A quick re cap on TELL Tellurian Inc TELL is a liquefied natural gas LNG development company headquartered in Houston TX TELL plans to develop a 27 6 mtpa LNG terminal with five plants near Lake Charles LA as well as upstream assets and pipeline infrastructure The initial stage will likely include 3 plants 16 6 mtpa capacity The Driftwood project will be financed by equity customers partners as well as project debt financing Tellurian will own 28 42 of Driftwood Holdings and 100 of Tellurian Marketing Tellurian is a market disruptor with their proposed Driftwood Project which will make them the first end to end well for the production company pipeline network for transportation terminal LNG for exporting exporter with an at cost LNG acquisition independent of domestic Henry Hub HH as they ll be selling primarily on Japanese Korean Marker JKM at this time U V3capitol What is this Driftwood Essentially it is a pipeline some of you may have heard of the Deals that have been signed recently I will get back to these later the Driftwood Pipeline is the vehicle that supplies these deals The Driftwood Dream has been going since 2016 it would seem we are on the cusp of making that dream a reality This summer we should be seeing some press release on infrastructure build out related to the actual pipeline construction Q1 2022 is the projected date for FID and when the pipes might be laid Driftwood has permits the company Betchel to build it and a team that has done it before Shovel Ready is the term here When the construction starts the floodgates will be open and this stock will Reference a stock like Cheniere trading 87 35 a company Charif Souki used to work for so you can get an idea Speaking of Charif Souki let s take a peak at the team All Star Management Tellurian has 2 of 3 pioneer LNG founders that developed the largest Natural Gas companies Charif Souki Chairman LNG Godfather and Legend who was the founder of Cheniere Energy in 1996 If they can do it once they can do it again Oct vio M C Simoes CEO Previously he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG amp Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra s efforts to develop build and operate liquefied natural gas LNG receipt terminals liquefaction facilities natural gas pipelines and storage facilities u V3capitol This team can and will get it Fun Fact 2 So you don t think LNG is cool Liquefied natural gas LNG is natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state at about 260 Fahrenheit now that is pretty cool if you ask me for shipping and storage The volume of natural gas in its liquid state is about 600 times smaller than its volume in its gaseous state This process makes it possible to transport natural gas to places pipelines do not reach The Deals Right now TELL has 2 of them Vitol and Guvnor each worth 12 Billion over the next 10 years So 2 4 Billion per year in revenue with these alone We can expect to hear a couple more deals announced in the next month These deals are what have people so excited for this stock as of late and rightly so I know what your thinking so what Without that pipeline they will not get any of that money Well to the skeptics I would ask this Why would these companies be signing deals without doing their due dilligence I mean here I am doling out info and my opinions on this company but don t take my word for it Take the word of the not 1 but 2 companies that are going to dish out billions Something I am sure many people are thinking Fossil Fuels are so last century Why would I invest in LNG I should invest in solar and wind and blah blah blah Well you are not wrong if your talking about coal and oil Natural Gas is going to stay relevant though Here are some reasons why Developing countries can not afford solar and all the fancy smancy tech energy They will continue to be buyers for a long time to come Remember TELL exports LNG Global Basis Demand continues to increase on a

being used as fuel to power trash collection vehicles The plant can produce up to 13 000 gallons of LNG per day from landfill gas enough fuel for 300 LNG powered collection trucks across 20 California communities This technology not only turns waste into a renewable energy source but it also benefits the environment due to the significant reduction in fuel emissions produced by the garbage truck

above mean It means that right now electric vehicles are a gold rush and BlackBerry is the one selling picks and shovels Through Amazon IVY is going to become an integral part of the EV process The market is sucking the dick of EV manufacturers but EV production is low margin and low scale BlackBerry IVY is data monetization which is high margin and has unlimited scale Within a few years BlackBerry will be making much more than the auto manufacturers they re partnered with Blackberry QNX is used by 23 of the world s top 25 electric vehicle OEMs BlackBerry targets more than just EVs

1246,ntvrs3,t2_7wtva,1623013923,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntvrs3/gtt_the_sleeping_giant_of_moon_missions/,1, GTT THE SLEEPING GIANT OF MOON MISSIONS , GTT the story of an incumbent losing its shackles and driving a green candle straight into the shorts ass Obligatory disclosure I am not a financial advisor the following is not financial advice when making financial decisions it is important to consider your own situation and evaluate the risk profile that a decision represents to your person That being said I seek to share some of the information I have gleaned over the last week of coffee and cigarette fuelled research into GTT Communications ticker GTT TLDR for fast scrolling apes GTT is one of the most shorted stocks with a very high short borrow fee and importantly small market cap It has a strong bull case for a pivot and a CEO with an extremely decorated track record of turning business into revenue generating machines The Rundown GTT is an internet infrastructure and cloud computing company They used to be one of the largest owners of T1 internet infrastructure networks used to interconnect datacentres and other bandwidth critical services both domestically and across the Atlantic They have been plagued for over a year with an overhanging debt liability which peaked at 3 1bn In October they sold their infrastructure division to I Squared Capital for a value of 2 15bn with the sale to be completed this year 1 Their CEO Ernie Ortega seeks to trim the fat from GTT and repackage them into a corporate cloud computing behemoth with a capex light business model 2 The Debt The crux for the short reports on GTT have been its high debt to earnings ratio the most damming and damaging published by wolfpackresearch in June 2019 I m not here to sugar coat GTT s past they made ALOT of dumb and aggressive acquisitions in 2017 and this is reflected in the seismic growth of their total assets and their awful debt to EBITDA earnings minus shit like interest rates and taxes etc A lot of things have changed DRAMATICALLY since then The CEO Commencing his position in 2019 after the slew of short seller hit pieces published on GTT Ernest Ortega is a decorated veteran of the internet services and communications industry Holding executive positions at Towerstream and Colt Technology Services Coming off the back of a sensational performance at Colt Technology Service as their revenue officer he slotted into the position of Towerstream CEO and grew EBITDA earnings revenue from a previous year loss of 616 000 to 2 8million the following year this represents an EBITDA growth of 557 Ernest has a knack for taking cashflow negative businesses trimming the fat and redressing them as low capital expenditure money printing machines Towerstreams chairman of the board described Mr Ortega as possessing the sic experience and performance in increasing sales productively at Cogent Communications and most recently at Colt Technology Services is what attracted us to him as a candidate He brings what is needed to transform our Company 3 The Pivot In October GTT announced their desire to sell their infrastructure construction and maintenance division to I Squared capital management Off the back of their aggressive acquisition schedule their net PPE exposure grew from 657 8k in 2017 to 2 561million in 2019 prior to Mr Ortegas stewardship this massively increased exposure was reflected in an accumulated depreciation growth of more than 2x from 2017 to 2019 Asset depreciation reflects as an expense to revenue and is the primary driver to GTT s terrible earnings and revenue numbers since it onboarded the enormous portfolio of infrastructure assets its offloading this year Mr Ortega seeks to offload this unwieldly bag of shit his company has strung together before his appointment and use the coverage of their debt from the sale as a way to pivot their service focus into a sector currently growing at a CAGR compound annual growth rate of 17 8 the cloud computing industry 4 GTT applied and was granted an extension to their debt on the 27th of May 5 thus TOTALLY removing the overhead short term risk of chapter 10 bankruptcy that short reports have leaned on for years as justification for their short position The Short Position on GTT GTT is one of the most heavily shorted stocks on wallstreet Currently it is listed as the 7 most short squeezable stock on Fintels list of most short squeezable stocks 6 Current short volume ratio is 22 but the real kicker lies in the tiny marketcap of GTT and the short borrowing interest rate GTT has a float of 46 1mil shares representing at the time of writing a nominal value of 137 378 million dollars Since 20 48 of this is sold short that means that the number of shares held or longed is 36 658million representing a nominal value of 109 242million If you compare this nominal value to some of the other interesting squeezables on wallstreet you ll find that to dry up the float of BB apes would need to control 90 99 of the float as only 9 1 of the float has been sold short this represents a nominal value of 4 567bn dollars To squeeze CLOV we ll need long control over a value of 644 356million For GTT we only need long control over 109 242 million Now the second sexy outfit GTT is wearing is the borrow rate for short shares The short borrowing interest rate represents the creditor or lender of shares to short sellers risk premium for lending those shares The rate represents how much premium the lender wants for lending out their shares and is an accurate indicator of the default risk of the short selling borrower The short borrowing interest rate on GTT shares being borrowed to sell short is a whopping 40 7 and was peaking around 50 last week Summary and Closing Comments The tiny marketcap of GTT coupled with its short interest rate is what has gotten it in Fintels top 10 short squeeze targets The extension to its debt repayment coupled with its sale of its underperforming infrastructure assets fleshes out the bull case for its pivot into the capital light and profit margin heavy sector of cloud computing while bringing along all its corporate and institutional customer base it has built for almost 30 years all this contextualised by Ernest Ortega s storied track record of bringing cash flow negative communications and networking companies out of the pit of revenue losses and into net cash flow positive territory is the cherry on top We were trading at a range between 43 56 prior to the short reports published in 2017 and the more recent news regarding debt extension and asset sales has NOT been priced in The cohort of GTT short sellers have been counting their blessings while all of this information has completely slipped

CLOV to GME or AMC While these stocks have some similarities particularly being targeted by hedge funds for short squeezes I m not going to get into that This post is for anyone who is somewhat new to investing still learning about shorts and squeezes and those of you who are more knowledgeable but want the full picture of what s going on with this stock You can also think of this post as a Part 2 to my previous post https www reddit com r CLOV comments ngesez this is the bottom and youll be top of the world utm source share amp utm medium web2x amp context 3 Brief description of my last post it was about the stock reaching its bottom at 6 80 and only going up from there which was correct TL DR Currently the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between 7 18 for every single month The goal is to stay above 12 to create a snowball of options being executed thereby causing a gamma squeeze the higher the strike price the higher the limit to execute and the hedges are worse off What Is Clover Health Clover Health is not just another insurance company They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis treatment and most importantly prevention This company should not be classified as a health insurance company but a tech company Their AI learning and database Clover Assistant make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing repetitive diagnoses and it consolidates a patient s medical history into one platform This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts Currently CLOV covers 66 300 customers across 8 states out of the 61 212 247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide which equates to 0011 of the beneficiary population As you can tell this number is extremely low which makes sense since they are a brand new company When they reach even 1 of the beneficiaries this company s stock price would be 100 based on fundamentals alone But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more CLOV Medicare Advantage Plan amp 37 growth as reported by cloverhealth com https preview redd it a23h4ztt5q371 png width 3297 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 9b4d5364e53f568220b08a89df89c3d701875f45 CLOV has huge long term growth potential so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze Let me explain why Positive Catalysts All the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in Here are some positives I m keeping an eye on DOJ SEC case dropping or settling even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare it will still be positive because at max they ll pay a fine and that ll be over with I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it s related to Medicare Biden s health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare related stocks so CLOV will definitely benefit CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000 who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares PR of any new partnership expanding to further states and increasing current partnerships They re growing rapidly as is so news like this is bound to come out in the near future The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV As previously mentioned the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it s unclear when it will be settled Although it s priced in it is still something to watch out for Hindenturd s constant attacks despite insisting they don t have any positions Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren t benefiting from it according to themselves This relates to the GME AMC squeeze Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely Hindenburg s report was created to hurt all of Chamath s SPACs specifically IPOC which is now CLOV Basically this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors and if I had to take a wild guess Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report I ve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations PS Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath his track record is stellar The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive For instance the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best if you go to their website you ll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail All their social media lead to Wix com platforms instead of their own And THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST as shown in Google Maps Lots of red flags Let s get down to the nitty gritty The Daddy of all Short Squeezes CLOV is currently over 42 58 as of Friday making it the highest shorted stock on paper and it s unclear how many naked shorts there are which could easily be 70 100 it s impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE it s just a matter of how much more the short interest increases which will correlate to a bigger squeeze Furthermore the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3 7 meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases Soon they won t be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves CLOV S I amp 37 as reported by Ortex https preview redd it uopctc3y5q371 jpg width 1125 amp format pjpg amp

a particularly good metric for evaluating young potentially high growth companies or companies in cyclical industries that may not show an actual net profit every year Let s talk about CLOV s P S

margin In 2018 and 2019 the market valued tech companies with IPOs at an average of 11 7 and 10 4 times respectively their previous 12 month earnings Conservatively that would put CLOV at 7 billion market cap which is around 20 fair value But in 2020 that number doubled which would increase CLOV s market cap significantly However for this consideration I m using the 2018 19 valuation to be conservative Bottom Line The fair value of CLOV is anywhere from 20 30 fundamentally which makes it a very risk free undervalued stock that has been suppressed by short sellers But this post is not about the fundamentals this is about exposing the short sellers manipulation of CLOV On paper this company is shorted 42 58 though this is MUCH higher when you include the illegal naked shorts that aren t reported making it the highest shorted stock as of Friday This number could go much higher as short sellers continue to borrow stocks and suppress the price further which only hurts them more the longer this is shorted As is common knowledge from previous squeezes hedge funds are not going to cover anytime soon they have to be forced by triggering their margins As the Fed hinted recently hedge funds are the most leveraged they ve ever been in the last 20 years which means retail investors can take advantage of them just like they ve been taking advantage of retail investors for 100s of years I don t know how much it could squeeze from 50 150 or much higher and there s no telling where the ceiling will end up The squeeze is inevitable whether you or I buy it or not but the process of how long it will take is up to the retail investing community CLOV s Response to Hindenburg Allegations https www streetinsider com Corporate News Clover Health Investments 28CLOV 29 Issues

CLOV to GME or AMC While these stocks have some similarities particularly being targeted by hedge funds for short squeezes I m not going to get into that This post is for anyone who is somewhat new to investing still learning about shorts and squeezes and those of you who are more knowledgeable but want the full picture of what s going on with this stock You can also think of this post as a Part 2 to my previous post https www reddit com r CLOV comments ngesez this is the bottom and youll be top of the world utm source share amp utm medium web2x amp context 3 Brief description of my last post it was about the stock reaching its bottom at 6 80 and only going up from there which was correct TL DR Currently the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between 7 18 for every single month The goal is to stay above 12 to create a snowball of options being executed thereby causing a gamma squeeze the higher the strike price the higher the limit to execute and the hedges are worse off What Is Clover Health Clover Health is not just another insurance company They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis treatment and most importantly prevention This company should not be classified as a health insurance company but a tech company Their AI learning and database Clover Assistant make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing repetitive diagnoses and it consolidates a patient s medical history into one platform This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts Currently CLOV covers 66 300 customers across 8 states out of the 61 212 247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide which equates to 0011 of the beneficiary population As you can tell this number is extremely low which makes sense since they are a brand new company When they reach even 1 of the beneficiaries this company s stock price would be 100 based on fundamentals alone But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more CLOV Medicare Advantage Plan by amp 37 of growth compared to competitors cloverhealth com https preview redd it wuoalim07q371 png width 3297 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b38cba4adeb4fcbbeae5d53ea93751964480113a CLOV has huge long term growth potential so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze Let me explain why Positive Catalysts All the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in Here are some positives I m keeping an eye on DOJ SEC case dropping or settling even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare it will still be positive because at max they ll pay a fine and that ll be over with I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it s related to Medicare Biden s health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare related stocks so CLOV will definitely benefit CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000 who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares PR of any new partnership expanding to further states and increasing current partnerships They re growing rapidly as is so news like this is bound to come out in the near future The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV As previously mentioned the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it s unclear when it will be settled Although it s priced in it is still something to watch out for Hindenturd s constant attacks despite insisting they don t have any positions Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren t benefiting from it according to themselves This relates to the GME AMC squeeze Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely Hindenburg s report was created to hurt all of Chamath s IPOs especially CLOV Basically this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors and if I had to take a wild guess Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report I ve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations PS Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath his track record is stellar The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive For instance the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best if you go to their website you ll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail All their social media lead to Wix com platforms instead of their own And THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST as shown in Google Maps Lots of red flags Let s get down to the nitty gritty The Daddy of all Short Squeezes CLOV is currently over 42 58 as of Friday making it the highest shorted stock on paper and it s unclear how many naked shorts there are which could easily be 70 100 it s impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE it s just a matter of how much more the short interest increases which will correlate to a bigger squeeze Furthermore the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3 7 meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases Soon they won t be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves CLOV S I amp 37 as reported by Ortex https preview redd it yem0laz57q371 jpg width 1125 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s d0602994d6bc0ddc1305c2737a8b1d70de3f7c58 No need to fear the company dumping their shares or diluting it because the Class B shares are locked up the directors aren t able to sell any shares until the stock price stays above 30 for 90 consecutive days or more The company is 700 million cash flow positive and no debt therefore there won t be any dilution The P S ratio is considered a particularly
