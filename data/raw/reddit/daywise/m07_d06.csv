,They are all apart of the Appharvest vision Seeing the world through Virgo s eyes https preview redd it myk3sf8ali971 png width 1650 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e405ddb0b95221613608e2d8b894a7dc0bcc8f19 To start I am a devout follower of the company Appharvest APPH I ve done a couple DDs on the company and A LOT has happened since my last DD They ve had their first earnings report They ve announced the construction of new farms They ve started expanding into other crops besides just tomatoes And most importantly which I will get to they acquired a robotics company called Root AI and will leverage their experience to build Project TalOS I firmly believe in the mission of APPH and there s no doubt in my mind that APPH will take me and possibly you to the promised land Quick Overview Of APPH APPH is one of the few publicly traded indoor farming companies in the world To borrow some big words from le sophisticated these companies are involved in what is called CEA Controlled Environment Agriculture However you don t have to be sophisticated to realize that with global warming supply shocks due to pandemics food shortages increasing population growth depleting resources and inflation that CEAs are the future Just take a look at California and other states out west and the current drought conditions It s only a matter of time before farming outdoors for many crops becomes impractical Indoor farming companies like APPH are the future because they require 90 less water than conventional farms Being inside they are also insulated from weather and are exposed to less pests meaning crops can be grown year round and with little to no use of pesticies APPH is strategically headquartered in Kentucky where rains have only been increasing in recent years Honestly there s so much to talk about this company and industry I will probably have to produce a FAQ one day if there s enough interest However what I want to focus on with this DD is well what s new What s New With APPH Since my last DD the following has occurred APPH had their first earnings report which can be found on their website Initially APPH focused on producing tomatoes They have announced that they will soon be growing strawberries and leafy greens APPH was added to the Russell 2000 Index APPH tomatoes were originally distributed via Sunset Mastronardi to grocery stores like Kroger Their tomatoes have now been bought by Wendy s as well APPH plans to have 5 farms operating by 2022 and 12 by 2025 That means this company is growing faster than you can say fast Remember the first farm was built only in 2020 APPH has fully locked in glass and steel prices for the next two farms hedging against inflation Could someone at APPH own the Time Stone APPH acquired Root AI and are starting to build Project TalOS Root AI and Project TalOS amp x200B What is Project TalOS https preview redd it kpepqnxgli971 png width 1402 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 8627f7810910bade7dc9906d1265efce7ec0ff4f In April of this year Appharvest bought Root AI which is an artificial intelligence and robotics company This acquisition enhanced APPH s ability to monitor crop growth using algorithms and pick crops using robots While this in itself is pretty cool having say Jarvis pick your tomatoes when they are ripe from a standpoint it is just ok Btw their robot now is called Virgo not Jarvis in case you were curious Sure you reduce some costs but that s about it and as of now APPH has no plans to manufacture and sell these robots Now I m not an expert of the food industry but I d imagine most of the industry is low margin meaning you aren t making a ton of money from each sale You just hope to make a lot of sales This is similar to another industry with a company I follow Carvana a used car dealer Buying and selling used cars is a low margin business so there needs to be additional revenue streams if you truly want to make it big Turns out the bulk of the money Carvana makes comes from financing as well as from selling additional products like GAP insurance NOT from flipping cars The leadership at APPH probably realizes this as well They can t be an agg tech company if all they do is sell crops Sure APPH has goals to become the largest CEA in the US but these guys have even bigger dreams They like Carvana plan on creating additional revenue streams which could turn what is traditionally a low margin business into a high margin one One additional revenue stream they are looking into is creating the industry standard Operating System of the CEA world Think Amazon Microsoft Apple Google type stuff but for Aggtech As of now there currently is no good OS for running CEAs which is what led APPH to create its own OS called Project TalOS The vision is for this software to integrate robotics genetics management software and AI In other words they plan to create the software that oversees and optimizes production through controlling every aspect of crop growth Ultimately APPH plans to make the food supply chain hyper efficient like the e commerce supply chain which Amazon revolutionized So is there a market for this I m no smarty but the answer is DUH I m willing to bet that more and more crop production will be moved indoors Additionally don t forget about the recent boom in marijuana which will require some sort of software to manage their crops Additionally there have been other indoor farming companies popping up here there For example a competitor of APPH Aerofarms is looking to build a farm in the Middle East In door farming is the future and as these farms get more sophisticated at some point they need some lines of code to make everything work together And APPH plans to make bags off of this Don t be a boomer and think farming should only occur outdoors I know last time I posted there were some boomers hating on CEAs Just remember boomers don t like change or bags With that said do I believe that the OS developed by APPH will be able to be the dominant OS in the CEA space I can t say for certain given that it s such a new thing and in a growing industry But the fact that they are attempting to do so and given their past track record of execution gives me confidence that they will at the very least make very good progress Remember these guys were able to build their first farm in 2020 during the heights of Covid 19 and are on track to build out a total of 12 farms by 2025 APPH also always seems to be ahead of the curve like locking in glass and steel prices before the current inflation While other companies are just beginning to build farms these guys are already building the operating system that those farms will use I love APPH I hope to see yall there with me Disclosure I am long APPH Fellow WSBs should carefully consider their investment objectives and risks before yoloing into APPH Opinions and statements regarding the financial markets are based on current market conditions and constitute my judgment They are subject to change without notice My bullish sentiment is my opinion and was reached after doing intensive due diligence on the industry and company Also DM or comment

now you ve heard about the 70 million settlement in the Robinhood HOOD case I ve seen how it s being covered They cite the outages in March 2020 and some vague wrongdoings involving options usually focused on approving people who were unqualified I decided out of boredom to look at the over 100 page filing in the case submitted by FINRA to see exactly what was charged and what evidence they had to support the charges I found a significant number of shocking details that at least from what I ve seen hasn t been widely reported So I d like to share those with you because I would imagine that most if not all of us have used them at some point So here s what the investigation uncovered Robinhood has allowed approximately 818 000 customers who had been approved for options trading either Instant customers or Gold customers with margin disabled to make trades such as options spreads that could and often did automatically trigger the use of margin For instance the firm permitted those customers to enter into options spreads which if assigned on the short leg required the use of margin to satisfy the assignment Robinhood fails to disclose to customers that even if they have an Instant account or a Gold account with margin disabled they still can make trades that can result in the use of potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in margin Robinhood published false and misleading information on its website about the risk of loss associated with in particular debit spreads and the firm falsely assured customers who had entered into options spreads that they did not need to take action to mitigate risk heading into options expiration Many customers who may have relied on Robinhood s statements experienced significant losses On September 4 2020 for example over 130 Robinhood customers who held expiring TSLA options spreads incurred losses either because they were assigned on their short options after hours while their long options expired worthless or because Robinhood exercised their long options while their short options were not assigned On average these customers lost tens of thousands of dollars even though Robinhood had informed them that their maximum losses would be a fraction of that amount During various time periods between January 2017 and May 2021 Robinhood displayed to millions of customers on its website and mobile applications a variety of other false and misleading information about their accounts This is broken down into 3 offenses A Robinhood displayed inaccurate account information to millions of customers because of delays or errors in the firm s systems which affected the processing of corporate actions From January 2017 to May 2021 Robinhood failed to timely process or made errors in processing certain corporate actions including stock splits dividends and mergers and acquisitions This caused Robinhood to display inaccurate account information to customers who held securities subject to the corporate actions including for example inaccurate portfolio balance cash balance buying power and total return While Robinhood was unable to identify all corporate actions that may have caused it to display inaccurate account information sample data indicates that millions of accounts were affected B From January 2019 to May 2021 Robinhood displayed inaccurate information to nearly six million customers regarding their accounts historical performance including the net increase or decrease in the accounts total portfolio value For affected accounts the chart that Robinhood used to display historical performance either overstated customers gains or understated customers losses for a variety of reasons including because Robinhood mistakenly did not properly account for cash dividends that had been paid to customers various cash movements in customer accounts and cash and position movements caused by corporate actions The amounts by which the historical performance of the affected accounts was overstated or understated varied and the inaccuracies in the information displayed did not affect the actual portfolio values of the accounts C From December 2017 through October 2020 approximately 367 000 customers viewed pages on Robinhood s mobile applications and website in which the firm displayed erroneous margin maintenance requirements or erroneously indicated that the customers were not in margin calls when they in fact were Although they re all bad this one in particular stands out as just new levels of incompetence and negligence I m sure if you were around you remember the outages in March 2020 where for a period of 2 days on multiple occasions Robinhood was totally down FINRA has requirements of brokers maintaining what is known as a business continuity plan BCP While Robinhood had plans for instances like fires natural disasters and pandemics they did not have a plan for technological failure even though internal documents indicated they were aware it could result in closure of the business permanently So in March when the app and website failed they literally had no plan on what to do next despite their awareness that it could result in the failure of their business permanently I mean No words Although Robinhood s clearing firm had recommended thorough verification of applications Robinhood s customer identification system overrode those alerts and approved the accounts without any effort to verify that the information provided by the customers was accurate Sample testing showed that Robinhood automatically opened i e without any manual review 94 of accounts that Robinhood s clearing firm had flagged for a high probability that the customer s Social Security number belonged to another person Robinhood also automatically opened more than 100 accounts that were flagged based on a high probability that the customer s Social Security number belonged to a deceased person Robinhood s automatic approval of accounts that had been flagged for potential fraud was contrary to the firm s procedures which specified that Robinhood request an ID such as a driver s license or passport when the firm could not verify a customer s identity using credit reporting agency data Robinhood did not enforce this requirement however and between June 2016 and November 2018 the firm approved more than 90 000 accounts that had been flagged for potential fraud without obtaining any physical form of identification So here s the TLDR Robinhood didn t care They blatantly lied to customers causing enormous losses They approved accounts that were obviously fraudulent The data contained in the app regarding your balance profit and losses was totally fake Even if you had margin turned off you were still allowed to use margin incurring hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses They lied to options users then took over their positions making terrible moves and costing them huge amounts of money In regards to their outages they literally didn t even have a plan Even though this report details hundreds of thousands of affected users the majority of the document details individual settlements making up a tiny fraction of the total amount 500 detailed dealing with options errors and 2 832 in schedule 2 Schedule 2 identifies customers who suffered losses as a result of the firm s erroneous margin calls and margin call warnings The total amount is 3 744 938 48 for both Out of a 70 million settlement Anyone still interested in buying the IPO Anyone think justice was done Over 95 of the money going to FINRA and Robinhood weeks away from cashing in to the tune of billions of dollars Meanwhile other than the fine Robinhood admitted no wrongdoing and submitted a 2 page list of 4 promises including stricter options requirements new customer support centers and hiring experienced lawyers to oversee their efforts It s a joke I can personally attest to the fact that several of these have not changed in the slightest So there you have it I m tired of companies like this suffering fake consequences while the users suffer real ones If you agree please share this post so that as many as possible know EXACTLY what Robinhood was doing robinhood finra investing memestocks

sectorpotential2083 u FatAspirations u JayAreW u JeffAmazon u drop o matic u uberkikz11 for guidance and assistance in writing this report PUBM has been a name that has been floating around for a few weeks now usually in the context of its high short interest As we dug into the name further we were pleasantly surprised to find out that this company is not dog shit is not failing nor is it in a dying industry as most of the other short interest plays that will remain unnamed but a thriving company in an accelerating industry This post will guide you through how we stumbled on the name the company and its financials the industry the short interest and the plan There are several angles of attack here enough for everyone to get their grubby little hands dirty traders investors and gamblers A summary amp x200B Clean financials with earnings beat and raised guidance Undervalued compared to peers Secular tailwinds as digital advertising expands Dual class share structure which disincentivize insider selling High short interest anywhere from 20 50 as of 6 24 High institutional ownership 74 Small float with tight liquidity Bottoming chart pattern with reversal Options chain initiation on 6 25 with more strikes to be added imminently Plan Shares for the conservative players Options the chain is limited because options were just introduced pound any and all strikes with focus on the longer dated Disclaimer Multiple people have contributed to this report and most have shares in the 30 range when the idea of this play was first conceived The Origins and Chart Analysis What caught our interest originally was a volume scan After market close on 6 7 PUBM showed up on a scanner looking for relative volume increases This is a scan I use a lot as it s a good way to follow the whales as they tip their hand when scaling into a position When you see big volume moves over the relative average but little price movement it s usually a sign of institutional accumulation The big players piece into positions slowly as not to price themselves out with a massive market order In the case of PUBM despite a 3x volume spike price only increased a modest 5 These moves are often signs of trend reversals when an institution slams its wizard staff into the ground and says You shall not pass The last three weeks have seen the most shares traded in PUBM s history even more than when PUBM IPO d in December of 2020 In addition to accumulation volume the PUBM chart is a perfect example of both types of head and shoulder patterns topping H amp S and bottoming inverse H amp S see Chart 1 The original H amp S called out the top and now we see an inverse head and shoulders formed which is typically a signal of a bottoming reversal pattern The breakout was rejected at the original neckline of the topping pattern and retested the breakout point on 7 2 21 and has held This is the beginning of a text book trend reversal breakout The chart setup is a buy But what is it we re buying amp x200B https preview redd it dvxgqryh4l971 png width 694 amp format png amp auto webp amp s c5eb3169a68bc1f3b007a499fde379b8bef0c0f1 So What Exactly is Pubmatic In short Pubmatic is an advertising technology company For most of human history business owners have been using ads to sell their products inform their customers of a value proposition or build brands With the advent of the internet adtech companies like Google have grown rich and powerful by allowing advertisers to communicate with any type of customer they want virtually instantaneously as much as they want No other form of advertising offers these features and as such the digital advertising market has become extremely complex with hundreds of billions of dollars on the line every year This trend toward digital advertising is expected to continue figure 1 Figure 1 Digital ad spending worldwide amp x200B https preview redd it e5zfu5zk4l971 png width 520 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 9cd713dbe7aad803d15b4b88c393138caede80a9 Pubmatic operates and competes in this space specifically programmatic advertising Before programmatic digital ads were bought and sold by teams of people on either side of the equation which was slow and cumbersome Now there are scores of companies that have built software and infrastructure that allows digital ad space to be traded programmatically The market share of programmatic advertising as part of all digital advertising has been on the rise figure 2 Figure 2 market share of programmatic advertising amp x200B https preview redd it bh073a1m4l971 png width 624 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 9444f4c9a7635ea35bfcd5b0cd76bdaef28c397c Since Pubmatic is a programmatic ad company it is benefiting from these two tailwinds more ads are becoming digital and more digital ads are becoming programmatic Programmatic channels primarily have two sides to them the buy side and the sell side At a basic level publishers generate revenue by selling digital ad space on their content and advertisers marketing agencies will purchase this ad space to place an ad in front of a potential customer Pubmatic is an SSP or supply side platform Publishers will integrate and configure Pubmatic s software to allow for the transactions to take place Publishers want the best outcomes possible for their ad slots so more often than not they ll integrate with multiple SSPs in an effort to increase their overall yield I can t stress this enough the programmatic ad market is so complex I would be willing to bet that a single person couldn t wrap their head around the whole thing It is mountainous in size Trillions and trillions of programmatic ads are served up across advertising verticals across global markets and across billions of devices every month Any sizable publisher that wants to efficiently sell their inventory at scale must work with an SSP and compete in the broader programmatic ad market Needless to say most digital channels continued to grow as people spent more time inside and on their devices Pubmatic s revenue continued to grow YoY as overall advertising spend took a big hit due to COVID The most exciting part about this is that global ad spend is projected to return to its normal growth pattern you can see this already taking place in figure 3 Figure 3 Global Advertising Forecast amp x200B https preview redd it fxd9zrum4l971 png width 624 amp format png amp auto webp amp s bd922d833a0f3c6224f29144a3f9d59a3699e434 So not only did Pubmatic gain a greater share of the total advertising dollars in 2020 the overall advertising pie is going to grow as well This rebound in ad spend is yet another tailwind for Pubmatic If you re keeping count that makes three so far 1 More ads are becoming digital 2 More digital ads are becoming programmatic 3 More overall ad spend in the future Shut up and talk about the short interest Since short interest is what all the kids talk about these days that was where we headed to next In addition to looking at squeeze probability it is good to know if a company is highly shorted Most short sellers know their stuff except maybe Melvin and if a company is highly shorted it s usually for a reason PUBM has short interest that is estimated as high as 50 in some places We actually believe this to be an inflation due to a quirk in the public float involving share types which the aggregators such as Bloomberg and others haven t caught on to yet will explain later There is a chance we are incorrect about this but according to our calculations the short interest is closer to the 20 mark which of course is still very high Price peaked at 77 during the first week in March and shorts have hammered it ever since The question is why The insider lockup Like most newly IPO d companies there was an insider share lockup These insider shares were mostly of the class B variety these were shares awarded to VC firms and investors that have been with the company since its inception in 2008 PUBM announced during the Spring that those insiders with class B shares of which there are 40 million of were free to sell as of 6 1 While we don t know if this is what short sellers had in mind it is probably a safe bet A similar situation happened to PLTR a few months back when they had their own insider lockup expiration So the next question is Did the insiders sell Some did but not many It is estimated that roughly 4 6M class B insider shares have been sold only one firm has liquidated the other big players are still in Why are they still in the game PUBM has an interesting quirk in their share and voting structure where class B shareholders hold a 10 1 voting advantage over the class A public float holders Their one class B share gets 10 votes per share vs our 1 vote per class A share If you want to still retain voting power within the company you really do not want to sell your class B shares Furthermore if class B shareholders sell it consolidates the voting power of the remaining class B shareholders Why this is important is because everytime a class B share is sold it converts to a class A public share this is what is missing when everyone talks about the short interest Some of these class B holders have sold converting their shares into class A and thus increasing the public float and diluting the short interest However most insiders have held and will most likely continue to hold if they still want a voting stake within the company Worth noting is that two of the biggest holders VC firms Nexus India Capital and August Capital both have seats on the Board of Directors so it is unlikely that they will sell a meaningful amount any time soon So the lockup has come and gone without too much damage share price bottomed out and has now increased Why else would someone be short The privacy wave Consumer data has been called the oil of our generation All of the data that is generated on your devices is sold recorded and analyzed Companies do this in order to serve you targeted ads based on your spending habits and characteristics In the past all of this has been done without the full knowledge or consent of the end user you Once people started to realize just how far the tracking had gone governments and individuals started to demand better privacy from adtech companies Apple has been leading this effort across the board since privacy has become part of their brand image Agencies and advertisers have become drunk off of readily available third party consumer data and as the privacy wave makes its way across the world we re going to see less third party data available to advertisers Last year Google said they would start phasing out browsers from accepting the third party cookies that help advertisers publishers and data brokers profile you to help advertisers target ads toward you The change would prevent an adtech company PUBM that recorded your visit to a trading website from later showing you ads for that stupid day trader guy with long red hair and a beard I know you ve seen those ads before This in effect would hinder all adtech companies from doing what they do But this dropped two days ago 6 23 https www cnet com news google delays chromes cookie blocking privacy plan by nearly 2 years https www cnet com news google delays chromes cookie blocking privacy plan by nearly 2 years Google delayed this cookie phasing out until 2023 so the show goes on Leo trading gif But cookies ARE eventually going away right The adtech industry is addressing this with the use of identifiers typically in the form of hashed email addresses or phone numbers that are collected upfront from the end users Pubmatic has been working vigorously on getting these identifiers put in place through the use of their identity hub product which is identifier agnostic There is a lot of speculation surrounding which of these identifiers will end up winning but since Pubmatic can integrate with any of them they don t much care which one wins out in the end Pubmatic s management will need to keep a close eye on the privacy developments as they move forward because the sunset of the third party cookie won t be the only problem That said the adtech industry is notoriously finicky and Pubmatic has been able to keep up with the times Management has repeatedly said that they take a long term approach toward their investments and I expect them to continue to be able to deliver value to publishers and agencies as these investments like Identity Hub pay out While the privacy wave is a headwind Pubmatic has been working on addressing it for years now In aggregate Pubmatic has a lot more going for it than against it Next stop financials Financials Revenue

example of SSP consolidation Gross Profit Pubmatic operates with a high gross margin as you would expect from a cloud based software company Their gross profit has also been trending upwards so they

know what s publicly available and everything looks really clean I suspect shorts are closing there s no reason not to But the beauty of this potential play is you can attack this from multiple angles Want to play the short squeeze Go ahead it s a possibility Want to play the value investor That works too Pubmatic is undervalued compared to its peers How about growth The digital advertising industry is accelerating and PUBM is still trading at levels below its valuation How about a market mechanics liquidity play see the bonus section Want to play the chart Easy reversal pattern and ride that trend with the accompanying volume Bottom line is most trading opportunities offer one or two avenues for profitability PUBM has lots of different pathways for success pick a path that suits your risk tolerance and hope the market doesn t shit itself A wise trader once told me You can either trade for justice or for profit but not both Pubmatic may just offer the rare opportunity to trade for both The plan Shares and the limited calls are what s recommended for now As some of you may have noticed PUBM did not have an options chain up until 6 25 Some limited strike prices have been added but still not enough Pound em and make our friendly brokerages add more PUBM managed to get to 77 without the aid of options leverage so I see no reason why a revisit of that price is unattainable by summer s end with the company and industry tailwinds Considering that any case for shorting PUBM has been removed it appears a new trend is starting Where things may get a little spicy is in the bonus section and it is in regards to the restricted liquidity Bonus section if it ain t tight it ain t right The liquidity for PUBM is very very tight If you ve been watching the intraday movements at all you ll notice a barren orderbook with share bid ask spreads routinely above 50 and sometimes even in the dollar range Exacerbating the already restricted float is the high institutional ownership which currently sits at 74 With most of the shares sitting in the coffers of big players there aren t many shares exchanging hands on a day to day basis which makes for wild price swings What makes this interesting is that as mentioned in the paragraph above options were just introduced as of 2 weeks ago This is very unusual for a 1 5B market cap company that has been traded for over 6 months Only minimal strike prices and dates have been added thus far with more additions anticipated The more strikes that get added and the more OTM call bombs that people lob PUBM s way the more interesting and volatile things can get I say again PUBM accelerated into the 70 s after IPO without the aid of options dynamite With the company and industry headwinds dulled for now sprinkle in the FD leverage and anyone short should probably pack up their bag cash in their tickets and GTFO Trade responsibly and good luck

tops and bottoms Double tops and double bottoms are reversal formations signaling to chartists that a sustained trend may be about to reverse Double tops typically occur when two successive moves higher are sold into creating two peaks on the chart The low point between these two highs is known as the neckline and the pattern culminates with a break through this level On this occasion you see that a second top fails to break above the initial high This indicates that the uptrend may have finished and a reversal is likely It s sensible to enter your trade below below depending on whether its a top or bottom when the pattern is fully formed because another pattern may be forming such as a triple top The benefit of trading a pattern such as a double top is that it also gives you a price

higher peak head followed by a lower peak right shoulder The neckline is formed between the two troughs on either side of the head If the neckline s sloping down that s an even better indication of a reversal You calculate target price based on the distance between the head and the neckline just add subtract that distance to from the breakout point It is worth noting that a head and shoulder s

higher lows indicate that the market is converging towards it This pattern usually signals that the price will move higher but its possible that the resistance level might be too strong causing the price to bounce off Generally the best strategy is to trade the breakout There is usually a re test of the horizontal resistance level after the break to establish it as a new support level The conservative trader could wait for the backtest before entering Descending Triangles Works in the opposite way to ascending triangles The market hits a level of support but a series of successively lower peaks suggests the price will move lower Symmetrical Triangle Occurs when the price appears to be converging with a series of lower peaks and higher troughs lows This is a continuation pattern which means the market will usually continue in the same direction as the overall trend after the pattern has formed If theres no clear trend before the triangle the breakout is equally likely to be up or down Its possible to trade this scenario with a one cancels the other market order Place an order to buy above and sell below the triangle and if one gets triggered the other gets cancelled amp

lockdowns and the adoption of the stay at home retail trader but also from the exposure they received during the Gamestop short squeeze They are growing incredibly fast on all key stats and metrics that include cumulative funded accounts monthly active users and net assets under custody To put things in perspective in a stellar 2020 they did roughly 1 billion in revenues and so far in Q1 2021 alone they ve already done 522 million on pace for 2 billion revenues for fiscal year 2021 Their bottom line is teetering between net profitability and net loss and management has said it is uncertain which side of the coin net revenues will fall on in future quarters short term Having said that from the S 1 management also see s growth continuing with a large share of the market still being un tapped Their biggest opportunities lie in the fact that 60 of Americans do not trade outside of their retirement accounts and majority of young adults aged 18 29 still do not invest at all the median customer age is 31 years old Robinhood also has a lot of room to grow in international markets mainly Europe and Asia Going off the data from previous years and looking at how Robinhood scales as they grow It seems that on average for every 1 in revenue the company grows in scale operating expenses will increase by approximately 75 cents The most notable increase in expense for Robinhood has been their technological and development expense This is understandable as the company has been scrutinized for when their services have gone down at seemingly inconvenient times for retail traders Lastly the biggest risk for Robinhood is their PFOF component which constitutes nearly 75 of total revenue Robinhood s business model relies on PFOF and any regulation on that segment would put their business at risk Positions None because the stock is not listed yet

importance of artificial intelligence AI has increased manifold over the years and now it has become an essential part of many technologies that we use on a regular basis AI along with its subset machine learning ML as well as other technologies that make use of AI like the Internet of Things are finding applications in various segments across the world Notably one of the major areas where AI is being used considerably is e commerce With the help of AI companies are offering personalized recommendations to their customers on their e commerce websites or mobile apps by studying customers behaviors including buying patterns search histories and so on This is beneficial for companies because AI is able to suggest products that the customers are more likely to buy Meanwhile video streaming platforms have a plethora of content sometimes making it difficult for consumers to find what they want to watch This is where AI comes in as it offers streamlined recommendations to users which are more likely to be suited to their tastes Meanwhile AI is also powering digital voice assistants Voice assistants make use of technologies like natural language processing to respond to users commands or requests and with the help of ML they are able to study the users patterns and develop better responses over time Moreover AI is the driving force behind industrial automation With the help of AI powered robots factories are automating mundane tasks increasing operational efficiency and improving output Interestingly AI is also finding its use in the development of self driven cars These cars make use of AI sensors cameras and other technologies to understand the environment around them and drive on the designated path being mindful of traffic jams and other obstacles and ensuring the safety of passengers AI is also being used in the healthcare segment in areas like robotic surgeries Notably with the help of AI robots are increasing the efficiency and precision of surgeries In fact a WhatNext Global article cited that research has shown that AI assisted robotic procedures could result in almost five times lesser complications than surgeons operating traditionally Moreover AI has been instrumental in the fight against COVID 19 as it has helped in areas like contact tracing among others Owing to the positive developments that AI is bringing to various segments it is no surprise that the AI market is expected to grow going forward Notably Markets and Markets stated in a report that the global AI market is estimated to witness a CAGR of 39 7 from 2021 to 2026 4 Stocks to Watch Out For Thanks to the myriad benefits that AI is offering across segments it is only prudent to predict that the AI market will grow in the future Hence this seems like an opportune moment to keep an eye on companies that stand to benefit from this continued upswing in the use of AI Notably we have selected four such companies that carry a Zacks Rank 1 Strong Buy or 3 Hold You can see the complete list of today s Zacks 1 Rank stocks here NVIDIA Corporation s NVDA Compute and Networking segment offers Data Center platforms and systems for AI HPC and

fall My strategy is to look for stocks with a downtrend or that have created a significant number of bagholder sentiments Ask a friend about the industry Now that I have figured I am going to ask a friend who works in the industry or is related it I messages a petro engineer about what he thinks will happen to the coal industry in the next 3 5 years Doing comparison So I visit its finviz page of

start keeping notes of what I am going to ask the industry expert How do smaller coal companies operate when they have a downturn Do they shut operations What happens to all that money when things get better It seems like that small company has more money than they could use it in operations So EV EBITDA philosophy is working against it The higher cap company is significantly shorted but I doubt coal company is attractive enough for a retails short squeeze Comparing the data against Price to a 52 week low is interesting also But both the companies are more or less the same Price to 52 Week High shows possible bagholder sentiment The negative the number the better ROI looks quite bad for the small cap I expect the coal industry to have a negative ROI but geez that number is crazy I also am looking for insider and institutional ownership but I will look deeper into it when I visit open insider Small cap doesn t even have analyst coverage Was getting bored let s do google I will usually start with Wikipedia but the small cap doesn t have an entry So I will check their annual report Started with purchasing natural gases and delivers Does a little bit of processing too But they have made investments in coal subsidiaries They do exploration and they don t have any provable reserves of asset Thermal coal has a lot more stable price than metallurgical coal They are in

taking the initiative to clear the air I m probably going to get a lot of downvotes but I m going to be straight up honest here We are not a team this is not a cult and this is not fucking collusion GME AMC amp CLOV are three completely different plays Stop fucking comparing the 3 with this cult like attitude GME Was being shorted because as per technicals it was a company that was going to shit bankruptcy if they didn t change leadership and incorporate strategic changes to their business model aka E Commerce and the like Additionally the biggest reason GME picked up is in late December early January is because it had a ridiculous unprecedented short interest of 140 Making the short squeeze extremely likely to occur The stock picked up gamma squeeze and short squeezes occurred and it s still the play to this day Why because the remaining 15 20 short sellers still holding their positions are the same ones from the beginning who have accumulated billions in loses thus still considered a major play the company making big changes to their board of directors adding e commerce and more etc AMC This stock sucked dick when it was first picked up The only reason this stock got picked up was because of nostalgia and because of people missing out on GME The SI on AMC back when GME rallied up was well below 20 This company as well was on the verge of bankruptcy It got picked up by the supporters like us apes and more shorts loaded in AMC due to the retail investors Picking this stock to rally up actually has started to work on their business model and accrued 1B in investments and has started to really concentrate on building the business into a success hopefully When the CEO said the talks of bankruptcy are no longer on the table is because even they knew at the time that filing for bankruptcy was a real possibility for the company Again the CEO has fucked over investors in the past by trying to continually dilute the float with adding more shares On top of that prior to the stocks rallying up the board and CEO s paid themselves handsomely when the company was about to fail Now the narrative is different for AMC as the shorts that are in this stock are the same ones from the beginning and have also accrued unrealized losses Also seems the company has really pivoted to reconstruct their business model to become a success once COVID 19 is no longer hindering the world from being normal again thus making AMC still a very big play CLOV Was ridiculously shorted the moment it hit IPO This had nothing to do with GME or AMC The short interest on CLOV has been there since IPO The play for CLOV is that it s a Medicare Advantage Disruptor and provides a real use case and a cost effective solution to the traditional Medicare Advantage sub segment that hasn t changed in ages This stock has a large short interest now probably greater then AMC and GME combined low float no debt and has a very bright future for growth It s also heavily invested by Alphabet Google and other major players The firms shorting CLOV are not the same as those who shorted GME and AMC separate that from your minds Yes Melvin Capital Citadel and others targeted GME and AMC but this has no relevance to CLOV No one gives a fuck a viable stock that has a potential to disrupt a market segment that is also heavily shorted is the play for CLOV That s it simple as that All 3 of these stocks are completely different plays Yes a short squeeze and or gamma squeeze will always be appreciated on any stock But get this through your heads THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PLAY They are completely different in respect to each other WSB is a casino we re here to place bets and hope for the best This is not a team sport this is not a cult and this is not collusion If you don t like a stock then don t throw money at it But stop with the shilling and the cult attitude predominantly from GME and AMC diehards that can t grasp that WSB is a casino and not a subreddit solely about GME or AMC I m not talking about GME and AMC holders as a whole most of you are chill af just some that are constantly shilling everything with a ticker thats not GME or AMC Now with this shit said I m a big supporter of all 3 But for fuck sakes they are not the same play stop comparing the 3 Don t forget AMC dropped to 6 and AMC bagholders were bag holding for months before it moved GME dropped to 40 and GME holders were bag holding for months before it moved Everyone needs to chill the fuck out play your plays and keep it moving Stop shilling shit and comparing shit when they re not correlated at all BB and NOK became Meme stocks because fundamentally they were undervalued for what the company actually does and where they re positioning themselves for the future People just need to stop comparing and having these debates 3 stocks 3 completely different plays fuck off and throw your money at which ever stocks you like and hope for the best just stop with the comparisons and cult shit it s ridiculous Also the short squeeze is nowhere near in sight You think the short sellers are dumb as fuck They re going to wait until inflation hits and fucks up the whole market They re probably betting that once the market goes tits up people bag holding these stocks will sell why Because they anticipate people will need to pay for bills mortgages rent their children etc and with the cost of living cost of commodities inflating due to inflation I can easily see how they re going to hold onto there positions shorting these stocks until this occurs They re banking that when shit goes tits up the investors in these stocks will also go tits up and FUD will kick in causing massive selloffs My personal opinion Some plays on WSB are value plays short squeeze plays gamma squeeze plays undervalued plays oversold plays etc the fucking list goes on WSB is a god damn casino so treat it as such I wish you all the best and many tendies regardless of what you re invested in Downvote me to oblivion idaf Cheers

steel in my pocket or am I just happy to meet SCHN as I kick off an epic three part series on Schnitzer Steel with a balls of steel short term bet These junkyard bums used to barely scrape a living by buying your junk car removing the upholstery stained with your trisomy sperm stripping the car down more than your mom did on stage while pregnant with you then finally harvesting the steel for cash Nowadays Schnitzer is rolling in tendies and not just the ones they find underneath the car seats Due to several industry tailwinds set to continue for years scrap prices are at decade long highs As Cleveland Cliffs CEO and steel oracle Lourenco Goncalves stated just last week Prime scrap is the new precious metal Schnitzer are industry experts at collecting sorting processing and selling and exporting the stuff I m balls deep long on SCHN because I agree that the demand for scrap will reach record highs in the coming years and because SCHN is perfectly situated to take advantage However currently there s a short term play that worked out for me last time and this time around the set up is even better It ll make for a good introduction to this ticker In this part 1 of 3 I go over that idiotic bet for you to get all apish over and blame me if it doesn t work out Parts 2 and 3 will be much more in depth and long term focused tldr The previous three quarters SCHN went down after beating earnings only to quickly recover and hit new 52w highs SCHN just posted an earnings beat last week and surprise surprise it went down I think it will pop back up because SCHN trends with the price of HRC steel futures since this drives demand for scrap HRC has been going up up up The SCHN HRC spread is at a low right now recently it has always bounced back up within about a month and always before next earnings SCHN s IV is low since they just reported earnings making the upside to this quite significant Other steel companies post Q2 earnings this month look at HRC prices and tell me they won t blow the lid off earnings taking SCHN up with them In my estimation there are several significant upside risks and few downside risks PTs 55 by end of July 60 by end of August Bonus I did this play last earnings and flipped 3k into 10k With 4 month out options Positions Jul Calls 50 55 15 Aug Calls 50 55 15 Commons 70 I SCHN s earnings cycles summarized Note I created an Appendix for actual wrinkle generation at the bottom Go take a look now if you care You don t really need to know that stuff to smash the buy FDs at market price button with your closed fist while grunting fuck hedgies or whatever but knowing this stuff will certainly help you explain to your step dad why his credit limit was reached This short term play is mostly based on the last three post earning periods that all show the same pattern SCHN gets dumped after beating earnings then roars back to 52w highs and closes the spread with steel prices I believe this post earnings price action is driven by two factors A rise in steel prices and positive earnings from steel companies The set up this time around looks even better and further catalysts are listed in another section Why am I only looking at the three last earning periods This is when the steel boom really began HRC going from 475 to 1800 Prior to that steel prices were dirt cheap and steel related stocks were in a glut If you don t know about the whole steel resurgence thing read some CLF TX DDs or wait for Part II Long story short demand is increasing infrastructure autos etc supply is decreasing limited capacity China not exporting as much Anyway this dump after earnings is not a surprise for those of us that follow the stock We SCHN traders call this the back up the truck period After earnings we load up on more shares Now you can be like us Except you probably won t buy shares I did this same strategy last earnings and flipped 3k to 10k This time around has some advantages SCHN HRC spread is better 52w is already established at 60 HRC has gone up the roughly same and Q2 steel earnings will be randy at computer jpg There are also some possible catalysts but I wouldn t bet on those alone II The Chart Here s a pretty picture for you Crayons make me want to buy https preview redd it ap7xzhs0en971 png width 1819 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f2033e9b07541842b8b6fae7285948da3b2cf3dc I ll describe the chart in more detail as surely the bright colors are causing some sort of primitive fight or flight response It s ok guys daddy is right here The Pattern 1 Steel prices the gray line rise a ton during the quarter 2 The market expects SHCN to have a huge earnings beat 3 SCHN gets pumped up in the week prior to earnings 4 SCHN reports and it s only a really big earnings beat but not an OJ Simpson beating murder charges type of beat 5 Market over sells SCHN 6 HRC inevitably rises more after the sideways leading into the month period 7 Within a month steel stocks report record earnings 8 Market realizes Oh shit HRC prices are still climbing and SCHN actually did crush earnings pretty bigly and everything steel is raking in cash 9 SCHN races upwards and obliterates the SCHN HRC spread 10 Multibagger depending on how retarded you play it The SCHN HRC Spread This is the graph at the bottom It s the price of HRC steel divided by the SCHN share price If you want a better understanding of this head to the appendix Otherwise just read this sentence When HRC goes up SCHN makes more money So the two should track relatively well and for the most part they do 15 The pattern I notice is that when this spread gets low it doesn t stay low for long It inevitably goes back up as the market takes into account that SCHN will be selling their scrap for beaucoup dollars In fact it seems to run up at least once before the next earnings period often times within just a month I m betting on run up occurring again soon The yellow circles are good buy points if red and good sell points if green Follow the yellow lines up The Wieners The yellow lines are the bump periods we want to capture I highlighted the price action between the buy and sell periods to create some of my patented beautiful green dildos https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nzszyd bgs green giant dildos and cream of wsb I actually played this strategy after the earnings in April 3k to 10k after last

instead I m sure that s at least a 10 bagger III HRC Prices Other Steel Stocks Critical to this short term thesis 1 HRC prices continue to rise or at least not fall and within a month or two 2 Steel companies blow out earnings HRC Prices Let s take a closer look at HRC prices Prices of HRC contracts over time They go up 3k to 10k after last earnings https preview redd it q9tb01o2en971 png width

websites and do a ton of tedious bullshit to make this chart The whole reason I track this is because bought a ton of HRC contracts 300 tons worth of future steel right before that big dip in May got margin called four days in a row didn t fold like a paper handed bitch and just finally made it out alive with a bit of profit The reason the chart is rainbow colored however is because I m super gay and not because it s the default colors of google charts Anyway here s what I learned trading futures and what you should notice HRC prices move sideways into the new month then start to climb a week or so later Go ahead look at each new month I even marked it with scribbles I believe this is due to low volumes during the front of the month as hedges against steel orders for future months are just starting to get worked out It just occurred to me I could plot the total volume of all contracts 30 minutes later amp x200B Volumes and prices often pick up after the beginning of each month https preview redd it 8wmklz44en971 png width 938 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 6882045d216f7560755f77f1f26cb42d52cfc7b7 It looks like there are two patterns 1 Volume of all contracts does tend to settle during the month change 2 The more volume there is the more the price changes roughly It s not iron clad but it looks more often than not HRC prices like to run up mid month as volume picks up I just checked my calendar It s almost mid month Now here s the kicker SCHN reports near the new month when HRC prices trade sideways That s to our advantage because what happens when HRC prices start to climb again That s right retards SCHN goes up with it Steel Earnings Besides HRC prices themselves the other part of this short term thesis is that steel stocks will post incredible earnings yet again causing share prices to rise and pulling SCHN up with them Steelmaking stocks have been covered to death in other DDs so I won t go into too much detail However I will say that steelmakers are absolutely rolling in cash right now Their profit margins are so high that each dollar increase in HRC prices are effectively a dollar of profit times the millions of tons of steel they produce This quarter will be even better due to the lag between steel prices and the revenues steelmakers actually get as well as HRC outpacing everybody s expectations Steelmakers such as CLF have different types of contracts some yearly some quarterly some monthly some at spot A significant amount of their contracts with auto manufacturers for example are yearly and quarterly As the old contracts expire and the new ones are negotiated steelmakers rake in the profits from high steel prices I expect steelmakers earnings to be quite solid as they have been all year There s zero reason to believe otherwise The takeaway Drill this into your brain HRC trades sideways into the new month then starts to rip This is good because you can buy SCHN cheap before HRC takes off again HRC has been ripping non stop all year These insane prices will show up even more in steelmakers Q2 earnings due to contracts being renegotiated What s good for steelmakers is good for SCHN IV Downside Risks Now before you get all giddy over this it s time to go over the bad news Your mom hates you and you could lose money on this bet Past results may not be indicative of future results This is obvious which means it definitely needs to be stated The past three earnings have shown SCHN to bounce back relative to HRC before the next earnings period but this doesn t make it a guarantee Ok Also HRC could fall to close the SCHN HRC gap As unlikely as I see this anything is possible The reason I don t think HRC will fall is because demand is so solid and supply is not increasing If anything worldwide supply is decreasing as China is increasingly showing signs of cutting production and disincentivizing the exporting of their steel Remember they export 15 20 of the world s steel so what they do is very significant Oh right downside risks Ok here we go China HRC took a big tumble in May because China fucked with their commodities market https www nasdaq com articles china exchanges move to cool iron ore steel price rally 2021 05 10 in an attempt to suppress runaway commodity prices They basically jacked up margin requirements overnight so that in the morning traders got slammed with margin calls and either had to liquidate or deposit more capital to hold their now shitty positions in contracts that were getting liquidated by everyone else From the article gt BEIJING May 10 Reuters China s commodity exchanges on Monday moved to raise trading limits and margin requirements for some iron ore contracts and reinstated fees on steel futures as a blistering rally in the ferrous metals complex showed no signs of abating This dip in commodities spread overseas and I got fucking slammed by it so I am fully aware of how effective China can be when it comes to manipulation China still has an incentive to manipulate HRC prices downward They want to keep their steel within their borders and keep that steel cheap to feed their 6 yearly growth target As such they can do crazy shit like fuck with their futures market which will have contagion around the world make crazy announcements and who knows what the fuck else However I find an export tax to seal the borders of steel to be much more likely and beneficial approach See upside risks The Fire in May On May 22 2021 SCHN experienced a fire at its Cascade Steel Rolling Mill in McMinnville Oregon They stated in earnings that they very confident insurance will fully cover the repair costs as well as missed revenues However that s not settled yet and they are waiting for confirmation It s possible they are found at fault and or that the insurance payment is much less than expected This could ding the stock a bit On the flipside the confirmation of coverage could come sooner and be higher than expected It s in the upsides as well The usual contagions etc SCHN is not immune to any of the following Unforeseen bad news for SCHN I don t know maybe their hottie CEO https www google com search q Tamara Lundgren bikini amp tbm isch dies or something Unforeseen bad news for US Steelmakers SCHN correlates highly Unforeseen bad news for market Burry JPow just stfu for a few weeks Biden stfu about taxes A continued dumping of value stocks for shiny growth stocks V Upside Risks The largest catalysts have already been mentioned in depth 1 SCHN HRC gap closing short term and or by next earnings This has been a consistent pattern 2 HRC bumping up mid month after the into the month sideways pattern 3 Q2 steelmakers pulling up SCHN with them I ll move on to other catalysts now To be clear I would not be making the bet based on any of these catalysts occurring they re just possible bonuses China China produces consumes and exports the most steel of any country To a large degree they dictate the global price of steel Any decrease in the amount of steel they export will lead to higher HRC prices globally Higher HRC prices means higher scrap prices means more profits for SCHN Furthermore any drop in production increases the likelihood they will export less Why China needs the steel for themselves to fuel their 6 GDP growth So count em two possible catalysts from China that may increase steel prices 1 An export tax This has been rumored for awhile https www metalbulletin com Article 3990727 FOCUS What Chinas possible new steel export taxes mean for global ferrous industry html but could become a reality at any time 2 A drop in production A decrease in 30 production in the main steel town in China https finance sina cn 2021 07 06 detail ikqciyzk3735769 d html sinawapsharesource newsapp amp wm 3200 0024 was actually reported yesterday July 5 Positive News on Chip Shortage Autos I don t follow semis or chip shortage news much so perhaps this is already priced in However anything good for autos is good for steelmakers which is good for SCHN If the market digests news that auto manufacturers are running at full speed again they may begin to value US steelmaker stocks more highly This would likely pull up SCHN Other Macro Stuff Not long ago we had a shift from growth to value That seems to have reversed but it s always possible it starts back up again This play is so short term that I wouldn t bet on it unless you are going out until to November or buying shares Little Schnitzer Things Possible Dividend Increase I m not sure where or when dividends are declared so feel free to call me a complete dumbass about this I searched their last earnings report and could not find the declaration of their next dividend the one after this upcoming July 9th one So there s a possibility they announce their next dividend soon and it s higher than expected I do not expect there to be much impact from this but just throwing it out there as a possibility Insurance Settlement As noted in the downside risks in May Schnitzer experienced a fire in their steel mill in Oregon In their earnings report they mentioned they are still waiting for the exact settlement number gt We have insurance that we believe is fully applicable to the losses and are currently working with our insurers on claims for property loss and damage and business interruption losses We anticipate that insured recoveries made of policy deductibles and various conditions exclusions and limits will cover most of the cost to repair and replace lost and damaged assets and also a significant amount of lost income as a result of the fire The accounting recognition of such recoveries is expected to occur over several quarters It s possible this number is announced soon Though it s not likely to be impactful I thought it was worth a mention VI Appendix Optional Steel Scrap and SCHN You can skip this if you are manically scrolling to the bottom to see positions and shit Scrap Steel is one of the most recyclable materials in the world It is also environmentally taxing and increasingly expensive to create from scratch As such steelmakers prefer to buy scrap and melt it down to make new steel Scrap metal in the US is plentiful as we enjoyed much of the 20th century being the steel center of the world We have a lot of if laying around Think those junkyards with car skeletons and washing machines stacked high You should have a drive by and see for yourself if those piles are getting higher or lower Being responsible soy cucks that care about the environment the US has also spent the last 100 years building out businesses to collect sort process and reuse scrap metal One such leading business that is publicly traded is SCHN EAFs An elecrical arc furnace EAF is a new ish type of steel furnace that uses electricity to smelt steel They are loud as fuck https www youtube com watch v j2jESz7Zl8 t 1m32s and if I could choose my own death it would death by EAF Anyway EAFs are great because they drastically reduce CO2 emissions as well as PM2 5 emissions small 2 5um particles that make humans sick when they breath them They can take scrap metal as input allowing for cheap and easy recycling of steel EAFs are the future of steelmaking and is why scrap will become the next precious metal Steel Prices The price of steel eg HRC prices is a rough proxy for how valuable scrap is Steelmakers can buy scrap smelt it and then sell the new steel If they can sell steel for more they can afford to buy scrap for more SCHN collects scrap and sells it As steel prices climb SCHN can sell the scrap they collect for more While it may become more costly for them to collect the scrap their margins have actually increased Their margins have steadily increased 13 Q4 quarter ending Aug 20 14 63 Q1 18 84 Q2 17 35 Q3 ending May 21 reported last week China China makes 55 of the world s steel and exports 15 20 of the world s steel and until now they have not been responsible soy cucks As noted in this article https www reuters com article us china tangshan steel china environment minister urges crackdown on steel mills illegal production idUSKBN2B407Q March 21 gt China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1 06 billion tons it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions The steel sector accounts for 15 of China s total emissions topping all other manufacturing categories Steel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution they should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people said Huang the Minister of Ecology and Environment in charge of cracking down on steelmakers Their air quality sucks it s killing people and they have the Olympics coming up amp x200B Apparently some regions are like smoking 40 cigarettes a day https preview redd it ev6pr9f5en971 jpg width 580 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 5add313e6aa51a7a8e606788daacb2a98d1b6d3f To cut pollution from steel China is doing the following 1 Cutting down on production 2 Cutting down on exporting they recently removed an incentive to export steel and a tax is rumored to be in the works 3 Switching to EAFs BTW China doesn t have 100 years of junk cars laying around All three of these drive a higher price of steel and a higher demand for scrap tldr long term basics Steelmakers love scrap High steel prices HRC means SCHN makes more money China makes consumes and exports the most steel by far of anyone in the world China essentially dictates the price of steel around the world China is exporting less HRC prices go up China is switching to EAFs China will want scrap VII The Bets The risk reward metrics for various calls are for you to determine but I ll share my notes The moderately retarded bet would be Aug 50 s They re 2 50 and I think they ll be above 10 00 at some point That s about the same risk reward as Aug 55 s 1 25 could end at 5 00 but the 50s being closer to ITM are much safer Some more notes advice for you to ignore My PT for this bet is 55 for July and 60 by August Both IV and share price on SCHN are looking juicy on the drop after earnings and especially given today s price action in steel It s interesting to see SCHN recovering faster than the pack SCHN IV at time of writing 3 30pm Tuesday is at 48 14th ile over 26w period Looks good to me The volume on SCHN is rather low based on past experience posting about WWE and BGS that could mean the stock and or IV pops If it does then sit it out and wait for better entry You have time Don t YOLO determine what you are willing to pay right now before looking at the prices and if the market is pricing it otherwise then wait As noted in the DD I expect steelmakers earnings will be good and will lift SCHN though it may take a week or two for them to actually move Here s a list of upcoming earnings STLD Jul 19 ish NUE Jul 21 ish CLF Jul 22 X Jul 28 ish Aug 20 Calls The real taster s choice shit This give exposure to steelmakers earnings plus some time for the market to digest them They cover August 1st which could be a possible China export tax announcement date They also give plenty of time for SCHN HRC to close Based on the past three post earnings periods SCHN has gone up significantly within 45 days The prices are nice 55 calls are around 1 10 a pop so that s a 4 bagger if my 60 PT is hit and more if the IV and or share price rally before expiration Given that the 50 s are similar 2 50 each they re a safer bet Nov Calls In my opinion these are pointlessly far out for this bet The main catalysts will have already happened by Aug 20 so why pay for time you won t use There might be a play here to go OTM and hope for a volatility spike into steelmakers earnings but I think liquidity will be shit I m passing on these
