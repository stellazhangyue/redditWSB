81,o5bfvw,t2_21hjanks,1624326891,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o5bfvw/amd_merger_incoming_breakout_catalyst_34_weeks/,1, AMD Merger Incoming Breakout Catalyst 3 4 weeks away ,Hello everyone I believe that AMD is on the verge of experiencing a catalyst that will push the stock to a new ATH As many of us know AMD has been trading sideways and down for the past year with some noise since last October I feel fairly certain that that is about to change Last October AMD announced a merger with XLNX The two giant companies have been working it out since that time Recently both companies share holders overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger To summarize what this merger means to AMD we re talking about increased revenue increased profit margin better synergy and heading towards better products The number 1 thing AMD is going to get out of this A better shot at taking down INTC for the cloud market A company with a market cap of roughly 225 billion compared to AMD s 100 billion So this is a David vs Goliath moment There s plenty of articles written out there on how this changes the financials and prospects for AMD but I know you guys aren t going to read it if I re write it here To put it simply This is a big deal If you felt bad about missing NVDA s stocksplit run this is the potential chance of catching the next big chip manf movement So why am I writing this now instead of last October Well it s because things changed last week We know who the customer is now GOOG That s right A 1 67T company is taping AMD over intel to help support their cloud Proof https www fool com investing 2021 06 17 why amd stock rallied on thursday source eptyholnk0000202 amp utm source yahoo host amp utm medium feed amp utm campaign article https www fool com investing 2021 06 17 why amd stock rallied on thursday source eptyholnk0000202 amp utm source yahoo host amp utm medium feed amp utm campaign article So we know they picked up XLNX Now we know they are teeing up for GOOG This is freaking huge Not to mention they also acquired business from TSLA another 600B company Proof https fortune com 2021 05 31 amd tesla contract chips infotainment system lisa su https fortune com 2021 05 31 amd tesla contract chips infotainment system lisa su So let s list them out Catalysts 1 XLNX Merger 2 TSLA contract 3 GOOG partnership This is clearly a big picture strategy on AMD s part to push INTC s weakening cloud business straight into the grave and take it s spot I believe if AMD is succcessful they will eventually reach a valuation closer to 200 300 billion dollars within the next 1 2 years That s a 200 300 share price So what am I suggesting amp x200B 1 I believe that post merger the fair value of AMD is closer to 120 160 a share 2 Without the merger AMD has a value of about 120 a share due to new contracts and overall market conditions Just look at NVDA s recent 50 run Staying neck to neck as a competitor puts them at 120 But they have new business to justify it instead of black magic stock splits Is there TA to support this You bet there is I use 2D time frames to wash out noise I made some small crayon circles to give the picture some scope You can use a 1W time frame and the analysis is the same The stock s slow moving averages have begun to move higher and are approaching a cross moving the stock towards positive In simple terms Gaining share value on average every 2 days And that rate is growing The OBV is increasing meaning that someone aka Wall Street is secretly scooping up shares and holding onto them They are doing all of this while keeping the stock suppressed well below it s ATH I believe they are intentionally gathering as much as they can before the catalysts combine and create a giant bull run This is a long term run that could make a lot of people rich The moment when AMD sprints after INTC and NVDA We all know as gamers and redditors that AMD has become much much stronger and better in recent years It s been amazing to watch their progress amp x200B AMD 2D time Frame https preview redd it ueoex1s30q671 jpg width 2448 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s cae96daec77945f519f2c1a112456ec06399e2b3 amp x200B Here on the 1 week you can see the faintest flicker of bullish life This is due to the recent contract developments and the quickly approaching date of the merger As I wrote above the catalyst is incoming 1 week time frame https preview redd it 9f80a7ur0q671 jpg width 2440 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 31722579984b09e8fa30bcf913e22b2d41a96c5c So When is the merger I am sure you want some dates and some juicy possible plays Here you go We ve got 3 approvals that have to happen 1 EU Believed to have no problems and will probably be approved end of June end of July at the latest 2 UK July 6th Deadline Also rumored to have 0 problems 3 CCP This one there s no rumored date but CCP supposedly has no issues as well What is Wall Street doing They are both shorting the stock while sweeping July calls as well as 2 year leaps Take a look at July amp x200B You ve got 19498 calls purchased for July 16th at a 90 strike That sure sounds like Wall Street betting on it hitting 90 after something happens But we know what that is It s the merger Unusual Option Chain July 16th https preview redd it s3ez29jl2q671 jpg width 942 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s ae8892e1f6a9a53eef3d2dc7a56f57c5a60926be How is this unusual Take a look at the week prior amp x200B You could sum this up and it s barely even the volume for the 90 strike on July 16th https preview redd it 53uatc9r2q671 jpg width 944 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 42bc7cd9650553fe2f3f34107f10c29c8a5e7ad6 So how to interpret this Well I read this as Wall Street knowing what s about to happen I believe they know the status of the merger and approximately how far it s going to take the stock I believe we re looking at AMD pushing above 90 by Mid July This is a potential 10 bagger Especially with them trying to push down AMD s price today now is a good opportunity to get in So what s the play The easiest one is the 7 16 21 90 strike Go alongside wall Street and when you re happy with the profit sell it The merger could be announced any day so buying to at least that date is wise IMO but I am just a degenerate not a financial expert Buying longer could potentially let you capture more of the run if things play out the way I think it will You could also take advantage of the current low to grab leaps and sit back and watch how this story unfolds over the next 2 years Either way there s real potential here in something most people are considering dead in the water I am currently holding 119 contracts A large portion are for the 7 16 21 90 So yes my money is on this play and continues to be what I pursue This is my YOLO amp x200B My recommendations Buy shares Buy calls for mid july Buy leaps If you buy shares wait for the catalyst to occur When it reaches an apex start selling CCs because the IV is going to grow As a disclaimer I am not a financial expert I am just a retail stock trader I love to do TA as a hobby I truly believe that AMD is being suppressed as Wall Street fattens their positions You know what I say Fuck em They think they are hiding what they are doing but I definitely see it They are preparing and we can too And if we re right we can make more than them amp x200B Best of luck out there I hope you enjoyed my DD I don t post DD often on WSB but I hope y all enjoyed the read You guys are great and I love you all

bank Since then making it s way to the moon This was the FIRST FinTech takeover of an actual bank and created the opportunity for real profitability in an otherwise tanking company Investors noticed and they ve been getting in on the action for awhile now thinking nobody was gonna notice Well I did and it s time we get our piece of that delicious pie At one point this stock closed at 139 50 so it has a hill to climb to get back to where it was Ape nation it s climbing are you gonna be on the rocket or on the sidelines watching it BLAST OFF So I am gonna say it and I mean it Drop your bags and start making money Why is it climbing Radius Bank Acquisition 1 LC benefits from the much lower cost of funds 300 basis points reduction 2 LC avoids the Issuing Bank fees that it was required to pay previously 3 LC can now generate accrual income at 10 per annum on LC originated assets that it warehouses on its balance sheet Is this actually a growing business The first quarter earnings show us what LC profitability could look like as they move forward Now there is some accounting noise in the numbers to include timing mismatches between expected credit losses taken upfront and revenue recognitions and originations fees amortized over the life of the loan asset The result is that LC appears to be loss making seen through the GAAP numbers on day 1 whilst increased profitability shines through in later periods The accounting noise is most pronounced at the ramp up stage of retaining LC platform assets on the balance sheet The accounting noise should largely dissipate as the business matures and settles into normalized growth rates Highlights from their Q1 earnings https preview redd it oy0xj2aj5q671 png width 640 amp format png amp auto webp amp s c8787a06d94d163a3ed0498c7a6888856c0eaa15 As you can see LC delivered a net loss of 47 million However approximately 44 million was attributable to notable items what I refer to as accounting noise including 1 Upfronting of provisions for credit losses CECL due to both day 1 adjustment for the Radius assets acquired as well as newly originated assets 2 Deferrals of revenue recognition for origination fees 3 Acquisition related non recurring expenses Adjusting for these LC in total is pretty close to being break even I also note that the NII contribution from the newly originated LC platform is quite small and that the LC platform operates on much lower origination levels than pre pandemic To extrapolate future profitability I conveniently looking to separate LC into two completely artificial profit centers being 1 LC platform assets that are retained on the balance sheet and 2 Radius bank business plus LC platform assets sold to investors And also assume that all costs are attributable to 2 Then on the back of an envelope calculation 2 is roughly break even on normalized levels i e pre pandemic run rate of originations Then the question would be what is the earnings trajectory of 1 LC Consumer assets deliver an effective interest rate of 14 amp 37 https preview redd it 3ikwdjxs5q671 png width 640 amp format png amp auto webp amp s cca34cd968251b6022a448544b29695220e65638 Assuming a 0 28 cost of funds and expected credit losses of 4 then all in return on such assets is going to be close to 10 The company is guiding for 7 billion of assets in 2021 of which 15 to 25 are to be retained on the balance sheet Note that normalized originations based on pre pandemic levels should be in the range of 10b Q1 2020 originations were 2 5 billion Putting all these together in 3 years time LC could retain as much as 6 billion of LC assets on its balance sheet which could derive close to 600 million of NII Whilst the rest of the LC bank Radius and platform assets sold to investors absorb all the costs at least in my notional back of the envelope calculation The 600 million is further sheltered by LC s tax losses as well Now if my back of the envelope is correct then you can choose what multiple you want to apply to that number 8x 12x or 20x To remind readers the current market cap is only 1 6 billion Now even if you assume a much lower level of assets kept on the balance sheet say 3 or 4 billion it seems to me that the margin of safety is rather large Also in this analysis I have not factored in the potential for further monetization of the LC client base deposits wealth management debit cards buy now pay later products point of sale lending etc IP BANKING RESEARCH Great article thank you for taking the time to create

continued expansion into other pet industry subscription products will allow it to further cross sell boost overall revenue at a much lower CAC and improve LTV per customer Bark boasts a higher gross margin business relative to its peers granting it significant operating leverage as it moves toward achieving profitability Favorable unit economics such as increased AOV and monthly retention allows for quicker payback periods and longer lifetime per customer Push from being a digitally native brand to a more omnichannel one will provide Bark with access to further market penetration and brand awareness within the pet industry Large cash balance post merger will allow it to further push itself into various growth opportunities Business Overview Bark the parent company to BarkBox announced it would go public via merging with blank check company called Northern Star Acquisition Corp in December for 1 6B Though I was hesitant after the SPAC mania and eventual pop earlier this year Bark is in an interesting company that seems to be one of the better ones to go public that doesn t have a sky high valuation expectation Founded in 2012 the company sells personalized dog care packages through its DTC subscription channel Bark started with its first subscription box called BarkBox where it delivered monthly themed plush toys and treats Since then the company has expanded into different areas of the pet industry with the same premise of a subscription box model https preview redd it sll7d4mgkq671 png width 559 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

https www cnbc com quotes CHWY as one to short As mentioned above I was at first skeptical recommending Bark because it had gone through the route of a SPAC to go public but after reading their management presentations I believe taking a starting position in Bark with its growth expectations could represent a 2 3x return in the next 3 4 years Let s dive into the why shall we Growth Growth Growth Industry tailwinds to support further revenue growth When first heard of Barkbox I thought just a box full of treats and toys How is that going to scale past a certain point Sure enough I was

years think about that timeline and what happened during it If you need a refresher their fiscal 2021 started right when we all went into lockdown puppies were being adopted left and right into families and more or less ended when many were getting the vaccine and things were opening up again Perfect timing for a fiscal year if you ask me Revenue grew 68 9 from fiscal 2020 and management is predicting revenue to increase to 516M and 706M in the next two years or a growth rate of 36 1 and 36 8 respectively https preview redd it n0d4409lkq671 png width 887 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0e68025f37f6a9b429f8c7ce94434aabbe1e81d4 They ve been another pet company to take advantage of supporting industry tailwinds in the pet industry and management doesn t see this slowing down anytime soon Right now of the 50b U S pet market Bark is just a small fish in a large pond ready to swallow up market share via its various product offerings The real question is how do they set themselves up for future success beyond just toys and treats You get a box You get a box Everyone gets a box Yes that s an Oprah reference Hopefully you got that Bark realized that growing a business on one type of subscription box would not yield them the growth that a DTC startup would need to be ultra successful especially when there are other pet companies out there that have either their own subscription

point where I decided to give The Farmer s Dog https www thefarmersdog com a try which specializes in real human grade food but is expensive as hell mine is 300 a month With personalized portion controlled dry dog food Bark has entered into the over 25b market for pet food With 74 of dog parents giving dry food to their pets and 57 of dog parents using some type of specialty formulated dog food to address specific needs age coat weight this particular subscription box should push their ability to grow top line revenue well into the future with limited churn Vertical integration leads to better everything The company is already a vertically integrated company meaning that all of its products are designed developed and branded by Bark This leaves them to drive higher gross margin which sits at 59 7 as of fiscal year end 2021 well above their respective peers https preview redd it 04o3zljvkq671 png width 671 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 7326431981ee0965a469b335be6ceb919a9bb209 The good thing about their gross margins is that they re relatively stable The input costs involved in creating these products do not vary widely so when we look to how they achieve profitability starting off with a higher GM will allow Bark more room to spend on growth via advertising and marketing Though their margins are impressive this isn t the sole reason why I bring this up Creating and building a successful DTC company is no easy feat and metrics matter Some of these metrics include customer acquisition cost CAC average order value AOV order retention and lifetime value LTV CAC how much in marketing dollars it takes to acquire one customer AOV the average basket size per customer aka how much they spend in one sitting Retention the rate at which the company keeps their customers on a subscription plan calculated as 1 the churn rate LTV The dollar value per customer over their lifetime with the company Given that Bark is merging with a SPAC there wasn t consistent information where I could make visuals for you all For example they were able to release CAC and LTV but not overtime One that I was able to get was their AOV https preview redd it xaujxhmykq671 png width 688 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 321ad9bc7e313a5db8f2692b9593b4415c338432 Spoiler alert they ve been increasing their AOV steadily since Q1 20 and ended fiscal 2021 with 28 74 in AOV This is good because that means that on average people are adding more things to their cart as time goes on More items added more money and less needed in marketing for the same level of goods Another few points to make are that its monthly retention is 94 1 as of FYE 2021 which is freaking phenomenal Having a higher retention rate means people are staying on the platform and it s much easier to make back the money that you spent on marketing and improve how much your customer spends via the duration of them being on the platform example of this below CAC ended FY 2021 at 47 55 and LTV was around 300 An example that the company gave in their recent management presentation breaks down exactly how this is calculated https preview redd it npuftv71lq671 png width 889 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b15ae9315184b43a9cda9cd1fa271d8a3e508de9 Based on the information above the company has a payback of 4 5 months how long it takes to pay yourself back on a gross margin basis based on your CAC and has a 6 6x LTV CAC ratio the return on the cost to acquire a new customer This is all great news and should CAC come down over time with the ability to cross sell LTV will benefit overall and this should directly impact the bottom line in a positive way Digitally native meets retail distribution Like many digitally native companies started online eventually they all realize that retail isn t such a bad thing This same revelation happened to Warby Parker AWAY All Birds etc Bark has noticed this as well and has already begun to be a more omnichannel company They ve already had retail exposure with companies such as Urban Outfitters Target Subaru Bluestone Lane Glossier and are looking to expand this reach into more brick and mortar stores like Costco Walmart Petco Petsmart T J Maxx etc Their retail and marketplace sales already make up over 13 of total revenue during FY 2021 One part of this push is Bark increasing their brand awareness on Amazon Bark has stated in their December 2020

f20fbcc497121013e2f2112745b5b25feb778741 With the company able to better understand the dog and owner better via the gathered data from the above image they are able to curate custom boxes every month to keep your pup engaged and enjoying all their new stuff From curating boxes that are for big breeds or small breeds to dogs that have allergies or prefer certain types of toys over others making the boxes personalized and not generic keeps the pup and owner happy every month My company actually gifted all employees with dogs a 3 month subscription to BarkBox and it was definitely a nice surprise getting it in the mail every month Pepper went crazy every time she smelled the box in the lobby What was cool was the themes that they were able to conjure up and the various toys and treats they provided I remember one month I had a Peanuts themed box with Snoopy being one of the toys and getting training treats since they knew she was a growing puppy Having insights like this helps contribute to the high retention they currently report and can always give your pup exactly what they need given their breed age diet restrictions I think given how long the company has been around it would be difficult for a legacy pet company to replicate this thus giving Bark a headstart This is why I also believe that the company could be acquired not only for the business itself and all the members that it currently has on its platform but because of millions of data points that it acquired over the years Valuation Support Sticking with the theme of being in the pet industry and also two of these players having their own dog subscription boxes Petco and Chewy I wanted to only show pet companies for the public comps I had thought of other subscription related companies like Stitch Fix Blue Apron and ThredUp but could not come to the conclusion that they would be the best to show for comps given their size and what industry they were in What is interesting is that even after Petco went public Bark did not update their comps analysis to include them in the May 2021 presentation which skews things a little more in their favor Tisk tisk guys I however included them in the table

comps table above the implied stock price ranges from 12 71 to 18 84 I m keen on learning closer to the mean multiple because though Petco operates in the pet industry the market hasn t given it a high growth multiple to trade off of so it brings down the overall peer multiple set Conclusion Bark is a small fish in a pond full of other much bigger fish However their unit economics cannot be ignored and they ve successfully for now identified areas of opportunity for growth in a very meaningful way to boost the overall LTV of each customer and keep them on the platform for longer I believe that management will continue to innovate new ways to increase their AOV and cross selling capabilities and with 490M in the bank after the transaction they have the firepower to do so amp

continued expansion into other pet industry subscription products will allow it to further cross sell boost overall revenue at a much lower CAC and improve LTV per customer Bark boasts a higher gross margin business relative to its peers granting it significant operating leverage as it moves toward achieving profitability Favorable unit economics such as increased AOV and monthly retention allows for quicker payback periods and longer lifetime per customer Push from being a digitally native brand to a more omnichannel one will provide Bark with access to further market penetration and brand awareness within the pet industry Large cash balance post merger will allow it to further push itself into various growth opportunities Business Overview Bark the parent company to BarkBox announced it would go public via merging with blank check company called Northern Star Acquisition Corp in December for 1 6B Though I was hesitant after the SPAC mania and eventual pop earlier this year Bark is in an interesting company that seems to be one of the better ones to go public that doesn t have a sky high valuation expectation Founded in 2012 the company sells personalized dog care packages through its DTC subscription channel Bark started with its first subscription box called BarkBox where it delivered monthly themed plush toys and treats Since then the company has expanded into different areas of the pet industry with the same premise of a subscription box model amp x200B https preview redd it ktv6ekb9mq671 png width 559 amp format png amp auto webp amp s c1beb0bf6fe1dc2d656beabc35e914695564ad6c The company also has over 1 1M active subscriptions 6 5M BARK customers 11M total contacts and over 8 5M social media followers as per their management presentation Investment Thesis Being a thematic investor and a dog owner lover I believe the pet industry is a place for massive upside I have written two previous articles pitching Petco https onlyalpha substack com p the dog goes woof woof WOOF https www cnbc com quotes WOOF as one to hold for the long term and Chewy https onlyalpha substack com p my first short idea chewy inc chwy CHWY https www cnbc com quotes CHWY as one to short As mentioned above I was at first skeptical recommending Bark because it had gone through the route of a SPAC to go public but after reading their management presentations I believe taking a starting position in Bark with its growth expectations could represent a 2 3x return in the next 3 4 years Let s dive into the why shall we Growth Growth Growth Industry tailwinds to support further revenue growth When first heard of Barkbox I thought just a box full of treats and toys How is that going to scale past a certain point Sure enough I was

reference years think about that timeline and what happened during it If you need a refresher their fiscal 2021 started right when we all went into lockdown puppies were being adopted left and right into families and more or less ended when many were getting the vaccine and things were opening up again Perfect timing for a fiscal year if you ask me Revenue grew 68 9 from fiscal 2020 and management is predicting revenue to increase to 516M and 706M in the next two years or a growth rate of 36 1 and 36 8 respectively amp x200B https preview redd it u8rgufvcmq671 png width 887 amp

see this slowing down anytime soon Right now of the 50b U S pet market Bark is just a small fish in a large pond ready to swallow up market share via its various product offerings The real question is how do they set themselves up for future success beyond just toys and treats You get a box You get a box Everyone gets a box Yes that s an Oprah reference Hopefully you got that Bark realized that growing a business on one type of subscription box would not yield them the growth that a DTC startup would need to be ultra successful especially when there are other pet companies out there that have either their own subscription services basically everyone or have their own pet subscription boxes Petco Pupbox https www petco com shop en petcostore c pupbox Chewy Goody Box https www chewy com

marketplaces and Barkshop com with additional product offerings coming in FY 2022 Bark Bright is currently available via subscription CVS Petco and Petsmart with additional product offerings in FY 2022 Bark Eats is currently ready to ship to 20 markets and plans to ship nationwide by the end of the calendar year 2021 With all of these boxes specializing in various parts of a dog s everyday life

ait0f6wemq671 png width 894 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b8e76b2dc23a016cc8903b67367fad91c1b72b00 The box I m most excited about is Bark Eats As a dog owner myself I am very conscious of what I feed Pepper that s her name and she s beautiful to the point where I decided to give The Farmer s Dog https www thefarmersdog com a try which specializes in real human grade food but is expensive as hell mine is 300 a month With personalized portion controlled dry dog food Bark has entered into the over 25b market for pet food With 74 of dog parents giving dry food to their pets and 57 of dog parents using some type of specialty formulated dog food to address specific needs age coat weight this particular subscription box should push their ability to grow top line revenue well into the future with limited churn Vertical integration leads to better everything The company is already a vertically integrated company meaning that all of its products are designed developed and branded by Bark This leaves them to drive higher gross margin which sits at 59 7 as of fiscal year end 2021 well above their respective peers amp x200B https preview redd it frpasc0gmq671 png width 671 amp format png amp auto webp amp s da56a6427222dca0b06b18306210d8a0eeeda333 The good thing about their gross margins is that they re relatively stable The input costs involved in creating these products do not vary widely so when we look to how they achieve profitability starting off with a higher GM will allow Bark more room to spend on growth via advertising and marketing Though their margins are impressive this isn t the sole reason why I bring this up Creating and building a successful DTC company is no easy feat and metrics matter Some of these metrics include customer acquisition cost CAC average order value AOV order retention and lifetime value LTV CAC how much in marketing dollars it takes to acquire one customer AOV the average basket size per customer aka how much they spend in one sitting Retention the rate at which the company keeps their customers on a subscription plan calculated as 1 the churn rate LTV The dollar value per customer over their lifetime with the company Given that Bark is merging with a SPAC there wasn t consistent information where I could make visuals for you all For example they were able to release CAC and LTV but not overtime One that I was able to get was their AOV amp x200B https preview redd it 8g5qtnxgmq671 png width 688 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 8020bce62106a16f015f94e0a08ab4a63c577120 Spoiler alert they ve been increasing their AOV steadily since Q1 20 and ended fiscal 2021 with 28 74 in AOV This is good because that means that on average people are adding more things to their cart as time goes on More items added more money and less needed in marketing for the same level of goods Another few points to make are that its monthly retention is 94 1 as of FYE 2021 which is freaking phenomenal Having a higher retention rate means people are staying on the platform and it s much easier to make back the money that you spent on marketing and improve how much your customer spends via the duration of them being on the platform example of this below CAC ended FY 2021 at 47 55 and LTV was around 300 An example that the company gave in their recent management presentation breaks down exactly how this is calculated amp x200B https preview redd it ggrelgrhmq671 png width 889 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b5246cf7adcbe88c70643ec1cc74bc469557630d Based on the information above the company has a payback of 4 5 months how long it takes to pay yourself back on a gross margin basis based on your CAC and has a 6 6x LTV CAC ratio the return on the cost to acquire a new customer This is all great news and should CAC come down over time with the ability to cross sell LTV will benefit overall and this should directly impact the bottom line in a positive way Digitally native meets retail distribution Like many digitally native companies started online eventually they all realize that retail isn t such a bad thing This same revelation happened to Warby Parker AWAY All Birds etc Bark has noticed this as well and has already begun to be a more omnichannel company They ve already had retail exposure with companies such as Urban Outfitters Target Subaru Bluestone Lane Glossier and are looking to expand this reach into more brick and mortar stores like Costco Walmart Petco Petsmart T J Maxx etc Their retail and marketplace sales already make up over 13 of total revenue during FY 2021 One part of this push is Bark increasing their brand awareness on Amazon Bark has stated in their December 2020 management presentation that their Amazon sales growth YoY grew by 2 5x and it s estimated that the Amazon marketplace spend on dogs is to be roughly 4 3B Even on their Amazon store page they have plenty of ratings of 4 stars or higher amp x200B https preview redd it uvqsf7mimq671 png width 1456 amp format

channel diversification Data centric model fueling product innovation One thing I like is a company s defensible moat Though there isn t anything revolutionary about a dog subscription box the data that comes from it is very critical amp x200B https preview redd it hlpmomgjmq671 png width 849 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 24b527cc1a32c2537de12c64179ca5fbacecbeb4 With the company able to better understand the dog and owner better via the gathered data from the above image they are able to curate custom boxes every month to keep your pup engaged and enjoying all their new stuff From curating boxes that are for big breeds or small breeds to dogs that have allergies or prefer certain types of toys over others making the boxes personalized and not generic keeps the pup and owner happy every month My company actually gifted all employees with dogs a 3 month subscription to BarkBox and it was definitely a nice surprise getting it in the mail every month Pepper went crazy every time she smelled the box in the lobby What was cool was the themes that they were able to conjure up and the various toys and treats they provided I remember one month I had a Peanuts themed box with Snoopy being one of the toys and getting training treats since they knew she was a growing puppy Having insights like this helps contribute to the high retention they currently report and can always give your pup exactly what they need given their breed age diet restrictions I think given how long the company has been around it would be difficult for a legacy pet company to replicate this thus giving Bark a headstart This is why I also believe that the company could be acquired not only for the business itself and all the members that it currently has on its platform but because of millions of data points that it acquired over the years Valuation Support Sticking with the theme of being in the pet industry and also two of these players having their own dog subscription boxes Petco and Chewy I wanted to only show pet companies for the public comps I had thought of other subscription related companies like Stitch Fix Blue Apron and ThredUp but could not come to the conclusion that they would be the best to show for comps given their size and what industry they were in What is interesting is that even after Petco went public Bark did not update their comps analysis to include them in the May 2021 presentation which skews things a little more in their favor Tisk tisk guys I however included them in the table below amp x200B https preview redd it 3e9dx6llmq671 png width 406 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 42b268ea153e924d1cee0aa092d38d01823118bb Based on the mean and median multiples of 6 6x and 4 2x from the comps table above the implied stock price ranges from 12 71 to 18 84 I m keen on learning closer to the mean multiple because though Petco operates in the pet industry the market hasn t given it a high growth multiple to trade off of so it brings down the overall peer multiple set Conclusion Bark is a small fish in a pond full of other much bigger fish However their unit economics cannot be ignored and they ve successfully for now identified areas of opportunity for growth in a very meaningful way to boost the overall LTV of each customer and keep them on the platform for longer I believe that management will continue to innovate new ways to increase their AOV and cross selling capabilities and with 490M in the bank after the transaction they have the firepower to do so Not financial advice

long winded analysis of Uxin To begin the case for an investment in Uxin is strong and I hold the opinion that the market vastly undervalues the potential which is present within the company Here I will give a very basic analysis based off of a common sense approach regarding the intrinsic value and potential of Uxin 1 MOAT First the economic moat that Uxin currently holds can be found in its technological base of operations and the inventory owning model it has recently ascribed to The company conducts their sales online as well as off line with an emphasis on the online model A customer can visit Uxin s website or app and can peruse through a variety of different automobile choices The customer can make their selection and then have the vehicle delivered to their location of choice This benefits the customer directly by cutting down on the time necessary to view vehicles and go through the process of buying a vehicle as well as offering a more extensive list of selections Most people do not want to stand in a dealership for hours on end Additionally the inventory owning model that Uxin now utilizes has increased the ability of the company to reassure customers that the vehicles they are being sold are of good quality The inventory owning model is also beneficial for the customer in that the customer now only deals with Uxin Some other business models connect a purchaser and a seller As one can imagine this could potentially lead to a shady transaction that does not work in the best interest of the customer China wants a national standard for the sale of used vehicles Shady dealers are ever present in China as in all parts of the globe and a national standard of used vehicles is something that will benefit the Chinese economy 2 MANAGEMENT Moving on Uxin has excellent leadership to push them into the future Founder and chief executive officer Kun Dai has an intimate knowledge of the Chinese car market A track record of success is useful in establishing the premise that he will be successful with assisting Uxin to become the national standard in China Kun Dai has not only already created an online used car website CarResume com but was an instrumental figure in the publicly traded company BitAuto which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange Within BitAuto he served as vice president and worked directly with the founder of both BitAuto and Nio William Li CFO Lin and COO Zhang add to the list of wonderful management as both men have track records of success which speak for themselves 3 MARKET At this time one must consider the market which Uxin currently sits in China is a country comprised of roughly 1 5 billion individuals China is and will continue to be the largest market in the world for auto sales Considering this fact one can reasonably surmise that BOTH new and used auto sales will be on the rise Eventually new car owners desire another new car and wish to trade in their used model Uxin Will be there to pick up the older model and will assist individuals with a speedy purchase of their older car while the individual either buys new from a dealer or buys a used car directly from Uxin Uxin will assist in taking the headache away from the customer while they are involved in the process of car selling and buying 4 INVESTMENT AND PARTNERSHIP Next investment in the company is coming from very reputable sources and some important partnerships have been created One important investment firm which holds a 50 stake in the company is Baillie Gifford Baillie Gifford investments is known to be a value investment oriented firm and is a major shareholder in Tesla as well as Nio having bought stakes in both companies well before their reputations became what they currently are Wells Capital the investment arm of Wells Fargo currently holds a 2 stake in the company as well Additionally a partnership with JD com one of China s leading online sales platforms is of major importance Expertise and knowledge of the online sales sector can be gleaned from JD and will allow Uxin to blossom in sales Finally and most importantly in my opinion the news of the joint investment by Nio Capital and Joy capital is a huge indicator of future success Circling back to the previously mentioned leadership of the company this is a big deal because William Li Chair of Nio Capital is a longtime friend and business associate of Kun Dai and has expressed positive sentiment towards the company Though speculative to assume this investment may be the start of a further collaboration Nio already stands to benefit from the sale of used cars as individuals who do purchase used Nio s still have the option of subscribing to the monthly subscription services such as battery as a service BAAS 5 FINANCIAL Last but not least financials in any company are important and Uxin is not an exception Though the financial situation with Uxin has not been anything to wonder at I do feel it will improve dramatically with time My thesis for the improvement hinges on the inventory owning model that Uxin now utilizes and the online sales platform changes it has chased The company is obviously improving itself and honing itself to become bigger than what it currently is That takes time and patience All things being said Uxin s revenue is in need of improvement With 2020 being its worst year to date with less than 100 million in revenue attributed to COVID related issues I feel that the storm has come and passed for Uxin In years prior the company was pulling in several hundred millions of dollars in revenue and this was before their change to the currently more efficient model they have now taken on Additionally tax incentives for used vehicles in China will be likely to help boost sales and revenue numbers as well So given the roughly 1 billion market capitalization the company currently has a price tag there is a ton of room for them to grow and potentially double and triple in share price at minimum even if we see dilution CONCLUSION To conclude I feel that the long term value oriented investor will reap the rewards of holding a company like Uxin Superior management exceptional economic moat vast market opportunity and hard to come by partnerships sets Uxin apart from the competition As with all investments time and time alone will be what is needed for the true fundamentals and intrinsic value of the company to become apparent To end my long winded and very basic analysis I quote The Oracle of Omaha Time is the friend of the wonderful company the enemy of the mediocre Warren Buffett If I got anything wrong please advise Uxin website Ir xin com Not financial advice

and long winded analysis of Uxin To begin the case for an investment in Uxin is strong and I hold the opinion that the market vastly undervalues the potential which is present within the company Here I will give a very basic analysis based off of a common sense approach regarding the intrinsic value and potential of Uxin 1 MOAT First the economic moat that Uxin currently holds can be found in its technological base of operations and the inventory owning model it has recently ascribed to The company conducts their sales online as well as off line with an emphasis on the online model A customer can visit Uxin s website or app and can peruse through a variety of different automobile choices The customer can make their selection and then have the vehicle delivered to their location of choice This benefits the customer directly by cutting down on the time necessary to view vehicles and go through the process of buying a vehicle as well as offering a more extensive list of selections Most people do not want to stand in a dealership for hours on end Additionally the inventory owning model that Uxin now utilizes has increased the ability of the company to reassure customers that the vehicles they are being sold are of good quality The inventory owning model is also beneficial for the customer in that the customer now only deals with Uxin Some other business models connect a purchaser and a seller As one can imagine this could potentially lead to a shady transaction that does not work in the best interest of the customer China wants a national standard for the sale of used vehicles Shady dealers are ever present in China as in all parts of the globe and a national standard of used vehicles is something that will benefit the Chinese economy 2 MANAGEMENT Moving on Uxin has excellent leadership to push them into the future Founder and chief executive officer Kun Dai has an intimate knowledge of the Chinese car market A track record of success is useful in establishing the premise that he will be successful with assisting Uxin to become the national standard in China Kun Dai has not only already created an online used car website CarResume com but was an instrumental figure in the publicly traded company BitAuto which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange Within BitAuto he served as vice president and worked directly with the founder of both BitAuto and Nio William Li CFO Lin and COO Zhang add to the list of wonderful management as both men have track records of success which speak for themselves 3 MARKET At this time one must consider the market which Uxin currently sits in China is a country comprised of roughly 1 5 billion individuals China is and will continue to be the largest market in the world for auto sales Considering this fact one can reasonably surmise that BOTH new and used auto sales will be on the rise Eventually new car owners desire another new car and wish to trade in their used model Uxin Will be there to pick up the older model and will assist individuals with a speedy purchase of their older car while the individual either buys new from a dealer or buys a used car directly from Uxin Uxin will assist in taking the headache away from the customer while they are involved in the process of car selling and buying 4 INVESTMENT AND PARTNERSHIP Next investment in the company is coming from very reputable sources and some important partnerships have been created One important investment firm which holds a 50 stake in the company is Baillie Gifford Baillie Gifford investments is known to be a value investment oriented firm and is a major shareholder in Tesla as well as Nio having bought stakes in both companies well before their reputations became what they currently are Wells Capital the investment arm of Wells Fargo currently holds a 2 stake in the company as well Additionally a partnership with JD com one of China s leading online sales platforms is of major importance Expertise and knowledge of the online sales sector can be gleaned from JD and will allow Uxin to blossom in sales Finally and most importantly in my opinion the news of the joint investment by Nio Capital and Joy capital is a huge indicator of future success Circling back to the previously mentioned leadership of the company this is a big deal because William Li Chair of Nio Capital is a longtime friend and business associate of Kun Dai and has expressed positive sentiment towards the company Though speculative to assume this investment may be the start of a further collaboration Nio already stands to benefit from the sale of used cars as individuals who do purchase used Nio s still have the option of subscribing to the monthly subscription services such as battery as a service BAAS 5 FINANCIAL Last but not least financials in any company are important and Uxin is not an exception Though the financial situation with Uxin has not been anything to wonder at I do feel it will improve dramatically with time My thesis for the improvement hinges on the inventory owning model that Uxin now utilizes and the online sales platform changes it has chased The company is obviously improving itself and honing itself to become bigger than what it currently is That takes time and patience All things being said Uxin s revenue is in need of improvement With 2020 being its worst year to date with less than 100 million in revenue attributed to COVID related issues I feel that the storm has come and passed for Uxin In years prior the company was pulling in several hundred millions of dollars in revenue and this was before their change to the currently more efficient model they have now taken on Additionally tax incentives for used vehicles in China will be likely to help boost sales and revenue numbers as well So given the roughly 1 billion market capitalization the company currently has a price tag there is a ton of room for them to grow and potentially double and triple in share price at minimum even if we see dilution CONCLUSION To conclude I feel that the long term value oriented investor will reap the rewards of holding a company like Uxin Superior management exceptional economic moat vast market opportunity and hard to come by partnerships sets Uxin apart from the competition As with all investments time and time alone will be what is needed for the true fundamentals and intrinsic value of the company to become apparent To end my long winded and very basic analysis I quote The Oracle of Omaha Time is the friend of the wonderful company the enemy of the mediocre Warren Buffett If I got anything wrong please advise Uxin website Ir xin com Not financial advice

com r wallstreetbets comments o55oy9 sklz dd an interesting stock with massive of u GRAPE FRUIT EXTRACT yesterday i d like to analyze SKLZ by looking to the wide range of competitors For good measure Skillz is a company active in the mobile gaming sector using a platform that focuses on online competition against other players Often the games even include cash rewards Someone at r stocks who sees his glass half empty once said SKLZ is neither a game company nor a gambling company Well I see the glass half full SKLZ combines both gaming and casino Although it isn t black and white to determine direct competitors I ll try to look into different sectors Market Cap 7 6B Mobile gaming sector is competitive but fragmented The mobile gaming sector is a huge industry and isn t gonna disappear anytime soon You here stories of programmers developping a game that blows up and making millions of a single app These stories drive thousands of programmers chasing their luck with game developing software From chasing luck to giants like Supercell The range of mobile games is immense Can SKLZ compete against the fragmented gaming sector Yes it can As in any company you gotta have main products that secure profit With mobile games this is not that easy People get bored after a while and will delete the game but classics are the ones that are fallen back on This is where SKLZ gets separated from the competitors Games like Solitaire Bingo Domino s are those classic games that keep returning and which SKLZ focuses on in their portfolio SKLZ 3 most popular apps count for 88 of their revenue And that is a very important aspect From this fundamental they got something to build on The same audience must be the target creating a solid userbase Maybe there s a decline for a while but they ll always come back even if it s just for a minute The second point is the business model of SKLZ that makes them very unique in the Mobile gaming sector Profit is being made of a commission A model that is known to be very effective anno 2021 given the amount of people playing Don t look too far your own broker uses the same principle And as we all know 20 21 have been booming times for our brokers thanks to us degenerates buying plays week in week out Yes SKLZ is a platform and ZNGA are games but as simple as it is the more you use it the more profit that s equal for both Thirdly these ads are getting out of hand lately Even on my national sport site the ads are almost longer than the clip itself Every fucker has a smartphone Every braindead fuck will watch the same ad over and over again just to play the game over and over again This is another source of income that is an easy plus for game developers NFL Partnership Just as Draftkings SKLZ also got a partnership with the NFL source https www skillz com nflchallenge American football is the biggest sport in America and seeing the NFL on the Skillz website boosts their brand image They actually have a really nice website feel free to take a look at https www skillz com https www skillz com It really comes over clean and organized The NFL challenge gives developers a chance to create a NFL inspired game Since June 1st 2021 the Game Development phase has begun The website is up to date and I just feel like they re onto something Really looking forward to that game even though this is more something for next year Russel Above that both get added to the Russell 3000 source https www casino org news draftkings gnog among gaming equities joining russell 3000 DKNG s run up got on a hold following a short selling allegation In comparison SKLZ had a more slower recovery and still awaits its a run up but this addition could help Introducing it s ticker to a new audience ETF s will be forced to buy in the stock in the upcoming

tits but sometimes you gotta get out of your comfort zone Debt ratio of zero If SKLZ wants to make new investments in the future they certainly got room for it Cash is king SKLZ is sitting on it and if they don t watch out they ll have to stand on it very soon Cash on hand was counted at 613M in the first quarter of 2021 source https www macrotrends net stocks charts SKLZ skillz cash on hand A look at the competition If you think about a stock active in mobile games trading on the market a lot of you will think about ZNGA since it was trending on WSB early February Just to name one In the

purchased between October 26 2019 and April 30 2021 This is because it is claimed that the company has misled their investors More specifically because the popularity of their main 3 games which account for 88 of their revenue has declined But as i mentioned in the second paragraph A game like Solitaire is like rats you can kill them try to trap them as much as you want They ll always come back A look at the competition What must not be forgotten is that SKLZ merged with a SPAC And these SPAC s got focused by the SEC restrictions were hanging above their head as a sword of Damocles Post SPAC s in general have been slapped in the market since February The stock has dropped over 50 in the market from a ATH of 42 73 A correction has pulled the price down a lot As Post SPAC s were oversold they seem to have recovered from their pull back and try to settle in This also counts for SKLZ One must look at the future Most recent update news https finance yahoo com news class action ebs sklz spce 094000886 html announced that the lawsuit actions have commenced The news was well received on the market as the stock was up on the day 6 20 This convinces me the lawsuit has already or

com r wallstreetbets comments o55oy9 sklz dd an interesting stock with massive of u GRAPE FRUIT EXTRACT yesterday i d like to analyze SKLZ by looking into the wide range of competitors For good measure Skillz is a company active in the mobile gaming sector using a platform that focuses on online competition against other players Often the games even include cash rewards Someone at r stocks who sees his glass half empty once said SKLZ is neither a game company nor a gambling company Well I see the glass half full SKLZ combines both gaming and casino Because it isn t black and white to determine direct competitors I ll try to look into different sectors Market Cap 7 6B Mobile gaming sector is competitive but fragmented The mobile gaming sector is a huge industry and isn t gonna disappear anytime soon You hear stories of programmers developping a game that blows up and making millions off a single app From programmers chasing their luck with game developing software to giants like Supercell The range of mobile games is immense Can SKLZ compete against the fragmented gaming sector Yes it can As in any company you gotta have main products that secure profit With mobile games this is not that easy People get bored after a while and will delete the game but classics are the ones that people keep returning to This is where SKLZ gets separated from the competitors Games like Solitaire Bingo Domino s are those classic games at which SKLZ focuses on in their portfolio Their top 3 most popular apps count for 88 of their revenue And that is a very important aspect With this fundament they got something to build on The same audience must be the target creating a solid userbase Maybe there s a decline in popularity for a while but they ll always come back even if it s just for a minute amp x200B https preview redd it yemo54jumt671 png width 745 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 790ba93e26d72f0bfab27b92888bcc83ef158f07 The second point is the business model of SKLZ that makes them very unique in the mobile gaming sector Profit is being made off a commission A model that is known to be very effective anno 2021 given the amount of people playing Don t search too far your own broker uses the same principle And as we all know 20 21 have been booming times for our brokers thanks to us degenerates buying plays week in week out Yes SKLZ is a platform but the more you use it the more profit that s equal for both gaming apps as platforms Thirdly these ads are getting out of hand lately Even on my national sport site the ads are almost longer than the clip itself Every fucker has a smartphone Every fucker will watch the same ad over and over again just to play the game over and over again This is another source of income that is an easy plus for game developers NFL Challenge Just as Draftkings SKLZ also got a partnership with the NFL source https www skillz com nflchallenge American football is the biggest sport in America and seeing the NFL on the Skillz website boosts their brand image They actually have a really nice website feel free to take a look at https www skillz com https www skillz com It really comes over clean and organized The NFL challenge gives developers a chance to create a NFL inspired game Since June 1st 2021 the Game Development phase has begun The website is up to date and I just feel like they re onto something Really looking forward to that game even though this is more something for next year Jack Russel on the loose Above that both get added to the Russell 3000 source https www casino org news draftkings gnog among gaming equities joining russell 3000 DKNG s run up got on a hold following a short selling allegation In comparison SKLZ had a more slower recovery and still awaits its a run up but this addition could help Introducing it s ticker to a new audience ETF s will be forced to buy in the stock in the upcoming weeks ETF s The goal of an ETF is to replicate the performance of an index as efficient and accurate as possible are indeed required to pull in the new stock to match index weighting s So i expect the stock to rise in the coming 2 weeks amp x200B In the picture you can see the

Funny note SKLZ and DKNG were taken public by the same SPAC team supported by Numbers In the recent two months 2 ratings have been given by research firms which were buy and hold with a mean price target of 23 5 Although these price targets don t assure anything it helps confirming If we look to the analyst ratings since Jan 2021 the stock got a mean target of 28 75 Leveraged to the dungeons this might go against your principle of leveraged to the tits but sometimes you gotta get out of your comfort zone Debt ratio of zero If SKLZ wants to make new investments in the future they certainly got room for it Cash is king SKLZ is sitting on it and if they don t watch out they ll have to stand on it very soon Cash on hand was counted at 613M in the first quarter of 2021 source https www macrotrends net stocks charts SKLZ skillz cash on hand A look at the competition If you think about a stock active in mobile games trading on the market a lot of you will think about ZNGA since it was

who purchased between October 26 2019 and April 30 2021 This is because it is claimed that the company has misled their investors More specifically because the popularity of their main 3 games which account for 88 of their revenue has declined But as i mentioned in the second paragraph A game like Solitaire is like rats you can kill them try to trap them as much as you want They ll always come back A look at the competition What must not be forgotten is that SKLZ merged with a SPAC And these SPAC s got focused by the SEC restrictions were hanging above their head as a sword of Damocles Post SPAC s in general have been slapped in the market since February The stock has dropped over 50 in the market from a ATH of 42 73 A correction has pulled the price down a lot As Post SPAC s were oversold they seem to have recovered from their pull back and try to settle in This also counts for SKLZ One must look at the future Most recent update news https finance yahoo com news class action

discovery in decades,This is a DD for a company Reconnaissance Energy Africa RECAF I have been following since mid January I haven t seen it discussed on this sub because it s market cap is only 1 54 Billion USD There is A LOT of DD on this company out there that takes weeks to really go through I m not going to even try to cover it all but basically ReconAfrica is an oil exploration company that recently discovered and has 90 rights to the largest undeveloped onshore basin in the world right now the Kavango Basin with total petroleum generating potential that s north of 120 billion barrels of oil Given it s current market cap I believe ReconAfrica is one of the most undervalued stocks in the market a potential future 100 bagger Some history on the ReconAfrica the company was taken public about two years ago Back then all it really had was an aeromagnetic survey showing what the company interpreted to be extremely deep sedimentary basin in the countries of Namibia and Botswana On the basis of this survey they had the foresight to purchase drilling rights to over 8 million acres of land for very cheap Last year Recon purchased a drilling rig and shipped it to Namibia to get more detailed stratigraphic data The company commended drilling the first well in January February and are currently midway through the second well The preliminary results have been very bullish I am not a geologist but as I understand it an active petroleum system needs to have a source rock a seal and reservoir and traps in order to be viable With the data released in the past two months being even better than expected it looks like all of those components are present and there is potential for huge amounts of extractable oil A full suite of results from the core samples in the first two wells is expected to be released soon In future wells they plan to target an actual oil trap using the seismic data By the end of 2021 they hope to be entering discussion with Joint Venture partners Geologically speaking the Kavango basin is similar to the Permian Basin in Texas which has over 50 billion barrels of oil and is currently producing 5 million barrels of oil per day However the Permian acreage is Texas is divided among dozens of companies The largest of them Diamondback FANG Pioneer PXD Concho CXO and EOG all have market caps in the tens of billions of dollars In contrast ReconAfrica has the rights to the entire basin all to themselves That is what makes it an incredible opportunity in my opinion I think the company currently trading in the 9 10 range could be a 100 200 stock by next year once the exploratory drilling and seismic program is completed and the company enters Joint Venture JV discussions Long term I can see the company being a next oil supermajor Again for one company to own the drilling rights to an entire basin like is extremely unique Another bullish tailwind for Reconnaissance is that Western supermajors have been cutting oil exploration expenditure due to environmental pressure from environmentalists and the EIA However demand isn t going to significantly decline for decades and we could be in for a major oil supply crunch https oilprice com Energy Energy General Saudi Arabia And Russia Warn Of Major Oil Supply Crunch html The company is in the perfect position to capitalize on a good macroeconomic environment for oil and gas The bear case Some of the biggest risks are Extreme opposition from foreign activist groups who want to stop ReconAfrica and Namibia from developing in the Kavango They ve spread rumors and misinformation on social media published hit pieces in newspapers organized marches etc If they are successful at slowing down or stopping ReconAfrica that would obviously be bad for the company But I don t believe their criticism is justified If ReconAfrica is successful you can bet that it will hugely benefit Namibia and Botswana which in turn will be massively beneficial for the people and wildlife There will be more money to raise people out of poverty increase access to healthcare and education support conservation areas etc So far ReconAfrica and the governments have been committed to protecting wildlife the livelihoods of local people following international best standards and promoting economic development ReconAfrica has no proven reserves yet We are waiting on more data from additional stratigraphic wells and seismic activities before the company can formally declare it has oil and gas reserves meaning we still aren t 100 derisked yet However given that we now have two exploration wells with thick marine source rock carbonates and a rift basin full of convention traps the play has been significantly derisked Governmental risk Of course it is ultimately up to the government and people of Namibia and Botswana to decide how they want to develop their natural resources However Mines and Energy Minister Tom Alweendo https www cnn com 2021 05 03 africa namibia oil exploration intl cmd index html and Kavango East Government Bonifasius Wakudumo https www namibian com na 102332 read Oil driller announces petroleum system at second well are both excited and

com r wallstreetbets comments o55oy9 sklz dd an interesting stock with massive of u GRAPE FRUIT EXTRACT yesterday i d like to analyze SKLZ by looking into the wide range of competitors For good measure Skillz is a company active in the mobile gaming sector using a platform that focuses on online competition against other players Often the games even include cash rewards Someone at r stocks who sees his glass half empty once said SKLZ is neither a game company nor a gambling company Well I see the glass half full SKLZ combines both gaming and casino Because it isn t black and white to determine direct competitors I ll try to look into different sectors Market Cap 7 6B Mobile gaming sector is competitive but fragmented The mobile gaming sector is a huge industry and isn t gonna disappear anytime soon You hear stories of programmers developping a game that blows up and making millions off a single app From programmers chasing their luck with game developing software to giants like Supercell The range of mobile games is immense Can SKLZ compete against the fragmented gaming sector Yes it can As in any company you gotta have main products that secure profit With mobile games this is not that easy People get bored after a while and will delete the game but classics are the ones that people keep returning to This is where SKLZ gets separated from the competitors Games like Solitaire Bingo Domino s are those classic games at which SKLZ focuses on in their portfolio Their top 3 most popular apps count for 88 of their revenue And that is a very important aspect With this fundament they got something to build on The same audience must be the target creating a solid userbase Maybe there s a decline in popularity for a while but they ll always come back even if it s just for a minute https preview redd it ravowhj4rt671 png width 745 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 25f2ad08e3f3f05df46f19eceb0265527dea5359 The second point is the business model of SKLZ that makes them very unique in the mobile gaming sector Profit is being made off a commission A model that is known to be very effective anno 2021 given the amount of people playing Don t search too far your own broker uses the same principle And as we all know 20 21 have been booming times for our brokers thanks to us degenerates buying plays week in week out Yes SKLZ is a platform but the more you use it the more profit that s equal for both gaming apps as platforms Thirdly these ads are getting out of hand lately Even on my national sport site the ads are almost longer than the clip itself Every degenerate has a smartphone and every one of them will watch the same ad over and over again just to play the game over and over again This is another source of income that is an easy plus for game developers NFL Challenge Just as Draftkings SKLZ also got a partnership with the NFL source https www skillz com nflchallenge American football is the biggest sport in America and seeing the NFL on the Skillz website boosts their brand image They actually have a really nice website feel free to take a look at https www skillz com https www skillz com It really comes over clean and organized The NFL challenge gives developers a chance to create a NFL inspired game Since June 1st 2021 the Game Development phase has begun The website is up to date and I just feel like they re onto something

Funny note SKLZ and DKNG were taken public by the same SPAC team supported by Numbers In the recent two months 2 ratings have been given by research firms which were buy and hold with a mean price target of 23 5 Although these price targets don t assure anything it helps confirming If we look to the analyst ratings since Jan 2021 the stock got a mean target of 28 75 Leveraged to the dungeons this might go against your principle of leveraged to the tits but sometimes you gotta get out of your comfort zone Debt ratio of zero If SKLZ wants to make new investments in the future they certainly got room for it Cash is king SKLZ is sitting on it and if they don t watch out they ll have to stand on it very soon Cash on hand was counted at 613M in the first quarter of 2021 source https www

purchased between October 26 2019 and April 30 2021 This is because it is claimed that the company has misled their investors More specifically because the popularity of their main 3 games which account for 88 of their revenue has declined But as i mentioned in the second paragraph A game like Solitaire is like rats you can kill them try to trap them as much as you want They ll always come back A look at the competition What must not be forgotten is that SKLZ merged with a SPAC And these SPAC s got focused by the SEC restrictions were hanging above their head as a sword of Damocles Post SPAC s in general have been slapped in the market since February The stock has dropped over 50 in the market from a ATH of 42 73 A correction has pulled the price down a lot As Post SPAC s were oversold they seem to have recovered from their pull back and try to settle in This also counts for SKLZ One must look at the future Most recent update news https finance yahoo com news class action

pitch themselves as tech these days but I would like to explain why RKT is the real deal TLDR RKT is having its Amazon is just a book company moment Investors are over discounting the MASSIVE upside from tech ecosystem opportunities for this already highly profitable and fast growing company First things here is my position 350k market value 17 500 shares 18 54 50x Sep 2021 19 89c 20x Jan 2022 20 89c Now that you know I m serious let me start with some context What do the best tech investors look for I ll quote someone smarter than me Top tier firms like Vista Equity Thoma and Silver Lake focus on buying businesses with the following characteristics mission critical products with high switching costs growing end market high ROI economics market leadership and sticky and recurring revenue base Every software company can be run at 30 35 EBITDA margin Twitter sendoh34 https twitter com sendoh34 status 1350163448663982081 s 20 I work at Best Buy so I know he is right Whether the focus is early stage VC tech PE or public equity tech investors want nothing more than high growth scalable recurring revenue and they look for companies with competitive advantages and moats within their industries to deliver and protect this tasty RR What does this have to do with Rocket Companies In case you care at all about what they do Rocket Companies NYSE RKT is a holding company of consumer oriented financial services real estate and mortgage businesses Most think first of Rocket Mortgage formerly Quicken Loans which is the 1 lender in the U S with 10 share of the 3 5TN mortgage market Rocket Mortgage is known for their best in class brand customer service and innovative tech driven approach to the industry About 90 of RKT s 16BN of revenue in 2020 came from its core mortgage business Rocket is currently treated by investors and analysts as a TECH ENABLED mortgage company but not a FINTECH company Read any analyst research report and it is obvious Why is this important Because while tech enabled businesses can deliver significantly better operating results market share gains and staying power than competitors their core business is unchanged and so the valuation metrics by analysts and the institutions are unchanged This is evident by RKT s current valuation at yesterday s close of 19 22 RKT was trading at 4 7x 2020 EPS and 9 0x consensus 2021 EPS Comparatively fintech companies trade at 25 30x PE multiples or even much much higher Are they right Why Rocket Should Be Considered a Fintech Company I ll give 5 reasons why you should start thinking about Rocket as a Fintech Company 1 ROCKET ALREADY HAS AN EXTENSIVE TECHNOLOGY BASE BUILT OVER DECADES Many don t realize that while Rocket Mortgage is their largest business Rocket Companies also includes dozens of other businesses formed over decades of investment Here are just a few of them Amrock Title https www amrock com tech enabled title insurance valuations and settlement services Industry pioneer in digital closings and eNotes which more than doubled last year Nexsys Technologies https www nexsystech com creates digital platforms for real estate appraisal Nexsys Clear Path insurance Nexsys Clear HOI and mortgage closings Rock Connections https rockconnections com contact services provider leveraging technology and data to connect consumers and brands more effectively Lendesk https www lendesk com Canadian technology company which operates Finmo Lender Spotlight Gateway and Enterprise solutions with more than 10 000 mortgage brokers using its products Others include Edison Financial https edisonfinancial ca Canadian digital mortgage startup Core Digital Media http www coredigitalmedia com online consumer acquisition platform ForSaleByOwner https www forsalebyowner com and more These companies and others in the Rocket Ecosystem https www rocketcompanies com our companies create technology that Rocket can leverage in its core mortgage business which why Rocket consistently destroys its competitors on nearly every metric and has been able to scale a higher margin Direct to Consumer business while others have not These companies are also big contributors themselves already as you can see from the 1Q ER Amrock our title insurance services property valuation and settlement services company generated 348 800 closings up 110 from Q1 20 representing the highest level of closings in Amrock s history This record volume was the primary driver for the increase in other income in Q1 21 to 466 1 million from 243 8 million in Q1 20 THAT IS A 91 YOY INCREASE 2 ROCKET IS INVESTING A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL AND FOCUS INTO THEIR TECH Over the LTM ended 1Q21 Rocket generated 12BN of EBITDA on 19BN of Revenue 65 EBITDA margin which they are investing right back into their business Over 2 3 of their 276 current job openings are tech related big data scientist software engineer developer designer product manager etc A little strange for a boring old mortgage company eh Rocket has a technology team numbered in the thousands Rocket s management team has stated that their capital priorities are 1 reinvesting into the business 2 strategic M amp A and 3 only then return of capital to investors Given how much money they are making they could do all like they did earlier this year with the special dividend Rocket is clearly focused on tech going forward In the past two weeks alone they have announced several public private partnerships including backing MSU Apple Developer Academy in Detroit and a partnership between Rocket Innovation Labs yet another ecosystem company and University of Windsor in Canada They have participated in virtually every Investment Bank sponsored Technology Conference this year There are countless others I could mention but you get the point 3 ROCKET AUTO AND ROCKET HOMES THE LARGEST OPPORTUNITIES YET TO LAUNCH Rocket is quietly building massive businesses that could become multibillion standalone businesses Rocket Auto currently provides third party technology services but they are preparing to launch their own managed e commerce marketplace Read from the 1Q21 release Rocket Auto our automotive retail marketplace facilitated the sale of 13 600 auto units up more than 5 300 units or 65 as compared to first quarter of 2020 Gross Merchandise Value for Q1 21 was 360 million which represents an annualized run rate of more than 1 billion ROCKET AUTO IS DOING 1BN OF AUTO SALES ALREADY AND HAVEN T EVEN LAUNCHED OR MARKETED TO THEIR EXISTING MORTGAGE CUSTOMERS On this topic Jay Farner said We wanted to construct a business that had all of the appropriate profitability metrics before really leaning in to our client base Rocket Auto also has an existing strategic partnership with Vroom whereby they can earn up to 8 6mm shares in Vroom over 4 years worth about 365MM at today s price Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network which did over 6BN of transaction volume in 2020 It has all of the capabilities of a Zillow or Redfin with Rocket s massive footprint and data trove backing it and it hasn t fully launched This is another MASSIVE sleeper opportunity Redfin and Zillow are currently valued at 6 8x revenue 4 SOME OF THE SMARTEST TECH INVESTORS HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT IN The five largest public holders are Caledonia Vanguard Invesco Blackrock and TCMI Wait who is TCMI TCMI is an affiliate of Technology Crossover Ventures https www tcv com one of Silicon Valley s top tier VC firms Yes one of the leading tech investors in the world held 4 450 000 shares of Rocket as of 3 31 21 5 THE FLYWHEEL EFFECT IS ALREADY PROVING OUT If you follow Rocket you ll hear management talk a lot about Life time Value LTV https en wikipedia org wiki Customer lifetime value This is a term which expresses the net profit earned over a customer over their entire relationship with the company This is what it is all about Rocket has a customer retention ratio of 91 LTM as of 1Q21 which is roughly 4x the industry average It is not hard to see why this is important Think about those qualities that tech investors look for growing end market high ROI economics market leadership and sticky and recurring revenue base Add to that an unrivaled brand highly profitable existing business to fuel reinvestment extensive customer base and 2k tech force We should be able to look out at every American and target market or have a specific message and value about how we can help them improve on their home saving money in some way shape or form buy a car or help them with a real estate transaction Farner said When you put those things together that s 30 percent of the U S GDP that we re talking about here All surrounded in a multibillion dollar brand CONCLUSION Rocket Companies is incredibly cheap for both the existing business at 9 0x on 2021 consensus EPS and the upside opportunity Given the growth opportunities it should easily command a 2 3x higher multiple as supported by fintech trading comps And to top it all off RKT has tremendous short term moonshot potential Third time is a charm

Inc NASDAQ ASO by estimating the company s future cash flows and discounting them to their present value Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow DCF model There s really not all that much to it even though it might appear quite complex We generally believe that a company s value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future However a DCF is just one valuation metric among many and it is not without flaws Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model https github com SimplyWallSt Company Analysis Model blob master MODEL markdown discounted cash flow dcf Crunching the numbers We are going to use a two stage DCF model which as the name states takes into account two stages of growth The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value captured in the second steady growth period To begin with we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows Where possible we use analyst estimates but when these aren t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow FCF from the last estimate or reported value We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow over this period We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today s dollars amp x200B https preview redd it nk8jfmpeet671 png width 609 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f79612fdaf936ca8ffa619e1b731a4d2d984d2d5

For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country s GDP growth In this case we have used the 5 year average of the 10 year government bond yield 2 0

in the Total Equity Value which in this case is US 6 6b To get the intrinsic value per share we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding Compared to the current share price of US 38 4 the

result have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry or a company s future capital requirements so it does not give a full picture of a company s potential performance Given that we are looking at Academy Sports and Outdoors as potential shareholders the cost of equity is used as the discount rate rather than the cost of capital or weighted average cost of capital WACC which accounts for debt In this calculation we ve used 9 5 which is based on a levered beta of 1 592 Beta is a measure of a stock s volatility compared to the market as a whole We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies with an imposed limit between 0 8 and 2 0 which is a reasonable range for a

at 47 as of 6 18 I ll explain later the price has been hovering around 50 60 for the past few months Speaking of my personal short term price target is 69 Their 50 Day Moving Average is 55 65 and I

weathered the pandemic surprisingly well and actually managed to reduce their debt to a mere 120 million in their latest filing This is VERY good news as it shows that soon they ll no longer need to

some big players out there trying to push this stock as far below 50 as they can The stock had an amazing rebound off of the pandemic maxing out at 62 but it appears that HFs are jealous of how many

the weekend and today s session has done very well in further confirming my confirmation bias Let me do my best to explain today s trading session from a Bull s perspective Friday had a MASSIVE short volume with 1 out of 4 shares sold short That caused the price to tank significantly and I think we ve seen that as a whole for the month of June they re doing the best they can to keep this stock under 50 However Monday s trading session saw a little bit of comeback With 400 000 normal volume we saw shares spike almost 5 today Imagine what could happen with 1 million volume The shorts will have to cover their positions and it could very quickly get out of hand for them This 6 18 data shows a very new short position having just been established last week and I think they could be blindsided with the price skyrocketing so soon Either way everyone knows stonks only go up VI TLDR OK I m sure 95 of you have skipped everything above and bee lined for this Here you go you smooth brained apes Literally has blowjob in name CEO is Greg Trojan Big condom guy Very low P E compared to peers Massive growth throughout US as new stores open Reduced Debt even during the no BJ lockdown Short Volume Ratio of 26 Alright I ll say it SQUEEEEEEZE Passes the legendary SMELL test in all 5 aspects Focus on memeability Analysts see this company going somewhere big I like confirmation bias 69 PT Monday s Session shows that volume profit This can only go up Can easily retouch the 50 Day Moving Average of 56 with just a little more buying Blowjobs should be a human right Case Closed Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor Do your own DD If you get schlonged on this play that s because you listened to someone on the internet with zero qualifications My position is 100 60 calls that expire 7 16 I see this flying fast as fuck I did want to say that while I see this as potentially being a meme play this is very much a legit company that s been doing lots of good business It ll definitely hit 69 by end of year but I think it s gonna be much much sooner than that My official benchmark goals are 56 by 6 25 60 EOM and 69 by July expiration

shares sold short on 6 8 when the stock was at 56 and we can see that there are some big players out there trying to push this stock as far below 50 as they can The stock had an amazing rebound off of

s trading session from a Bull s perspective Friday had a MASSIVE short volume with 1 out of 4 shares sold short That caused the price to tank significantly and I think we ve seen that as a whole for the month of June they re doing the best they can to keep this stock under 50 However Monday s trading session saw a little bit of comeback With 400 000 normal volume we saw shares spike almost 5 today Imagine what could happen with 1 million volume The shorts will have to cover their positions and it could very quickly get out of hand for them This 6 18 data shows a very new short position having just been established last week and I think they could be blindsided with the price skyrocketing so soon Either way everyone knows stonks only go up VI TLDR OK I m sure 95 of you have skipped

shares his best advice sh 4c7b405d5840 I cut out the end part where he answers some questions about his dad While very insightful information into the life of RC I didn t feel like analyzing that particular part as it relates to investing Over 7 years RC and Chewy raised around 350m in investments He sold to PetSmart for 3 5bn He has already raised 550m https www shacknews com article 124044 gamestop gme completes 550 million secondary stock offering shares skyrocket 1 126bn https finance yahoo com news gamestop completes market equity offering 104500035 html 1 676bn for GameStop The difference is this isn t private money These monies were acquired by selling to long term devoted investors He is starting off at GameStop in a significantly better capital position than he did at Chewy GME is and is not a meme gt Cohen also served as CEO of Chewy which PetSmart acquired in 2017 for 3 35 billion which at the time was the largest e commerce acquisition ever Zack Friedman Why did you see a need for Chewy that didn t exist with Petco PetSmart Amazon and other online retailers Ryan Cohen I was going to the neighborhood pet store for my dog food but because I was busy building a business I didn t always have the time to make the trip I tried Amazon and the big box retailers but they were all missing the specialized experience and their customer service sucked Try calling them With Chewy I combined the best from all of them I saw an opportunity to differentiate from the pack and convert fanatical pet parents like myself into die hard customers Our customers got the local pet store experience with the convenience of shopping online You can see that RC really believes in what he does It s a mentality like this why some people would say Invest in the man not the company You see a similar aspect with someone like Elon Musk Not to put anyone on a pedestal but many investors put a lot of blind faith into him because they believe in his vision It s great when you get the combination of a great company and a visionary behind the wheel It s the cherry on top of a sound investment You can see he built the business because he identified a major flaw in the existing market and sought to remedy it with controversial and groundbreaking business ideas Some of it was against the grain as he elaborates to further on You can see a mirror premiss in his investment in GME gt I focused on bringing a human element to e commerce We provided 24 7 US based customer service and included small touches like handwritten holiday cards and personalized pet portraits These were ways we could connect with customers and build loyalty over time optimizing for a lifetime relationship not a single transaction Chewy s relationship with customers was the secret sauce This is the main reason why Microsoft and likely Sony have commission based sales relationships with GameStop Both companies have the ability to create decreased Customer Acquisition costs though GameStop vs Amazon or WalMart and create longer LifeTime Revenue and increase their Total Addressable Market GameStop does have the largest digital magazine subscription in the world Someone like Ryan Cohen will be able to capitalize on this aspect by focusing on Customer Service and Customer Experience You can tell he as a huge inclination towards his customer loyalty Another great article in the link at the top of this paragraph gt Friedman You were rejected by 100 different investors What did you learn from the process What made you keep going when you kept hearing no Cohen For me each no sounded like they just didn t understand my vision It was frustrating at times but never discouraging Those no s never made me doubt my strategy it was the opposite I was motivated by all the rejections and they just got me fired up Buy and fucking hold Don t worry about the noise gt Most investors couldn t get past two hurdles competing head on with Amazon and the pets com failure during the dot com bubble But I was convinced being focused on the pet category along with high touch customer service gave Chewy unique competitive advantages Pets com was a good idea but a decade too soon and without sufficient scale to cover their costs These two hurdles didn t scare me I never considered changing my business plan One highly respected venture capitalist told me he would be more interested if we were selling live pets over the internet rather than pet supplies Like most investors he believed running into Amazon s teeth was suicidal I understood that thinking big was likely going to be misunderstood along the way I m contrarian by nature so being misunderstood often validates what I m doing It wasn t until Chewy boxes were on doorsteps across the country that the bulk of investors started to recognize our formula How many times has Ryan and GameStop shown they have a hidden edge that no one expected That sentiment will only continue to grow gt Friedman Let s talk about execution and scale You ve said that you used Zappos as a model You also were inspired by Jeff Bezos and Amazon s growth and model How do you go from idea to platform to scale What was the process and how did you scale so quickly Cohen In just three months we built a website found a distributor and partnered with a third party logistics company What has GameStop done in the last three months Raised almost 2bn in cash Made a ton of new hires Expanded their product offering Completely changed their board Increased revenues and online sales Got rid of the drift wood thank you for your service Sherman Revamped their online presence Sustained insane valuations compared to where they were last year gt In June of 2011 we launched I focused on four pillars and we did them better than anyone else We started with the value proposition of delighting our customers which we did through amazing customer service low prices fast shipping and selection The onus was on us to create the most efficient supply chain to support that business model This is where we start getting into some more serious DD on RC s comments Anyone who has ever worked for a multi billion dollar corporation recognizes what RC means when he starts talking about building pillars Pillar systems are some of the most cliche corporate business strategy foundations that exist What this tells me is this guy is familiar and in the know with running a multi billion dollar company He obviously has experience with Chewy but this jargon validates that he was actually doing something while he was there Those who have been following along know that he has made a major shift towards delighting customers and offering a better value proposition Anyone in the USA who has experienced the Door Dash same day delivery knows what I m talking about gt When we reached 200 million in sales we had to insource fulfillment to be able scale to the next level We opened our first two warehouses in 2014 By 2018 we had seven warehouses around the country and 4 7 million square feet of space Each is the size of 13 football fields and four stories high GameStop like I just said is using DoorDash for fulfilment along with pickup in store Covid is probably presenting a lot of challenges for this right now and no doubt every industry is either going to adapt or die though these times Maybe RC intends to insource this as well for GameStop I also do not know what they currently do for warehousing and distribution but I would imagine this would be one of the first things RC would intent to overhaul if he saw fit Will be curious to see if we can get any insight into these plans if any To give you reference 4 7 million square feet is about 3x3 city blocks or it would take about 6km by 6km of property to fit warehouses of that size Roughly peaking It s large though So he is capable of managing logistics of a large scale This is the scale of multi billion dollar operations gt I needed to hire the best people and delegate into their areas of expertise Each employee we hired had a strong bias for action and were excited about the opportunity to disrupt the pet industry We always hired for will over skill One you can teach the other you can t Everyone and everything revolved around being customer obsessed We scaled from 3 employees in 2011 to over 9000 Chewtopians by 2018 I specialize in labor management for large corporations I also ran a small business with several employees These are the fundamental aspects of managing people You could literally be entirely unqualified in your field as long as you delegate to qualified people and hire people based on their attitude vs their qualifications then you will build a very strong culture and worker base Most skills can be taught to most people especially the motivated ones But only the motivated ones can help you drive business forward They will grow as much as you nurture them One of my largest concerns with GameStop is that judging by their subreddit they have a ton of disgruntled employees Sounds like they are often driven to quitting through unreasonable growth and sales expectations and competing with stores that manipulate figures Among other problems To see Ryan call his employees Chewtopians really signifies that he has a personal relationship with his workers I would like to see that type of culture expanded in GameStop gt We prioritized long term growth over short term profitability The last thing you want to be is a subscale e commerce company You re a dead man walking and Amazon will crush you We rapidly expanded our product offering to include all pet food and supplies so there was never a reason to shop elsewhere Expect the same thing with GME Sustained growth Long term investment He knows what it takes to take on Amazon We know this We ve seen it before in Chewy Maybe Bezos will be smart enough to partner this time Only time will tell They have already expanded their product offering in the USA Expect that to continue gt By 2018 90 of our revenue was from repeat customers This is easier to achieve with something like pet food but holy smokes that is an insane figure gt We raised six rounds of financing and more than 350 million over seven years We grew sales from 2 million in 2011 to 3 5 billion by 2018 a 190 annual growth rate 190 ANNUAL growth Jesus christ those kind of returns are practically unheard of on a continued basis Applying that to GME sends it to a trillion dollar valuation in less than 5 years Here s https www youtube com watch v dB9ZerucuwQ a video of Anne Hand CEO of Super League Gaming talking about the potential market for the gaming industry gt Friedman What s the most misunderstood thing about entrepreneurship Cohen Don t let the pictures or magazines mislead you it s not at all glamorous Negotiating with vendors reading long contracts conducting nonstop interviews convincing investors to give you money combined with a constant stream of everyday problems is not fun The Type A in me is competitive and loves to win but the day to day feels like you re losing If you think you re winning you re probably not doing a great job building your company Even as our sales grew into the billions I always felt behind Whether that s the right mentality or not that s how I m wired Friedman What are three pieces of advice you would give to an aspiring entrepreneur Cohen I d be remiss to say my way is the right way It s simply what worked for me My dad had a glassware importing business and he told me about how he was talking with his dad one day His dad had pointed at two trucks You see those trucks there he d said If what s in one of those trucks will make you more money and what s in the other truck will make your customers happier choose the one that makes your customers happier even if you make less money That served as the guiding premise for Chewy Second I was never afraid to say no I was constantly bombarded with new ideas and when you re growing quickly it s critical to stay focused so I said no to almost everything There s a time and place for ideation but in the early days when resources are finite it s important to choose a handful of things and do them extremely well This just provides some insight into his business strategy Out of the box thinking can be a great thing so don t be worried if you see some un orthodox moves come from RC gt Third my biggest risk would have been not taking risk The risk of going head to head against Amazon The risk of insourcing fulfillment The risk of building a company in Florida rather than a popular tech hub The risk of spending 3 million a month on TV ads more than Home Depot HD https www forbes com companies home depot 1 6 https www forbes com companies home depot s budget The risk of hiring expensive executives even though we weren t profitable These decisions were some of the most controversial and required me being comfortable betting against conventional wisdom and were often contrary to the advice of my board Suffice it to say I was not the most popular board member This is basically where I stopped analyzing the interview Like i said he goes on to answer some questions about his dad Which I believe lend a lot of insight into his personality and life but I didn t really feel comfortable commenting on it I have no doubt his dad would be pretty proud of what he is doing now As a father myself I would be completely blown away if my kids were doing what he s doing Based on what RC says here I believe you can get a feel for what to expect next TV Social Media ads are probably

finish https www google com search q sack rubbed finish as you learn about this load bearing home builder that reports tomorrow A brief overview Housing demand is at 2005 levels during a major housing shortage that will take a decade to sort out Commodity prices don t matter buyers are paying Evidence Data says so CEOs say so and LEN just blew out earnings and went up 10 KBH earnings are coming up Wednesday and it tends to roll with LEN so I m rolling the dice with KBH on July Aug calls plus commons because gay pride Annoyingly long TLDR below then I get gay The residential construction market is hot despite high prices Demand is insane We are essentially in 2005 High housing market index High housing starts High orders High commodity costs are a non issue prices get passed on to buyers KBH caters to the exact demographic with the highest demand first time buyers west central Residential construction stocks are down from Mid may due to The Great Inflation Scare and haven t recovered yet Real estate is generally thought of as an inflation proof investment Whether or not there is inflation people are going to buy houses at record pace for the foreseeable future All signs point to a great KBH earnings report Wednesday after close All of the above LEN has the same earnings calendar They reported last Wed Jun 16 Result Blowout Popped up 10 in two sessions LEN had no problem building homes taking orders and increasing margins despite high costs KBH tracks LEN share price rather consistently and KBH hasn t moved yet I see 10 upside easy I scraped a housing review site Results are inconclusive but if you squint they look bullish Commodities may be entering a bear market which may cause higher guidance lower commodity prices higher margin I Like The Stock Massive cashflow massive backlog of orders massive orders getting added In the right place at the right time West and central regions CEO made the news when he called neighbor Kathy Griffin a bald dyke and cunt after she made a noise complaint on his 3 grandchildren swimming in his pool Bullish July Aug calls A bet on positive earnings Wednesday following in LEN s footsteps A bet on a 10 catch up to LEN as they generally track one another and LEN is up Housing market is clearly bullish and I see no reason it will slow down Many builders report in July so Aug calls could bang Risk reward seems solid I Housing Supply Shortage and Historic Demand Levels The current housing situation for builders is better than any erection drawing they ve ever seen The supply of homes was already at a shortage about 5 5 million houses too few People were already moving out of cities and into suburbs Then COVID caused the move to suburbs trend to massively accelerate leading to a surge in home demand COVID dampened the ability to construct homes causing even more supply deficit So we now have massive demand and short supply The people moving tend to have a lot of money and they re buying despite high costs We are now at 2005 levels housing starts orders sentiment all skyrocketing It may take a full decade to build enough houses to satisfy the current demand SUPPLY The Great Housing Shortage COVID caused construction to slow Everybody had to quarantine and wear masks and shit Unprecedented times It was a really hard period that has changed us all forever and bla bla bla All that matters for us is home construction slowed during a period where people increasingly wanted to move into houses and after a period where there weren t enough houses already On June 18th The National Association of Realtors released a report titled Underbuilding Left America Short 5 5M to 6 8M Homes it s here but behind a paywall https www bankerandtradesman com nar underbuilding left america short 5 5m to 6 8m homes You may choose not to believe NAR which could be described as a lobbying group in which case you can read this discussion on Reddit https www reddit com r realestateinvesting comments o1458f why does the media treat the national association That NAR report is behind a paywall but the WSJ wrote a piece about it here https www wsj com articles u s housing market needs 5 5 million more units says new report 11623835800 which I ll quote just to give you an idea of how severe the supply shortage is Shortage existed Pre COVID gt The report also says that from 2010 to 2020 new home construction fell 6 8 million units short of what was needed to meet household formation growth and replace units that were aging or destroyed by natural disasters Housing prices are up but demand is still bottlenecked by supply gt Limited supply has been a recent driver of rising housing prices for renters and home buyers alongside robust demand gt gt The supply shortage became especially acute in the past year Builders slowed construction in some regions last spring and delayed land purchases because of the Covid 19 pandemic In addition low mortgage interest rates and an increase in remote work led to a surge in demand for single family housing And many homeowners delayed or canceled plans to list their homes for sale gt gt Builders ramped up the pace in 2020 in response to robust demand Housing starts a measure of home building activity rose last year to 1 38 million units the highest rate since 2006 But shortages of labor ready to build land and materials have limited the pace of construction growth builders say What do you reckon will happen to KBH if when they announce better access to labor and materials Have you noticed that lumber and copper have gone down significantly since May Builders will need to build at an incredible rate gt To shrink the supply deficit builders would need to exceed the long term historical average pace of 1 5 million units a year according to the NAR report At 2 1 million units a year near the level reached in 2005 it would take a decade to close a gap of 5 5 million units the report says So there you have it not enough homes and a surge in demand Builders have a lot of back filling https www google com search q back filling to do and believe me they are happy to do it This construction boom is going to last DEMAND The Great Migration It s no secret that COVID jump started a massive migration out of cities Arguably COVID just accelerated an already occuring trend of people leaving cities most evident in SF and

skyrocketing building rates without a fuck given about prices KBH must be salivating at the thought of all that oozing caulk II The Commodities Boogeyman High prices don t matter Ok so you have a picture of the crazy demand and crazy short supply of houses Now let s address the boogeyman on everyone s mind the spike in commodity prices Do not fear high commodity prices The spike in commodity prices is a direct result of the boom in residential construction and surge in demand prices are high because the market is willing to pay TLDR Houses use a lot of lumber and copper High lumber and copper prices are a consequence of the insane demand for houses are passed on to the consumer and do not impact margins As commodity prices fall builders stand to increase their margins Bullish As Fuck Lumber and Copper The same shit that happened to home building happened to lumber and copper Shut downs in production from COVID but an increase in demand afterward largely driven by residential construction From this source https www copper org education c facts home residential construction accounts for a full 1 3rd of the usage of copper Residential construction also accounts for some massive percentage of lumber usage I can t be arsed to look it up but just think of all the rim joists https www google com search q rim joist batter boards https www google com search q batter board etc that go into a house My point the surge in home building where the demand is so high means copper and lumber get bid up The costs get passed on to the buyers and the market will show you as much

people ordering homes III The Great Inflation Scare of May Let me recap what happened in mid May People emptied their weep holes https www google com search q weephole due to inflation Their butt welds https www google com search q buttweld simply burst from fears the world was ending LEN got bush hammered https en wikipedia org wiki Bush hammer from 51 down to 44 and now hovers at 43 as there s some rotation back to tech and the market circles in a landing pattern with no conviction of where to land Yet conditions for builders have only improved since May KBH has stated costs could be passed on to buyers LEN has proven costs could be passed on to buyers in Q2 and actually increased their margins in Q2 Copper and Lumber costs have tumbled since May which will further increase margin Inflation or not KBH is printing money hand over fist will reveal this in Q2 earnings and will continue to crush Q3 and Q4 aided by lower prices of commodities and continued strong demand and shortage in supply Buyers will pay CEOs say You don t have to trust fancy graphs and those squiggly whatsits numbers You can see what LEN and KBH execs have openly said about the effects of rising commodity prices Well you personally probably won t but I did KBH Q1 transcript March 24 gt So no I m not overly concerned at this point In fact we ve been confident enough and thought about the year favorably enough to lift the margin guidance as we go So we re actually even feeling a little bit better about our profitability than we were three months ago Higher lumber costs and yet higher profitability How s that possible Oh right People want to live in homes rather than in the Wendy s parking lot and will pay for it KBH CEO May 6 Taken from here https www cnn com 2021 05 05 business lumber prices home building costs index html gt While lumber prices have gone up we have been able to pass it on to the consumer with higher prices for homes KBH CEO Jerffrey Mezger That pretty much says it all LEN Q2 earnings transcript Jun 17 No need for conjecture let s see how this quarter actually panned out for LEN so far which just reported earnings last week gt Q4 of 2020 is when we saw the first significant increase in lumber costs which impacted primarily our Q2 deliveries The lumber increases which occurred in Q1 and Q2 will mostly flow through our deliveries in the second half of the year But as we noted and Diane will cover more detail we believe that Lennar s pricing power will more than offset this and we expect to deliver stronger gross margins The true test will be Q3 and Q4 where the high prices of lumber will have had the largest impact But as for now yeah their margins actually increased I think we will hear the same story with KBH on Wednesday Also from this transcript gt Looking forward we expect to see some limited relief on our lumber costs for our July starts as more expensive lumber works its way through the system And if the current downward trend holds we ll see a more significant benefit for August starts You catch that Margins managed to increase during high lumber prices in Q2 So what will happen in Q3 and Q4 if lumber continues to decrease It peaked in May Yeah More margin creating an ultimate load https en wikipedia org wiki Ultimate load of profit Expect a recovery from Q2 and beyond The stock price has yet to recover from May I m betting it will There is no reason these stocks should be cheaper than they were in May There is every indication they are doing better than they were in May Inflation or not people are buying houses More orders More housing starts Higher HMI sentiment LEN proved costs don t matter they increased their margins And now there s LOWER cost of material IV Canary in the Tendies Kitchen Where LEN goes KBH follows Both LEN and KBH share the same weird corporate calendar where their quarters are set back a month So Q1 is Dec Jan Feb and Q2 is Mar Apr May LEN posted earnings last week They crushed it and surged 10 in the two trading sessions afterward So to the extent that market conditions are working in the favor of LEN they are most likely working in favor of KBH as well Also from the LEN Q2 Earnings Call Jun 17 gt The strongest market in the United States today is Austin Notwithstanding outmigration from parts of California the markets in California are strong Driven by the state s severe housing shortage there is more demand and supply making housing the No 1 agenda item for the governor Ok guys same quiz Where does KBH do most of their business Say it with me class West and Central What else did LEN Q2 earnings reveal LEN says demand is still strong LEN says lumber costs not an issue they get passed on to the buyers LEN delivered more houses than last quarter LEN took more orders than last quarter LEN increased margin their margin Basically they are building as fast as possible and still continuing to grow their backlog Looking good for KBH Now take a look at this chart showing the

see what I see Where LEN leads KBH follows And LEN just gapped up This isn t a sure fire bet LEN could simply retrace downwards or the LEN KBH spread can persist for awhile or just fail to be a thing in the future However I m a gambling man and I m betting on this Housing Starts and Deliveries Let s compare LEN s houses ordered and delivered vs census gov housing starts to KBH amp x200B They re

homes delivered And housing starts have indeed increased Housing starts hit 4 814 in KBH calendar Q2 which is a 3 month total not seen since October 2006 Now maybe you want to think of yourself as some sort of clever Steve Carrell character and that we re in a housing bubble Or maybe you think you re that retarded glass eye drummer dude You do you and sit there and whine about how the market is going to crash I ll be that rich asshole asian guy at the restaurant whose net worth exceeds yours because I m betting big on KBH For real though there aren t really any signs there is a bubble This is purely demand outstripping supply If that many housing starts were issued then builders were at it full force I see no reason why KBH would be excluded from the frenzy I think their deliveries will be up and their orders up further increasing their insane backlog I also think their margins will increase just like LEN s They have pricing power I ll take the bet that KBH blows out earnings just like LEN V Scraping a Reviews Website On the topic of trying to predict deliveries I found a website that allows homebuyers to write reviews https www newhomesource com builder kb home reviews 5 Perhaps there s a correlation between how many reviews are written and how many houses KBH ends up delivering So I set up a scraper and pulled all the reviews The dates locations scores everything for three major builders LEN PHM and KBH Average review scores by quarter KBH is absolutely killing it Quarter KBH Avg Score LEN Avg Score PHM Avg Score 2021Q2 4 61 4 19 4 00 2021Q1 4 61 3 84 4 18 2020Q4

to match the review date to the proper quarter given LEN and KBH s weird quarterly schedule eg Q1 Dec Jan Feb I also took each review day and subtracted 7 days from it to better estimate the day the house was actually delivered since there is likely a delay between completion and writing a review I plotted this against the actual number of homes delivered as reported on quarterly earnings The theory here Perhaps there s a correlation between the number of reviews written and how many houses get delivered That would allow us to predict this quarter s numbers amp x200B If you squint maybe there s a correlation https preview redd it y0ex0lzjxu671 png width 719 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 2be1d6126ed161679e35c37d99aa17dbf60d6e20 It doesn t look like there is any strong correlation However if you omit Q1 data it looks pretty good Anytime review count decreases homes built decreases Anytime review count increases homes built increases Review count if anything underestimates the amount of homes built There s a spike in Q2 reviews so I d like to believe that will put the number of homes built at or above 3 500 But honestly I wouldn t bet on it just from this data VI The

amp s 0fde082909e67eee6c8b285eb235af665ecba755 A key aspect of this company is where they do business Yes again WEST AND CENTRAL 66 of their deliveries and 72 of their revenues are from CA WA TX and CO They re right in the middle of where the highest demand is and as such I believe this gives them an advantage in capturing higher average costs and margins than their competitors Another advantage is their early earnings schedule which is a full month before basically the rest of the industry except LEN I believe the market is slow to adjust prices on the whole industry until they see the bigger guys DHI PHM NVR TOL report first Luckily LEN reported before KHR and the results were exceptional That s enough for me Residential construction is currently going through a generational boom

This plays to their soy boy customer base millennial first time buyers They won the EnergyStar 2021 Partner of the Year Yeah there are actually like thirty companies that win this every year but nonetheless the stats are kind of neat gt Apr 13 2001 KB Home NYSE KBH today announced that it has been named an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award Winner for an unprecedented 11th consecutive year by the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA KB Home has built over 150 000 ENERGY STAR certified homes more than any other homebuilder in the nation These high performance energy saving homes are estimated to have cumulatively reduced utility bills for their homeowners by 800 million and CO2 emissions by 5 6 billion pounds the equivalent of removing nearly 557 000 cars from the road for one year It s kind of suspicious that they measure CO2 emissions in pounds because it s a gas so I have no idea how they managed to put it all on a scale But anyway apparently all of the high tech environmentally friendly crap they put in their houses cuts monthly expenses from 343 to 130 per month meaning their houses basically pay for themselves in 195 years or so ESG Crap

Back in Sep 2017 KBH CEO Jeffrey Mezger was recorded verbally destroying Kathy Griffin and her boyfriend Randy No Dick Bick http www huffingtonpost com entry kathy griffin jeffrey mezger kb home us 59c145aee4b0186c22061a67 after they called police multiple times to report a noise complaint against him The noise Mezger s three grandchildren playing in the pool In the audio you can hear Mezger declare war tell Mr Bick he s stuck with a bald dyke cunt apparently Griffin shaved her head and other fun shit Apparently Ms Griffin and Mr Bick had called police between 7 to 10 times in the past and in each case the complaints were dismissed with no further action required One of the times they called a noise complaint due to music being played during a ceremony where Mezger s niece who has stage 4 cancer was renewing her vows Due to the Griffin incident KBH ended up cutting Mezger s salary by 25 He never apologized though he regrets losing his temper and the language he used He also added Why the fuck would you record it and submit it to Huffington Post you insignificant attention whore Here s the WSJ s coverage of the ordeal https www wsj com articles kb home cuts ceos bonus over kathy griffin tape 1505993665 The top comment gt He deserves an award not a punishment Don t fuck with Mezger VII The Bet Welcome to my DD You probably just skipped down to here so let me summarize things for you TLDR again Housing demand is at 2005 levels during a major housing shortage that will take a decade to sort out Commodity prices don t matter buyers are paying and in fact that s what s costs so high Evidence HMI index at all time highs Housing starts at 2005 levels Orders way up And CEOs are saying costs are getting passed on without an issue The kicker LEN and KBH report a full month before all the other builders LEN reported last week and they blew out earnings and went up 10 and their margins went up despite commodity prices increasing The market didn t give KBH a similar boost and their earnings are coming up Wednesday which I can only assume will kick ass I ve also noticed that KBH tends to highly correlate with LEN and catches up to rather quickly The second kicker Builders peaked in share prices in May but got dumped down due to The Great Inflation Scare in mid May The thing is homes are considered inflation proof And literally every sign has pointed to better conditions now than in mid May Higher sentiment more starts and LEN crushed it Q2 Mar Apr May There is no end in sight to the demand These stocks are due for a repricing Like LEN I think KBH built a lot of houses this quarter took record numbers of orders and increased margins despite high commodity prices I think the market might get all excited after their earnings Wednesday after close If not then then in mid late July when all other builders report Catalysts Wednesday 10am June new home sales report comes out https www census gov construction nrs pdf newressales pdf Will it continue to smash Yes Will the market react I don t know KBH Q2 Earnings Wed after market close There is every indication home building was insane this quarter Highest 3 month building starts since 2005 All time high buyer sentiment And LEN crushed it Time elapses LEN and KBH have been tethered together for awhile and LEN just leaped up 10 I think KBH will follow Section IV Throughout July and August various residential construction companies report earnings A continued stream of positive earnings could be what the nervous market is waiting for before diving back in as they seem rather hesitant since mid May July 22nd DHI Q2 earnings July 22nd est PHM Q2 earnings July 22nd est MTH Q2 earnings July 23rd est NVR Q2 earnings July 26th est MDC Q2 earnings July 28th est BZH Q2 earnings Aug 15 est TOL Q2 earnings Longer term there could be more COVID there are concerns about the delta variant While another surge of corona could cause some panic in the market it would serve to bolster demand further if that s even possible KBH crushed it during COVID so I expect they d crush COVID 2 0 Bets This is not financial advice and I m gay and retarded I m into all sorts of crazy shit Single hung https www google com search q single hung window yeah double hung https www google com search q single hung window better Tongue and groove https en wikipedia org wiki Tongue and groove male couplings https www google com search q male couplings spider nuts https www google com search q spider nuts I love it all So you should really question my judgement and do your own research Once again I advise caution Do not YOLO Check prices IVs and wait for good entries If you can t snatch July calls at a decent price wait for things to calm down and go for August Or just celebrate pride month with some commons July Calls There are no FDs but July calls are fine They give some leeway for the market to understand commodity prices don t matter inflation doesn t matter and that people are ordering and building houses at an astounding rate and will continue to do so In my opinion the IVs are reasonable in the mid 40s If the stock hits 50 which I see as entirely possible it s multi bagger August Calls Suitable if you do not have faith KBH will catch up to LEN short term or if you do not have faith the earnings will play favorably This allows you an extra month to capture the wave of builder earnings coming in July which could provide the sufficient confirmation of they are building a lot despite commodities and inflation that the market needs to send these stocks up There s also some rotation of growth to value potential here Shares The backlog is massive and growing faster and faster COVID 2 0 or not inflation or not people are buying homes and KBH stands to run alongside this current housing bull run I think shares are a pretty safe play at least until 50 My positions Jul 16 calls 44 48 Aug 20 Calls 50 Lots of commons gay pride month

my word for any of this I suggest you all Trust but verify Similar to my first DD Energy Transfer ET which has done quite well btw I m not going to mention short interest because you should invest in shit for better reasons my personal opinion Ternium TX Background As any quality DD begins lets start by explaining basically who Ternium is Ternium TX is Latin America s leading flat steel producer with an annual crude steel production capacity of 12 4 million tons TX operates in Mexico Brazil Argentina Colombia the southern United States and Central America through regional manufacturing facilities service centers and its own distribution network In addition TX participates in the control group of Usiminas a leading flat steel company in the Brazilian market Their customers range from small businesses to large global companies in the automotive home appliances heat ventilation and air conditioning HVAC construction capital goods container food and energy industries across the Americas TX s industrial system has various production technologies that provide a diversified cost structure based on different types of raw material and energy sources and a flexible production configuration The industrial system includes proprietary iron ore mines and processing facilities steelmaking facilities finishing facilities service centers and a broad distribution network to offer slabs billets hot rolled products cold rolled products galvanized and electro galvanized sheets pre painted sheets tinplate welded pipes rebars and wire rods as well as slit and cut to length products A large number of co products result from the steel manufacturing process These can be reutilized thus helping to reduce CO2 emissions In the latest years TX has achieved a 100 material efficiency and the number of co products resulting from the manufacturing processes has increased significantly Their steel then created utilizing both Electric Arc Furnaces and BOF Converters Blast furnace basic oxygen furnace uses iron ore as its base raw material that accounts over just 50 of BOF steel costs and electric arc furnace uses scrap as its base that represents around 75 of EAF steel cost The Basic Oxygen Steelmaking process differs from the EAF is that BOF is self sufficient in energy Fundamentals and Recent Accomplishments Developments P E 4 81 really fucking low which means it has room

Ternium expects a sequentially higher EBITDA in the second quarter primarily due to an increase in realized steel prices partially offset by higher cost per ton due to higher iron ore scrap and slab costs flowing through the company s inventories Following the pandemic induced decrease in steel consumption during the first half of 2020 an increased demand for steel has outpaced the speed of the recovery in global steel production This has driven a significant increase in steel benchmark prices around the globe over the last nine months Iron ore benchmark prices are also reaching multi year highs The company currently expects these conditions will tend to normalize during the second half of 2021 Ternium expects the commissioning of its new hot rolling mill in Mexico during June 2021 with ramp up during the second half of 2021 will contribute to increase its market offering in this scenario with an expanded product range and improved productivity levels in its industrial system Ternium anticipates sequentially higher realized steel prices in Mexico in the second quarter of 2021 as prices in the USMCA market continue to increase and quarterly contract prices reset Ternium also expects volumes in Mexico to increase in the second quarter with strong demand from exports driven industrial customers and steady activity in the commercial market Catalyst Biden Infrastructure Plan

shorted worth 194m and 28 of the float Low float of 15 5 million shares Low low volume 10 day avg volume is 520k days to cover is 8 32 Share lock up expiration on July 12th could serve as a major catalyst for stock Strong fundamentals Ask your wives and girlfriends if they use POSH Consumer behavior in millennials and Gen Z favors second hand items which will grow the resale market to 64 billion by 2024 Depop was recently acquired by Etsy for 1 6 billion Depop was valued at 23 price to sales vs POSH which is currently at 12 price to sales There are several short squeeze plays out there but its has been a lot of fun Reddit has changed the game and has brought shorts to their knees through perseverance and true retardation Now it is great that Reddit has moved stocks and that the actual company has been given a second chance at life due to the frenzy But what is even better is buying a growing company that will be able to take advantage of the changing consumer behaviors of Gen Z I E Posh Mark Now I have been bullish on POSH for several months after I read some very good DD on WSB and then speaking with my younger family members who absolutely love the app Now I know that most of you are male millennials and virgins which are not exactly the key Poshmark demographic But I can almost guarantee if you speak with the younger generation you will find there is a deep love for the app and that the average user spends more than 27 minutes a day on it amp x200B Fundamentals There are several key macro factors that play into the Poshmark story First more and more Gen Zs are entering the workforce and are rapidly gaining spending power and they are also influencing their parents buying behaviors with 85 of parents saying their children influence their purchases according to 2019 National Retail Federation survey Furthermore a study by Bain found that 60 of Gen Z s consumer behavior is influenced by reducing their environmental footprint and is a top reason they gravitate to resale companies They are also driven by purchasing goods at discounted prices Second they are the largest player in a growing market space The second hand resale market is expected to grow to over 64 billion by 2024 just in the U S and is expected to grow at a 39 annual rate between now and then Poshmark currently operates in the US Canada and Australia They have international expansion in mind meaning they have not even scratched the surface of the total addressable market Third the shift towards social commerce For you that don t use the app it feels like a social media app that allows you to shop for goods This keeps buyer and sellers addicted to the platform and is why the time spent on the app is over 27 minutes per day per user The average per instagram user is 30 minutes The social media feel of the app also provides current and future opportunities to provide a platform for influencers to market within that app which is a large driver of consumption with Gen Z Fourth POSH runs an asset light business model where they provide a platform to bring sellers and buyers together for a fee Now this is important fro several reasons but the most important point is that their model is extremely scalable POSH is a market place that does not hold inventory This model requires little to no large capital expenditures when expanding into different countries or adding products on the platform like pet home goods and baby products This gives them a competitive advantage over competitors like Thread Up Valuation Depop was recently acquired to by Etsy for 1 6 billion In 2020 Depop had 70 million in sales from 30 million users in 150 countries They were valued at 23 price to sales multiple Vinted another reselling app was just valued at 4 5 billion with a 13 country and 45 million user base in the most recent funding round POSH had 262 million in sales in 2020 and is currently valued at 12 price to sales ratio They have operations in 3 countries with about 6 5 million active users They also have about 15 market shares of the resale market with 1 1 billion of gross merchandise value What does this mean It is evident that POSH has a more loyal valuable user base because they are able to monetize their users more effectively with each active user contributing 40 to the top line vs Depop which only earns 2 33 of revenue from each active buyer POSH has only penetrated 3 countries leaving hundreds of million users yet to be reached Just comparing the price to sales of POSH and Depop POSH should be trading at least 2x higher There are other factors like future growth in the US and internationally The stock and technicals Now that stock IPO d at over 100 and was quickly shorted into oblivion and bottomed five months later at 33 It has recovered since then but still has a short over over 28 The float on POSH is about 15 million and the SI is about 4 33 million shares according to Ortex and has been growing ever since the IPO The cost to borrow has been slowly creeping up to 3 66 The utilization rate has been above 80 for the past week and hit 100 last week meaning there are very few shares left to short There were 3mm shares short when the stock bottomed last at 33 last month The stock is currently trading at 45 so there are likely several shorts underwater The volume is super low on this stock with 520k shares on average traded over the past two weeks This leaves the days to cover ratio at 8 3 This is also puts the shorts in a bad position where they are unable to close out their positions without sending the stock flying To expand on this point any buying pressure or positive catalyst will send the stock flying as well amp x200B https preview redd it 2we61cuqgv671 png width 1914 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b4d8e2b82981144f3852b3c64b6c0fae74dd709a amp x200B The catalyst Currently since the volume is so low they cant close their shorts without significant price movement to the upside What they are banking on is a large chunk of newly available shares to close their positions after the share lockup expiration on July 12th This could serve as the catalyst for the stock to jump higher if insiders do not sell The stock will jump as the short sellers will have to purchase shares from the existing low float and volume to close Personally I do not believe insiders will sell at these levels for two reasons One the macro trends in consumer behavior are favorable to their business model If POSH can maintain their current market share of around 15 and the market for resale goods hits 64 billion in three years POSH could easily hit over 1 5 billion in yearly sales by 2024 If you were to apply a price to sales of 6 which half of the current P S you would have a market cap of 9 billion and this does not even include sales from the established market of Canada and growing market of Australia or any other market they decide to move into So why would I sell my shares today if it will be worth at least 3 times more in 3 years Second their stock IPOd at 42 and jumped to over 100 The stock is only trading at 45 If i knew that someone was willing to pay over 100 six months prior why would I sell in the 40s This is similar to what happend to Doordash which jumped 14 on their lock up expiration The POSH chart also looks very similar to LMND pre lock up LMND ran from 60 to 181 after their lock up expiration Overall POSH is in a solid position to take advantage of changing consumer behaviors and will easily be a 3 bagger if not more in three years Position 6000 shares and some July 60c and Aug 70c

tumbled to a current share price of 48 I believe this represents an incredible opportunity to get in on a stock ticker with a proven track record of making huge gains I missed DKNG s initial runup in 2020 because I was skeptical of each new ATH but last week s Hindenburg report got me taking another look at the company and I love what I see Now one week later I ve finally finished my DD and am

can t place a bet on whether the Packers will beat the over But through DraftKings you can select players from the Packers for a temporary fantasy football team and then play that team in tournaments for money This is because most states consider fantasy sports a game of skill and not gambling But basically it s a loophole that allows a roundabout form of sports betting In 2018 the U S Supreme Court struck down the federal sports wagering ban and that same year DraftKings released DraftKings Sportsbook which allows users to place sports bets through an app in states where online betting is legal The company is looking to leverage first mover advantage and name recognition to become the predominant betting company in the United States by capitalizing on the mobile market DraftKings

DraftKings during the fall winter If online betting were legal in our state I m sure we d all be using their sportsbook too Think about it DraftKings and FanDuel have essentially created a gateway app to a gambling addiction via daily fantasy sports The Legalization Of Betting This is huge Since 1992 sports betting has been illegal in most of the U S But after the Supreme Court s ruling in May 2018 13 states have legalized online betting 7 others legalized betting at retail locations but have yet to legalize online betting 8 more states are expected to finalize legalization of some form of

represent over 27 of the entire U S population 1 In Florida Gov Ron DeSantis has signed a new compact with the Seminole Tribe that would bring statewide mobile wagering although betting won t begin until at least mid October It is anticipated that DraftKings will be able to at least secure a pari mutuel contract with the Seminole 2 Texas had a sports betting bill submitted this year but it likely won t be considered until the 2022 legislative session There are no legal casinos in Texas so it s expected that Texan gambling would include an online component 3 The L A Times reported last month that California voters will decide on November s 2022 ballot whether to allow sports betting It s uncertain if the measure will tether betting to tribal casinos like some other states or whether it will also allow online wagers Revenue Earnings and Outlook DraftKings is experiencing rapid revenue growth with one ARK analyst stating the firm believes sports betting revenues will be 18x by 2025 Q1 2021 earnings were 312m an incredible 252 69 year over year increase That revenue figure beat analyst projections by a thicc fucking 32 Below is a chart comparing DKNG with some other growth stocks

Despite incredible revenue growth DKNG has had abysmal EPS showings In Q1 2021 they reported a loss of 0 87 per share which was 60 worse than analyst estimates So how does this company that boasts massive revenue growth manage to lose so much money Advertising and customer acquisition costs Eilers amp Krejcik Gaming estimated similar company FanDuel s spends about 68 per daily fantasy sports customer acquired However they also estimated that FanDuel made 100 per season off each acquired customer So the upfront cost is big but the profit margin is about 47 the first year and then 100 each season after that DraftKings is competing against FanDuel and Barstool Sportsbook to become the industry leader in the new world of online betting so the customer acquisition cost of sportsbook gamblers is likely at least twice as much But DKNG has to be aggressive to immediately establish themselves as the premier sportsbook among new gamblers and being aggressive means spending money So far it s been very successful https preview redd it 7kiby2sxnv671 jpg width 1000 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 1dce1d5cedfbe14e31f93d838c67c3317ec35889 In Q1 2021 Monthly Unique Payers MUPs increased 114 year over year which was about a 60 larger growth rate than projected This means the aggressive approach is working and while it costs a lot to acquire a user once you have them you have them for years Unlike costs such as website upkeep user acquisition can be scaled back eventually which means DraftKings is expected to translate their massive revenue into monster earnings by decade

pjpg amp auto webp amp s 4de5b03f7b048e0c956728876baa56cffb99a8bc Let s finally get the big flaming blimp in the room out of the way On 6 15 2021 Hindenburg Research published a reasearch note titled DraftKings A 21 Billion SPAC Betting It Can Hide Its Black Market Operations Hindenburg s most notable allegation is that SBTech a Bulgarian company that merged with DraftKings as part of it s SPAC process generates roughly half their SBTech s revenue from markets where gambling is banned I can t believe this even requires addressing SBTech s revenue accounts for a tiny portion of DraftKings total operations Who gives a fuck about this Certainly not investors Besides the fact that Hindenburg s allegations are poorly read not at all sourced DKNG has seen it s stock price soar because of U S legalization not because of SBTech s operations Additionally Hindenburg states that insider selling is a bearish sign Fuck off The stock rose over 300 in 2020 every corporation on the planet would have insiders who take profit after a run up like that News flash insiders selling for massive gains isn t a bad thing If you want to read a more complete takedown of the Hidenburg allegations I d

structure Since the federal ban on sports betting was struck down in 2018 many states have been hesitant to upset their tribal lobbies by legalizing online betting And some legislators whether true or only claimed believe that legalizing online betting would violate the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 IGRA Tribes have successfully lobbied in several states to limit sports betting to their established retail casinos As somebody who lives in one of these states I feel confident saying that this does not adequately service consumer demand So it s almost a given that some states will expand their laws at some point to allow online betting How many states is a big question A lot of analysts that I ve seen write speak about the coming widespread legalization of betting don t seem to fully understand the legal framework that could still limit DraftKings expansion The best case scenario may be for betting to be once again challenged in court this time either going after the IGRA or filing an anti trust lawsuit against the tribes I personally think DraftKings will have online betting available in the majority of states by the end of the decade but it is not a given like many analysts believe Just because betting is legalized doesn t mean DraftKings Sportsbook will be legal Analysts and Investors Love DKNG Use some common fucking sense this generation loves to gamble You

an ARK Invest analyst gt When we first started looking at the online sports betting space the realization we came to is this is a supply and demand issue in that there is definitely a ton of consumer demand but the supply has been held up by regulation and I would just add there that regulation is starting to favor more and more online sports betting So when you look at it as just a supply and demand issue this is definitely still very much the early days gt gt This past year was absolutely disastrous for sports You had the cancellation of tournaments you had shortened seasons But what we actually saw was an enormous growth in online sports betting The 18 billion dollars in total bets handled breaks down to around 1 billion in total revenue for 2020 We expect that to almost 18x in terms of we re going to go from 1 billion in revenue in 2020 to almost 18 billion in revenue by 2025 Investors know that while customer acquisition cost is high it s an upfront payment you make in order to acquire a lifetime customer in a high revenue industry If you think full legalization will bring a lot of new customers wait until 2030 when today s teenagers will have real jobs and start betting their paychecks on the bourgeoning e sports scene I know that seems like a long time away but the market won t wait until 2030 to start pricing that in https preview redd it f52ayiltqv671 png

is pricing in 7 5B in revenue max So if investors reach a consensus that aggressive analysts like ARK are right and revenue will grow to 18B a market cap of 50B would make more sense That s 125 a share or a 250 increase So why has the price fallen 34 since March The most likely answers are two factors 1 Profit taking after the huge runup in 2020 2 The giant miss on Q1 2021 earnings While the earnings miss likely scared away some investors who were hoping for a profitable business within the next few years most are in it for the long haul I know that if I was long on shares I frankly wouldn t give a single shit about the earnings I like to see the company being aggressive and spending money to dominate a giant growth industry from the go especially when acquisition has been so incredibly successful That should mean huge profits in the next decade This stock seems to have fantastic support around the level it s at now Granted it did kiss 40 in May but it rebounded back to 55

Plays Position and Price Targets There s three plays that make sense to me 1 Options are cheap so you could choose something medium length to capitalize on football season hype 10 15 60c are trading at 2 90 with a lot of open interest Sell when the price hits 70 again and you should get at least a quad bagger Take note though there s no guarantee football hype will be enough to drive the price above your break even point If you felt really risky 10 15 80c are 0 85 If the price hits 70 before the theta decay hits too hard like next month you could potentially make a ten bagger 2 My personal play is LEAPS 1 20 2023 60c are 11 55 You ve got plenty of time to let the stock consolidate and rally again This option leaves time for plenty of big catalysts to pop the price such as new legalizations football season March Madness and revenue growth A share price of 100 should net you a quad bagger maybe a lot more depending on how soon it happens 3 Shares is a great option here It
