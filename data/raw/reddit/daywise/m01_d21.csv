mortgage banking industry specifically I work with distressed debt portfolios and the utilization of Mortgage Servicing Rights as a financial hedge in mitigating credit losses I also enjoy thinking about the wider US economy because well I m autistic I guess I am on a bunch of Adderall and wanted to voice my rambling thoughts about a macro trend unraveling in the US housing market Since you like me are aimlessly scrolling through the vast news and information flows that rule our mind I am going to assume you have become aware of two things 1 With historically low rates mortgage applications are at decade long highs with lenders and processors working overtime and hiring like crazy We re talking massive growth even in established lending units at large financial institutions If you work in banking or finance you may likewise get inundated with scores of job openings for closers processors auditors compliance etc in medium to large sized mortgage origination operations 2 Due to the massive lasting unemployment in sectors ravaged by the current COVID pandemic there are tens of millions of American workers currently in distressed housing situations representing billions of dollars in unpaid mortgage and rent With federal moratoriums in place many debtors are protected by current orders from both foreclosures and evictions Millions of American homeowners have required prolonged payment deferments in order to prevent their mortgage from going in to default If you are not interested in reading a massive ramble about my thoughts on these two contrasting points I d advise backing out now Topic 1 is fascinating in itself and I would be happy to put together another post delving further into things like rates the effect on asset prices etc if there is demand However I want to focus on one key thing The increased volume of mortgage applications combined with a lack of new supply in the housing market is leading to extremely high asset prices and thus much larger mortgages This may seem all too familiar However my focus is on distressed debt or credit depending on how you look at it The number of loans that are over 90 days delinquent on their mortgage payments has been rising rapidly over the past several months as extended unemployment leaves unprotected borrowers further and further behind Currently in one portfolio the average borrower in a 90 day default had arrearage of over 5 500 00 When the COVID pandemic first struck the economy the US government instituted a policy that all of it s Government Sponsored Entities would offer up to a 12 month payment deferment to debtors This policy did not apply to private mortgages and while many private lenders did institute their own deferment policies for a period they have somewhat slowly begun proceeding legally on defaulted loans again in recent months Biden has just extended this moratorium through September of 2021 When a borrower defaults on a mortgage the lender s only recourse to re coup their credit loss is to execute a foreclosure on the property allowing the lender to take possession of the home and resell the asset using the proceeds of the sale to cover the losses incurred on the mortgage Executing a foreclosure takes substantial time and money even a completely uncontested foreclosure can take up to a year and cost say 5 000 00 in attorney fees alone with the moratoriums on foreclosures and evictions in place lenders have no way to take possession of their assets and resell them on them market costing even more time and money However there is nothing stopping lenders from doing everything but foreclosing evicting in the judicial process with just the final step of eviction being blocked Because of this the US has a HUGE number of cases piling up where as soon as the courts say Go we will see a torrent of evictions being filed likely hundreds of thousands as banks move to take possession of homes that are severely defaulted Theoretically the flood of new inventory on the housing market with potentially millions of more foreclosures and rental units apartments coming on the market once evictions resume as well should serve to b ring down the relative cost of housing in those markets to a proportionate degree In reality the only areas that have truly high rates of default and significant foreclosure action are already struggling areas dominated by industries flipped upside down by COVID Counties where families are earning less than the state s average where low wage service based jobs dominate entire towns that are reliant on single sectors like energy These individuals do not all live in houses that have benefitted from the rising tide of asset prices or else they would have already refinanced or sold to cure the default There are millions of Americans currently facing this reality and the reality of several million homeless desperate Americans see each day is that housing prices are at an all time high the stock market is soaring people are so comfortably wealthy that Peloton can become a thing I believe that if we do not do something NOW to address the root cause of what is truly a disgusting problem we are going to see a massive decrease in the quality of life in America massive unnecessary suffering and cause untold problems for the future of our country We could see a literal peasant revolt The only question now is what will the coming months look like Will we see a progressive revolution in the mortgage financing industry with sweeping new regulatory changes and massive homeowner relief programs Or will we see inaction and untold hardship Do massive financial losses come either way I have no idea of the answer to any of these questions though I do have my thoughts I m curious to hear yours TLDR PPL are fucked Edit

tomorrow,Obligatory disclaimer I am not an expert nor have I been doing this long I m also rather poor If you wish to award this post please also buy a GME share or something at Gamestop Obligatory emoji Obligatory position GME 266 shares 36 54 avg This is a repost with updates if this is not OK mods go ahead and delete I ll just edit the original amp x200B Before I get into this I need to say two things first One shorters will keep shorting they re in too deep Second they will also do their absolute best to make ANYONE ELSE sell or short too and they ve had years of practice on how to manipulate people and to use the media to do it including paid news articles Reason 1 GME is a mall store blockbuster no future will cite earnings reports Please see this very extensive Due Diligence DD https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kz7ygv gme dd one dd to rule them one dd to find them along with this fascinating new development https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kypuyb gme dd buildapc kiosks coming Also definitely worth an extensive read is this amazing DD on its own website https www gmedd com GME is on a trajectory to do some pretty cool things even without the short squeeze that has everyone excited Long buyers are in News people are starting to pivot more and more as of Wednesday they cannot deny the trajectory in the face of continued shorting amp x200B Most likely things they will cite are 1 Total sales declined 3 1 in the holiday sales report 2 Large 3rd quarter sales declines pre covid vs post covid the most likely cause 3 Closed 11 of stores which they did to cut underperforming stores and because their stores are FAR too dense especially given an increased focus on E commerce 4 Unavailability of consoles as if this has anything to do with Gamestop amp x200B Most likely things they will intentionally leave out 1 Comparable store sales increased 4 8 in holiday report so decrease above likely because of store closures 2 E commerce is at 34 of company sales equivalent to Best Buy percentage and growing rapidly and more rapidly than Best Buy 3 Regional sales in Australia New Zealand no covid went UP 31 amp x200B Reason 2 Insiders are selling This is true But here are the facts that they will leave out 1 12 21 1 13 21 Hestia Capital whose managing member is Wolf Kurt James sold 945 550 shares of GME for this reason in order to better align with the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital The fund still owns 91 000 shares and Wolf Kurt James PERSONALLY AND DIRECTLY still owns 50 689 including 20 000 of his wife s shares Also 1 13 21 Dunn Lizabeth sold 5 000 shares of GME She still owns 57 258 1 13 21 1 15 21 Raul J Fernandez sold 31 119 shares of GME He still owns 29 289 updated 1 13 21 Kathy P Vrabeck sold 50 000 shares of GME She still owns 79 537 The forms regarding the previous 3 people s sales were all filed by Dunn Lizabeth suggesting that they sold as a coordinated choice Also all three of those people are NOT on the Board of Directors as proposed by RC Ventures and conditionally agreed to by Gamestop an agreement they ll almost definitely keep given the huge increases in share price upon RC Ventures buy in and policy changes that RC Ventures has strongly suggested recommended Source SEC Filings https sec report Ticker GME amp x200B Reason 3 Some form of WSB bashing 1 They will likely ascribe most if not all of the upward trajectory of Gamestop to WSB This is not entirely false this subreddit the repeated DDs on it and people s rabid attention has indeed contributed to the upward trajectory This is the age of the individual investor though and the way media works has changed There is nothing shady or inappropriate about large groups of people believing in something and then pursuing and or betting on its success This is exactly what the MM s do the difference is that they have few people moving lots of money and WSB has lots of people each moving a little money 2 Y all have been rude AF Not saying anything against it I m just saying that there will be backlash to the kind of savagery we ve seen against Citron and Melvin in the past few days They will call you rabid they will call you crazy idiots they will call you insane gamblers they will imply but never say on air that you are autists and retards and in some most cases they ll even be right However I hope that anyone reading this who isn t a WSB fanatic will recognize that the movement of this stock while inspired by such fanaticism is not based on some rabid fanaticism alone See 1 see the hundreds of tickers posted here every day amp x200B Reason 4 The short squeeze has already happened 1 Now here I expect them to throw up some fancy crayon data analysis looking at shares shorted or available to short or short interest of daily trading or fees to short and try and pretend like that number really means that the shorts have already covered Here s the important data there s some in the DD in 1 as well First Short interest was higher than float as of EOD Friday https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kzwo2z gme short interest declined to 71m and some other and still higher than float at EOD Tuesday https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments l18jvw gme short interest update 703m shares short meaning there is an absolutely obscene of shorted shares a high number is often cited as 20 30 we re at 100 We ll see updated numbers for EOD Wednesday in the early morning Short interest actually INCREASED during the Wed Thurs time that Citron was originally saying was the short squeeze Now these are Ortex estimates based on the self reported shares short at a large aggregate of brokerages but have been very reliable when compared to the official SEC data that comes out every half a month Important Update here based on re analysis The of shorted shares from Wed Fri was approximately 71 4M approximately the current of shares short Citron s analysis will say that shorters have COVERED their original shorts and what we are seeing now are NEW shorts at higher price points less pressure I think they are partially correct However 1 Shorters will have wanted to drive down price on Wed onward This means that the shorted shares are not necessarily new opened shorts that are still open but may have been temporary shorts that were covered on the same day We have seen a lot of temporary shorting in the past few days so at least some of the shorts were due to this In fact I expect that a very large number of those 71 4M shorted shares were temporary shorts based on the number of shares sold short each day over the past few months millions per day and the overall changes in the total number of shorted shares over the same period almost none relatively 2 Shorts have been re opened The difference between their loss on a new short after covering an old short or from holding the original short is the difference in price between those two shorts could be as high as 20 but that s only for some of the shorts However the fact that a similar level of short float exists today means that the EXACT SAME potential for a short squeeze is present even if these are new shorts but the pressure is somewhat lower as the current price MIGHT be closer to the short price 3 With GME s current trajectory even if we discount Wednesday s meteoric rise and just look at the last 6 months even those hypothetical higher price point shorts are still in significant danger If they weren t we wouldn t be seeing this huge pushback from media and such aggressive market manipulation see Tuesday s 2x1M share sell offs BONUS It s important to note that the borrowing fees while not insignificant are reasonably trivial for a large institution It amounts to something like 0 03 per day per share even at 30 on a 40 stock They can hold for a month and if they make 1 per share they re still up However this adds up Also eventually the broker will need to fill real share buy orders and can force an immediate sale Finally if trajectory continues to go up it just stops being worth trying to short it and someone will start a selling chain driving up price amp x200B Reason 5 More shares traded on some days than are short Meaning days to cover is not close to accurate This is absolutely true Days to cover is based on an average of the daily volume over the past few days What they will say is that because daily volume is higher then shorts can cover very easily Here s three reasons I disagree 1 the volume shorted over the past week has consistently been around 20 of the daily volume Therefore we can discount 20 of the volume as that has no net effect on the number of shorts 2 any increase in volatility of a stock will lead to increased trading That means more sellers but also more buyers The days to cover metric is based ONLY on volume That means that it assumes that every share bought is bought to replace a shorted share That is unlikely to ever be the case especially in today s market which is saturated by retail investors because of trading apps They re using 1900s math in 2021 3 Trading volume has actually been decreasing since last Wednesday while short hasn t changed so current volumes will mean more time to cover again compared to last Wednesday even though days to cover isn t the greatest measure So this is less and less in the shorters favor as volume decreases and we have a similar short float So what will happen THIS IS A GUESS But based on the sudden vanishing of shares available to short at IKBR at approximately the same time as the Citron announcement on Tuesday I suspect tomfoolery In addition Citron just started doing these twitter Live things two days ago Yes GME wasn t the first one but it s still a very recent new thing At the same time GME has had some barefaced manipulation these past few days on this sub and elsewhere in the media not to mention the likely months of naked shorting https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments ky9mu0 gme comrades 115 update 27 consecutive days on Citron also conveniently decided to delay their twitter live for the inauguration as they were hoping for a higher viewership or potential viewership which makes perfect sense but still seems strange that on the SECOND LIVE TWITTER THEY DID for the good of their viewers THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE ELECTION None of this happened yesterday because yesterday was a slightly lower volume day than usual and their strategies to drive down price require maximum exposure If they re very aggressive and trigger SEC Rule 201 again they re limited in their shorting options on the next day Option 1 we have a repeat of Friday where shorters will try to immediately and early smash down GME price in hopes that it will keep going down after starting that trajectory They can do this because SEC Rule 201 is not active so they can short on a downtick again Option 2 Shorters will first allow stocks to rise as they did Tuesday Then at around 11 30 1 hour GME will start to tank rapidly potentially due again to some big 1M share sells If it was me I would time it and hit it very hard so it hits 10 for the day the furthest they can push it by shorting on downticks as close to the Citron announcement as possible with the hopes that that livestream will then push retail shorters to short more or paper handers to sell Remember due to puts expiring Friday there is likely significant pressure on shorters to drive price below 35 or as close as they can asap Option 3 Small but steady downward pressure in the hopes of making retail investors get bored and leave so that the stock price goes down Gamestop will also announce an influx of new consoles sometimes tomorrow This helps push stock up and I bet they time it to be right before Citron s twitter live if they can and my personal hope is that there s something unexpected about this influx of new consoles perhaps a larger number than usual due to a new deal but I don t expect this to have a super huge effect

brightest idiot in the lot but after continuously scrolling through the EV hype and other news on Ford and GM etc I decided to do some light dd for to get a glimpse of the future of the EV and other automotive hype and try to plan some possible plays based on what I found Currently No Positions in any automotive stonks or much of anything other than fighting for GME at the moment Background No financial background I m just a failing engineering student who washes dishes to gamble his way out of debt Rockets for the autists Please give me feedback good or bad 1 Ford and GM are not Tesla but they can be damn close They do not have a space division or Tunneling company to influence their stock price They are more focused on the automotive industry This can be good to be zeroed on making good vehicles but all of the chips are in on their vehicles performing to expectations A slip up like the Tesla fire can be a real threat to our short term gains Additionally their CEO s Jim Farley and Mary Barra don t meme their stocks so don t expect blessings from the lord On the other hand A ton of R amp D and public rallying behind EV has already been done for them by Musk and smaller EV brands they just have to perform well to compete We know how much Elon wants to standardize his charging plugs for his cars and any upcoming compatibility news between brands is a 2 Current supply shortages I ve seen the news that Subaru had to cut its production back due to the global shortage of semiconductors It is important to remember that not just the auto industry is going green Look at the price of lithium stocks recently and rare earth stocks Other industries like green energy farms Solar Wind Tidal are also popping up and need these resources As we are starting to break away from Covid 19 hurting business and people start to get back to work and buy things like cars Ford and GM were up on quarterly earnings through Covid regardless a greater demand for cars more specifically EV vehicles may drive demand past supply of said vehicles This in turns leaves a shortage and Car EV prices to increase How can people buy new cars if there are no new cars to buy On the other hand As the shortage of supply becomes more and more apparent in the market There will be a balancing force to restabilize I see this as increased efforts at recycling metals and plastics as well as new mining operations for precious metals This is very much in line with the going green policy and some of it now even now begins to take place Lucky for us lithium is a pretty abundant resource also so I am not worried about battery shortages Check newest PLL and LAC mining agreements 3 Industry and the market adapting in the coming years I know a lot of you retards aren t in this for the long haul but this may affect you if you are in it long enough to see these cars come to fruition This kind of goes with the last one in regards to keeping price down so people can buy As manufactures begin to struggle to source a supply of materials a shift in design is going to have to occur to maintain sales I see this shift as being new smaller lighter vehicles focused on efficiency as a majority of production but EV SUV s and Pickups definitely still being on the menu based on the success and sentiment of Tesla s larger vehicles and other SUVs Pickups in general On the other hand Companies like Ford and GM don t have to rush into an all EV lineup they ve been making gasoline vehicles and can will continue to do so as the market continues to shift to EV This still gives them a source of revenue and should keep the earnings reports positive even as supplies for EV development are scarce If I were to go in what would I do One of these options 1 I run as far away from these as possible 2 Go for the low commit play I would buy into the hype early I m broke right now because of GME yolo but I could get in like 50 60 shares unstressed We may see a discount on 1 21 with the Tesla fire to go in on Ford for the Rivian Potential Hold till any more news hits then scram not pussy paper hand news like OMG Ford is a dead brand will be back to 8 easy I m here for gainz 3 Buy some calls I m not really fluent in options so pardon my retardation but this could be a learning experience given the potential once I do some catching up and get some more gains than just buying shares If you do not know anything about options do not trade options Then again this is r wallstreetbets and I m not your wife s bf 4 Actual smart investment I m kind of in this with GME and looking past the meme and hype train and see some actual potential for these stocks and for GM and Ford to get their shit together Jim Farley seems promising for Ford to make a difference and anyone with half a brain cell wants to get a piece of Tesla s EV pie I really believe that Ford has an opportunity to transform itself from a company that makes metal dogshit into something to compete with Tesla and at the very least be worth more than 15 a share Thanks for your time and stay

Street Bets Explained Currently this sub is in an amazingly extraordinary situation GameStop has presented us with the opportunity for shareholders to increase their portfolios by 5 50x Today was a hard fought battle and it is impossible not to see the bullish case 1 Firms with billions had trouble keeping the price down We were merely 20 cents away from ending GREEN 2 Shitron s announcement caused the price to drop from 45 on Tuesday ending the amazing rally we had But guess what that means retards It got priced in I heavily doubt we will see a huge dip tomorrow If they even go through with their conference Fuck most of us will be the ones watching it Who has time to watch a no name investment company led by a criminal explain how much smarter they are than everyone else Only thing I m worried about is a coordinated bear attack and market manipulation 3 Citron and Melvin Capital have enemies As explained in an earlier post that was deleted a firm commented on a tweet that these companies have many enemies who see GME as a huge opportunity to a make a fuck ton of money while b fucking over the companies that fucked over them 4 With no POSITIVE news we have been able to hold the line and not allow the price to dip drastically Each day that we hold is another day the shorts lose money They re coming to an end it is just a matter of when 5 Catalyst opportunities that may trigger the mother of all short squeezes multiple of these occurring on the same day will seal the deal Ryan Cohen tweets literally anything GameStop comes out with a Press Release GameStop delves into their new vision for the company pulled out of conference 2 weeks ago roughly when short squeeze info started to gain a lot of attention allowing Cohen and Co to decide when it is most beneficial to release the new vision This is CRUCIAL Ryan Cohen has the power to release this plan at any moment and you sure has fuck can bet he will do it when it s most appropriate He s a genius for god sake Ryan Cohen buys the remaining 7 7 of shares allowable by his contract Burry tweets in support of GameStop and or ups his stake A new Large Institutional Investor joins in spite of Melvin Capital and Citron Implications of this are massive and Tendies would actually rain from the sky Old white fucks hate being shit on by other old white fucks We just need one old white fuck to seek revenge and maybe bring a couple buddies with him buy several hundred thousand shares and effectively end the short positions in GameStop A current Institutional short flips I love this catalyst a lot because it may trigger a chain reaction causing the others to flip Personally if I m the head of a company shorting GameStop right now I would flip immediately By flipping you are taking control of the squeeze and deciding it s timeline for maximum profits Stubborn shorts like losing money apparently A smart short would say Hey I m losing a lot of money Let s flip tell some other shorts our plan flip together and trigger the squeeze Let s dump our losses on the remaining shorts and make it rain Tendies and autistic hookers The amount of potential catalysts and bull ammo is simply mouth watering I would sell my left nut if it meant I could buy more GME shares Now back to the Potential Power of Wall Street Bets When the squeeze occurs if we have unified and people aren t getting sidetracked by fucking BB this sub will be very wealthy I am dead serious The amount of power we will have is something that many should consider We will most likely become audited if the moass goes through and everyone here held the line and profited It will become dangerous to promote stocks on WSB because of the sheer liquidity of our members Say the squeeze happens within next two weeks and all holders of GME in the sub have increased their portfolios by 5 50x That s a lot more fucking money Now imagine if our hive minds then drifted to Blackberry or Palantir You fucking name it We ve already done exceptional with the little money we have in our Robinhood accounts With actual power to really move markets the sheer willpower of this sub and hive mind retardedness is something we shall strive for Within two weeks Blackberry will probs trade at around 15 20 a share Once GAmestop gang returns from Saturn we all pay the tax men while most since some of you guys are autistic Gamestop gang will ride the Battle Bus to victory and increase our net worth even more I ve seen a lot of posts lately like I have 500 what should I invest in After the gamestop trip to Saturn and around the galaxy those posts will turn into Have around 50k to play around with any suggestions The opportunit s for growth from that point will become endless and institutional investors will no longer see us as just Robinhood warriors They will be forced to appeal to us and our retardedness This has the potential to turn into a French Revolution of the investment world but only if we all play our cards right

week after seeing all the memes Opened a Robinhood account last Thursday so now I am officially an autist Good fucking job at rallying a whole media platform with memes and monologues filled with homoerotic slurs amp x200B I am an avid gamer so I want to chip in and give you my two cents on the state of the videogame market because I feel that there are a lot of DDs saying that GME is a brilliant play long term but without giving more information than they have a deal with Microsoft Ryan Cohen is a god when it comes to online retail and GME is going to build custom PCs in store For people that game a lot this information might be redundant but I wanted to inform the noob in gaming that is spending his mama s 401k Proof of my video game knowledge addiction Processing img f8c11qijcoc61 I have 102 games on Epic Game Store a few more on other platforms and I also play on PS4 Basically I have no life and play video games 24 7 with me I am not a native speaker Let s talk quickly about those rumors and infos Microsoft Deal https news microsoft com 2020 10 08 gamestop announces multiyear strategic partnership with microsoft https news microsoft com 2020 10 08 gamestop announces multiyear strategic partnership with microsoft Great now they are going to use Office 365 and Microsoft Teams But wtf were they using before then They are going to use Microsoft cloud based solutions it s not like they are building a cloud gaming service like the nearly dead Stadia I know they talk about the Xbox deal Xbox All Access which is a discount bundle to pay for the console and a 2 year subscription to their Game Pass First of all you must see that Xbox was not a hit in the previous console cycle Sony sold 113 5 https www sie com en corporate data html million PS4 and Xbox around 50 https www forbes com sites paultassi 2020 01 30 the nintendo switch may have just outsold the xbox one with a 35 year late start sh 10a3c14857e5 million consoles They are so ashamed of their numbers that they don t even talk officially about console sales anymore but Xbox lives users so they can bundle PC console and mobile users Even the Nintendo Switch who shouldn t even be part of the conversation has more sales at 68 30 https www nintendo co jp ir en finance hard soft index html million Right now there is a big shortage of consoles so every time they hit the stores they are gone within hours so I am not sure the deal is really increasing their sales Everybody is trying to get their hands on a console no matter if it s from GME or another retailer I am not going to take a dump on Xbox yet because they have a good argument the new Xbox Series S cost only 299 99 for lower graphical capabilities and no optical disc drive Which is a trend since the PS5 has a digital edition for 399 99 with no optical disc drive Both constructors are pushing to go the digital route which goes in the direction that our god RC is advocating for With this lower price point Xbox might increase their share and with the exclusive deal make more sales through GME But you must understand that this deal is a double edged sword for GME For those who are not familiar with Xbox Game Pass it is basically Netflix for Games You have a monthly subscription and you get access to a full catalog of games that you can download and play Which means that you don t need to buy games So GME would potentially sale Xbox to users who will not buy games for 2 years Build custom PC in store https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kypuyb gme dd buildapc kiosks coming https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kypuyb gme dd buildapc kiosks coming The only chain that does that that I know of is MicroCenter maybe some people on r buildapc or r buildapcforme could come up with other stores but they are probably smaller which could give GME a big advantage since it has way more stores On the other hand online there is a plethora of options between hardware manufacturers like NZXT Corsair Asus or PC builders like Dell Alienware Digital Storm Maingear Origin Falcon Northwest even fucking Wallmart everybody is doing it Right now is not a good time to build a PC hardware prices are going through the roof because of manufacturing problems due to COVID 19 new gen consoles China tariffs increasing demand scalpers Check r hardware most posts are about the fact that there is a CPU and GPU shortage that has been going on for months now My take is that most people that were on the fence between console and PC are going to go for console since the price is so attractive and after the normal hardware price resumes they are probably not going to want to spend thousands on a gaming PC Ryan Cohen is an e commerce god Yes that is true but what is more important he is a meme god Digital shift Now let s talk about what I really wanted to talk all of you about Digital game sales Some here on their DD talk about it like it s a pot of gold Of course it s true according to the latest estimate the video game industry made 174 9 billlion https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1326380 000101359420000821 rc13da3 111620 pdf in 2020 but 85 of that comes from free to play games and their in game purchase model GME can t get on that action so how much of the other 15 can they take considering the heavy players that are already involved Console According to this review https www wepc com news video game statistics https www wepc com news video game statistics Playstation has around 60 of the console market and Sony with the PS5 and the digital edition without an optical disc drive at a lower price is trying to reel in their users to the Playstation Store which is the only place where you can buy digital games for their console So long term Sony s move is to have all their users only buy from their store Or a monthly subscription just like Xbox with Xbox Game Pass but it s called PS Now Xbox is not making digital games exclusive to their store right now but they could pull that move later since they are also pushing to remove the optical disc drive from their console That is why I feel like the console and digital games sales are not a great alley for GME since Xbox and Nintendo could make the game s purchase exclusive to their store which Sony is already doing and the subscription based gaming would also decrease GME s game sells PC PC gaming for those who don t know has been digitalizing games for a while The main force for that has been Valve the video game developer and publisher behind the popular game Half Life who created Steam in 2003 Steam is a digital distribution platform where you can buy download and launch games and your digital library is tied to that platform Other video game developer and publisher have launched their platforms around 2010 with a library limited to their games contrary to Steam who sells more than 30 000 different games Ubisoft Connect formerly UPlay for Ubisoft Main franchise Assassin s Creed Battle net for Activision and Blizzard Call of Duty Origin for EA Games FIFA GOG for CD Projekt The Witcher and CyberPunk 2077 It is hard to gauge the number of active PC gamers since they overlap on so many platforms I see a lot of articles that throw 1 X billion but let s be more realistic According to steam review of 2020 https store steampowered com news group 4145017 view 2961646623386540826 https store steampowered com news group 4145017 view 2961646623386540826 They have around 120 million monthly active users There are probably more PC gamers with people playing exclusively certain games like Fortnite League of Legends that are not on steam But considering that 50 of the game developers develop for PC I would assume there is the same amount of PC users and console users So it s a big chunk of customers that GME could get But let s face it the only platform that compares to steam has been launched 2 years ago Epic Game Store and they are spear headed by Fortnite a game they developed According to this article https www eurogamer net articles 2020 06 23 epic games store hits 61m monthly active users https www eurogamer net articles 2020 06 23 epic games store hits 61m monthly active users they boast 61 million active users and this article from last year would suggest that their revenue is generated at 3 5 by Fortnite in game revenue https www theverge com 2020 1 14 21064951 epic game store users number cross play revenue valve steam https www theverge com 2020 1 14 21064951 epic game store users number cross play revenue valve steam Epic Game to be able to compete with Steam that on top of a digital distribution platform has a lot of features with a mobile app hardware VR chat game reviews forums game guides streaming gives away one free game per week have a lower cut on sold games than steam and make one year exclusive deals with some game developers With all that they have 50 of Steam monthly users And most of their revenue come from Fortnite a game they produced Some other platforms I mentioned above tried to fight steam and removed their games from the platform and sold exclusively on theirs but most now reverted back to selling on steam like EA or the latest one Windows with the rerelease of Halo and Age of Empires II I feel like big game companies don t care that much about the revenue from game sells but more about in game sales or subscriptions a la PS Now or Xbox Game Pass GOG is another interesting player it has more of a niche following since they focus on old games and sell DRM free copies For the non initiated it means they can be played without using their platform You can download the game install and keep it on you hard drive for later use In that context I don t see how GME could get in this sector considering they are not coming in with a popular game of their own and would have to create a platform from scratch And now my last point Online video games retailers Their main business is to sell game keys for a specific digital distribution platform Steam Epic Games GOG You redeemed those keys to the right platforms and you get your game I have used a bunch myself Humble Bundle Fanatical GreenManGaming Voidu Gamesplanet WinGameStore But there is literally 30 of those retailers Just check out r GameDeals or go to isthereanydeal com https isthereanydeal com From the shear number of retailers competing on this market there is a sale every other week and you can find 95 of games at 50 or below 6 months after release Some of those retailers have interesting incentives For instance Humble Bundle has on top of a store a monthly subscription for 9 selected games a month and a 10 discount on their store Fanatical does mystery bundles where you pay a small amount and get a bundle of random games sometimes you are lucky sometimes not that much It has star deals heavily discount price for a limited number of keys And all of them make bundles of games for cheap price and cashback deals to keep you spending on their stores My point is for the little info and rumors we have on GME s plan for their digitalization I just don t see them making an entrance in the digital game market that would have an incredible impact TL DR Long term plan for GME is not detailed enough Consoles are pushing for digital sales that is already exclusive for Sony and or monthly subscription in a Netflix for video games business model Bad moment right now to build a PC hardware shortage driving price hike and consoles cheap in comparison Digital game market for PC has a humongous competition that has been in the sector for nearly 20 years Steam or 10 to 15 year for the other platforms and retailers Conclusion Buy more shares until we reach the

01 21 , Stocks rally as Biden and the Dems take the helm of the US Netflix crushes earnings while Jack Ma finally appears General Motors partners with Microsoft to develop their self driving tech Let s talk about this and other stock market news Hello everyone and Good Morning So let s start with the recap of the last 2 days as Tuesday we saw the stock market rally with the Nasdaq Composite https ibb co bR7cJ13 gaining over 1 5 the broad stock market SP500 https ibb co fXZYKRS rising by 81 and the Dow Jones https ibb co yhDLD82 Industrial gaining 116 points to finish the day as the VIX https ibb co kJPWrR3 dropped over 4 5 Over 60 of the companies https ibb co BT7vfL0 were advancing with over 200 new highs on above average volume as 8 of the 11 SECTORS https ibb co M7wNJ2Q finished in the green with Energy Communications amp Technology leading the way while Real Estate was the biggest laggard as growth companies were outperforming https ibb co zbgJRWC with small caps gaining more than 1 while Large Cap Value was the biggest underperformer HERE https ibb co Dbb47Jn is the HEAT MAP from Tuesday as you can see most big tech companies were gaining with Google Facebook amp Alibaba posting a gain of more than 3 while the biggest laggard was the consumer defensive sector Yesterday we also saw the broad stock market finish with all 3 major indexes at all time highs as the Nasdaq Composite https ibb co s3D1kvZ lead the way up almost 2 while the SP500 https ibb co 9hV9fhV gained 1 36 and the Dow Jones https ibb co 5B3r1D5 rose 257 points as we saw the VIX https ibb co P9mtRCH dropping more than 7 after the removal of this big political event We didn t see that many companies advancing yesterday https ibb co zZzFY6b with only 57 of them gaining on average volume though 10 of the 11 SECTORS https ibb co cTszSd6 finished in the green with Communications leading the way after a huge spike in Netflix while the Financial sector was the only one to lose ground as Large Cap Growth companies outperformed https ibb co 8mVHFyx the rest of the market with Large Cap value play finishing the day down almost 1 Here is the HEAT MAP https ibb co LvGDryV from yesterday with all big tech names gaining over 2 as Amazon Google amp Netflix all gained more than 4 while the biggest laggards were seen in the banking amp biotech sectors We didn t get to much economic data in the past days with the most interesting one being the Redbook store sales https ibb co zPDB0pj which improved slightly over last week as the economic calendar was on pause awaiting the inauguration of the new US president Today https ibb co jgJ1frz we start getting more economic data as we start off with Jobless Claims early in the morning and close with the Money supply and the FED s balance sheet We have to see if last week was just a blip or if the jobless claims will continue to rise even more In some other stock market news we saw Netflix https ibb co 54tB18g miss the earnings share but beating both the revenue and especially the net adds of subscribers which came in at 8 5M vs the 6M expected as the biggest streaming platform has passed 200M subscribers Netflix spiked yesterday https ibb co B6zTrSp more than 16 and closed at an all time high as they have hinted at a sustainable free cash flow after 2021 as the company will no longer seek to raise debt and is expecting to start stock buybacks in the next years which will be a great positive for shareholders Another benefit is their pricing power https ibb co s93DdWz as they have just increased their most popular subscription plan by 1 and they can do this even further with minimum risk of losing to much of the subscriber base I really like 3 companies in this sector Netflix Disney amp Roku and I think you should own all 3 of them as this is the future while the old TV and cinema world is dying We also saw GM https ibb co hyb3GSB rising after entering a new strategic relationship with Microsoft This looks like a nice partnership between the two with GM using Microsoft s cloud computing to develop their Cruise venture which is a subsidiary of GM And on the other hand this deal will provide needed capital to Cruise to fast track their self driving tech while also making Microsoft GM s preferred public cloud partner I think GM is a very good play on the EV world with massive production capacity and good battery technology Tuesday https ibb co Q9JYY6D we saw Jack Ma finally show up after numerous speculations of his disappearance This is finally some good news for Alibaba and the shares are up over 6 since the spotting after those speculations led to a continued sell off in the stock as investors feared China s Government implications around the company Alibaba is still a great company that will remain one of the biggest e commerce companies in this new world and that is still fairly undervalued right now Sports betting soared again after the latest reports of new records https ibb co KF1Wy78 in Pennsylvania with over 500M in wagers in December and is also expected to go live in Michigan on Friday https ibb co 9spwZMT Morgan Stanley also expects https ibb co 3CSLKFT more states to push to the legalization of sport betting even faster than expected I personally like companies like DKNG PENN amp WYNN in this sector and I am not planning on selling in the near future any of them We also saw investment banks crushing earnings in the past days with Goldman https ibb co 6rzBBNh crushing earnings by almost 5 and an increase of 18 y y in revenues while Morgan Stanley also BEAT https ibb co Lp3dJbp expectations with an EPS beat of 64 cents and an increase in revenues bigger by over 2B than expected I think the financial sector is pretty fairly valued right now after the huge run it has seen in the past months https ibb co k0wTBVn and it might only see another boost if rates go up but that will inversely affect the rest of the stock market so overall they might be a nice hedge against a potential rise in rates in the next years And one final thought is that I think staying invested in the markets is the best way to go as always Even if the market experiences a short term pullback or correction I believe this will be short lived It doesn t matter if we see tax increases or not it doesn t even matter who is president You should stay invested and look for the best opportunities in the markets HERE https ibb co 1QxtfSH is the average SP500 return since 1933 under each president and both averages are way above 5 for each party far exceeding inflation expectation for the future so stay invested look for the best companies and hold even through tough times and even look to add on any weakness in the markets Keep in mind that the SP500 https ibb co DKym45m return for the first 100days of a new president is usually very good with the last 3 terms returning at least 5 We can also see the DOW https ibb co VDG7vyC has returned over 10 on an annualized basis for each of the past 3 terms which is way over the historical average Biden has had the biggest rally https ibb co wYZKGmT between the election date and the inauguration date in the past 70 years so don t expect huge gains like we have had since March but do stay invested even if the markets start to see a slowdown Your money is better off being invested rather than siting in a regular bank account where they will do nothing So let s hope for a good day in the markets as the WORLD https ibb co 9Z075Fy markets seem to be pointing to another good day after Biden s inauguration and Janet Yellen s latest remarks on the economy and the need of big spending while the US FUTURES https ibb co rf6B1Z0 are also pointing to a green open with the DOW leading the way Thank you

outlining the incoming demo day for Palantir It is potentially going to be the single biggest event for the stock since inception I m also going to shed light on how PLTR can aid in vaccine distribution AKA a fatty contract with Uncle Sam Without further or due retards here is what that demo will entail and the optics for how that will affect Palantir s price Hint for all the retards that can t read What does Palantir do Palantir is a software company that allows big corporations and governments to consolidate data into one interface and create analysis on that data To go more in depth a company has incredible amounts of information and that number becomes unnavigable by an employee ass time goes on This is where Palantir comes in they source data from files emails license plate data weather reports Really the possibilities for input are endless and addressed when the software is tailored to a corporation With that data it searches for connections and can draw incredible conclusions based on that data This is the chance to invest in some big brother tier tech shit at an insanely discounted rate because BABY WE RE going LONG To emphasize how widespread the applications are here are examples Gotham was used during hurricane Florence to compound flood and active weather data to show the most at risk locations so they could rescue those first precedent for being used in disasters It is used in counter terrorism to create risk analysis for an individual Say that individual recently quit his job purchased questionable materials from a hardware store and is making a trip to a country where he has no connections That is how easy it is for Palantir to prevent terrorism based on information that is automatically entered into he system There is also speculation that Palantir tech helped find Osama Bin Laden and the CEO can t comment sounds classified Conclusion TAKE MY MONEY PLTR Now onto the Demo day 1 26 21 4 30 ET AKA Liftoff Intro Shyam Sankar Foundry Bianca Rahill John DiFulvio Gotham Demo Doug Philippone head of development Andy Elder and Martin Manville Also discuss NEW product Titan Apollo Demo Clark Minor Ali Mondro This is Palantir s annual demo Why is that important you might ask or worthy of being a catalyst for PLTR 2 Reasons 1 They are releasing Titan It is a direct upgrade of Gotham based on 10 years of learning Titan is going to be more performant open and proactive PAUSE Look carefully at those words performant and proactive Based on that and the fact that the Chief Operating Officer called it a force multiplier I am speculating that Titan will include a stronger AI integration If this is true Titan will be an exponentially more efficient system that requires less user input for final analysis Why is this important Palantir gives a lot of contracts that expire but leave the user with the old version of the software even if not renewed If Titan is such a pivotal upgrade of less user input AI integration and Greater magnitude hence open it will be a necessary upgrade and spur a new round of contracts And based on Palantir s fundamentals startup costs for new programs like Titan are higher than renewals so this means TENDIES ALL AROUND 2 Currently there is a certain element of unknown associated with Palantir and what exactly it does The only demo we have is from a much older platform and doesn t show all the features to the public I think a huge barrier to the excitement we have to this stock is that we have done our research and know what Palantir does As soon as this is exposed to the public it will be a game changer for the amount of attention Palantir is getting and thereafter the demand for Palantir shares This stock is not on most peoples radar because they do not interact with it as they do other brands The demo will be a blow to this aspect and increase interest from investors and demand from customers eager to upgrade to the new technology It is also going to give this company the traction it needs to MOON and finally retain those day gains If that wasn t enough for you Retards there s MORE We are now post inauguration of President Joe Biden He is eager to prove that he will handle the pandemic better than Trump did And has already signed a number of Executive Orders pertaining to Covid 19 policy The single best way for Biden to make this happen is quick vaccine distribution Here is where PLTR comes in Alexander Carp CEO recently interviewed with the Washington Post describing how Palantir can be used to distribute vaccine doses to maximum efficiency and to optimize limiting the spread of Covid 19 Earlier this year it signed a contract 25M with the Department of Human and Health Services to analyze Covid 19 data and give a path to the most effective vaccine distribution this program was called Tiberius If the Biden administration can make quick work of this vaccine distribution and make the US a model it will bring Tiberius to the forefront This will open the opportunity to license it other governments and also large healthcare companies such as chain doctors offices nursing homes etc to distribute their share of vaccines most effectively internally When this happens PLTR will Fucking Print This is an incredibly understated value we have a compelling shared interest with the brand new president The value that this has for the stock long is incredible It will put PLTR to the front of the line for contract renewals as a trusted agency that acted as a saving grace to the administration in the first of its 4 YEARS This on top of the fact that they have little competition to begin with means we will be looking through our telescopes to find the shares If nothing else our beloved Cathie Woods everything she touches basically moons just stocked up on a JUICY 498 000 Shares for her ARKK ETF Position 80 shares 25 TLDR Next Gen software catches bad guys and can also be used by businesses In bed with uncle Sam and Biden will keep it that way Tiberius Demo will increase demand on both sides and trigger new contracts so we can sit back and watch this baby PRINT

is to describe why I think Novavax NVAX will be releasing efficacy data in the next week and explain why I have decided to buy weekly options until data comes out for the biggest possible return tl dr 1 Data is coming in the next week 2 IV on options expiring next week is going to go through the roof on Friday afternoon 3 High likelihood of good data 4 Buy now For quick context as of today NVAX will be the 4th COVID vaccine to release Phase 3 efficacy data though they have already secured the most government contracts Currently Novavax is in a phase 2B trial in South Africa a phase 3 trial in the UK and a phase 3 trial in US Mexico The release of South Africa and UK efficacy data is imminent see reasons why I think data will be released next week below This data is a significant catalyst as up until this point no efficacy data has been released from NVAX other than non human primates which was best in class relative to competing vaccines As for what that data will entail there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic that I will not get into in this post I am a medical student and am more than happy to discuss further if needed but for starters I recommend reading the 4 posts by u Upstairs Speech on why NVAX is deeply undervalued and has a high chance of success The only thing I would add to their posts is the robust antibody response significantly higher than MRNA and PFE after 6 months as shown on slide 17 https ir novavax com static files 84a85933 d43f 438e 9dd3 32a023129da7 of their JPM presentation two weeks ago which as a result has gotten many immunologists excited We have seen the share price impact of released efficacy data before For reference Pfizer added 15B to their market cap after release of efficacy data in November and Moderna doubled its market cap in November from 30 to 60B NVAX has a market cap currently of 8B 16 that of Moderna and that includes the valuation for a separate influenza vaccine that completed Phase 3 in March 2020 I think a 40 immediate increase is reasonable following good data and I think NVAX will continue to grow to be multiples higher than current levels in a few months A 40 increase from current levels would take the share price to 175 which would net a 10x or greater return NVAX hit 190 share price last year after the primate data it could certainly go higher than 175 Here are the reasons why I think NVAX will provide data in the next week 1 At JPM s healthcare conference on January 11 their CEO said data would be in a few weeks and has repeatedly said data would be in early Q1 2 At the same conference their CCO said South Africa data would come first and UK would follow shortly after in late January early February but could be sooner due to the high burden of disease in those two countries Here are a couple recent news articles highlighting how out of control the situation is UK article https www businessinsider com covid 19 coronavirus uk variant cases 2021 1 and South Africa article https www theafricareport com 57277 south africa new coronavirus variant rages alongside vaccine finance debate 3 On January 13 the following South Africa news source https www pharmaceutical technology com comment novavaxs south african phase iib covid 19 vaccine trial likely to reveal results within next fortnight source says said Novavax had completed its data entry with the government and results would be revealed in the next fortnight which implies results coming out by next Wednesday at the latest 4 The screenshot in this tweet https twitter com someguymg status 1351237225636360194 s 20 from two days ago from a seemingly reliable Facebook vaccine group where a study participant in the UK had been told by a sponsor that Novavax had completed the 50 events for an interim analysis 5 The New York Academy of Sciences announced a webinar https www nyas org events 2021 webinar the quest for a covid 19 vaccine tab agenda on February 2 3 Novavax is attending alongside Pfizer and Moderna and their President of R amp D is giving an Efficacy Data Update Earlier stage vaccines are only giving updates so we know that at the very latest we will have data by February 2 and I believe it will be much earlier than the New York Academy of Sciences presentation 6 Pfizer Moderna and Astrazeneca have all released news before market on Mondays so given the combination of the points above I think we will be getting data next Monday morning and if not definitely sometime next week Currently IV is so high on Novavax that I have been opposed to buying calls a few weeks out as it kills potential returns So for the last two weeks I have bought small amounts of calls on Friday that expire the following week I am buying significantly more this week for options expiring next Friday due to my confidence in imminent data Lastly on January 8 before the JPM presentation IV went over 200 and that was with a monthly expiration that had strikes going over 220 There is a bottleneck of availability of strikes on next week calls expiring January 29 as they only go up to 170 On Friday afternoon IV will go through the roof on these higher strike calls so now is the time to get in Positions 1 29 Strikes 150 155 160 165 170 anything you can get your hands on As an aside some have expressed concern that NVAX a relatively unproven biotech company may not have the ability to ramp up production and or the US trial is too late for the vaccine to get traction Those worries are WAY overblown in my opinion Now s not the time to get deep into that but here s some quick reasons why 1 NVAX currently has more than 1 6 billion doses already ordered from countries around the globe Pricing is consistent globally at 16 per dose do the math on revenue and think about other biotech firms trading at 2 3x revenue we should see the market bake a lot of that in once positive phase 3 data is released 2 NVAX has made acquisitions and partnerships incl Praha

is to describe why I think Novavax NVAX will be releasing efficacy data in the next week and explain why I have decided to buy weekly options until data comes out for the biggest possible return tl dr 1 Data is coming in the next week 2 IV on options expiring next week is going to go through the roof on Friday afternoon 3 High likelihood of good data 4 Buy now For quick context as of today NVAX will be the 4th COVID vaccine to release Phase 3 efficacy data though they have already secured the most government contracts Currently Novavax is in a phase 2B trial in South Africa a phase 3 trial in the UK and a phase 3 trial in US Mexico The release of South Africa and UK efficacy data is imminent see reasons why I think data will be released next week below This data is a significant catalyst as up until this point no efficacy data has been released from NVAX other than non human primates which was best in class relative to competing vaccines As for what that data will entail there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic that I will not get into in this post I am a medical student and am more than happy to discuss further if needed but for starters I recommend reading the 4 posts by u Upstairs Speech https www reddit com u Upstairs Speech on why NVAX is deeply undervalued and has a high chance of success The only thing I would add to their posts is the robust antibody response significantly higher than MRNA and PFE after 6 months as shown on slide 17 https ir novavax com static files 84a85933 d43f 438e 9dd3 32a023129da7 of their JPM presentation two weeks ago which as a result has gotten many immunologists excited We have seen the share price impact of released efficacy data before For reference Pfizer added 15B to their market cap after release of efficacy data in November and Moderna doubled its market cap in November from 30 to 60B NVAX has a market cap currently of 8B 16 that of Moderna and that includes the valuation for a separate influenza vaccine that completed Phase 3 in March 2020 I think a 40 immediate increase is reasonable following good data and I think NVAX will continue to grow to be multiples higher than current levels in a few months A 40 increase from current levels would take the share price to 175 which would net a 10x or greater return NVAX hit 190 share price last year after the primate data it could certainly go higher than 175 Here are the reasons why I think NVAX will provide data in the next week 1 At JPM s healthcare conference on January 11 their CEO said data would be in a few weeks and has repeatedly said data would be in early Q1 2 At the same conference their Chief Commercial Officer said South Africa data would come first and UK would follow shortly after in late January early February but could be sooner due to the high burden of disease in those two countries Here are a couple recent news articles highlighting how out of control the situation is UK article https www businessinsider com covid 19 coronavirus uk variant cases 2021 1 and South Africa article https www theafricareport com 57277 south africa new coronavirus variant rages alongside vaccine finance debate 3 On January 13 the following South Africa news source https www pharmaceutical technology com comment novavaxs south african phase iib covid 19 vaccine trial likely to reveal results within next fortnight source says said Novavax had completed its data entry with the government and results would be revealed in the next fortnight which implies results coming out by next Wednesday at the latest 4 The screenshot in this tweet https twitter com someguymg status 1351237225636360194 s 20 from two days ago from a seemingly reliable Facebook vaccine group where a study participant in the UK had been told by a sponsor that Novavax had completed the 50 events for an interim analysis 5 The New York Academy of Sciences announced a webinar https www nyas org events 2021 webinar the quest for a covid 19 vaccine tab agenda on February 2 3 Novavax is attending alongside Pfizer and Moderna and their President of R amp D is giving an Efficacy Data Update Earlier stage vaccines are only giving updates so we know that at the very latest we will have data by February 2 and I believe it will be much earlier than the New York Academy of Sciences presentation 6 Pfizer Moderna and Astrazeneca have all released news before market on Mondays so given the combination of the points above I think we will be getting data next Monday morning and if not definitely sometime next week Currently IV is so high on Novavax that I have been opposed to buying calls a few weeks out as it kills potential returns So for the last two weeks I have bought small amounts of calls on Friday that expire the following week I am buying significantly more this week for options expiring next Friday due to my confidence in imminent data Lastly on January 8 before the JPM presentation IV went over 200 and that was with a monthly
