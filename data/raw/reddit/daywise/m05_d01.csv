earnings were an absolute blowout Below is a snapshot of this quarters beat 3 30 per share vs 2 37 per share forecast up 93 YOY 26 17 billion vs 23 67 billion expected up 48 YOY The company has attributed the huge beat to a 30 increase in the average price per ad as well as a 12 increase in the number of ads shown These are not transitory changes and therefore forward guidance by analysts will have to be increased moving forward We can analyse the present value of future cash flows using a Discount Free Cashflow DCF model factoring in the changes to revenue and forward guidance in tandem with a fair p e multiple on forward guidance Prior to earnings analysts guided 11 27 EPS for the full fiscal year 2021 amp 13 54 for the full fiscal year 2022 Assuming all else remains equal those figures should be upgraded as follows 11 27 EPS 1 3 increased ad prices 1 12 increased frequency 13 54 1 3 1 12 Current incl yesterday increase 27 83 The 5 year mean p e is 38 88 with 12 month mean being 30 51 Taking the conservative 12 month average of 30x based on F 2 EPS a end of 2022 estimate 19 71 30 Using the WACC for the discount a 25x multiple for EV EBITDA 2 5 perpetual growth rate amp factoring in 20 EBIT growth rate including the changes to ad revenue frequency It s important to note that we are looking for a positive margin of safety when using the DCF to protect our downside and tech stocks can and often do exceed their intrinsic values Part 2 Tailwinds Facebook clearly benefits from increased spending on advertising post reopening In spite of recent IOS changes discussed later they guided year over year total revenue growth to remain stable or modestly accelerate relative to the growth rate in the first quarter of 2021 although growth likely will slow in subsequent quarters User growth is also being maintained by Asia Pacific region and with internet connectivity still reaching hundreds of millions of people in the coming years user growth is expected to continue Their Non advertising revenue grew almost 150 YOY and their Oculus VR initiatives can be a meaningful part of their revenue in the not so distant future The VR gaming market value is predicted to reach 92 31 billion by 2027 expanding at a compounded annual growth rate CAGR of 30 2 percent over the forecast period Long term growth for AR and VR headsets are expected to be strong throughout the forecast period with shipments growing to 76 7 million units in 2024 resulting in a CAGR of 81 5 percent We are not even taking into account any crazy ideas like selling digital goods in a VR world among other ways to monetise a VR user audience Lastly Whatsapp and its 2 billion worldwide users are still not monetised If you do a sum of the parts valuation for Facebook you sort of start to WISH that the US government would break them into seperate entities Part 3 Addressing headwinds The biggest near term headwind facing Facebook is that of the changes brought in IOS 14 tangibly reducing their ability to gather data Here is what they said gt We re doing a huge amount of work to prepare We re working with our customers to implement Apple s API and our own Aggregated Events Measurement API to mitigate the impact of the iOS14 changes We re rebuilding meaningful elements of our ad tech so that our system continues to perform when we have access to less data in the future And we re part of long term collaborations with industry bodies like the W3C on initiatives like privacy enhancing technologies that provide personalised experiences while limiting access to people s information Facebook has enough data on half of the world population to continue to target highly relevant ads and this fear is overblown in my opinion Mark Zuckerberg even mentioned how these IOS changes can actually boost their e commerece business marketplace gt It s possible that we may even be in a stronger position if Apple s changes encourage more businesses to conduct more commerce on our platforms by making it harder for them to use their data in order to find the customers that would want to use their products outside of our platforms Zuckerberg said Not a perfect analysis and would love to receive any and all thoughts and critiques Disclaimer I am long Facebook stock Also not a financial advisor Credit EPS projections are from TIKR terminal Financial analysis

Acquisition by Google I discuss how to think about Fastly as an investment to folks who have reasoned that investing in cloud compute and networking is a good idea but may not necessarily understand how or why it s a good idea We focus on basic networking and the consequences of serverless computing an architecture that has gained popularity in recent years I ve written about Cloudflare before in May 2020 on an account called u codingprofessor before taking DD writing more seriously I claimed that Cloudflare would blow past 60 dollars and was critically undervalued due to COVID economics their current position in web security and serverless computing I still view that Cloudflare and Fastly can both reach 40B marketcaps by 2023 amp x200B https preview redd it bgr8i8qmmjw61 png width 1148 amp

here WSB has grown and in my view our committed analysts can outpace Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or The Motley Fool We have on the ground experience as laborers customers and digital natives that often gets filtered out Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail

not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice but to explore the economics behind it amp x200B Cloudflare vs Fastly TL DR Fastly makes stuff faster Cloudflare is more general purpose They can be used together https preview redd it 8nw4s6mlojw61 png width 1220 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0060e02dd4363ce7e7cc4cf3b59b3438603b9bc7 This is a common question that is asked by investors interested in the cloud computing space from both novices and experts alike In my view the comparison isn t very useful and usually illustrates some misunderstanding between the two product spaces Fastly is focused on real time services and acts as an optimizing layer for existing network providers Cloudflare is a general network competitor You can use both and most do amp x200B General purpose needs https preview redd it 8g9lk7uhwjw61 png width 2314 amp format png amp auto webp amp s bdaadd144aa9a0b64a37a3c05a6f236c965fefb6 In a crude sense Fastly focuses on convenience akin to the services provided by Costco while players like Akamai or Cloudflare focus on the convenience brought to you by gas stations or companies like Walmart It s not to say that one is better than the other because it s not They just solve different problems with completely different approaches You may not go to Costco as often as you do Walmart but when you go to Costco you re picking up and utilizing a lot more This explains why Fastly takes the approach to generally co operate with other service providers and is able to provide a range of services for things like Snapchat storage Spotify network meshes Google Cloud services and other real time demands from the tech industry amp x200B gt While a convenience store is generally closer to a person s home it has a limited set of items for sale If the person drives a few more miles to the supermarket they could get all of their groceries in one trip In this case convenience stores represent the approach taken by the legacy CDN s with many local POPs and the supermarkets represent Fastly s approach with fewer larger ones amp x200B Cloudflare has ambitions to compete with the likes of companies like Amazon and attempts to be a general purpose solution for networking on the internet it wants to make the internet more accessible safer and fair Fastly seeks to solve specific problems on the internet So in a nutshell one is a general solution and the other is a specialized solution An example of specialized needs provided by Fastly is like Reddit s execution of the r place experiment in 2017 which allowed millions of users to collaborate and draw an image together pixel by pixel with rules and regulations in real time https i redd it 2kf4qnoorjw61 gif This is only one example of many The way I like to frame it is by viewing real time and collaborative services as a relatively new economic need and thus a product like Fastly has a high demand from organizations that excel with these kinds of services You may see associations with Fastly from places like Spotify Ticketmaster or The New York Times all of which have specific needs or demands when it comes to content delivery and network management https preview redd it m9muspwsrjw61 png width 1594 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 72b18b1b49ed8aed906a2b9936beb1e29a5479a1 A big advantage that Fastly has in this regard is the fact that they often build their network with the intention of being world class from top to bottom from the code they write to the metals that build their points of presence They are effectively able to choose their destiny as a product versus having to race the horses in competition They research experiment and execute on the boundary of networking making it a superb way to play the serverless and networking industry from a long point of view The result of this approach means higher quality servers and less need to rely on the number of PoPs used This ultimately means that Fastly spends less on building and maintaining servers while being an order of magnitude faster at the same time They are efficient and provide value per the dollar spent on their network from customers and internal alike amp x200B https preview redd it s9n1xm5zrjw61 png width 640 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 65e97432b694a884e1445db1793377e0f3eefa8c Cloudflare s team of course counters this by saying that speed is not nearly as important as Cloudflare s ability to be compliant to global requirements This is completely nonsense if you consider that in the long term Fastly s general approach is to solve specific problems rather than to function as a general purpose network The compliance debate is a bogus marketing attempt when Fastly s speeds in the microseconds is exponentially faster than Cloudflare s serverless implementation that sits in the milliseconds range This is frankly an example of how Matt Prince is warmer to investors and plays a stronger marketing game than Artur Bergman who seemingly could not care to impress Wall Street funds and plays for the long term https preview redd it 9afefjyasjw61 png width 1600 amp format png amp auto webp amp s af129b27bf734c74c0d8a039341ff03b126af5c1 Why does this distinction matter Well what of the requirements where networking speed and response times are critical like hospital communications stock market crashes wildfires or other problems unique to the challenges of running a network amp x200B gt The way to think about this is what do you pay for right I mean if you and where are these moments that are valuable When Tiger Wood walks down with the 18th green the Masters and God willing he is able to do that again that matters that moment matters Everyone is going to tweet about it and everyone wants to see it the company that is in charge of that cares desperately about that content When you send a gift across the Internet like it s not monetized in the same way it s not as valued So where we have seen the value is in content that is highly valuable to customers and their end consumer where they re willing to pay for it and the quality and the security and the scale of that deeply matters And we have always focused our work on that type of content There s plenty of content that just scrapes by and is low commodity Every month they want a lower price That s a different market from our perspective and we re not in it Fastly CEO Understanding Content Delivery TL DR You have data you cut the data into smaller pieces send it across a network and rebuild those pieces somewhere else https preview redd it a92mp9wesjw61 png

world This model is known as the OSI model and it s not necessarily the end all be all model that governs the internet but it is a useful framework to understand at a glance There are many complexities that go behind these protocols and they are the subject of intense debate or research At the same time many of these steps follow a similar process translate or transform the data that s

data into machine bytecode in a similar way that a networking router will need to translate information into a stream of 0 and 1 signals This may not make too much sense yet but just remember that it s just a series of translations and preparations of data into different segments so that it could be read and understood by other pieces of hardware amp x200B https preview redd it kvhajfjtujw61 png

time messaging protocol It sends the video to the presentation layer 2 Presentation Layer The video data is received and compressed It gets sent to the session layer 3 Session Layer A communication session is initiated A network communication is initiated with various receivers at some set of defined internet address routes 4 Transportation Layer The data is further segmented and prepared for transportation 5 Network Layer Once the data has reached this stage the segments are converted to packets 6 Data Link Layer The data is sliced into frames and delivered to the physical layer 7 Physical Layer The frames are converted into a bitstream of 0s and 1s as a way to represent that final stage of data representation which are signals that along a physical medium like a cable amp

process again in the opposite direction where the data is received at the physical layer and concludes at the application layer the person who you sent an Zoom call to There s a reason that the network use trucks or mail deliveries as ways to compare the process as it can be strikingly similar at times What are the complexities related to delivering a letter a box of clothes or a Home Depot truck full of metals and wood So that s the essence behind content delivery networks preparing information and delivering it with optimal paths It s worth taking some time to ponder and think about this They may be words or ideas that you ve heard routers bitstreams addresses and so on What is the difference between collecting a Pinterest pin playing a Spotify stream or setting up a Zoom call

d39cdad6269f4b7d224fff12e6c39adc60584d60 With this developing model in mind consider again how Cloudflare is particularly invested in the overall health of a network while Fastly is primarily concerned with pushing the network further They seek to solve different platforms while having obvious overlaps at the same time Serverless Compute The Event Driven Network TL DR Serverless allows software engineers to spend more time building products https preview redd it lhez9rq6tjw61 png width 1260 amp format png amp auto webp amp s fb377d7a5f2c3d3995c4c56ec0a5b925a860e0f7 What serverless architecture accomplishes is that it adds programmability and portability to the cloud clusters and the network There are two major benefits to serverless computing 1 It grants developers access to complex functions out of the box For example if a developer wants to create a lightning fast application where taking an image of a crop plant returns some analysis about the health of the crop or warning signs that the crop image is showing a serverless function as a service can provide that capacity for a developer https preview redd it bm6jwodptjw61 png width 1360 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 29a9e9552a1f3874b8932e5baaabe5bf91c8fccd That image is stored with the provider to improve the quality of future recommendations and output as well Given that the image taker is likely situated in a rural area edge computing like this allows the application to complete this process much faster than communicating to a central server that is in a much farther location amp x200B https preview redd it 1trzui6ctjw61 png width 670 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5501fee8d2a9a8e2e5bce681a6b86d6f48e69da3 2 It allows developers to spend more time working on application code rather than infrastructure to support it Imagine that a product that benefits off real time services and events has particular problems handling the amount of traffic that reaches their servers A perfect example of this are the server failures of Rob in the hood during spikes of activity or Reddit s own ability to handle surges of logins registrations and activity after events like GME s stock market explosion Other historical problems were things like World of Warcraft s expansion releases where servers were effectively on fire and required round the clock support Edge computing effectively offloads some of these problems from central servers by making the network more programmable and effective If an application I wrote suddenly has to manage 1 000 000 users a serverless architecture allows for intelligent autoscaling which means that services like Fastly will handle those problems for me This ultimately results in a metered pay as you go system amp x200B https preview redd it

start up an idea from application to deployment at a much faster pace I believe this should equip a reader with the ability to imagine the opportunity behind edge and serverless computing Here are some simple questions I like to think about amp x200B https preview redd it ydk0hfx7ujw61 png width 800 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3c506b4d99dfd7e7f512f9d304f5c1e8f53e52e9 Can we improve the customer experience of swiping a card in a store or other network based currencies How do we improve the security of individual network connected devices Are we able to improve the response times of emergency technologies like hospital or firefight dispatching Are we able to better measure online engagement and create new interactive experiences Will online video games require servers bounded by location Would we be able to change camera angles when watching a sports stream Can we improve the quality of industrial automation or logistics Are we able to extend programmability to node based products like windmill farms or electric vehicle charging stations amp x200B https preview redd it 5otn5vekvjw61 png width 2230 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 14201da0292e3f895dc829239999889d0af43add Some of these questions are asked by Fastly themselves as they list the following subjects of interest in their S 1 1 API acceleration Accelerate and secure critical API responses at the edge for delightful application experiences such as instant hotel lookup based on location and real time inventory updates between retail stores and their online storefronts 2 IoT Process and secure data from connected devices at the edge for instant results for time sensitive applications 3 Cloud migration Seamlessly migrate from data center to cloud hybrid or multi cloud environments enabling the customer to take advantage of the functionality and cost savings of one or more cloud providers 4 Enabling redactedchain block Cache and accelerate individual transactions on the redactedchain block in real time Conclusion TL DR Investing in some form of serverless computing is a good idea You may have noticed that I did not discuss financials This is mostly because these details do not nearly weigh as much as the general understanding of the product which is content delivery and serverless computing In my view the economic consequence of these architectures far outweighs any other metric that could measure the future value of a company like Fastly Most of my DD writing follows this principal I m far more focused on economic consequences and incentives of an industry player rather than data points that can be fixed in time like a recent earnings or financial report Those things need to just check out

Qualcomm Intel Skyworks Texas Instruments Samsung and Analog devices all had something in common in their supply chain They all buy their testing capital equipment from Cohu Cohu offers a few different products All of them are within the market of testing computer chips Why is this market important Well on the customer end imagine if you spent 2500 on a laptop and the intel chip inside didn t work You d return it to BestBuy who would return it to HP who would return it to Intel A long and expensive chain of returns for a nonfunctional product This issue can also be more than just an inconvenience What if you bought a self driving tesla and one of the chips in the sensors didn t work What if a Boeing airbus had some faulty chips in the navigation system In short it s very important that the semi manufacturers know that their product is working when they send it out Bullish trends 1 Semiconductor volume is increasing in the following industries mobile phones 5g needs 2x the chips Computing Automotive electric and self driving need exponentially more chips than cars of the past Cloud computing basically a warehouse of semiconductors AI not sure how this works but it s going to need computer chips Here s my main argument Each of those markets is rapidly growing and at the same time chip volume is rising in each of those markets This creates a sort of exponential effect for the semiconductor chain Not only is there a strong catalyst from increasing volume in existing markets phones pcs but we also see rapidly growing new markets that also have high density cloud auto This is very bullish for the entire semi supply chain But the key feature that benefits testing in particular is increasing complexity of chips A more complex chip requires more complex testing which demands a higher premium 2 Semiconductor shortage We all know demand for computer chips is very high And supply has just about run out This means that prices for semiconductors should increase due to scarcity This is great news for Cohu as it leaves more margin to charge for testing If you were ford would you pay a premium on chips in order to produce your vehicles 3 Increasing chip complexity on smaller wafers demands a higher price for testing AMAT recently noted on April 6th analyst day that capital intensity revenue spent on capital equipment is returning to the 2000 highs of 16 This increased capital intensity seems especially true when we consider the global chip shortage Intel and Nvidia are opening new fabs in the last couple months These factories are going to require a shit ton of capital equipment For example TSMC announced they ll be spending 100 billion over the next 3 years on capital equipment as their fabs have been running at 100 for months and still can t keep up with demand 4 Trend of strong growth Cohu has shown strong growth in the last year In Q1 2020 revenue was 138 9 million and gross margin was 41 7 Q1 2021 revenue was just reported at 225 1 million and gross margin was 45 6 This is annual revenue growth of 62 and margin growth of 9 Business outlook in only getting better as the semiconductor shortage worsens and demand continues to grow across sectors 5 Very high accounts receivable Accounts receivable is up 30 annually to 197 million Recurring customers represent 48 of Cohu s revenue so this is a very strong sign in my opinion Bearish trends 1 The company is on a huge downturn in the last few trading days due to announcing 42 45 gross margin for Q2 instead of 45 like Q1 This is on increased revenue of 234 250 million forecasted for Q2 A decrease in GM on growing revenue is never a great sign The reason for this change is that much of the forecasted growth is in the automotive segment which is lower margin than other segments I mentioned in the last section Essentially the chips in cars aren t as complicated as the chips in PCs or phones so they are less expensive and therefore have a lower margin for testing I will point out that the firm is likely to generate more gross margin dollars next quarter than this quarter albeit on lower gm 43x240 103 2 gm vs this last quarter 225x 456 102 6gm 2 Recent stock offering Cohu sold 4 950 000 shares at 41 at the start of march This diluted the shares available but raised 202 million for the firm They used this to pay off debt and fund future growth 3 strong competition Cohu s main competitors are advantest and teradyne These are two large global firms that have significantly more financial resources than Cohu Cohu does have some advantages over these strong competitors it s the global leader in Radio frequency power amplifier RF amplifiers are a key component in mobile phones and are increasing in volume with the 5g rollout more chips per phone and more complexity Essentially Cohu is in the dominant position in this growing market Cohu is also the leader in automotive handling handling is a process where chips are moved into the testing device then sorted based on results Fundamental analysis I use a ratio similar to p e I use gross margin market cap If I was buying the whole company I d want to know how much profit I m purchasing I don t like p e because it can be manipulated by the of shares issued Cohu annual gm 316 000 000 Cohu market cap 1 925 000 000 316 million 1925 million 6 09 This is a very attractive price gm ratio Lets compare it to some other companies ratios Cohu 6 09 aapl 19 12 amzn 18 ter 11 3 advantest 7 19 swks 17 9 If cohu were trading at the same multiplier as it s large cap competitor Teradyne the stock price would nearly double Taking a look at the balance sheet Cohu is in a much better position today than 1 year ago They have 290 million of cash almost double from a year ago They also have significantly lower long term debt 200 million today versus 300 million a year ago amp x200B Technical analysis Cohu 1 year chart https preview redd it pav84wurgjw61 png width 1504 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3d65ce5a266334b6f1c8a9cd3fb344509441451e As we can see from the 1 year chart above Cohu seems to find support around the 40 mark for the past 6 months Currently it s chillin out on the support line so this indicates to me that it s a good time to purchase cohu as I love buying dips We can also see it s found resistance at around 50 having tested that line 3 4 times since the start of the year I cannot say with certainty that it will break this resistance line but I do expect it to at least check this number again some time in the next 2 3 months My expected range for this stock in the next 3 months is between 50 and 65 which leaves room for some nice profit if one were to buy at 40 In conclusion cohu is a small cap in an extremely hot market It s got some big competitors but it holds certain key advantages over them The financial position of the company is really good currently and it s growth should continue for the foreseeable future It s strongest catalyst is that semiconductor density is increasing in existing markets and new markets are emerging with high density which has the potential to create enormous growth For this reason I think COHU is a great choice Even if you disagree on Cohu you will want to have some semiconductors in your portfolio for the next few years Disclaimer I m holding call options on this company cheers
