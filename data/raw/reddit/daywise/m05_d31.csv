total addressable market for BYND is potentially in the trillions of dollars displacing animal based beef pork eggs cheese and chicken The World Economic Forum has argued that global meat consumption must fall within the coming years According to Forbes 60 of Gen Z is looking to base their diets on plant forward foods BYND market cap s only 10 billion It s growing like a weed Yearly revenue growth for the past three is 131 compounded annually And BYND might have a durable competitive advantage According to analyst Alexia Howard for BYND as plant based products tend to be relatively complex to manufacture moats could prove to be deep Additionally as of 2019 the company had one patent and 21 U S and international patent applications It s attempting to achieve price parity with animal based meat in the next few years and ultimately even produce for cheaper As the first mover it also has the potential to achieve economies of scale faster and become most attractive from a price standpoint Its competitor Impossible Burger has had to turn down partnerships because it hasn t had the infrastructure that BYND has and couldn t produce sufficient product to service big partnerships BYND s further along and has been able to garner partnerships with the likes of KFC McDonald s Starbucks Pepsi Pizza Hut Impossible Burger also produces its food with GMOs which are outlawed in many countries BYND already sells products in 80 countries Remember that the GME run started in 2020 with not only high short interest but attractiveness from a fundamental perspective that led big investors like Michael Burry and Ryan Cohen to move in aggressively BYND has this fundamental attractiveness more than a lot of companies with a high short interest which analysts are largely downrating BYND s growth took more of a pandemic related hit than other food providers because much of its growth involves people buying their products in restaurants It is therefore considered a re opening play BYND spends 7 of revenue on R amp D which is many times that of more mature food providers so the future looks bright High short interest According to both MarketWatch and Ortex BYND s short interest is higher than AMC BB and GME Favorable externalities Good against global warming good for animals good for global resources good for human health This gives incentives to many influentials celebrities governments to encourage people to consume plant based meat Governments have subsidized the electric vehicle industry Will they do the same for clean meat Cramer has suggested BYND as a WSB play to his 250 000 viewers during each of his last three Mad Money episodes Tues Weds Thurs no show Fri and elsewhere on CNBC A couple people here have suggested Cramer has done so as a distraction I understand the bitterness toward hedge funds They re selling out making a lot of money while not adding much to society But Cramer s offering insight to nonprofessional investors to help them make investing decisions I just started watching Cramer again about a month ago and just about everything he s liked most has moved up in value Roblox Ford Wells Fargo He has in the past consistently said favorable things about BYND and Ethan Brown He s even suggested in the past that going against BYND is going against history And anyway the proof is in the pudding BYND short interest is higher than AMC BB and GME according to MarketWatch and Ortex And it would be a lot nicer for a company displacing animal meat to sell stock and get more capital for R amp D than a cell phone or a movie theater company I was following the market in 2013 and this situation reminds me so much of Tesla in May 2013 The stock started rising on fundamentals and commentators thought it was highly priced and thought it was rising only due to a short squeeze But electric vehicles were the future and Tesla kept rising for years even though there was concern that big players would get into the industry Beyond Meat is also the future and has the potential to rise even after the short squeeze which is one reason institutional investors may be buying BYND s market cap of about 10 billion is also the same as Tesla s when its run started in 2013 and commentators were scoffing at its valuation Now it s over 600 billion This stock right now is potentially set up for a strong run within the next few months increasing bullishness of institutional investors high short interest and maybe the increasing support of WSB It s 40 below its all time high I wouldn t be surprised if it doubles in the next several months Disclaimer I m not in any other squeeze plays I will probably write covered calls on AMC and hedge with puts because their short term calls are very highly priced This is a delta neutral position that should not impact AMC share price I have BYND calls and may buy more because their short term calls are still cheap

leaving lazy comments about Ticker X has short interest of Y This is dumb and you should feed bad about wasting our time with something so useless amp x200B What is short interest Here we find the first reason why this is dumb comment Short interest is an incredibly vague concept Usually you see it reckoned as a percentage of the float or the shares outstanding but even this is not a consistent definition Thinking back to the GME runup there were two numbers being thrown around for Short Interest 140 and 270 amp x200B The first number 140 was short interest divided by the total shares outstanding If a company has 1000 shares outstanding and 200 shares have been short sold this works out to a 20 short ratio But not every outstanding share is available to trade on any given day Many will be owned by the company itself insiders and institutions that are not legally allowed to sell them without doing a bunch of publicly available priced in paperwork So sometimes you ll see numbers like the second 270 which use the shares that are available to trade on any given day as the denominator If only 700 shares are available to the market that will increase the short float to almost 30 amp x200B Trouble is how do you define a share that is available to trade If you don t know the definition that was used when calculating the number you re throwing around then you don t know what the short float number actually means And if you don t know or can t explain it then you shouldn t be wasting our time with it because its meaningless amp x200B What is Days to Cover There is another way of reckoning short interest that actually does have some validity Days to Cover is a measure of how many days of trading it would take for every short position to be unwound This is the total number of shares shorted divided by the average trading volume That ratio is the number of days on average it would take for shorts to cover If every short position had to be closed as quickly as possible it would take that many days if every share traded were used to close a short position for short interest by any metric to reach zero This is at least a little bit useful because you can tell how long an increase in buying pressure from short positions being closed is likely to last amp x200B Why even DTC is not particularly useful amp x200B Even DTC can be an inconsistent metric though as likely not every short position must be closed immediately reducing DTC and the fact that it is taking the average volume means that a single high volume day could easily drop that number substantially You don t know what s going to happen just because you have access to a single metric which is also available to every other trader on the market and that includes those with open shorts Going back to the GME example even at the height of the short squeeze craze DTC was sitting at just over six days Six days of average volume to cover and we saw trade volumes that were an order of magnitude higher than that average Does that mean the shorts covered Who knows You certainly don t even if someone on the internet told you they didn t amp x200B It s probably not a short squeeze While the concept of a short squeeze is valid you need to understand that they are incredibly rare events If you want to make trading them your primary strategy have fun but be ready to wait a long time years for the next opportunity You don t know when short positions need to be unwound and there s no way for you to force anyone to do it involuntarily You can be sure that they are doing everything in their power to minimize their losses maximize their profits and you should do the same Why should we believe that a ticker that is 30 short with a DTC lt 1 is going to squeeze If you can t explain that then it s not worth crowing about Nobody cares about your half thought out conspiracy theory DFV spent a year building his case and still came within a few months of his positions expiring worthless Michael Burry almost went bankrupt waiting for the housing market to crash You don t hear the stories of the ones who lost it all even if they were right on the premise amp x200B If you ve got knowledge of squeeze that is incoming great but build a case for it Wildly screaming GME SHORT INTEREST 30 in the daily is not a case Shouting GME DTC 1 4 DAYS is a little more informative but ultimately meaningless without further context Can they afford to spread the covering out over several days A week Four fucking months How many are held by a single entity and therefore likely to be closed all at once What is the price doing Why would they get squeezed if the position is profitable and looks to continue being profitable for the foreseeable future If you don t know then nobody is going to care amp x200B No Bullshitting We have a rule here No Bullshitting Don t make shit up and be responsible giving and taking advice This includes talking about things you don t know about You should listen not talk Nobody wants an ill informed opinion Lurk More Nobody wants an ill informed opinion Nobody wants an ill informed opinion If you re in the daily thread vomiting numbers that are effectively meaningless

buying 150 put options when price is gt 1200 Our main resource will be Shopify annual report 2020 hereafter AR presented on the website of Shopify https s27 q4cdn com 572064924 files doc financials 2020 ar 40 F pdf I will refer to pages of it as AR p xxx Revenue Let s start with revenue 2 of 3 bln is coming from merchant solutions If you do the math from AR p 157 you will realize that 1 5 billion of Revenue is coming from Shopify payments It is 50 of year revenue Shopify recognizes revenue from Shopify payments as a principle I don t believe this figure for several reasons 1 AR p 101 In audit opinion it is stated that revenue recognition Principal Vs Agent was a subject to both management and audit judgement If auditors were sure about correctness of revenue recognition they wouldn t mention it 2 If you review contract terms section 5 between Stripe who is processing payments for Shopify you will see that the whole responsibility and control over payments is on Stripe In this case Stripe is a principle https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1594805 000119312515129273 d863202dex1011 htm 3 If you look at the balance sheet AR p 102 and note 10 AR p 122 Shopify simply doesn t have assets Property plant and equipment to process payments It literally has no infrastructure You can t tell me that 9 3 mln worth computer equipment can generate 3 bln revenue for a company with gt 5000 workers 4 WIX competitor of SHOPIFY has similar number of live websites but has 10 times less revenue from merchant solutions they call it business than SHOPIFY Financial statements of WIX are https sec report Document 0001178913 21 001179 Usage statistics https trends builtwith com shop Shopify https trends builtwith com shop Wix Stores 5 Despite have that Shopify claims that they have more sales than WIX the deferred revenue balance of SHOPIFY is less than WIX s Maybe WIX is receiving fees more in advance than SHOPIFY but SHOPIFY has a ratio of amount of deferred revenue to revenue equal to 1 to 27 Meaning that it asks to pay fees more often than every 2 weeks This is very unlikely since the standard period is minimum one month The thing is that even the absolute number is lower than WIX not just percentage Sales and marketing costs 1 Since I don t believe in revenue figure I will refer to gross profit AR p 103 It is 1 5 bln For this gross profit SHOPIFY spends 602 mln on sales and marketing That means one dollar spent on ads gives only 2 56 dollars of gross profit This number is very low and indicates that SHOPIFY is not such a good or mass product Reminder company exists for 17 years 2 I see ads that say Shopify can make you 30 mln profit for 30k investment we all know that only stonks can do it Research and development AR p 103 SHOPIFY spends hundreds of millions on research and development But we don t see any increase in intangible assets or PPE Why a company that uses creative accounting to show good sales is not using it to capitalize R amp D expenses and show higher profit In my opinion because those expenses aren t R amp D but Cost of sales Recently companies started to use creative accounting to reclass COGS to R amp D and show better gross profit margin The most recent example is Plug power Just comparable figures annual Research Expenditures of universities Princeton University 326 207 000 University of Chicago 433 328 000 Do you think that Shopify is more research oriented than some top universities Unrealized gain on equity and other investments Despite all the manipulations P amp L still does not look good We have 90 million income from operations from a company with gt 100 bln market cap To show a better picture SHOPIFY decided to find another source of income revaluation of purchased assets 135 million It is 150 of income from operations AR p 120 They received investment in Affirm in July and measured it low In September they revalued it and got 133 million profit Both evaluations were done in the same quarter They have created a profit out of thin air If we exclude this profit from EPS calculation it will fall to 1 56 and PE ratio will become 700 Cash So P amp L a lie What about balance sheet It looks empty for 150 billion worth company In my opinion it even worse 1 It is missing restricted cash According to the same contract with Stripe Shopify USA acknowledges and agrees that Stripe or its financial partners may require a reserve to secure Shopify USA s liability the Stripe Reserve 2 The cash itself is not trustable AR p 118 One reason for that is that it consists mostly of commercial papers and bonds It is hard to audit you can t just send confirmation request to the bank and receive a reliable evidence You perform physical examination of those documents They can be forged they can be borrowed Another reason is that there is a consistent outflow of cash from trading marketable securities I haven t found a single report with big reliable cash figure that can be confirmed via bank letter 3 And finally why Shopify is purchasing so many securities after all I have a theory that it is done through the cooperation with banks who underwriting their shares I will come to it soon Banks are underwriting their shares and in exchange ask Shopify to buy bad corporate bonds and commercial papers from them thus getting rid of these bad securities Then they sell Shopify shares on the stock market to you In fact I don t think that they even sell and buy corporate bonds they are probably just restructuring them and we will never see billions of real cash on the balance sheet In my humble opinion Shopify has very little cash About 800 million and half of it is restricted So how the company is operating then How it is surviving I will tell you that it is surviving by taking money from different investors including probably you from frequent stock offerings If you look at the page 130 of report you will see that Shopify was doing offering every 4 6 months And with time the frequency increases The last offering was in February this year Before that it was in September According to my expectation the next offering will be this year in June July then September October then November December and after in January of the next year Than Shopify will declare bankruptcy and go under administration and Tobi will go to jail Because he can t get out of the boat how 3 of 7 top managers of Shopify did recently Do you want to sink with him Stock manipulation As a final remark I would add that the sparkle that made me make this video was target price for Shopify stock that was set by Goldman Sachs The bank who was selling its client mortgage bonds in 2008 and was buying itself SWAPs It made several billion profit while their clients lost everything It had a hearing in congress paid 6 billion fee but continued to operate For Shopify February offering Goldman Sachs was underwriter They did underwriting at 1300 price Now they suffer loses and they will do everything to sell you these shares That is why they determined the highest target price above 1 600

premium A few weeks ago I saw price at 27 and the price of eagles at 41 That s a 50 premium You are getting gouged Or are you If you talk to some people who sell 1 000 oz bars there s no shortage of them They tell you come to my site and I ll get you 1 000 oz bars all day long And when you look at the price they are selling for you are still looking at a 31 an ounce or about a 14 premium They were calling out high premiums by dealers as insane and playing the argument that they have no shortage of 1 000 oz bars amp x200B When you look under the hood and do they math those sites were charting between 1 25 and 1 65 premium per ounce for those 1 000 oz bars What is normal In times of normal conditions I ve heard experts state that you can get a 1 000 oz bar from the COMEX at 10 to 20 over spot But if you go into these markets and listen to the people who are telling you bullion dealers are gouging you due to fake shortage are selling you a product they perhaps marked up 5 16x on premiums Why You are sort of seeing narratives out there by the evil dark lords and the like talking about there is no shortage At 28 no one is likely to run to the coin shop with grandma s silver and evil dark lords are smart guys and They know this and their smugs and condescending tones to you is to convince you that this supply is available at any price point It s not amp x200B https

that will increase in price and demand as price increases When price is low you d think people would scoop this up Silver and gold are the types of things that as price rises people pile into it This is why they need tampy tamp If they do not have this silver would literally go parabolic inside of a few weeks And we might be getting to that point anyway due to the governor switch possibly going the way of Palladium soon When Palladium broke the tampy tamp then it went nuts This potentially is what is in store for silver soon amp x200B https preview redd it ribjse0hjg271 png width 1551 amp format png amp auto webp amp s fcfe3cd3646d9036b8bedfdcc1358e4f900c5722 But lets get back to premiums Let s look at dealers If you listen to the dealers they tell you the supplies they get from the mints to sell Eagles and Kangaroos is very constrained Assume there s 900m ounces sold of silver per year What you find from these dealers is that the US mint only makes so many eagles The US mint then slaps like a 2 3 premium on from THEM This then goes to distributors who have a mark up then get to the end dealer to sell And they may have 10 000 available but 100 000 want them at 5 over This moves price higher to meet that 10 000 available and find the equilibrium Otherwise they sell to you too cheap and they are out of products and out of business soon thereafter So what is given to the dealers from the distributor is very little supply and a RAGING demand The market essentially has the governor switch at the retail front end Interesting huh We have a cheat code for that by the way hey HAVE to raise prices to 1 slow you down from cleaning them out 2 make money in the event you clean them out and they have no products to sell for weeks or months See if you took that micro economics class the first sentence of the first day is A businesses are in business to make money They are NOT in the business of running a charity And it is NOT their duty to give you a price that makes YOU happy but one that sustains their continued operations Remember at the same time those who deal with 1 000 oz bars are telling you there s no shortage come here and they have 5 16x higher premiums than normal Anyone buying silver for 5 minutes knows that the larger the quantity the lower the premium per ounce But why would THEY have such high premiums They use the word tightness Let me translate At this price point there is a lower than usual supply so I am being charged more This is exactly the same story the retail guys have dude What are other options to drain the COMEX so to speak 1 Buy PSLV or another ETF that you trust PSLV is indeed draining 1 000 oz bars from the market 2 Buy OneGold that says that it is allocated and a Sprott product Supposedly this is matched to silver in their vaults If you want your silver they cash you out to dollars then you can buy at the best premiums on Apmex You are then running into premiums twice It is highly liquid though and you can get metal on the other end provided Apmex is not out 3 Kinesis but you can buy KAG and mint silver there which has them going out and draining silver from the market and putting into their vaults You can take delivery of 100 oz bars minimum of 200 oz This is the best solution if you want to put some serious money into silver yet down the road have the optionality to take delivery of your silver if you aren t a 6 figure investor in silver The latest silver reports show investment silver at 500m oz to include ETFs yet price hasn t moved since the summer If you want 100 and 200 silver Continue to drain on LCS or retailer sellers and when premiums come down on the left side get some more shiny here and there Maybe you don t have a great stash now you can perhaps buy KAG for stupid low premiums and down the road get 100 oz bars delivered to you when no one can find them The common mistake is just trying to go after retail Look at the drip above that is going to dealers If you can only buy that much but they are re supplying in the back end faster than they are stocking the shelves the answer is to attack the supply at the root And that s 1 000 oz bars Concluding thoughts I m also aware as supply is unlocked it s possible the refineries and others are hedging what they just bought to protect from downside price moves That hedging in itself is potentially shorting on the COMEX and creating the downward price pressure they are trying to protect against What 1980 and 2011 did NOT have was PSLV Kinesis Money and OneGold Meaning as retailers see a flood of interested people over 30 high retail premiums would be the norm to slow the interest in buying But now we can filter a lot of those people towards other instruments bypassing the air brakes of the trickle of the retail front end supply If we continue to pound PSLV and those types of instruments we blow through 50 silver like a hot knife through butter and continued pressure may make Palladium jealous of the results that come from this Thanks for addendum Natenfishpa

amp auto webp amp s b152ff16064d6ce20439d94e448adac57d08878f This my quick and top of the head version of DCF model for BNGO Please note that I haven t made any pin point assumptions All assumptions are ballmark to just get an high level price estimate I m not a financial advisor nor a financial analyst I m just a random guy applying his financial education in real life I m more than happy to hear your feedback and update my analysis with more accurate numbers or correct any wrong assumptions Please let me know if I m missing any other types of revenues expenses If you feel its justified feel free to share it on other social media platforms Recently on SeekingAlpha an analyst did his DCF model and his price came out to be 7 3 which I feel wasn t justified enough I believe it was because he didn t factor in Saphyr 2 0 potential and didn t project his sales for longer years Well so I took it upon myself as a small little challenge to do a DCF myself NOTE This does not include the Nanonozzle revenue projection because at this point in time its really hard to estimate those numbers Also just wanted to note that the top analysts on Tip Rank gave BNGO an average price target of 12 I think this sort of proves my analysis that BNGO is at least worth 12 EDIT I have received some critical feedback on my analysis from my post on BNGO subreddit I will be incorporating those changes but it will only affect my analysis positively amp x200B TLDR BNGO2THEMOON amp x200B Units Installed Expected sales of Saphyr to increase about 80 every year as more and more labs clinics hospitals etc start to adopt it Though from year 2028 I have reduced the adoption to 50 every year giving me an almost 70 CAGR Rent Sold I have broken the sales of Saphyr into rent and sold This is because there are different consumables agreement with each type of sale As per CFO in Q1 earnings transcript he said rentals are more sales however this might change as Saphyr is still finding its level My assumption is 60 rent and slowly reducing down to 35 by 2030 Revenue per Consumable We currently know it costs 550 consumable As BNGO s goal is to reduce it to 100 I have done about 50 decrement each year starting 2024 when Saphyr 2 0 will launch and achieving 100 from 2028 Saphyr 1 0 2 0 Saphyr 1 0 is just 5000 14 rounding it down to 350 genomes per year Why divide by 14 Because that s what Saphyr 2 0 will be able to do Min 120 Genome per 6 month Rent Agreement If someone rents from Saphyr that s what the agreement states currently This means minimum 240genome runs at per Saphyr rented ones per consumable price every year I m assuming they are running the minimum and not the maximum capacity i e about 350 year Sold Saphyr 240 Genome Bundle Currently BNGO has a bundle going out for clients who buy Saphyr For them the genome run would cost 450 instead of 550 However for ease of calculation I have not included the 100 discount in my calculation Everything is being multiplied by consumable price for the year I m assuming they are running the minimum and not the maximum capacity i e about 350 year Saphyr 2 0 Consumables This was the trickiest part in my calculations and involves a lot of assuming stuff We all know they are aiming to launch 2 0 by 2024 Therefore adoption of 2 0 will take time and as a result it will take some time for revenue to start increasing from 2 0 We also know it will be able to do 5000 genomes a year but not every lab clinic hospital etc will be running that much So for my calculation I have assumed only 5 of 5000 genomes runs will be done on the Saphyrs installed everywhere This will increase by 2 5 over the years up to 20 by 2030 In terms of CAGR it will be increasing by almost 180 every year Given the power of Saphyr 2 0 I think its reasonable enough estimate I also think this is somewhat conservative and the number will be even higher My calculations are based on that only 25 of the full power of Saphyr 2 0 will be used This section is debatable and I m happy to talk more about it and update it with useful feedback Total Revenue Revenue growing at 79 CAGR Again this is a very conservative number from my perspective Also as per Eric CEO he expects the revenue to be somewhere between 2 6B 3 8B with 10 000 Saphyrs sold In my calculation we hit 10k mark in year 2029 We can see total revenue is around 2 3B lower than Eric s estimation Though my consumables estimate is between his expectation Its just the sale of Saphyr that seems to be off I m assuming 65 will be sales and 35 will be rent by 2029 Maybe more of sales and less of rent might be a better estimate Gross Margin Currently BNGO s margin is around 33 To be very conservative I haven t increased margin by a lot I m estimating margin to steadily grow throughout the years Additional Costs This is any other costs over operating expenses just being more conservative I m increasing it at a rate of 20 30 over the years at a 25 CAGR Net Profit Loss You can see BNGO will start to be profitable by year 2024 It will really start to pick up in net profits in year 2026 Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC Formula Cost of Equity Cost of Debt Cost of Equity Risk Free Rate Beta Market Rate Risk Free Rate Risk Free Rate 10Yr Treasury Bond 1 75 Market Rate 8 Beta 2 Cost of Debt 0 As BNGO rarely have any debt WACC 14 Free Cash Flow Assumed Net Profits as a source of free cash flow available to the company Terminal Value Assumed a 3 industry average for BNGO Although this is very unlikely because BNGO is far away from its maturity stage But for ease of calculation purpose BNGO will grow at 3 for the rest of its life Firm Value After discounting all the CFs for 10 years at 14 it gives me the company value to be around 5 5B This is about 3x the current market cap Outstanding Shares The current outstanding shares are 279M For the sake of dilution articles out there lets say BNGO raises extra 350M and lets say at 7 price this would mean extra 50M shares So out outstanding would now be 329M Price per Share With the 5 5B MV and 279M O S share this gives me a share price of 20 This is about 3x the current share price Giving a potential upside of about 200 Even with the extra 350M offering the price would fall to 16 7 per share Well in any case as per my assumptions in the discounted cashflow method BNGO seems to be heavily discounted

LULU CLDR CRWD DOCU AI and More, Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation AND Analysis Week 7 APPS ZM CGC LULU CLDR CRWD DOCU AI and More amp nbsp What s poppin bull gang Flux here with Week 7 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation Although it s a short week this time round there are still a surprising ammount of companies posting meaning there s good money to be made That being said earnings season is just about over so there is a good chance that this is going to be the final spreadsheet until Q2 rolls around Thank you all for joining me for the ride amp nbsp All that being said I love earnings season It s an absolute battleground out there Insane volatility breaking announcements and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time What s not to love Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers roll the dice and amass a small fortune That being said the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders many find that they re one bad trade away from a complete blowout so you always need to think about each trade critically No shame in sitting it out altogether amp nbsp The Spreadsheet To aid us in planning our trades this week I ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week https docs google com spreadsheets d 1z8vpI6JOEWFScuCdl gVnmyVEYEJSwB7Jz BqozX Bk edit usp sharing Using this spreadsheet we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker Obviously past performance isn t indicative of future success but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information If you re struggling to find a given stock click on the ticker symbol on the index page it should hyperlink you straight to the table If the above link isn t working for you refer to the link below amp nbsp Spreadsheet HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 1z8vpI6JOEWFScuCdl gVnmyVEYEJSwB7Jz BqozX Bk edit usp sharing amp nbsp Please note that scraping and compiling this data took hours If the sheet has helped you out in any way please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials It would mean alot to me Most websites also require you to pay for this data which I think is a load of shit amp nbsp Interesting Observations and Sample Plays Below I ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance If I missed anything feel free to bring it to my attention amp nbsp Although risky Digital Turbine options are inefficiently priced Similar to ZScaler last week Digital Turbine has the gambler s edge this week Historically Digital Turbine moves roughly 8 post earnings but the options chain is only pricing in a 5 move this time round Furthermore across the past 10 earnings reports Digital Turbine has moved an average of 15 giving us an insane edge Unfortunately the direction this could go is a complete tossup Digital turbine is sitting at 4 month lows indicating the potential for a moonshot and they also postponed earnings by one week indicating that there s something going on behind the scenes They claimed they postponed due to the anticipated completion of a recently announced acquisition leading me to believe they plan to drop some announcements regarding the merger during the ER call which could be incredibly bullish There are lots of strategies you can run this week but I m personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills or a call debit spread amp nbsp Scotia Bank earnings are very likely priced in already While the 5 other major Canadian Banks reported earnings last week Scotia Bank has been banished to this week Unfortunately for us we can t make a collateral play on it since it s followed the exact price action as the other 5 while still not reporting earnings The other banks have gone up roughly 2 3 during earnings week and scotia bank followed suit on no catalysts Expect Scotia Bank to stay flat or go down post earnings unless they managed to create money out of thin air or put forward some insane guidance amp nbsp Slack has capped upside due to the SalesForce acquisition Although you may look at the historical moves and options pricing and think it s an absolute steal I would avoid playing this ticker entirely The details of the acquisition state that shareholders will get 26 79 in cash and 0 0776 shares of Salesforce stock in exchange for each share of Slack on the day of the merger If you run the numbers this equates to roughly 45 per share of Slack With Slack currently trading at 44 it leaves us with less than 2 upside on this trade absolutely abysmal odds and return Slack has no reason to breach 45 either as then shareholders would be paying more for less come the merger amp nbsp Similar to last week liquidity is suspect Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains If you think you see an awesome play make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it You ll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain so there s gonna be a crater in the bid ask spread You re guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners amp nbsp Obviously since I gave data on over 35 companies there s plenty that I ve missed Dive in have a look around and have some fun with it Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes and get the best risk reward possible Feel free to share your findings too I d love to see what you guys come up with amp nbsp Conclusion We ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week meaning there s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles Use the spreadsheet https docs google com spreadsheets d 1z8vpI6JOEWFScuCdl gVnmyVEYEJSwB7Jz BqozX Bk edit usp sharing to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio and play accordingly If enough people found these useful I ll continue making them throughout the earnings season If the sheet has helped you out in any way please consider dropping an upvote or a comment and checking out my socials it would mean a lot to me Happy

DILIGENCE The Structural Variation Company Frunkla Investment Dayo Nurudeen THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE THIS IS FOR FUN PURPOSE ONLY 26 05 2021 INTRODUCTION TO BIONANO GENOMICS Bionano Genomics Inc is a structural variation See Fig 2 company that uses optical genome mapping technology to analyse genomes of living things such as plant human or animal Fig 2 Types of Structural Variations that can be detected by Saphyr Bionano Genomics is committed to unlocking understanding of genome See Fig 3 biology to advance the promise of genomics in areas including cancer and human disease agricultural bioengineering and genome discovery Fig 3 Cell Chromosome DNA Gene Base Pairs Genomics is defined as the study of genes and their functions and related techniques Gaining a better understanding of the interactions between genes and the environment by means of genomics is helping researchers find better ways to improve health and prevent disease HISTORY According to Princeton University on Thursday June 21 2018 BioNano Genomics technology offers a large scale view of the DNA molecule letting researchers see where genes are located relative to each other The technology also could potentially reveal other elements such as open reading frames noncoding frames repetitive regions and even epigenomic patterns This information is often destroyed when DNA is cut up for use in traditional sequencers The technology also can reveal sites of DNA damage mutations and structural variations such as duplications deletions and extra copies of genes Current sequencing techniques are limited to short segments of DNA requiring researchers to piece together the segments in a manner not unlike putting together a jigsaw puzzle Yet researchers would like to examine sequences of whole sets of genes and other long segments of non coding regions of the genome The technology was developed at Princeton by a multidisciplinary collaboration among faculty from the School of Engineering and Applied Science the Department of Physics and the Department of Molecular Biology It was supported by a grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency The inventors were Cao Steven Chou Joseph C Elgi n Professor of Engineering Robert Austin professor of physics and former postdoctoral fellow Jonas Tegenfeldt COMPANY MANAGEMENT FOUNDER Han Cao Han Cao is BioNano Genomics founder and

Variants Detected by Optical Genome Mapping with Saphyr html of a study by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium HGSVC revealed in Side by Side Comparison that methods using PacBio Sequencing detects only 72 of the Large Structural Variants detected by Optical Genome Mapping with Saphyr Erik Holmlin Ph D CEO of Bionano Genomics commented This publication outlines one of the most comprehensive side by side comparisons of PacBio sequencing and Bionano s OGM for large SV detection The unparalleled performance of Saphyr is remarkable because the Bionano data were generated on our commercially available Saphyr system and analyzed using its automated pipeline for a variable cost per genome of less than 500 With the latest update to Saphyr s software released this week the instrument can now generate clinical quality SV calls on 12 samples per day per instrument and up to 96 samples per week Something else worth noting in these studies is that longer read lengths improve the accuracy of SV calls With PacBio s focus on matching Illumina like read quality their HiFi reads are significantly shorter than their traditional long reads By contrast Saphyr images molecules that are consistently 20 to 30 times longer than PacBio reads Sequencing reads are not getting longer which we believe implies that Saphyr will remain the only effective and affordable technology currently capable of detecting the structural rearrangements in the genome that are involved in disease PACBIO Pacific Biosciences of California Inc is an American biotechnology company

Sequel II system with a further 8 fold increase in throughput In October 2020 the company announced the Sequel IIe which added onboard consensus computation to the sequencing instrument so DNA sequences produced are already corrected for accuracy ARK INVEST As at 30th of May 2021 Pacific Biosciences of California is currently number 37 on Ark Invest portfolio Ark Invest ownership in PacBio is presently 3 15 PacBio weighs 0 79 in the entire Ark Invest fund According to Ark Invest Pacific Biosciences PACB pioneered long read sequencing with its HiFi sequencing method Unlike short read NGS long reads can detect difficult to sequence mutations known as structural variants SVs SVs are critical to understanding and diagnosing conditions within oncology rare disease hereditary disease predisposition and neurology In our view Illumina s recent decision to repurchase GRAIL and focus on multi cancer screening effectively competing with its customers will galvanize PacBio s acceptance in the clinical market Recently in the PrecisionFDA 2 0 challenge PacBio HiFi reads aided by Google s GOOGL DeepVariant interpretation pipeline produced more accurate data than either Illumina or Oxford Nanopore suggesting that PacBio now is the industry leader in complete highly accurate sequencing This success already is bearing fruit For certain clinical workflows genomic innovators like Invitae NVTA and Children s Mercy Hospital are migrating from short read to long read sequencing In our view as costs continue to fall more diagnostic providers will follow suit ushering in the age of third generation sequencing

Dayo Nurudeen THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE THIS IS FOR FUN PURPOSE ONLY 26 05 2021 INTRODUCTION TO BIONANO GENOMICS Bionano Genomics Inc is a structural variation See Fig 2 company that uses optical genome mapping technology to analyze genomes of living things such as plants humans or animals Fig 2 Types of Structural Variations that can be detected by Saphyr Bionano Genomics is committed to unlocking understanding of genome See Fig 3 biology to advance the promise of genomics in areas including cancer and human disease agricultural bioengineering and genome discovery Fig 3 Cell Chromosome DNA Gene Base Pairs Genomics is defined as the study of genes and their functions and related techniques Gaining a better understanding of the interactions between genes and the environment by means of genomics is helping researchers find better ways to improve health and prevent disease HISTORY According to Princeton University on Thursday June 21 2018 BioNano Genomics technology offers a large scale view of the DNA molecule letting researchers see where genes are located relative to each other The technology also could potentially reveal other elements such as open reading frames noncoding frames repetitive regions and even epigenomic patterns This information is often destroyed when DNA is cut up for use in traditional sequencers The technology also can reveal sites of DNA damage mutations and structural variations such as duplications deletions and extra copies of genes Current sequencing techniques are limited to short segments of DNA requiring researchers to piece together the segments in a manner not unlike putting together a jigsaw puzzle Yet researchers would like to examine sequences of whole sets of genes and other long segments of non coding regions of the genome The technology was developed at Princeton by a multidisciplinary collaboration among faculty from the School of Engineering and Applied Science the Department of Physics and the Department of Molecular Biology It was supported by a grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency The inventors were Cao Steven Chou Joseph C Elgi n Professor of Engineering Robert Austin professor of physics and former postdoctoral fellow Jonas Tegenfeldt COMPANY MANAGEMENTFOUNDER Han Cao Han Cao is BioNano Genomics founder and chief scientific officer Han Cao was a co inventor of the

addressable markets TAM ,I am in the daily thread way too much and I have heard many times that many folks would like to see more quality DD on non MEME stonks I stated a couple weeks ago that I was going to do one on Zillow I was able to stop shit posting just long enough to give this a try I will include some numbers and links to most everything I lay out in this post but much of will be anecdotal along with just how much I personally think of the company overall and how I use it I am not a TA guy personally but do like trends Z is ubiquitous to real estate RE as is GOOG to search and ZM for video conferencing It has grown and become a part of pop culture 6 Zillow SNL YouTube I am also in the insurance business and the top search result anytime you enter a physical address in Google the Z listing for the property is the top result and we can glean any information needed to be3 able to do an accurate home insurance quote With the shortage in the housing market people and families moving more and the work from home trend continuing Z will be at the forefront of the change and disruption that I believe will only accelerate at a pace that will surprise many in my opinion The first disruption I will cover is Z Property Manager From my own personal experience it is the greatest thing to come along I have moved houses in the same city 6 times in 10 years was in the lake cabin market for many of those years along w having 5 rental properties First the marketing alone from Z has provided the best and most quality applicants for the rental units Z simultaneously puts your property on Z Trulia and Hot Spots Craigslist is nonexistent in this space now at least in my area and while FB marketplace is decent it does not come close to competing w Z Last 8 tenants have all come from Z marketing It does not stop there either Once you get an applicant Z rental manager allows you take applications accept applications and once accepted set up all payments electronically all online and seamlessly They will even screen applicants for public records credit and criminal history The lease process is so simple using your own documents and easily insert data initials and signatures wherever needed Z is now charging monetizing the marketing of rentals and I have no doubt they will be able to do so more for all facets of the rental process and I would not blink an eye as long as it is reasonable Mobile app is easy to use for all parties from my experience Customer service has been top notch on the 3 occasions I have had any questions Zillow Rental Manager Online Property Management Tools The numbers have been fantastic Z acquired it s closest competitor Trulia in 2015 Trulia acquisition closed by Zillow Group Inman Z is coming out of the hyper growth at all costs phase of their business and is now actually making revenue while at the same time still plowing billions back into their business and growing sectors and disruptors at an alarming rate Z current share prices is 117 32 off 43 6 its 52 week high of 208 11 Z reported 4th Q 2 10 21 and absolute blew past any and all expectations My rough research had Z moving from about 164 to 194 on this report and it had ran up nicely up to earnings In my opinion it then sold off after this in the general tech sell off that started very close to this reporting date I wont list all the numbers here but here they are for you to peruse Zillow Group Inc Zillow Group Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Financial Results Zillow Group Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Financial Results prnewswire com Z Q1 2021 earnings report was another beast of a report in my opinion especially the EPS of 44 beating expectations by 83 Zillow Group ZG Q1 Earnings amp Revenues Beat Estimates Nasdaq I believe in addition to what is laid out here that Z will disrupt how RE is transacted in the future w iBuying division Zillow Co founder Breaks Down the Basics of iBuying and SPACs Qualia Insight but not only that Z could disrupt the appraisal industry and mortgage industry in the future as well I believe all these sectors need to change and that Z will be the lead agent to do so Z share price has not been this low since Dec 2020 it looks like it has consolidated to me and ready to run and never look back TipRanks has an analyst price target of 172 62 an increase of 46 from current share price Zillow Group Class A Earnings Date ZG Earnings Report tipranks com YahooFinance has a 2 2 buy rating and a price target of 184 56 representing an increase of 57 3 over current share price Obviously there is way more information out there and analysis then provided for in here but I wanted to do a DD on something I believe in that isn t mentioned on WSB much that I have seen and I believe has tremendous long term viability and growth ahead of it Don t ever invest based on what some dude on the internet says and I have been long in Z for a long time and plan to only grow that position Sold some shares over a week ago to buy a LEAPS Jan 2023 100 strike and have 50 shares Plan is to sell CCs over the LEAPS at some point and to pick up more shares LEAPS I have been compiling this long enough and time to go grill some steaks Good luck
