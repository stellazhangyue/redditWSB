moved your way,I posted this elsewhere but I m reposting here in case someone finds it useful In this post I will provide a quick overview of option pricing in its most simplified form aimed at beginners Why you ask There is no shortage of resources online but many focus on the definitions introduce the Greeks and omit the complicated math The Greeks are definitely important but when you re starting out it might be easier to think about options pricing in a different way If you re an expert you likely won t learn anything new from this post With the preliminaries out of the way let s begin The random walk model To price derivatives i e options we need to first have a model for the underlying The commonly used model is that equity prices exhibit Geometric Brownian motion https en wikipedia org wiki Geometric Brownian motion In this model the price of an equity continuously compounds with time but at a varying rate at any instant the rate is the sum of two parts a steady component or drift and a random component that can be positive or negative in a compounding period Example of a price history with a daily drift of 5 bps and a random component with a typical daily scale of 100 bps values that are typical of SPY over the last 10 years https postimg cc cgcKJHQv Distribution of daily growth rates for this price history https postimg cc ph5GNw8c Given a starting point several price histories can fan out from there for different realizations of the random components of the growth rates the above price history was for one realization 5000 randomly generated trajectories for SPX over the last 10 years https postimg cc 3d2pQ4mX If we could look at this universe of possibilities a la Dr Strange and record the final price for each history we would obtain a distribution of final prices from a starting price Theoretical and empirically derived by generating random trajectories distributions for the final SPY price https postimg cc YL3QTRXy Here are a couple of important features of this distribution Over an extended interval that spans several compounding periods odds are the total growth rate within the interval is below the expectation from the steady rate this pops out from the graph above This means that the price action will underperform the mean more often than not and make up for it with relatively shorter fewer spurts of overperformance legs up so that the average growth rate will equal the steady one Another way of looking at the same feature we map each final SPY price to a compounded daily growth rate for that trajectory and look at the distribution of these rates notice how it peaks below the steady rate https postimg cc Mnx1qCk3 The spread in the universe of possibilities i e how much the universe of trajectories fans out as measured by say the logarithmic range https en wikipedia org wiki Natural logarithm that the trajectories explore after factoring out the mean return grows as the square root of the elapsed time Standard deviation or typical spread in the natural logarithm of the SPY price over the universe of trajectories as a function of time https postimg cc 4mFbb8jW This spread is usually expressed in terms of an annualized volatility percentage so over a finite time t Spread in the natural logarithm of price volatility percentage 100 square root t 252 days assuming there are 252 trading days in a year For reference the trajectories in the plots above have a volatility percentage of 16 which is coincidentally not far from the IV of leap options on SPY Note that if the changes in price are reasonably small the spread in the natural logarithm of price equals the spread in the price measured as a fraction of the price Option pricing Given the model that I described above and its parameters how do we value a call option to purchase shares at a given strike K and a given day in the future T given the current price S The classical method is to proceed via the Black Scholes model https en wikipedia org wiki Black E2 80 93Scholes model which answers the question in terms of the solution to a differential equation Let s think of this in another way if we think of the call option as an asset its present value is the discounted value of all the future cash flows that we re exposed to if we hold it If we buy the call option we have two kinds of future cash flows We pay the strike K at time T Assuming we immediately resell the underlying at the time T we get a cash amount equal to its future price These transactions happen only if the price at T exceeds K For a moment assume that we are forced to purchase the asset at K regardless of price and immediately resell it i e no optionality The present value of the first cash flow is easy it equals K e r T where e is Euler s constant and r is the risk free rate of borrowing i e if we have K e r T in the bank today we will have K in our account at T that we debit in order to purchase the underlying For the second cash flow our expectation is that the unknown price at T is distributed like in the model above remember https postimg cc YL3QTRXy To discount this distribution to the present time we cannot use the risk free rate since it is a risky investment but rather we have to use the expected rate of return After we do this the steady rate cancels out and the distribution of discounted prices only depends on the current price S and the expected spread in the future price i e volatility and time remaining Distribution of discounted 10 year prices for SPX on 2011 05 02 https postimg cc 8sSc0kwr Distribution of the natural logarithm of discounted 10 year prices for SPX on 2011 05 02 https postimg cc Cd3NtqXs The fact that the value of the option does not depend on the steady growth rate or the equity risk premium means that by purchasing the option you re not betting on the expected growth of the price you re betting on excess growth In other words stonks go up is priced in If we add the optionality only those parts of the discounted distribution that are profitable count Here are the same figures as above with the relevant regions marked for a discounted strike price of 2115 Distribution of discounted 10 year prices for SPX on 2011 05 02 with the shaded region relevant for a strike price of 2115 https postimg cc gnxmNr1p Distribution of the natural logarithm of discounted 10 year prices for SPX on 2011 05 02 with the shaded region relevant for a strike price of 2115 https postimg cc Czk6hgqD With the optionality the first cash flow paying for exercise at T has a present cost of K e r T area of blue shaded region i e exercise cost the estimated probability of exercising the option With the optionality the second cash flow earnings from reselling the underlying has a present value similar to the area of the blue shaded region but with an extra weighting factor that depends on the exercise price the precise calculation involves some extra mathematical details These two terms are precisely those that appear in the solutions to the Black Scholes model e g here https en wikipedia org wiki Black E2 80 93Scholes model Volatility and time From the previous discussion and this https postimg cc Czk6hgqD figure in particular we see that the probability of exercise and hence the value of an option depends on the area of the normal distribution beyond the strike price This is called the survival function Survival function as a function of the departure from the peak of the normal distribution in units of its standard deviation or spread https www itl nist gov div898 handbook eda section3 eda362 htm SURVIVAL Notice that as we move toward positive values of x the survival function falls exponentially From this https postimg cc Czk6hgqD figure the spread in the distribution of log discounted prices depends both on the volatility and the time to expiration Hence if the volatility dies down or the time to expiration draws nearer the spread narrows and for a fixed OTM strike price even if the underlying price doesn t move the difference between the logarithms of the strike and the price measured in units of the spread which is what the survival function depends on rises steeply and hence the probability of exercise and the value fall steeply Change in the probability of exercise for an OTM SPX call option with 3 years remaining vs 10 years remaining neglecting the change in the discounted strike due to the risk free rate https postimg cc 3kNcpbfJ Depending on what is changing this effect is captured by a combination of a few of the options Greeks theta charm vega but we can see that at the core all of these are describing the same phenomenon Why did I lose money even when the price moved my way The volatility that is priced into options is not backward looking historical volatility but forward looking expectation of future volatility or implied volatility IV historical volatility and implied volatility of the GOOG options chain this year https postimg cc 18Sp1gwx Prices move by small amounts but the IV moves by a lot in a small amounts of time and hence the IV is the most important metric to consider when buying options considering the sensitivity of options prices to this parameter Buying calls when the IV is high e g earnings is equivalent to betting on a loaded dice with the bias not in your favor Caveats I have neglected several real world effects in this discussion dividends early exercise etc Another important factor is that the Geometric Random Walk model isn t really correct since the distribution of daily returns is very non Gaussian there are many more days with small moves and very large moves than the model predicts The market deals with this by using different volatilities for different strike prices You can play with the code used to make the plots in this note here https colab research google com drive 1jRi 20hoM2lG lmaIHCUMTPJ16BwP8nG usp sharing

35,otuetv,t2_lw5c6,1627552327,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otuetv/nokia_q2_earnings_and_near_future/,1,Nokia Q2 Earnings and Near Future , Some of you might remember my posts and my bullish case for Nokia Feel free to check my profile for my detailed analysis of the company that I ve posted in the past I am even more bullish now than ever in my 15 20 per share goal for Nokia within the next one and a half years to two years Here is why 1 CEO I have to applaud Pekka He has done a tremendous job within such a short period of time He changed the company culture the approach to business and the whole company structure Many people in the finance world is always quite weary for non stop re structures that come with new CEOs There is always a lot of noise that rarely translates into reality However based on Pekka s past and his conservative but ruthless approach I knew he was going to be successful There was no fluff in his road map to technological leadership It was straight to the point and ruthless Therefore my number one reason for success is Pekka Lundmark and deservedly so 2 Mobile Networks division Just last quarter Nokia s guidance for 2021 for this specific division was 1 to 2 Now it has been upgraded to 4 to 7 Considering that this division has about 10 billion Euros in revenues the weighted average effect on each percentage point increase to the EPS is significant This is a truly unbelievable achievement considering that Nokia lost a giant Verizon 5G contract to Ericsson NA is more profitable than other regions Honestly based on the Q1 Earnings Call I expected Nokia to be in 1 2 range in 2021 instead of 1 range but even as a Nokia bull I did not expect the guidance to be revised to 4 7 range This revision for 2021 is especially important as Nokia s full year 2023 guidance for this division is still only 5 8 and let me tell you right now that in 2023 the operating margin for Networks will be over 10 I am very confident in saying that per Tommi Uitto s Q1 Q amp A section I will carefully listen to the Q2 Earnings Call and Q amp A session as well 3 Cloud and Network Services division This division is struggling and is currently in a turn around phase I listened to Saghal s portion of the Q amp A very carefully and he alluded that his division took some bad contracts due to greater good of the company The whole end to end provider BS of the previous incapable CEO However the good news is they are phasing out these contracts and Saghal was very bullish in top line revenue but more importantly the operating margins his division can achieve within a year or two This will be significant as currently this division is doing poorly For 2023 this division is looking at 8 11 in operating margins which would significantly increase the EPS of Nokia 4 Networks Infrastructure This probably should go 2 since this division is the star division of Nokia as of now They are performing so much better than expected and will NOT slow down any time in near future They have a very strong order book and do very well in operating margins Per Guillen he sees no reason that his division s margins should not increase beyond 12 Per the Q1 Q amp A session in or around 2023 5 Finally Nokia has 67 live networks 170 Commercial 5G deals and 230 Commercial Agreements Per the CEO more than 90 of Commercial Agreements result in the company becoming a permanent client Therefore the future of Nokia is very bright Once Nokia reaches 75 80 live networks with improved margins in the three divisions I ve mentioned above Nokia will reach 15 comparable margins within one and a half to couple years This will SIGNIFICANTLY increase its EPS and that will directly increase its share price With 20 PE ratio we will get to 15 20 in that time frame excluding the overall market risk Finally congratulations to all the longs Don t listen to the price targets of analysts If you truly take a look at Nokia right now and where they will be in couple years based on each division s targeted margins it is easy to see what Nokia s share price will be considering the industry s average PE ratio Sit back enjoy the overall steady incline in the share price Don t focus on the daily or weekly ups or downs The company is doing an amazing job and there is no end to that insight So in long ish term this stock will do wonders Congrats again to all the longs

was originally designed to treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia CMML and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia JMML amp x200B Then over a year ago COVID 19 hit and doctors started to notice the plasma of hospitalized COVID 19 patients had elevated levels of several inflammatory cytokines known as a cytokine storm And that s what Lenzilumab was created for to work against cytokine storm amp x200B

others has already conducted two Phase I and two Phase II studies including in patients with severe respiratory conditions with excellent safety results amp x200B And so a Phase III protocol for evaluating the efficacy of Lenzilumab in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS was submitted to the FDA https www bloomberg com press releases 2020 03 27 humanigen

other words when faced with the grim outcome of their current COVID 19 advanced infection some patients opted for the last Hail Mary attempt Lenzilumab amp x200B Mayo Clinic realizes they have something unique Humanigen did not seek screen or pre select any patients who opted for the compassionate use Mayo Clinic requested the FDA on behalf of each individual patient before each dosing of Lenzilumab amp x200B It was not a formal study It was compassionate use it was a Hail Mary pass But the positive results were overwhelming amp x200B The compassionate use patients who received Lenzilumab were already hospitalized and required supplemental oxygen but were not on invasive mechanical ventilation IMV yet However all patients had elevation in at least one inflammatory biomarker and all patients had at least one co morbidity associated with poor outcomes in COVID 19 Several of them had multiple co morbidities Also they were viewed as being at high risk of further disease progression hence the compassionate use amp x200B So Mayo Clinic started to match those compassionate use patients with their own electronic registry of other COVID 19 patients in the same centers Matching the cases for age sex disease severity and baseline oxygen requirements amp x200B Basically they wanted to find other patients who faced similar conditions as the compassionate use patients

potential new variants in the future will still create spikes in COVID 19 hospitalization 3 Let s face it A lot of people will not get vaccinated Many of them will do just fine even if they get infected But an increasingly significant number will end up in the hospital with an expected grim outcome And once someone reaches the hospital it s already too late to get a vaccine 4 Lenzilumab can

severe cases of COVID 19 5 Lenzilumab can make the difference between going on a ventilator which reduces one s chance of survival and leaving the hospital alive Thus the need for the FDA to fast

the one we re focusing on right now is Lenzilumab Specifically their LIVE AIR indication for prevention treatment of hyper inflammation and cytokine storms amp x200B HGEN has something called Lenzilumab https i redd it fjlzdkum75e71 gif amp x200B What is Lenzilumab It is a humanized monoclonal antibody class IgG1 kappa that targets colony stimulating factor 2 CSF2 granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF Here s the Wikipedia article https en wikipedia org wiki Lenzilumab amp x200B Why would I care about Lenzilumab Lenzilumab is a therapy for hospitalized hypoxic COVID 19 patients amp x200B Lenzilumab is a treatment for COVID 19 https i redd it i1ka0dlq75e71 gif amp x200B Let s go back in time and understand Lenzilumab s history Lenzilumab was originally designed to treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia CMML and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia JMML amp x200B Then over a year ago COVID 19 hit and doctors started to notice the plasma of hospitalized COVID 19 patients had elevated levels of several inflammatory cytokines known as a cytokine storm And that s what Lenzilumab was created for to work against cytokine storm amp x200B Processing gif cjkf52rv75e71 amp x200B Lenzilumab already had Phase I and Phase II studies Humanigen did not start to create something from scratch because of COVID 19 They already had Lenzilumab amp x200B Quoting Dr Cameron Durrant https www bloomberg com press releases 2020 03 27 humanigen submits phase iii protocol synopsis to fda for lenzilumab for coronavirus treatment chief executive officer of Humanigen gt We have been working on prevention of cytokine storm for nearly three years Lenzilumab has an excellent safety and tolerability profile and has not been associated with serious adverse events including in patients who are immunosuppressed or with severe asthma gt gt Humanigen has pioneered the field of GM CSF neutralization and unlike others has already conducted two Phase I and two Phase II studies including in patients with severe respiratory conditions with excellent safety results amp x200B And so a Phase III protocol for evaluating the efficacy of Lenzilumab in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS was submitted to the FDA https www bloomberg com press releases 2020 03 27 humanigen submits phase iii protocol synopsis to fda for lenzilumab for coronavirus treatment That was over a year ago back in March 2020 The study https www stopstorm com formally started on May 5 2020 amp x200B IND authorization In April 2020 just one month after starting the Phase III protocol Lenzilumab was granted emergency single use Investigational New Drug Application IND authorization from the FDA known as compassionate use to treat patients with COVID 19 amp x200B What is compassionate use It is a potential pathway for a patient with an immediately life threatening condition or serious disease or condition https www fda gov news events expanded access expanded access keywords definitions and resources to gain access to an investigational medical product https www fda gov news events expanded access expanded access keywords definitions and resources for treatment outside of clinical trials when no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy options are available amp x200B In other words when faced with the grim outcome of their current COVID 19 advanced infection some patients opted for the last Hail Mary attempt Lenzilumab amp x200B Mayo Clinic realizes they have something unique Humanigen did not seek screen or pre select any patients who opted for the compassionate use Mayo Clinic requested the FDA on behalf of each individual patient before each dosing of Lenzilumab amp x200B It was not a formal study It was compassionate use it was a Hail Mary pass But the positive results were overwhelming amp x200B The compassionate use patients who received Lenzilumab were already hospitalized and required supplemental oxygen but were not on invasive mechanical ventilation IMV yet However all patients had elevation in at least one inflammatory biomarker and all patients had at least one co morbidity associated with poor outcomes in COVID 19 Several of them had multiple co morbidities Also they were viewed as being at high risk of further disease progression hence the compassionate use amp x200B So Mayo Clinic started to match those compassionate use patients with their own electronic registry of other COVID 19 patients in the same centers Matching the cases for age sex disease severity and baseline oxygen requirements amp x200B Basically they wanted to find other patients who faced similar conditions as the compassionate use patients and then compare the outcomes between them amp x200B Mayo Clinic noticed Lenzilumab was helping COVID 19 patients with expected poor outcomes https i redd it 1i13q78e85e71 gif amp x200B Mayo Clinic reports the results On September 1 2020 Mayo Clinic Proceedings a premier peer reviewed journal published the first case control data of Lenzilumab in COVID 19 patients amp x200B It demonstrated an 80 reduction in relative risk of invasive mechanical

Humanigen with access to manufacturing capacity reserved by BARDA for fill finish product to accelerate the drug product manufacturing of Lenzilumab The initial agreement originally signed in November 2020 complements Humanigen s development efforts for Lenzilumab by providing access to a full scale integrated team of manufacturing and regulatory subject matter experts and statistical support in anticipation of applying for EUA and subsequently a Biologics License Application BLA for Lenzilumab as a potential treatment for COVID 19 amp x200B So they ve been preparing and getting ready for mass production Like a race car engine running hands on the wheel and eyes straight ahead just waiting for the green light of the FDA EUA amp x200B Realizing Lenzilumab s potential a Phase 3 study was already underway https i redd it 0avfg4qb85e71 gif amp x200B Phase III results are already in Remember I mentioned that they submitted the Phase III protocol back in March 2020 The Phase III study to

about it in this PubMed article https pubmed ncbi nlm nih gov 33972949 But here is the conclusion and I quote amp x200B gt Conclusion Lenzilumab significantly improved SWOV survival without ventilation in hospitalized hypoxic subjects with COVID 19 pneumonia over and above treatment with remdesivir and or corticosteroids Subjects with CRP lt 150 mg L and age lt 85 years demonstrated an improvement in survival and had the greatest benefit from Lenzilumab So there s no doubt about it Lenzilumab works amp x200B Lenzilumab significantly improves survival without ventilation in COVID 19 patients https i redd it ggjewtil85e71 gif amp x200B Finally the time came for the EUA submission Because after the Phase 3 multi center randomized placebo controlled double blinded clinical trial in the setting of COVID 19 results came in Humanigen had everything they needed for the filing of an Emergency Use Authorization EUA submission amp x200B And they did just that on May 28 2021 Humanigen Submits Application to FDA for Emergency Use Authorization for Lenzilumab in COVID 19 https www businesswire com news home 20210528005244 en Humanigen Submits Application to FDA for Emergency Use Authorization for Lenzilumab in COVID 19 amp x200B That s the earliest and most important catalyst There are no guarantees but it looks like it s only a matter of time before they receive the EUA amp x200B Why do you think that 1 Phase III already supports the efficacy of Lenzilumab 2 The Delta variant and potential new variants in the future will still create spikes in COVID 19 hospitalization 3 Let s face it A lot of people will not get vaccinated Many of them will do just fine even if they get infected But an increasingly significant number will end up in the hospital with an expected grim outcome And once someone reaches the hospital it s already too late to get a vaccine 4 Lenzilumab can prevent and treat the immune hyper response called cytokine storm a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID 19 death https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1293310 000121465921000716 ex99 1 htm Data showed that up to 89 percent of hospitalized patients with COVID 19 are at risk of this immune hyper response which is believed to trigger the acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe cases of COVID 19 5 Lenzilumab can make the difference between going on a ventilator which reduces one s chance of survival and leaving the hospital alive Thus the need for the FDA to fast track a treatment that can save lives now amp x200B The next step is the FDA EUA FDA EUA https i redd it ny138plv85e71 gif amp x200B When will that happen Again there are no guarantees or scheduled dates However I did some research https www fda gov drugs coronavirus covid 19 drugs cder scientific review documents supporting emergency use authorizations drug and biological and found out the number of days that elapsed between the submission receipt date when the FDA received the EUA submission and the action date when the FDA approved the EUA for other COVID 19 related drug and biological therapeutic products not vaccines amp x200B Bamlanivimab took 34 days Baricitinib in combination with Remdesivir took 35 days Propofol Lipuro 1 took 39 days REGEN COV took 44 days Sotrovimab took 63 days Actemra took 65 days amp x200B We know Humanigen submitted Lenzilumab s application on May 28 2021

19 patients amp x200B Lenzilumab is a treatment for COVID 19 https i redd it rr06as71b5e71 gif amp x200B Let s go back in time and understand Lenzilumab s history Lenzilumab was originally designed to treat chronic myelomonocytic leukemia CMML and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia JMML amp x200B Then over a year ago COVID 19 hit and doctors started to notice the plasma of hospitalized COVID 19 patients had elevated levels of several inflammatory cytokines known as a cytokine storm And that s what Lenzilumab was created for to work against cytokine storm amp x200B Lenzilumab works against cytokine storm https i redd it 705ukb66b5e71 gif amp x200B Lenzilumab already had Phase I and Phase II studies Humanigen did not start to create something from scratch because of COVID 19 They already

chief executive officer of Humanigen gt We have been working on prevention of cytokine storm for nearly three years Lenzilumab has an excellent safety and tolerability profile and has not been associated with serious adverse events including in patients who are immunosuppressed or with severe asthma gt gt Humanigen has pioneered the field of GM CSF neutralization and unlike others has already conducted two Phase I and two Phase II studies including in patients with severe respiratory conditions with excellent safety results amp x200B And so a Phase III protocol for evaluating the efficacy of Lenzilumab in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS was submitted to the FDA https www bloomberg com press releases 2020 03 27 humanigen submits phase

authorization In April 2020 just one month after starting the Phase III protocol Lenzilumab was granted emergency single use Investigational New Drug Application IND authorization from the FDA known as compassionate use to treat patients with COVID 19 amp x200B What is compassionate use It is a potential pathway for a patient with an immediately life threatening condition or serious disease or condition https www fda gov news events expanded access expanded access keywords definitions and resources to gain access to an investigational medical product https www fda gov news events expanded access expanded access keywords definitions and resources for treatment outside of clinical trials when no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy options are available amp x200B In other words when faced with the grim outcome of their current COVID 19 advanced infection some patients opted for the last Hail Mary attempt Lenzilumab amp x200B Mayo Clinic realizes they have something unique Humanigen did not seek screen or pre select any patients who opted for the compassionate use Mayo Clinic requested the FDA on behalf of each individual patient before each dosing of Lenzilumab amp x200B It was not a formal study It was compassionate use it was a Hail Mary pass But the positive results were overwhelming amp x200B The compassionate use patients who received Lenzilumab were already hospitalized and required supplemental oxygen but were not on invasive mechanical ventilation IMV yet However all patients had elevation in at least one inflammatory biomarker and all patients had at least one co morbidity associated with poor outcomes in COVID 19 Several of them had multiple co morbidities Also they were viewed as being at high risk of further disease progression hence the compassionate use amp x200B So Mayo Clinic started to match those compassionate use patients with their own electronic registry of other COVID 19 patients in the same centers Matching the cases for age sex disease severity and baseline oxygen requirements amp x200B Basically they wanted to find other patients who faced similar conditions as the compassionate use patients and then compare the outcomes between them amp x200B Mayo Clinic noticed Lenzilumab was helping COVID 19 patients with expected poor outcomes https i redd it sy5vvx6cb5e71 gif amp x200B Mayo Clinic reports the results On

Realizing Lenzilumab s potential a Phase 3 study was already underway https i redd it cp7efnweb5e71 gif amp x200B Phase III results are already in Remember I mentioned that they submitted the Phase

NCT04351152 It s already completed amp x200B You can read more about it in this PubMed article https pubmed ncbi nlm nih gov 33972949 But here is the conclusion and I quote amp x200B gt Conclusion Lenzilumab significantly improved SWOV survival without ventilation in hospitalized hypoxic subjects with COVID 19 pneumonia over and above treatment with remdesivir and or corticosteroids Subjects with CRP lt 150 mg L and age lt 85 years demonstrated an improvement in survival and had the greatest benefit from Lenzilumab So there s no doubt about it Lenzilumab works amp x200B Lenzilumab significantly improves survival without ventilation in COVID 19 patients https i redd it jkdk0j9hb5e71 gif amp x200B Finally the time came for the EUA submission Because after the Phase 3 multi center

submission amp x200B And they did just that on May 28 2021 Humanigen Submits Application to FDA for Emergency Use Authorization for Lenzilumab in COVID 19 https www businesswire com news home 20210528005244 en Humanigen Submits Application to FDA for Emergency Use Authorization for Lenzilumab in COVID 19 amp x200B That s the earliest and most important catalyst There are no guarantees but it looks like it s only a matter of time before they receive the EUA amp x200B Why do you think that 1 Phase III already supports the efficacy of Lenzilumab 2 The Delta variant and potential new variants in the future will still create spikes in COVID 19 hospitalization 3 Let s face it A lot of people will not get vaccinated Many of them will do just fine even if they get infected But an increasingly significant number will end up in the hospital with an expected grim outcome And once someone reaches the hospital it s already too late to get a vaccine 4 Lenzilumab can prevent and treat the immune hyper response called cytokine storm a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID 19 death https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1293310 000121465921000716 ex99 1 htm Data showed that up to 89 percent of hospitalized patients with COVID 19 are at risk of this immune hyper response which is believed to trigger the acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe cases of COVID 19 5 Lenzilumab can make the difference between going on a ventilator which reduces one s chance of survival and leaving the hospital alive Thus the need for the FDA to fast track a treatment that can save lives now amp x200B The next step is the FDA EUA FDA EUA https i redd it eghqj6sjb5e71 gif amp x200B When will that happen Again there are no guarantees or scheduled dates However I did some research https www fda gov drugs coronavirus covid 19 drugs cder scientific review documents supporting emergency use authorizations drug and biological and found out the number of days that elapsed between the submission receipt date when the FDA received the EUA submission and the action date when the FDA approved the EUA for other COVID 19 related drug and biological therapeutic products not vaccines amp x200B Bamlanivimab took 34 days Baricitinib in combination with Remdesivir took 35 days Propofol Lipuro 1 took 39 days REGEN COV took 44 days Sotrovimab took 63 days Actemra took 65 days amp x200B We know Humanigen submitted Lenzilumab s application on May 28 2021 As of today Jul 29 2021 it s been 62 days amp x200B It might still happen until August but this rocket is

So should I buy and hodl I can t tell you that It s your decision But I can tell you that even though the upcoming FDA EUA announcement is the next catalyst there s also the MHRA CMA amp x200B What s

rate ZIM would be on target for full year earnings of around 20 per share a PE of less than 2 but rates continue to move much higher What is behind the shipping rate upsurge and how do we know this will continue 1 During covid Retail inventory has fallen to a 28 year low this means shops are scrambling to restock creating intense demand for goods from China Asia etc as more and more of the world reopens this demand will continue to compound for some time deep into 2022 and possibly 2023 2 Shipping has been going through a tough time the last decade and as a result the number of ships is at a low The worldwide inactive container fleet is now just 2 8 of the global fleet and primarily consists of vessels waylaid by accidents urgent maintenance sanctions and waiting periods before upcoming service Anything that can be deployed is already deployed as it takes approx 3 years to build new vessels this supply pressure will not be relieved for at least 18 24 months 3 Additional pressure is being placed on shipping due to congestion at ports a vessel that is delayed by a week or more will miss its scheduled rotation which results in a cancelled blank sailing Covid means there are a lower number of staff at each port trying to deal with a larger than normal backlog with more and more vessels turning up every day Demand is outstripping supply by a huge factor A typical commercial ship takes about three years to complete so the fleet supply constraints are not going to be alleviated for some time None of the above 3 factors are going to abate any time soon and the likelihood is that things will get worse before they get better meaning elevated rates for all of this year and likely towards the end of 2022 and perhaps beyond A quick calculation for full year earnings ZIM carried 818 000 TEUs during the first quarter of 2021 The average freight rate per TEU was 1 925 compared to 1 091 for the first quarter of 2020 ZIMs current capacity is 429 205 TEU which should equate to a full year figure in the region of 3 400 000 TEU transported This will equate to a turnover of 7bn average shipping rate of 2000 up to 10bn if average rate is 3000 per TEU In Q1 1 74Bn revenue resulted in earnings of 5 17 so the full year should be somewhere in the region of 20 to 29 against the current share price of 37 85 17th July 2021 sound like buying a dollar for 50 cents ZIM management have the share holders interests at heart on 22 April the company announced it was paying off 351 6 million of secured debt 2 years early one of the reasons for this was that the terms of the debt prevented the company from paying a dividend During Q1 earnings ZIM announced a 5 special dividend of 2 00 ex dividend date of Aug 25 2021 ZIM also confirmed their intention to distribute 30 50 of 2021 net income to shareholders via special dividends this should equate to approx 10 per share The company also are carrying forward a tax loss in 2018 2019 which will be in the region of 132m and

with more and more vessels turning up every day Demand is outstripping supply by a huge factor None of the above 3 factors are going to abate any time soon and the likelihood is that things will get worse before they get better meaning elevated rates for all of this year and likely towards the end of 2022 and perhaps beyond A quick calculation for full year earnings ZIM carried 818 000 TEUs during the first quarter of 2021 The average freight rate per TEU was 1 925 compared to 1 091 for the first quarter of 2020 ZIMs current capacity is 429 205 TEU which should equate to a full year figure in the region of 3 400 000 TEU transported This will equate to a turnover of 7bn average shipping rate of 2000 up to 10bn if average rate is 3000 per TEU In Q1 1 74Bn revenue resulted in earnings of 5 17 so the full year should be somewhere in the region of 20 to 29 sound like buying a dollar for 50 cents ZIM management have the share holders interests at heart on 22 April the company announced it was paying off 351 6 million of secured debt 2 years early one of the reasons for this was that the terms of the debt prevented the company from paying a dividend During Q1 earnings ZIM announced a 5 special dividend of 2 00 ex dividend date of Aug 25 2021 ZIM also confirmed their intention to distribute 30 50 of 2021 net income to shareholders via special dividends this should equate to approx 10 per share The company also are carrying forward a tax loss in 2018 2019 which will be in the region of 132m and improve 2021 earnings Comps ZIM revenue 4 9bn Mkt Cap 4 35bn Cash 1

deFinEtiLyNoTcOmPliciT thOUGh https i imgur com XAO79bD jpg I m ready to fuck shit up By fucking shit up I am referring to the entire facade that is our financial markets Fucking up the entire system Not sure how he would but just flow of consciousness writing here nothing guaranteed yet Hear me out could all start with the one that started it all 2 HFs literally shell companies in Brazil got stuck with a single play worth more shares than exist on our beloved stonk https redd it otn94a Shitadel packages up Melvins retar dead puts and calls up their boiz at JP Morgan JPM calls up some Brazilian nerds and tells them to declare bankruptcy after we send u these puts Not USA so how would they pay DTCc said nOPE u can t just transfer the equivalent of 57m shares each side of the trade to some random broke ass hedge in Brazil and stick us with the bill DtCc mad SEC complicit and they ve known since March Price not breaking out because 180 is their averaged put strike Successfully lowering or averaging downwards every day Even worse if it started like this in March One HF shorts sells puts to another HF who proceed to short and sell puts and the hot potato is bouncing around screaming banks fail wut is mean Buying a put guarantees your right to sell shares at the strike price You can choose to either exercise or let them expire worthless But what happens if the shares that you thinks are real and should be real since he bought them early aren t actually real At this point there s no difference between real and synthetic shares anymore right If they re synthetic shares it would cause a feedback loop and kill everyone who played hot potato with the shares before refresher Remember how synthetic shares are created Party A borrows shares from Party B gt then Party A sells the shares short AKA buys puts or sells calls to Party C gt now it gets good Party C has the choice to exercise and buy those shares that Party A sold short gt Party C now owns X amount of shares amp the key moment synthetic shorts are fucked is when Party A who sold the option is forced to buy back the initially borrowed shares from Party B which are now worth much more value in order to give those shares to Party C Zoom out because this is where things get insane An FTD is when Party A cannot get a hold of initially borrowed shares since Party B the share lender gt but Party A still owe Party C the shares so at some point whoever brokers the transaction the Market Makers decides ok let me marks this on paper that Party C took shares in at X price from Party A Since the broker doesn t actually have shares they say ok we have a piece of paper now AKA an IOU from the MMs saying Party C owns X shares We ll give Party C the value of these shares on our dime for now let s keep our IOU scheme between broker and MM a secret There s so many trades happening we ll figure it out later What s the worst that could happen Now why can t Party A get those shares from Party B like usual Because hello feedback loop brain hurting time The shares that Party B lent out were simply on paper too at a different brokerage Extrapolate further a week later Party C decides they don t want those new shares They can do whatever they want it s their shares The broker who created that IOU is now stressing because they ve written an IOU hi SEC and lent money to Party C in place of the shares that were promised by the Market Maker who s screwed The broker when they ve lent out all their real money on IOUs the MMs who write IOUs IOUs are illegal by the way very illegal literally printing money from thin air Fake share sold gt fake share bought gt fake share sold today FTD cycle has gone on for months now and we ve just received proof of huge options trades in play Considering that they let us SEE that double the float is being sold on a single options trade imagine what you don t see You don t see the cycle that loops backwards containing all those IOUs and FTDs On exercise of such a big trade it would legitimately demolish the entire financial system How about selling more shares than exist in the float and being forced to buy them back because down the line of IOUs and FTDs someone decided to sell this large amount of options or got liquidated Oh wait that s literally already happened glacier Melvin archegos like a domino effect And one person with enough shares fake or synthetic would start the MOASS Could be anyone If they sold 9m shares that s 9m less shares the brokers and MMs have available to buy Liquidity dries out At some point brokers start fighting brokers for shares and MMs start fighting MMs for shares Otherwise all their illegal IOU FTD bullshit comes to light and they go to prison Tl dr The kicker is that they aren t worried because the S e C is a bag of dicks at best and has no real power I bet they can t even send anyone to prison They can t because the cycle has gone too far already And it s not just video game stonkz Guess what they uncovered when they looked into this shit further It s happening to every single stock on the market Movie stonk Spy Fed doesn t give two fucks Its IOUs and FTDs all around Would love to see any opinions I took one too many adderall today This is all probably wrong so call me an artist

top ten global container shipping carrier with a fleet of 101 ships in operation with a total capacity of around 429 000 TEU Shipping rates are going through the roof due to increased demand coupled with lack of global fleet supply port delays etc at its current earnings rate ZIM is on course for a 2021 full year PE of 2 TTM PE is currently under 4 against sector peers PE range of 8 to 15 On 21 June 2021 ZIM extended its partnership agreement with ALIBABA that allows customers to book transport through the Chinese e commerce giant ZIM TEU carried 818 000 in Q1 2021 the traditional off peak quarter 22 of ZIMs capacity is on 12 month set price contracts with the remaining 78 on spot daily rates The 12 month contracts give the company certainty of income covering ZIMs operating costs while being short enough in duration to allow ZIM to renegotiate taking advantage as spot prices increase The remaining 78 of the fleet are able to take full advantage of the rocketing spot daily rates which are currently exploding higher as the world comes out of covid and retailers scramble to desperately refill inventory West Coast FBX01 Container FEU spot rates were around 1500 at the start of 2020 they rose to around 3500 by the end of 2020 and are currently around 6700 over 4 times the 2020 rate with many routes commanding much higher amounts Due to the lack of space congestion and high demand in many cases shipping clients are paying a premium well over these rates anywhere from 11 000 to 23 000 to ensure they can secure loading equipment amp vessel space for essential supplies

share 5 17 than the entirety of 2020 4 96 and peak season has only just started traditionally running from 1st June to 31st October Even at the Q1 shipping rate ZIM would be on target for full year earnings of around 20 per share a PE of less than 2 but rates continue to move much higher What is behind the shipping rate upsurge and how do we know this will continue 1 During covid Retail inventory has fallen to a 28 year low this means shops are scrambling to restock creating intense demand for goods from China Asia etc as more and more of the world reopens this demand will continue to compound for some time deep into 2022 and possibly 2023 2 Shipping has been going through a tough time the last decade and as a result the number of ships is at a low The worldwide inactive container fleet is now just 2 8 of the global fleet and primarily consists of vessels waylaid by accidents urgent maintenance sanctions and waiting periods before upcoming service Anything that can be deployed is already deployed as it takes approx 3 years to build new vessels this supply pressure will not be relieved for at least 18 24 months 3 Additional pressure is being placed on shipping due to congestion at ports a vessel that is delayed by a week or more will miss its scheduled rotation which results in a cancelled blank sailing Covid means there are a lower number of staff at each port trying to deal with a larger than normal backlog with more and more vessels turning up every day None of the above 3 factors are going to abate any time soon and the likelihood is that things will get worse before they get better meaning elevated rates for all of this year and likely towards the end of 2022 and perhaps beyond A quick calculation for full year earnings ZIM carried 818 000 TEUs during the first quarter of 2021 The average freight rate per TEU was 1 925 compared to 1 091 for the first quarter of 2020 ZIMs current capacity is 429 205 TEU which equates to a full year figure in the region of 3 400 000 TEU transported This leads to a turnover of 7bn average shipping rate of 2000 up to 10bn if average rate is 3000 per TEU In Q1 1 74Bn revenue resulted in earnings of 5 17 so the full year should be somewhere in the region of 20 to 29 sound like buying a dollar for 50 cents ZIM management have the share holders interests at heart on 22 April the company announced it was paying off 351 6 million of secured debt 2 years early one of the reasons for this was that the terms of the debt prevented the company from paying a dividend During Q1 earnings ZIM announced a 5 special dividend of 2 00 ex dividend date of Aug 25 2021 ZIM also confirmed their intention to distribute 30 50 of 2021 net income to shareholders via special dividends this should equate to approx 10 per share Catalysts Q2 Q3 Earnings Peak shipping rates season is Q3 Continued Increased demand for products by consumers as the world comes out of covid coupled with low retail inventories 2021 2022 Profit sharing by way of 30 50 special dividends the promise of juicy dividends will help keep the share price elevated and reduce selling volume Increased Demand coupled with lack of fleet supply port unloading delays and congestion will maintain and likely increase spot rates further and keep them elevated until the end of 2022 and into 2023 It will take several years for shipping new builds to bring the worldwide fleet to a level where supply will match demand2023 Additional 10 ships My Positions 1050 Shares 41670 1 x 50 Oct Call 220 4 x Cash Secured Puts 1729 amp x200B https preview

short traders and shares will soar to record high within a couple of weeks MOXC a Chinese based social network platform company was shorted by WOLFPAC research who posted a research report of MOXC as a failed business this Tuesday July 27th In the meantime 2 million shares were borrowed to be sold during the trading time 1 million of those hitting the bid price of the circuit breaker within a few seconds at 10 00 cause the share price plunged from 19 bux to under 14 during that trading hour Tuesday MOXC was opened at 16 79 and closed at 15 24 10 lower than the opening Today MOXC was traded at 17 2 during the before market time Sounds so far so good 2 million shares were borrowed by paying 44 BLS rate daily which caused the shortable shares of IBKR from average 1 8 2 2 million per day to plunge to 100K till the before market of Thursday but the stock price still trading between the range from 15 17 about 15 lower than the opening price this week But we also notice that among 90 of the 2 million shares were traded under 15 that short trader s position is obviously underwater WOLFPACK seems to fall into 2 thorough fallacies that cause it can t make a profit or not much profit by its maneuver Fallacy One the value of MOXC share MOXC s inside value obviously isn t worth the current trading price or any price during the past 2 months So do AMC and GME While AMC still trading at 40s and GME at 180s today that are their trading value a value that investors pour their belief and hope in You told shareholders that AMC doesn t have value so as to GME that can t hurt AMC a penny EVERY holder of AMC knows that Holders don t expect AMC will quickly turn profitable and grow to a mega they just hold a belief that everyone holds AMC but sells it the price of AMC will go to the moon MOXC s has an exactly identical scenario Most of the holders of MOXC are Chinese they know 1 better what they are trading even better than WOLFPACK Those Chinks won t get hurt by telling them the stock they are trading doesn t worth a penny they know that already just as Yoloers of WSB know AMC The shorting report of MOXC doesn t really work Fallacy Two the trading behaviors of shareholders WOLFPACK

report was posted the 2 million shares were borrowed from its broker and hit the market to short the price Is that legal Let s put this question besides for now That triggered the Circuit Breaker once WOLFPACK expected the fuse would trigger shareholder s stop loss function to automatically close their position selling stock they hold to further hit the stock price to even lower to trigger second even third fuse WOLFPACK doesn t know those Chinks well Chinese traders don t use this function they stop loss manually and most of them even use buy more as their stop loss maneuver FUTU the so called Chinese Robinhood even doesn t have this option to activate Thus the second fuse never happened Investors buy more shares at a lower price to dilute their position s average cost the stock was trading higher after that riot leaving WOLFPACK s short position in the lower zone and suffering the floating loss MOXC is obvious a stock that was maintained by a House By study the sortable stock borrowing interest rate SLB of IBKR as following MOXC s SLB is continually going low but kept above 40 despite the short interest wasn t much on July 15th That is a shred of strong evidence that MOXC shares were highly 2 concentrated to few holders we call them the House The SLB was going low since Jul till today even the shortable shares were consumed by big shorters as WOLFPACK from 2 2 million to 100K That also means the House was sold its shares to small retail traders during the past 2 weeks while the stock price was higher as 30 or 35 A strong signal of trading books shows that the House is back to the market and buy more shares which he sold at a double price which also maintains the stock price doesn t go lower as WOLFPACK expected That means the House will get more shares and the stock will go to more concentrated in few holders The management of MOXC may still hold 30 of all shares the House may hold about 60 share of total outstanding tradable shares which support the SLB keeping above 40 10 of share about 2 million was borrowed by short traders MOXC is facing liquidity risk now there aren t any shares that could be traded or short traders to cover In case the House stop lent out his shares shorters have to buy back those shares immediately within 3 trading days That would cost the stock price soar to double even triple of today s Option trading 1 By studying the open interest of Aug options there isn t enough long call position built to protect short position Thus huge upside risk exposure left for those shorters included WOLFPACK Any risk happened shorters have only one way to buy back shares to cover which causes the stock price to soar higher and quicker we call that short squeeze 2 Above strike 20 there are total 20K calls among 20 40 strike prices were shorted That isn t too much compare to other underlyings But compared to July 15th there were less than 3K 20K is a big number compared to only 10 of outstanding shares liquidity left in the

and shares will soar to record high within a couple of weeks MO XC a Chinese based social network platform company was shorted by WOLFPAC research who posted a research report of MO XC as a failed business this Tuesday July 27th In the meantime 2 million shares were borrowed to be sold during the trading time 1 million of those hitting the bid price of the circuit breaker within a few seconds at 10 00 cause the share price plunged from 19 bux to under 14 during that trading hour Tuesday MO XC was opened at 16 79 and closed at 15 24 10 lower than the opening Today MO XC was traded at 17 2 during the before market time Sounds so far so good 2 million shares were borrowed by paying 44 BL S rate daily which caused the shortable shares of IB KR from average 1 8 2 2 million per day to plunge to 100K till the before market of Thursday but the stock price still trading between the range from 15 17 about 15 lower than the opening price this week But we also notice that among 90 of the 2 million shares were traded under 15 that short trader s position is obviously underwater WOLFPACK seems to fall into 2 thorough fallacies that cause it can t make a profit or not much profit by its maneuver Fallacy One the value of MO XC share MO XC s inside value obviously isn t worth the current trading price or any price during the past 2 months So do A MC and G ME While A MC still trading at 40s and G ME at 180s today that are their trading value a value that investors pour their belief and hope in You told shareholders that A MC doesn t have value so as to G ME that can t hurt A MC a penny EVERY holder of A MC knows that Holders don t expect A MC will quickly turn profitable and grow to a mega they just hold a belief that everyone holds A MC but sells it the price of A MC will go to the moon MO XC s has an exactly identical scenario Most of the holders of MO XC are Chinese they know 1 better what they are trading even better than WOLFPACK Those Chinks won t get hurt by telling them the stock they are trading doesn t worth a penny they know that already just as Yoloers of WS B know A MC The shorting report of MO XC doesn t really work Fallacy Two the trading behaviors of shareholders WOLFPACK may know a little bit of the inside value of MO XC won t work just as he knows the situation of AM C G ME So he not only post the report but also hit the market by manipulating the price At the same time report was posted the 2 million shares were borrowed from its broker and hit the market to short the price Is that legal Let s put this question besides for now That triggered the Circuit Breaker once WOLFPACK expected the fuse would trigger shareholder s stop loss function to automatically close their position selling stock they hold to further hit the stock price to even lower to trigger second even third fuse WOLFPACK doesn t know those Chinks well Chinese traders don t use this function they stop loss manually and most of them even use buy more as their stop loss maneuver FU TU the so called Chinese Robinhood even doesn t have this option to activate Thus the second fuse never happened Investors buy more shares at a lower price to dilute their position s average cost the stock was trading higher after that riot leaving WOLFPACK s short position in the lower zone and suffering the floating loss MO XC is obvious a stock that was maintained by a House By study the sortable stock borrowing interest rate SL B of IB KR as following MO XC s SLB is continually going low but kept above 40 despite the short interest wasn t much on July 15th That is a shred of strong evidence that MO XC shares were highly 2 concentrated to few holders we call them the House The SL B was going low since Jul till today even the shortable shares were consumed by big shorters as WOLFPACK from 2 2 million to 100K That also means the House was sold its shares to small retail traders during the past 2 weeks while the stock price was higher as 30 or 35 A strong signal of trading books shows that the House is back to the market and buy more shares which he sold at a double price which also maintains the stock price doesn t go lower as WOLFPACK expected That means the House will get more shares and the stock will go to more concentrated in few holders The management of MO XC may still hold 30 of all shares the House may hold about 60 share of total outstanding tradable shares which support the SL B keeping above 40 10 of share about 2 million was borrowed by short traders MO XC is facing liquidity risk now there aren t any shares that could be traded or short traders to cover In case the House stop lent out his shares shorters have to buy back those shares immediately within 3 trading days That would cost the stock price soar to double even triple of today s Option trading 1 By studying the open interest of Au g options there isn t enough long call position built to protect short position Thus huge upside risk exposure left for those shorters included WOLFPACK Any risk happened shorters have only one way to buy back shares to cover which causes the stock price to soar higher and quicker we call that short squeeze 2 Above strike 20 there are total 20K calls among 20 40 strike prices were shorted That isn t too much compare to other underlyings But compared to July 15th there were less than 3K 20K is a big number compared to only 10 of outstanding shares liquidity left in the market 20K calls means 2 million shares While stock price soar to over the strike price option traders have to buy back short call to cut loss or buy relative amount stock to cover his short call that was called gamma squeeze an even 10 times strong squeeze than stock short squeeze Closing 3 MO XC was seriously shorted in the past 3 trading days left huge upside delta exposure stock trader and gamma exposure options trader You don t stand in front of a running train You either keep yourself beside the rail and watch the train running through or jump in the carriage to enjoy the speed by holding some shares WOLFPACK WILL BE CRASHED 4

Financial Crimes Syndicate A P Mathew A P Mathew Published Jul 27 2021 Follow I m an Indian immigrant who loves the United States of America This love resonates in the deepest caverns of my heart I love American values and respect those who have came before me wearing the uniform I served in the United States Marine Corps as a rifleman as a testimony to my patriotism Like most patriots I am committed to the American Dream for ALL AMERICANS Upon my honorable discharge I attended Harvard University and later on business school nearby at Bentley I believe the American Dream is still viable and reachable for the average man which is why I reached for higher education That being said I went into finances as means of achieving this dream while being service connected disabled But today I feel the American dream is jeopardized by the unscrupulous I recently discovered that Citadel Securities out of Chicago and Susquehanna International Group LLP SIG has been illegally naked shorting and cheating global retail investors Citadel serves as broker market maker and short seller to 80 of retail investors here in the U S and some abroad They use a proprietary software application called Citadel Connect which is a dark pool application This particular application is unique because of it s clandestine features Citadel Connect has over 8000 securities enrolled in smart order routing and don t have to report to FINRA Yes you read that correctly ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY through any U S Government financial governance agencies All this while they serve as the Market Maker Citadel found a financial gray area and has been exploiting it for YEARS Essentially ripping off retail investors on a monumental scale through market manipulation This goes beyond the controversy with the PFOF Payment for Order Flow with discredited broker Robinhood who was caught red handed ripping off their retail investor clients on Citadel s behalf They have also been hiding their FTDs Failure to Delivers which is another highly illegal tactic The blatant and criminal act of market manipulation using dark pools to re route a majority of retail buy orders and the consistent shorting and dodging of ftds by using married puts should be enough proof that Citadel is exploiting the MM privileges they have been granted It s impossible to determine how much profit they have made and how much American wealth and treasure has been swindled using these illegal methods But it s clear to me that either the SEC is in on the take or they really are that incompetent I say this because somehow Citadel Securities managed to be Hedge Fund Market Maker and an unregistered Dark Pool and no one had said a word not even batted an eye It had previously occurred to me that this Wall Street Bets saga was tantamount to a black swan event and brushed it off However I recently looked up some of AMC s AMC financials and their fundamentals AMC has been shorted into the BILLIONS GME is even worse There is not doubt in my mind that Citadel and 22 other Hedge Funds have overleveraged themselves are into a critical predicament There is no way they would be able to cover their shorts It s mathematically impossible according to the studies I ve conducted Which is probably why the DTCC came out with their bail out plans an SFT Securities Financing Transaction This plan would essentially stop a perceived or existential market crash when the Hedge Funds in this play get margin called Additionally it s clear to me that they must be reaching deep into their clients pocket to short the stock each week Or they re borrowing from anyone who is silly enough to lend to them This includes the Federal Government and their Reverse Repo I would further venture to say that their clients would not be able to take their money out to avoid the inevitable The HF s were also inclined to disrupt retail investors mentioning their predicament publicly Just ask Peter Hann CFA or Cristhian Andrews if you have any doubts Additionally it can be noted Social Media personalities like Trey Trades Matt Khors have been silenced by getting YouTube to shut down their channels These Hedge Funds have also spent BILLIONS of dollars in order to produce bad press FUD through their journalistic holdings like Motely Fool and Market Watch They have been paying Finance journalist sums of money to demote AMC GME stock as a bad investments detering new investors All these things I ve listed are criminal acts and hence highly illegal We still do not know why there has been no action by the SEC or any

Financial Crimes Syndicate A P Mathew A P Mathew Published Jul 27 2021 Follow I m an Indian immigrant who loves the United States of America This love resonates in the deepest caverns of my heart I love American values and respect those who have came before me wearing the uniform I served in the United States Marine Corps as a rifleman as a testimony to my patriotism Like most patriots I am committed to the American Dream for ALL AMERICANS Upon my honorable discharge I attended Harvard University and later on business school nearby at Bentley I believe the American Dream is still viable and reachable for the average man which is why I reached for higher education That being said I went into finances as means of achieving this dream while being service connected disabled But today I feel the American dream is jeopardized by the unscrupulous I recently discovered that Citadel Securities out of Chicago and Susquehanna International Group LLP SIG has been illegally naked shorting and cheating global retail investors Citadel serves as broker market maker and short seller to 80 of retail investors here in the U S and some abroad They use a proprietary software application called Citadel Connect which is a dark pool application This particular application is unique because of it s clandestine features Citadel Connect has over 8000 securities enrolled in smart order routing and don t have to report to FINRA Yes you read that correctly ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY through any U S Government financial governance agencies All this while they serve as the Market Maker Citadel found a financial gray area and has been exploiting it for YEARS Essentially ripping off retail investors on a monumental scale through market manipulation This goes beyond the controversy with the PFOF Payment for Order Flow with discredited broker Robinhood who was caught red handed ripping off their retail investor clients on Citadel s behalf They have also been hiding their FTDs Failure to Delivers which is another highly illegal tactic The blatant and criminal act of market manipulation using dark pools to re route a majority of retail buy orders and the consistent shorting and dodging of ftds by using married puts should be enough proof that Citadel is exploiting the MM privileges they have been granted It s impossible to determine how much profit they have made and how much American wealth and treasure has been swindled using these illegal methods But it s clear to me that either the SEC is in on the take or they really are that incompetent I say this because somehow Citadel Securities managed to be Hedge Fund Market Maker and an unregistered Dark Pool and no one had said a word not even batted an eye It had previously occurred to me that this Wall Street Bets saga was tantamount to a black swan event and brushed it off However I recently looked up some of AMC s AMC financials and their fundamentals AMC has been shorted into the BILLIONS GME is even worse There is not doubt in my mind that Citadel and 22 other Hedge Funds have overleveraged themselves are into a critical predicament There is no way they would be able to cover their shorts It s mathematically impossible according to the studies I ve conducted Which is probably why the DTCC came out with their bail out plans an Securities Financing Transaction This plan would essentially stop a perceived or existential market crash when the Hedge Funds in this play get margin called Additionally it s clear to me that they must be reaching deep into their clients pocket to short the stock each week Or they re borrowing from anyone who is silly enough to lend to them This includes the Federal Government and their Reverse Repo I would further venture to say that their clients would not be able to take their money out to avoid the inevitable The HF s were also inclined to disrupt retail investors mentioning their predicament publicly Just ask Peter Hann CFA or Cristhian Andrews if you have any doubts Additionally it can be noted Social Media personalities like Trey Trades Matt Khors have been silenced by getting YouTube to shut down their channels These Hedge Funds have also spent BILLIONS of dollars in order to produce bad press FUD through their journalistic holdings like Motely Fool and Market Watch They have been paying Finance journalist sums of money to demote AMC GME stock as a bad investments detering new investors All these things I ve listed are criminal acts and hence highly illegal We still do not know why there has been no action by the SEC or any governing bodies The simple truth remains Ken Griffin is a white collar criminal and Citadel Securities is an organized crime syndicate I would describe him in the same manner as the late and infamous

28,ou3si8,t2_bqa2d,1627584983,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ou3si8/hims_on_sale/,1,HIMS ON SALE, By Riyado Sofian from seeking Alpha Investment Thesis The telehealth industry saw an explosion of adoption as a result of the pandemic Hims amp Hers HIMS a DTC telehealth company certainly enjoyed this tailwind However HIMS still has room to grow beyond the pandemic as there are clear growth initiatives that HIMS could take HIMS operates a high margin subscription business model which saw many copycats and competitors flocking in to take market share Despite the competitive risks HIMS has a unique approach in marketing its products which builds a lasting emotional connection with customers Its strong brand is HIMS key differentiator Combined with strong fundamentals and a long growth runway I believe HIMS is an attractive BUY Riding The Telehealth Wave Telehealth the practice of using telecommunications technologies to conduct healthcare services was not a very popular option for consumers to fulfill their healthcare needs The concept of telehealth was alien to many including me but the pandemic brought light to this sector causing a surge in its adoption Social distancing restrictions and fears of contracting the virus during in person visits prompted patients to turn to virtual healthcare as an urgent solution According to a McKinsey study https www mckinsey com industries healthcare systems and services our insights telehealth a quarter trillion dollar post covid 19 reality only 11 of consumers used telehealth in 2019 By May 2020 the number rose to 46 as people used telehealth to replace canceled healthcare visits The positive reception of using telehealth also meant that this trend is likely here to stay The study found that 76 of consumers indicated that they are now interested in using telehealth going forward with 74 reported high satisfaction Furthermore 57 of healthcare providers viewed telehealth more favorably than they did before the pandemic and 64 of them are more comfortable using it Based on McKinsey s analysis 20 of all healthcare spend in the US could potentially be virtualized which totals to about 250 billion annually This is possible given how telehealth eliminates or alleviates some of the problems commonly found in traditional healthcare systems e g long wait times healthcare accessibility and transportation barriers Telehealth offers a much more inexpensive accessible and convenient solution Source McKinsey A company riding the telehealth wave is Hims amp Hers a digitally native fully verticalized multi specialty telehealth platform that provides consumers access to high quality medical care HIMS products and services cover primary care mental health sexual health skincare and many more and they are available in all 50 states HIMS focuses on providing healthcare for conditions that are often stigmatized such as erectile dysfunction hair loss and depression By marketing itself as a playful and easygoing brand HIMS makes it convenient for people to receive healthcare without feeling embarrassed The success of this strategy is reflected by the fact that 80 of HIMS customers are seeking treatment for their particular conditions for the first time Moreover Millennials a somewhat image conscious generation make up the bulk of its customer base a strong testament to the effectiveness of HIMS stigma free brand Source HIMS March 2021 Investor Presentation To get access to HIMS products customers first choose the type of health issue they want to resolve through its website or mobile app The customer will then answer a set of questions regarding their condition customers are also encouraged to upload photos for visual reference HIMS will then connect the customer with a licensed healthcare professional who will then evaluate next steps such as recommending a product or two Since its inception in 2017 HIMS has completed 2 million telehealth consultations Note that HIMS does not own any of the healthcare providers within its platform Instead it has contractual agreements with Affiliated Medical Groups separate professional entities owned by licensed physicians which were incorporated with HIMS assistance for the specific purpose of these physicians to provide services through HIMS platform These agreements typically last 10 years These providers undergo a rigorous selection screening and training process prior to becoming a HIMS licensed provider As of 31 December 2020 HIMS has 220 licensed providers Source HIMS March 2021 Investor Presentation HIMS also partners with several pharmacies for the fulfillment and distribution of some of its products These pharmacies include TruePill Curexa Pharmacy and XeCare This way HIMS can focus on marketing its brand and educating its audience This proves to be an effective business model as seen by providers receiving strong reviews from customers posting a 94 average provider quality score and a 4 7 5 0 average patient rating for consultations At the same time HIMS has a high net promoter score of 65 That s how HIMS is riding the telehealth wave by incorporating an approachable brand strategy providing a delightful customer experience and offering a library of high quality products and services As a result HIMS became one of the fastest growing startups and one of the youngest companies to ever go public However HIMS is only scratching the surface and I believe it has more room to grow as it continues to disrupt the healthcare industry Growth Opportunities The most obvious growth opportunity for HIMS is to acquire more customers According to its investor presentation HIMS has a total of 312 000 subscribers at the end of 2020 For context there are about 38 7 million millennial men https www marketingcharts com charts us population distribution by age and gender in 2020 attachment censusbureau us population distribution by age group and gender june2021 age 18 to 34 in the US alone That puts HIMS at slightly less than 1 market penetration leaving a lot of room for the company to acquire more customers In my opinion given the company s quickly growing subscriber base I wouldn t be surprised if HIMS is able to secure 5 penetration within 5 years As HIMS acquires more customers the company also has the potential to expand revenue per customer While not the perfect metric average order value or AOV is a good proxy for revenue per customer AOV for the first quarter of 2021 was 74 up from 52 a year ago It is also nice to see the number of net orders trending alongside AOV which increased to 687 000 from 546 000 a year ago Additionally HIMS recently shifted their target demographic from general millennials to higher AOV millennials or richer millennials so to speak This provides the company leeway to bag extra dollars from customers as the company gets ready for category expansion By focusing on higher AOV customers HIMS is more likely to be successful in cross selling their products with each new customer acquired As HIMS stated The majority of Hims amp Hers customers are millennials at the beginning of their healthcare journey and Hims amp Hers intends to grow with them as their healthcare needs evolve Next HIMS could offer new products HIMS go to market strategy is to offer solutions for chronic and often stigmatized conditions that can be treated safely via telehealth require ongoing and recurring customer relationships and for which generic medication has been established as an effective means of treatment Initially HIMS started out with hair loss and ED products and has recently launched mental health dermatology and primary care verticals The company is eyeing to introduce more categories including sleep fertility diabetes and cholesterol to name a few As you can see the market opportunity for HIMS blows up to massive proportions as the company offers more products and services amp x200B Source HIMS March 2021 Investor Presentation HIMS could also expand geographically more specifically internationally Europe Canada and Australia are excellent destinations Another country that presents great potential is Indonesia Indonesian telehealth companies such as Alodokter and Halodoc are gaining steam here which validates Indonesians capability to adopt telehealth as part of their everyday lives There are also many HIMS copycats here https norm id and here https sozomen com in Indonesia which also confirms product market fit for HIMS in the Southeast Asian region amp x200B Source HIMS March 2021 Investor Presentation Another exciting offering that may contribute to long term growth is Hims amp Hers for enterprise a telehealth option for employers to extend health benefits to their employees Although a compelling value proposition its enterprise offering may not gain significant traction given that the B2B space is dominated by Teladoc TDOC and other traditional offerings such as Anthem ANTM Nonetheless enterprise offerings will contribute to HIMS s top line although it may not be as meaningful as some investors might hope In my view HIMS has a long growth runway ahead it is still an infant in a giant of an industry Competitive Risks Continuing my discussion about copycats I believe HIMS s biggest risk is competition The rise of copycats over the last few years shows that HIMS lacks intellectual property protection to prevent new entrants from eating a fair bit of market share This is because HIMS mainly sells generic drugs which typically have patents that have already expired As such it is easy for copycats to just find a drug distributor or fulfiller and launch their own brands Some copycats include Keeps https www keeps com and Lemonaid https www lemonaidhealth com However its biggest competition is Ro a strikingly similar business compared to HIMS Ro just like HIMS offers telehealth products and services for both men and women under the brand Roman and Rory respectively Ro however has another brand called Zero https quitwithzero com which is a treatment plan that helps people quit smoking something that HIMS has yet to launch I wouldn t be surprised if HIMS launch the same offering in the near future In fact that is what the subindustry has alluded to since its inception For example back in 2019 Ro founder Zachariah Reitano wrote a complaint https medium com zreitano on behalf of hims patients thank you for copying ro aba99193d231 about HIMS copying its online visit feature Following the incident I read somewhere before that the product manager responsible for copying Ro was immediately fired Whether that is true or not Ro still stands as HIMS biggest threat In March this year Ro raised a whopping 500 million https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 03 22 online pharmacy ro is said to raise funds at 5 billion value kml4u3wu to bring its valuation to 5 billion and reported 230 million in revenue in 2020 As a comparison HIMS had total revenue of 149 million in 2020 substantially lower than Ro Looking at their LinkedIn profiles Ro was founded in February 2017 while HIMS was founded in November 2017 so we can pretty much say that Ro had a head start and that it earned the title for originality Other competitive threats include other telehealth companies such as Teladoc and Amwell AMWL but they are not direct competitors as they are more B2B focused GoodRx GDRX a platform that offers price tracking and coupons for generic drugs actually offers better pricing compared to HIMS As an example 30 tablets of Finasteride a medication used for hair loss costs less than 8 when using GoodRx coupons For context HIMS charges 22 for the same drug Cost conscious customers may be discouraged by HIMS s price premium amp x200B Source HIMS March 2021 Investor Presentation There s also PillPack an online pharmacy run by Amazon AMZN When Amazon leverages its scale and large customer base it could be a problem for HIMS However I do not think it will materially impact HIMS in the long run given HIMS strong brand and focus on stigmatized conditions HIMS is incredibly effective in building a strong emotional connection with customers Here s CEO Andrew Dudum reiterating HIMS competitive advantage when asked about the increasing competition in the telehealth industry gt Despite a lot of the excitement that we re seeing in the space the model and the trends are really showing continued improved durability and unit economics as Spencer said I think when you step back you realize that we re operating in probably the largest market in the United States that really has yet to be disrupted by traditional technology and for the benefit of traditional consumers So at a 4 trillion market the at 70 or 80 of the market moving towards digital platforms like Hims and Hers over the next decade I think it s safe to say that there s a lot of room for a lot of big winners and I think there will be In addition to that though there s things that we re doing that create a really defensible advantages and moats for our business We re first to focus on strategically on building a direct trust and deep relationships through our brand that s resonating with a very young audience the generation that in ten years from now will be the largest spenders in healthcare that audience that we know exceptionally well Our rapid diversification of revenue as a result of having built that technology platform that allows us to scale so quickly we re going from something like sexual health and hair loss to last year in mental health primary care dermatology has all been possible because we ve invested so much in that technology platform to accelerate that diversity Lastly the team s ability and expertise in acquiring and monetizing and iterating exceptionally fast are showing to be really strong and defensible advantages This is a 3 year old company but we re pulling off things that I think are usually see as year 7 or 10 in the company s life cycle So a combination of all these things give me a confidence that we will be able to maintain a leadership role as more players enters this space and this space hopefully will improve a lot in the next 5 to 10 years Source HIMS 2020 Q4 Earnings Call Financials Turning to the financials HIMS reported strong results for Q1 2021 Revenue grew by 74 year over year driven by higher AOV and net orders beating estimates by 3 6 million More importantly management raised full year revenue guidance by 10 from 200 million to 224 million for FY2021 attributing to stronger fundamentals and higher expected marketing expense moving forward I have been closely following HIMS for the past year and I can say that management has been sandbagging their guidance since their SPAC investor presentation Despite the recent guidance raise 224 million in revenue only represents a 50 year over year growth still quite conservative in my opinion Some might argue that HIMS has tough comps to beat this year but I believe HIMS is not a COVID 19 play Rather it is a secular growth play that will stretch out for years or even decades to come I expect HIMS to beat revenue estimates in the coming quarters Source HIMS 2021 Q1 Earnings Release Earnings however were disappointing as it missed estimates by 0 19 dragged down by high marketing and SG amp A expenses at 27 million and 62 million respectively However a good portion of it was due to high stock based compensation which was a total of 34 2 million as compared to only 1 4 million from the year ago quarter Earnings should not be a concern at this stage as lossmaking is quite common for high growth companies Gross margin was 77 for the first quarter of 2021 compared to 69 in 2020 This figure is very high considering that HIMS is more of a consumer product business Management also mentioned that churn was in the mid single digit so a high margin recurring revenue stream will at least minimize the negative cash flow for the business Moving forward HIMS should benefit from economies of scale as it capitalizes on its growth plans HIMS ended the quarter with 323 million worth of cash cash equivalents and short term investments and with only 40 million expected adjusted EBITDA loss this year HIMS is well capitalized for at least the next few years Its current ratio also stands at 17x a strong balance sheet indeed As for valuations I d have to admit that it s difficult to say where the stock price will head in the short term In the past 6 months the price fluctuated between 8 and 25 I stayed in my seat during the whole roller coaster ride In the long run however I believe shares will trend upwards as the growth story for HIMS remains intact At 14 a share HIMS is trading at a 13x EV TTM Revenue This is not cheap by any means but it is relatively cheaper than Teladoc at 17x and GoodRx at 26x Conclusion Telehealth is an emerging industry and its growth has been accelerated by the onset of the pandemic Social distancing measures and fear of contracting the virus forced people to adopt telecommunication technologies as they sought advice and consultations from professionals virtually HIMS with its strong DTC strategy and growing telehealth platform is riding the telehealth wave While HIMS is unlikely to be a market leader in the space the company has a good chance of building market share in the massive healthcare industry The company can do so by leveraging its strong brand acquiring more customers expanding globally and offering more products However its growth ambitions may not be left uninterrupted Competition such as Ro and Amazon are larger and have more resources Despite all this I believe HIMS has what it takes to resonate well with Millennials given its strong branding and playful marketing approach allowing people to have access to high quality and affordable healthcare without feeling embarrassed On the other hand its playful brand can be a double edged sword as it may not resonate well with patients with more chronic conditions Also HIMS may also turn out to be just another health amp wellness brand given its focus on consumer products such as shampoos and vitamins as well as generic drugs that are purchasable in local pharmacies All in all HIMS has a strong brand great unit economics a fortress balance sheet and a long growth runway ahead Furthermore HIMS continues to deliver exceptional results Despite the risks I believe HIMS has the potential to create significant alpha position 275 SEP 17 21 10 CALL

develop ways to make money that is not payment for order flow in the future thus increasing the profit margins and net income 2 Robinhood will increase their userbase by 150x equating to 2 54billion people all of which have an average balance of the current user base in USA where stimulus checks money printers and high disposable income go brrrr 3 Robinhood increases the net revenue generated by each user by around 150x Either 150x more volume is traded per user or the bid ask spreads from payment for routing exceeds 150x current 4 A combination of the above 50x user growth and 3x profit margin growth 5 Assume that operating costs are fairly negligible and linear due to SaaS being economies of scale based Bear Case 1 Robinhood is a Trading software that s thinly veiled as a technology company and should be given the P E of a tech company that can scale exponentially 2 Robinhood faces regulatory risk expanding outside of USA and even if every man woman and child deposits what the average APE has on the platform right now and trades at the frequency of an average RH APE We would reach a P E of 217 3 If Robin hood abolishes the methods of Payment for order flow and uses monthly fees data charges it will lose a large part of the entirety of its branding It would be like if Apple abolished the iPhone Free Trading is their Model 4 As Order Flow is a linear business 1 unit of order flow results in 1 extra In order to reach 150x multiplier to reduce PE to reasonable tech company levels we would be looking at 150x the net volume being transacted on Robinhood 5 Robinhood Excerpts from S 1 Filing We incurred operating losses each year since our inception in 2013 through 2019 including net losses of 6 1 million 57 5 million and 106 6 million for fiscal 2017 2018 and

familiar with Coupang the Amazon of South Korea and the most valuable foreign based company to be listed on the NYSE since BABA in 2014 At the time of writing this it has a current market cap of 65B USD When it DPO d on March 11th the SoftBank backed company saw its share price jump from 35 to 63 5 an 80 single day increase Since that time it has traded down and stayed range bound within a fairly narrow band It currently trades for 38 Many analysts expect it to continue to perform at this level with some opportunity to receive a valuation catalyst when they report earnings on August 11th While this is certainly within the range of possible outcomes there is also a convergence of factors that create a bullish thesis for the coming quarter and years to come Some of these factors are outside of the sort of financials and fundamentals that drive a great deal of analysis for individual securities providing some opportunity to establish strong positions before a change in analysts ratings and further institutional investment Most of my analysis is based on global macroeconomic trends with an emphasis on externalities and stock stories and I believe there is an opportunity to get ahead of the curve an opportunity that I will endeavor to make the case for here through a somewhat traditional SWOT analysis focusing on the company the economic climate of Southeast Asia and greater market trends that make it a potentially excellent value A summary of CPNG itself Coupang is based in Seoul SK and is incorporated in Delaware It was founded in 2010 by Bom Kim a Harvard Business School drop out While Coupang in its current iteration looks nothing like the company he first founded this isn t that uncommon for tech companies and in this respect it bears some resemblance to the company it draws frequent comparison to Amazon While this is the tech giant with which Coupang is most frequently associated and the one that it emulates in many respects I think that there are arguments to be made that its future success is tied much more closely to Alibaba AMD Samsung and Sea Like Amazon Coupang has several different sectors This includes their core business of e commerce where they are clearly taking some of the lessons of Amazon and applying them offering their own brands of essentials on their platform food delivery both in the form of groceries where they once again have their own brands available for sale and also from restaurants small business solutions payment processing digital advertising and through their recent acquisition of Singapore based Hooq subscription video streaming services Strengths Coupang is already the largest online marketplace in South Korea Their active customer base added 21 this last year climbing above 16 million users in South Korea These customers also spent more with Coupang than they did the year before 44 Y Y There are 52 million people in South Korea so there is still a large portion of the market for them to tap into Furthermore they actually have a higher dollar retention rate than Amazon of 346 to 278 This means that after somebody first uses the platform they come back and spend more money in subsequent years In the case of Coupang and Amazon considerably more While we don t have information about the dollar retention rate of Chinese customers with Alibaba it is quite possible that these are the most valuable customers in the world You want to talk about a moat This is a moat Their goal is to make their customers unable to imagine life before Coupang and they have built a very successful brand based on the rapidity of their delivery 99 3 of their orders are fulfilled within 24 hours of the purchase Even foreign goods are delivered within just 3 days This is facilitated by their logistics network which emulates the Amazon warehouse model and the concentrated population density of the areas in which they operate 70 percent of the South Korean population lives within just 7 miles of a Coupang fulfillment center Returns are as simple as using their app to notify Coupang that you would like to return an item setting it outside your door and then within minutes one of their 15 000 full time drivers will have picked it up It really is an incredible business model They already have created their own end to end logistics network of manufacturing delivery warehouses and tech What they haven t built they have acquired They currently have over 100 fulfillment centers in 30 cities in South Korea Furthermore in 2020 Coupang is still operating cash flow positive with 302M despite their position as a rapidly growing company Analysts are expecting revenue to rise another 61 this year to 19 4B This correlates to 26 3 EPS this year Weaknesses The majority of Coupang s weaknesses can be described as traditional financials and the way in which they influence share price Quite simply put they won t be profitable especially soon particularly as they continue to expand into new markets There are lots of bullish indicators even here While net loss increased 180 operating loss declined 36 on a revenue increase of 74 4 2B It should also be noted that their 2020 gross income was also 92 of what they did in 2019 They are growing quickly but they are paying for it especially as their labor force jumped to 50 000 employees The company plans to double this workforce over the next few years as they continue to grow They aren t short on cash to fund this sort of expansionary effort however as Coupang previously received 3B from SoftBank and they certainly put it to work for them yielding a 33B profit for their investor They will be able to get infusions of cash just about any time they want EBITDA from 2020 provides the greatest reason for concern as their operating administrative and general costs rose with the completion of their network especially their fulfillment center capacity moving from 42M to 133M This is fairly typical of a growth company and I m really curious to see what their EBITDA looks like on August 11th There are also in fairness some issues with these employees and Coupang has been criticized for some of their labor practices They also recently had a fire in their logistics warehouse Lastly while I am unconcerned about competition in Korea I would be remiss to fail to mention that they do not benefit from protectionist policies and Amazon has recently tried to gain some market share in the country by taking a stake in 11Street This is a non issue for me because they can t provide comparable services to those provided by Coupang unless they are willing to make a considerably larger investment and dedicate a decade to creating a similarly structured logistics system Opportunities My enthusiasm for Coupang is based on the myriad diverse paths for future success including possibly explosive growth over the next couple years If you skipped the rest of the DD to get to this point I wouldn t blame you One of the chief knocks against Coupang has been the size of the market in South Korea There are two reasons why this is no longer the factor that it once was First I am extremely bullish on the South Korean economy in general Even if a market is small as long as it has more assets in it growth can be expected A quick look at my post history will reveal that I am also bullish long on AMD and I should probably be taking a good hard look at Samsung This has a lot to do with the South Korean government s plan to invest 450B into becoming a global chip manufacturing powerhouse For a sense of scale this is 9x the investment that the US recently pledged to manufacture this increasingly valuable commodity While their GDP growth rate is already nearly 3x that of Japan this savvy national strategy is only going to bring additional discretionary income to many Koreans among whom consumer spending has not been a historical strength in part due to the historical division of wealth inequality among South Koreans This is no longer the case and the South Korean middle class now comprises 53 of their population Over the last year personal disposable income grew at an average rate of 3 55 and private consumption jumped 2 4 from Q1 to Q2 Indeed Korea s strong COVID 19 response helped their GDP contraction rank among the lowest in OECD countries South Korean exports increased as a percentage of the global market share primarily driven by about a 4 growth in semiconductors They are already Asia s 4th largest economy and while I don t see an imminent reshuffling of this order having already moved to the 10th largest economy in the world passing Russia and Brazil in the past year they should pass Canada and Italy in the next two to three years In short even if Coupang stayed concentrated in South Korea strong economic policy has them well positioned to be the beneficiaries of a growing economy with steadily increasing discretionary income for a busy Korean middle class This leads me to my second point they aren t staying in South Korea They notably expanded their services to Japan and Taiwan this quarter and just announced that they were about to begin their operations in Singapore using this last expansion as a test platform to refine their broader expansion into the Southeast Asian market with its population of 650 million Coupang s next target for expansion appears to be Malaysia E commerce is thriving in Southeast Asia reaching a volume of 62B in 2020 up 63 from 2019 The expectation is that this market will be 172B by 2025 South Korea is already this region s third largest e commerce market While some would see this aggressive expansion as a logical next step there are two considerations that make it particularly valuable at this moment in time for Coupang the first is that they are already past the period of significant investment in their own infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities as exhibited by their financials Secondly Alibaba the region s largest online marketplace is facing an existential crisis which corresponds with market growth that fails to match e commerce growth in the region I won t go into that here What I will say is that while I do not expect Coupang to ever operate in China the world s second largest economy the rest of Southeast Asia suddenly has a much larger contested market share Threats There are two threats for us to consider when assessing CPNG as a growth stock The first pertains to its business there is a lot of competition in Southeast Asian e commerce with a range of players but particularly the well funded Shopee and Lazada Lazada is a subsidiary of Alibaba and there is way too much here for me to provide any sort of concrete analysis so instead I ll focus on Shopee There was a recent analysis on The Motley Fool comparing Shopee s parent company Sea Ltd SE to Coupang in which the analyst suggested that SE was the better buy based on their gaming business I reached the opposite conclusion shocker of the analyst at The Fool in no small part because of Sea s connection to Tencent particularly in regard to their gaming sector Yes Tencent holds 23 of SE s shares outstanding but it is more the potential issue with the licenses of LoL and Arena of Valor both developed by Tencent and which Sea publishes in Asia that has me slightly concerned I m not the only one either as SE has seen a share price drop of about 3 49 over the course of this week Mitigating this concern to some extent is that Sea s most important gaming title Free Fire the world s most downloaded game in 2020 is self published It should be noted that given the growth of e commerce in Southeast Asia that I am also very bullish long on SE but the value differential of EPS TTM for Sea 3 59 and CPNG 3 99 does not justify the market s current concern regarding potential over valuation of CPNG as opposed to SE SE currently trades at 18x this year s sales compared to Coupang s 3x SE currently has a market cap of 149 668B compared to Coupangs 65 092B While I do expect Sea and Lazada to grow over the next several years there is still a sizeable market for all three of these major players in the region This relates to the second threat general market perception of CPNG There are two stories being told here One is the apparent share price which again has failed to impress since it listed on the NYSE and the fairly widespread FUD coming through all the typical industry mouthpieces and the other story is the massive institutional insider investment over the last 6 months as well as some extremely curious options activity Leaving the options out of it because that is not how I am recommending playing this position the reality of the 147 251 715 insider shares purchased over the last 6 months tells a different story than the one currently circulating among retail investors 86 3 of the float is held by institutions This isn t a retail darling and the low volume corroborates this This is a company slowly being acquired into consolidated positions by the likes of Greenoaks and Blackrock while the business makes significant moves not reflected in the share price The 1 34B shares float are going to make this a very difficult stock to move quickly so one should temper expectations accordingly and also avoid anything but the most conservative options plays in the short term as a result Why enter now I m expecting a beat on August 11th but that isn t driving my urgency What makes me want to expand my position in this company sooner rather than later is the revised thesis on Asian e commerce due to Alibaba s profound issues the ongoing COVID crisis and the trends in NYSE investment Retail investors have to conduct their own research and make their own decisions algorithms on the other hand can make massive acquisitions as soon as they are given a buy signal which in the case of CPNG could come sooner rather than later This is because of the anticipated shift over the next 10 18 months from stable large cap to speculative small mid cap growth We ve been hearing a mixed story about the rotation from growth to value for a while now and a cross section of ETFs can be used to make this case that even with AAPL adding 5 T like it was nothing value is up 16 YTD compared to growth up 10 YTD however the reopening narrative seems to have shifted since mid May with speculative growth such as ROKU gaining 11 compared with cyclicals and banks any of which provide ample evidence contrary to the popular rotational narrative Alphabet notwithstanding even with amazing ER beats large cap tech is selling off their ATHs While it is clear in recent days that some of these profits are flowing into fake internet money I m not here to tell you about that instead to bring your attention to an opportunity in a company that actually makes things and provides services How to play it LEAPS or shares only both of which are extraordinarily cheap right now and which probably won t be quite as inexpensive in the near future as Coupang s footprint in Asian e commerce continues to expand and investment in Asia further consolidates outside of China I think you have about a quarter to establish a strong position before it becomes about 50 more costly to do so This gives you some time to be patient with its growth but not so long that I would hesitate to make the move The real profits are made on surprise stories Disclosure This is not financial advice I have a small position in CPNG that I am looking to add significantly to I am a degenerate and a moron Do your own DD

business for autonomous vehicles TuSimple TSP currently has the best autonomous truck tech and is the closest to profitable commercialization TuSimple Stock The Driverless Truck Stock That Counts NVIDIA and Cathie Wood as Investors https finance yahoo com m 979f72e4 7022 3f0e a9a5 e20306d3e48e tusimple stock the html Why not Robotaxis Robotaxis are sexier and get all the media attention But commercialization of robotaxis currently poses several technical operational and business challenges Why not Robotaxis Technical Robotaxis are most profitable in downtown environments But those environments also pose the greatest challenges for an autonomous vehicle due to the large number of hard to predict agents No company has been able to solve those yet Pick up and drop offs are also technically very challenging because frankly most Uber Lyft pick up and drop offs in downtown environments are in illegal locations Human drivers can get away with that But a computer system cannot be programmed to perform illegal actions without the company being held responsible Why not Robotaxis Operational With Uber or Lyft the drivers do much more than just drive They purchase store clean fuel charge and maintain their vehicles With robotaxis all of this operational load falls to the robotaxi company Where are they going to store thousands of vehicles in downtown environments How are they going to charge them and perform all of the other operational tasks Even if this problem could be solved it means that robotaxis will scale much more slowly than Uber or Lyft did Why not Robotaxis Business The cost of robotaxis is currently extremely high due to the compute and sensor requirements Even if they perform perfectly it will take a long time before they are more profitable than vehicles with human drivers Further recent regulation in the US has shown that the public support is behind the drivers not the silicon valley companies Driving for Uber and Lyft has been a lifeline to people who lost their jobs during the pandemic So robotaxis are going to be viewed with hostility and likely backlash from the public and thus from governments Why Trucking Why Trucking Technical Highway driving though higher speed is much more structured than downtown environments In most ways it is much easier as evidenced by current level 2 driver assistance systems that easily handle most highway driving It does however require much longer range perception We will return to that below Why Trucking Operational Trucks already have all of the operational infrastructure They are stored at depots They have dedicated staff for their cleaning maintenance fueling etc Making trucks autonomous can simply leverage all of this infrastructure Why Trucking Business There is currently a shortage of truck drivers Freight shippers want to ship faster and not need to wait for drivers to sleep Truck driving is not a fun or healthy job It keeps people away from their families And trucking is a 4T industry globally 1T in the US Given the long lifespan of trucks and their ability to run for millions of miles the cost of the autonomous compute and sensor system can be amortized much better than for robotaxis In short the stars are all aligned for autonomous trucks today Why TuSimple The players who started with robotaxis have built their entire tech stack around detailed but short range perception Trying to convert that tech stack to trucking poses more challenges than one might expect But since TuSimple has focused on trucking from the beginning 2015 they have built their stack to have 1000 meter perception more than 4x other companies TuSimple also has been building up partnerships with the rest of the international freight ecosystem since the beginning They have key partnerships with OEMs Tier 1s shipping companies and part manufacturers in the US Europe and Asia None of the other autonomous companies have that TuSimple is also building their Autonomous Freight Network across the US in multiple phases Initially only corridors with favorable weather will be autonomous But as the technology improves to be able to handle heavy rain and snow additional corridors can be easily flipped from manual to autonomous mode But but aren t they Chinese They definitely have ties to China Their first investors were Chinese So what This actually gives them an advantage vs pure US players they have easy access to the entire trucking market in China Conclusion Given all of the above TuSimple is undervalued with its current valuation of about 15B Some other self driving companies are around 30B or more despite facing all of the challenges mentioned Sources https sec report Document 0001193125 21 091150 https sec report Document 0001193125 21 091150 https www
