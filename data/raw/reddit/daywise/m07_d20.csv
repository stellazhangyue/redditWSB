results I tweak certain assumptions in my previous forecast which allows me to reach a profit forecast of at least 20 million USD of profit This is good in a way that my forecast was reasonably reliable except that certain assumptions like funded accounts and average deposits per funded accounts were slightly off Nevertheless the positive implications brought along by higher user account and higher trading activity did compensate for some small misses My original assumptions for number of funded accounts were 450 000 and customer deposits to reach 25 billion USD in 1Q2021 I have to admit that I was assuming that management was pushing for funded accounts growth rate per quarter to remain at around 45 000 whereas the latest figures to reach the 600 000 funded accounts target for the management is around 75 000 accounts Looking at 2Q2021 I do not think Q2 would be an issue to meet such growth assumptions and considering my market view that Nasdaq 100 will reach further higher point to around 16 000 there are reasons to believe that the 600 000 accounts can be met I recently chatted with a Singaporean friend who funded a Tiger Brokers account pursuant to a marketing campaign by Tiger Brokers He explained that the recent experience gives him confidence to use Tiger application to trade and invest shares Considering that he is a highly conservative individual I has reasons to believe that more people will adopt Tiger Brokers application Nevertheless I certainly hope Tiger Brokers management can deliver even better results in terms of acquiring funded accounts launching new products enhancing user experience etc One low hanging fruit to enhance the company s profit i believe could be reducing the corporate tax paid by Tiger Broker I had a quick look at one of its competitors and notice that the implied tax rate paid by Tiger Brokers is around 25 If this can be reduced significantly even by 5 Tiger Brokers could easily pick up at least 1 5 million USD per quarter assuming the profit remains constant Naturally we know this is not possible Considering that settlement rate of US shares is only 30 now there is a significant room to lift up the profits of Tiger Brokers Furthermore with more customer deposits there would be avenues to capitalise on higher interest income Below is a breakdown of the key items of Tiger Brokers revenue stream 1 Commissions 2 Financing services fee 3 Interest income 4 Settlement and clearing fees 5 Other revenues With higher funded accounts plus customer deposits and trading activity it is only natural for the first 3 items to go up With the percentage of self clearing of US trades Tiger Brokers will easily earn another 16 million USD per quarter once funded accounts reach 600 000 and customer deposits reach 31 8 billion USD This is around 10 billion USD higher than 1Q2021 figures You will be able to note that I have tweaked down the funds per funded account to be more conservative If I were to use 57 000 USD per funded accounts the customer funds could easily go up to around 34 billion USD which is another 3 billion USD Considering that the commission is driven by trading turns and the amount of customer deposits this is good for the business Furthermore it is clear cut that the interest income will go up too which could potentially reach 23 million USD per quarter going into 2022 Assuming self clearing is completed by 1Q2022 the revenue from self clearing fees could potentially reach 16 million USD per quarter Commissions based on my assumptions could reach 65 million USD which I try to mange down the assumptions by assuming less trades made by per customer deposit USD Note that I did not use the same trading turn per customer deposit USD and instead use the 4Q2020 trading turn 1Q2022 1 Commissions 65 million USD 2 Financing services fee 2 4 million USD 3 Interest income 23 2 million USD 4 Other revenues 10 million USD assume unchanged 5 Settlement and clearing fees of 16 million USD In total this works out to 116 million USD of quarterly revenue which is reasonably conservative based on my assumptions should management achieved 600 000 funded accounts and 32 billion USD of funds in the accounts Tweaking up the profit margin to 30 instead of 25 8 now the profit per quarter could easily reach 35 million USD which then translated to around 140 million USD of profit for 2022 Note that this is before taking into account any funded accounts acquired in 2022 which is highly UNLIKELY Considering that Tiger Brokers is in a high growth sector Fintech and wealth management platform with a growing TIger community the current valuation based on current share price of around 2 9 billion USD market market would imply a next year PE ratio of only 20 To me this is a good time to acquire a good business in a growth sector Noting that the Company s management has delivered the results so far and had not failed me in 1Q2021 I will continue to monitor its performance and keep my holdings in Tiger Brokers shares Note the risk here is if market collapses and never recovers but it is human beings character to always pick themselves up after falling down So I do not have any concerns that there will be no trading in the long run Once a sizable funded accounts have been acquired even if market collapse for 1 5 years typical market bear lasts 18 months there will still be businesses for a growing company This is not forgetting that there are other wealth management products like funds that users can switch to during times of uncertainty Note that Trade Republic an European trading platform with only 10 billion USD of customer deposits has an implied market valuation of 5 3 billion USD See the following link for your information https www cnbc com 2021 05 20 european robinhood rival trade republic raises 900 million of funding html As always the above should not be construed as any investment or trading advice Note that forecasts are difficult to make and no one can claim 100 accuracy as the forecasts are only as good as its assumptions As such I do not want to go beyond year 2022 to forecast 2023 2024 2025 market conditions for Tiger Brokers My short writeup to summarise my thoughts on Tiger Brokers figures

shame of your ignoble blood May you choke on the queasy convulsing nausea of your own trite foolish beliefs You are weary stale flat and unprofitable You are grimy squalid nasty and profane You are foul and disgusting You re a fool an ignoramus And what meaning do you expect your delusional self important statements of unknowing inexperienced opinion to have to us who think and reason What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat spinning rabidly in a circle waiting for the bite of the snake You

physics that we know I m sorry I can t go on This is an epiphany of stupid for me After this you may not hear from me again for a while I don t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia or any of the rest of this drivel Duh I mean really stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective True

of luck in the emotional and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you You re an idiot A moron of the highest order You re so stupid it s a wonder and a pity you can remember to breath Intelligent ideas bounce off your head as if it were coated with teflon Creative thoughts take alternate transportation in order to avoid even being in the same state as you If you had an original thought it would die of loneliness before the hour was out On an intelligence scale of 1 to 10 10 corresponding to the highest attainable IQ you re rating is so far into negative numbers that one would need to travel into another quantum reality in order to even catch a distant glimpse of it Your personality is that of a rabid Chihuahua intent on destroying its own tail Your powers of observation are akin to those of the bird that keeps slamming into the picture window trying to get that other bird it keeps seeing You are walking talking proof that you don t have to be sentient to survive and that Barnum was thinking of you when he uttered his immortal phrase regarding the birth of a sucker You are at varying times tedious boring and even occasionally earth shatteringly hilarious in your idiocy routinely childish moronic pathetic wretched disgusting and pitiful You are wholly without any redeeming social grace or value If God ever decides to give the planet an enema

forever live in shame You have nothing to say and Godwin s Law does not apply when writing about you You are the anti Midas for all that you touch becomes valueless and unusable Mothers gather their children close when you appear You are an aberration a corruption and a boil that needs to be lanced You are a poison in need of being vomited You are a tooth so rotten it infects the whole body You are sperm that should have been captured in a condom and flushed down a toilet I don t like you I don t like anybody who has as little respect for others as you do Go away you swine You re a putrescent mass a walking vomit You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt You are a jerk a cad and a weasel Your life is a monument to stupidity You are a stench a revulsion a big suck on a sour lemon You are a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world Meaningful to no one abandoned by the puke drooling giggling beasts that sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you You are a monster an ogre a malformity I wretch at the very thought of you You have all the appeal of a paper cut Lepers avoid you You are vile worthless less than nothing You are a weed a fungus and the dregs of this earth And did I mention you smell Monkeys look down on you Even sheep won t have sex with you You are unreservedly pathetic starved for attention and lost in a land that reality forgot You are a waste of flesh On a good day you re a halfwit You are deficient in all that lends character You have the personality of wallpaper You are dank and filthy You are asinine and benighted You are the source of all unpleasantness You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go You are a fiend and a coward and you have bad breath You are degenerate noxious and depraved I feel debased just for knowing you exist I despise everything about you and I wish you would go away I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are The only thing worse than your logic is your manners Maybe later in life

is getting into the nugget game Popeye s to Launch Tendies https finance yahoo com news popeyes launching chicken nuggets first 164500590 html We all remember the lines of customers waiting hours to get their Popeye s chicken sandwiches and the so called Chicken Sandwich Wars https www mashed com 247340 the chicken sandwich wars just got more intense This sandwich actually caused a man to be fatally stabbed https www mashed com 173602 argument over popeyes chicken sandwich ends in death Even COVID couldn t slow this thing down https www qsrmagazine com fast food coronavirus crisis no

Nuggets are unlike anything you may have experienced before We believe that these piece s of crunchy juicy delicious chicken will have guests question how they ever enjoyed chicken nuggets before this So who is QSR and who is their main competition Good question Check out the big brain on Brad QSR s subsidiaries include Popeye s Burger King and Tim Hortons We ll dig into Popeye s in a minute As for the others we have Burger King Home of the Whopper Whoppers are good Also the OG of the chicken sandwich game Interesting Fries could be better TBH Then there s Tim Hortons I don t know anything about Tim Hortons but I hear Canadians love it It s therefore probably safe to assume this place has something to do with very polite moose playing ice hockey Yeah that sounds right Now on to the reason we re here Popeye s Popeye s makes the best damn fried chicken you ve ever had in your life The sides and biscuits are also top notch We previously addressed the legendary chicken sandwich But you already knew all that What you may not have known is that Popeye s has been stockpiling chicken for 6 months Basically hedging chicken the way airlines hedge oil Clearly Popeye s management are geniuses There are currently nationwide chicken shortages and prices are spiking Popeye s has positioned themselves beautifully to handle this and crush the competition Chicken Stockpile https nypost com 2021 07 14 popeyes stockpiling chicken amid shortages price hikes Speaking of competition we are going to have to talk about YUM s KFC Popeye s chicken is far better than KFC s This is not debatable It is known And Popeye s actually treats it s customers like humans with dignity and respect by packaging their family meals in a box Meanwhile KFC provides a feed bucket like we re some sort of barnyard animals Colonel Sanders is an asshole I really debated on if I should include this section or not In the end I felt it was my doodie to be real with you guys We ve all been there PopAss is defined by Urban Dictionary as The gastrointestinal phenomenon experienced by many people after they eat Popeye s Chicken including but not limited to explosive and watery diarrhea uncontrollable flatulence and upset stomach Normally lasts until the next ferocious bowel movement Well I have been researching and testing this theory for many years I never knew I would have a useful reason to share my results My experience has shown that YUM s KFC will produce explosive diarrhea roughly 50 of the time It s pretty much a coin toss Popeye s spicy Chicken sadly has this effect about 60 of the time HOWEVER Popeye s mild produces this at a far lower rate 20 That means Popeye s averages out to about 40 overall which is in fact LOWER than KFC We don t even need to add

fantastic community for a better part of this year and I ve mostly taken part in general shitposting and hype plays I thought that this time I d like to add some value and talk about a company that has become one of my portfolio s favorites Embracer Group Please bare with me this is my first time posting DD so I know it won t be perfect I own this stock and genuinely think the company hasn t been getting the attention it deserves This is not financial advise nor is my intention to get you sidetracked from short squeeze plays such as AMC GME BB and others I am nothing but a humble retard talking about a company that is still in my opinion a steal regarding the fundamentals and growth prospects Embracer Group THQQF can be thought of as a mutual fund for gaming development studios It s a gaming conglomerate from Sweden owning a massive catalog of over 240 franchises and 69 internal game development studios across 40 counties With a market cap of close to 12 billion USD it is one the world s largest global gaming conglomerates Embracer Group s growth strategy has been to consistently acquire game development studios in order to achieve operational efficiencies such as lower costs while unlocking synergies and value by leveraging its growing independent eco system of video game companies One of its latest major acquisitions was Gearbox along with Aspyr Easybrain for SEK9 3B 1 07B known for being one the most famous franchises in the world Borderlands Other well known games IP include Saints Row Goat Simulator Dead Island Darksiders Metro and this year s steam smash hit Valheim Embracer Group s expanding portfolio of game development studios has converted into a growing pipeline of upcoming titles which benefit from constantly growing video game market https preview

rate CAGR between 2019 and 2023 to reach 204 6 billion I expect Embracer group to benefit from this growth trend as it is becoming a large behemoth in the video games industry As we can see in the PnL

a0a637374171ff8abc1889e6d1a0c9f03f8be4a4 Souce Investor Presentation https embracer com wp content uploads 2021 05 Embracer Interim Report Q4 pdf Embracer Group s EBITDA margin has been growing currently sitting slightly below 30 The only large gaming studio which has a greater EBITDA margin than Embracer is Activision which has ultra high margin Legacy titles such as World of Warcraft and Hearthstone Embracer does not have such legacy titles yet but in my opinion this year s success with Valheim has proven Embracer s ability to attract game development studios that can produce AAA titles in the future Analysts expect Embracer s EBITDA to grow by 10 5 and 13 9 in FY2022 and FY2023 respectively Currently Embracer s price sits around 220 SEK or 22USD for that matter Analyst estimates https www marketwatch com investing stock thqqf analystestimates give a target price between 25USD 35USD giving Embracer Group 13 6 59 upside with current prices Despite its bright growth prospects expanding portfolio of world class studios and higher financial growth levels than its competitors Embracer is currently the most inexpensive amongst them e g CD Projekt stock price https finance yahoo com quote OTGLF is at the time of writing 47 66USD Embracer group trades with the cheapest multiple amongst its industry peers despite some relying on seasonal releases resulting in cash

company must have copious amounts of debt due to its extensive acquisition strategy Yet Embracer has essentially 0 debt The company acquires its studios through cash in hand and equity which is great as the management teams of the studios it acquires which usually are majority owners of these smaller studios get Embracer stock aligning their interests with their parent company Embracer does have a 6 billion SEK 600 million USD line of credit https news cision com embracer group ab r embracer group ab secures an unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility of sek 6 0 billion c3373818 that it can use for growth and acquisitions but the company hasn t yet published any acquisitions with credit Historically Embracer tends to announce new acquisitions along with interim reports Q4 20 coming 18th of August and FY20 coming 26th of August and these tend to have a positive effect on the stock price One risk for foreign investors is of course the currency risk However for instance the SEK USD rate has been relatively stable over the past few years seldom deviating by more than 10 during a 1 year period This risk is prevalent with other foreign companies as well so I personally don t see it as a major risk with the company Embracer Group is also more diversified than your average gaming company and thusly carries less risk if a single release fails to meet expectations Embracer s financials are steadily increasing and the company has a great pipeline of upcoming releases Additionally management is achieving operational efficiencies while the balance sheet remains debt free All in all I believe that the valuation multiple the market has attached to the stock does not reflect Embracer s growth prospects or position in the gaming industry I consider Embracer to be a hidden gem amongst gaming companies and it s only matter of time when the majority of investors wake up to Embracer s true value

Essential Patents SEP s NOK has been winning in Litigation and being paid damages and royalties , I entered a large long position on October 20 2019 based on momentum their flashy NASA 5G contract US government 5G cybersecurity contract and NOK s growing 5G market share In February of 2021 I furnished a little DD of NOK with a one year to 18 month price target of 14 possibly with an OTT exuberance at that time Afterwards I dug deeper into Nokia and it continues to be one of the most interesting stocks on the market Being an Autistic Silverback looking to buy more crayons to eat since my wife is too busy with her boyfriend and has no time to make me dinner I bought in with another large long position in April of 2021 Previously posted on the NOK subs I probably have more silver in my hair than the average Redditt Autistic Ape hence I prefer to be titled Silverback but I have equal exuberance and love of our communities here There is a lot to look into Nokia Bell Labs formerly named Bell Labs Innovations 1996 2007 is an American industrial research and scientific development company now owned by the Finnish company Nokia NOK which itself was established in 1865 Nokia Bell Labs headquarters is located in Murray Hill New Jersey the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world 9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories as well as 4 Turing Awards The C Programming Language as well as Unix was developed at Bell With the 5G 6G arms race heating up it is time for the 100 year old Nokia Bell Labs think tank and 155 year old NOK to be leveraged once more Hard SPECULATION Big tech trades human futures Zuboff The Age of Surveillance Capitalism IMO modern institutions are very cunning Everything they do has purpose From certain notorious figures in the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market I have learned this and scaled it into larger markets The behaviors are the same but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading Just trade whale for institution Nokia is seen in a negative light by retail and the whole WSB push on January 27 2021 further weekend NOK s image to traditional retail investors Many investors instantly rejected the notion of learning about this company Forgive me if you have disdain for WSB and the Robinhood investors but I believe that there is big money behind them BlackRock JPM etc They are a vehicle for change and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation Some of the DD are likely released by BlackRock themselves I ve seen some of the account s post histories Robinhooders are looked down upon yet under the guise of anonymity Hedgie s can release red herring DD that far exceeds any big name analyst report It smells fishy Don t forget what RH did with blocking purchases of BB GME AMC and NOK on January 27 2021 Announced on July 16 2021 Robinhood traders who held Gamestop AMC Nokia BlackBerry Bed Bath amp Beyond Naked

your claim and your losses negotiate with the company and pursue your claim in arbitration if necessary 2 Possible threads of speculation The outstanding shares of NOK is 5 6B however with a large float and a high percentage of short interest and public participation even NOK can be manipulated Impulse Wave 1 is often a test pump To gauge the retail demand levels Institutions love to do this and only create a melt up when an ideal motive wave can be created However with NOK short interest has been dropping from nearly 300M in January to 150M this month a 23 drop from last month Accumulation of Institutional Ownership has ranged from about 4 0 in Q4 2020 to 6 44 in Q2 2021 double that if one follows Fintel The Institutional Ownership has increased because of the analyst upgrades and the added possibility of dividends being reinstated Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases Are you in need of tools to seize the opportunities of 5G Would you prefer to win new revenue with low risk and minimal investment instead of spending CAPEX and time building an IoT network and developing new services Welcome to Nokia WING a managed service that offers operators the ability to support their enterprise customers with global IoT connectivity across borders and technologies It is live today with a truly global footprint but also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow no matter what directions it is taking There is nothing else like WING on the market Nokia website At the start of new bubbles CapEx Capital Expenditure for juniors get filled very quickly If we make a comparison to precious metals miners this company is a first wave major not a second wave junior i e in the early stages CapEx is high and that is why in October of 2019 NOK suspended dividends to reserve cash for increased spending in RD Since 2019 NOK has made major expenditures in RD In November of 2020 Nokia Elisa and Qualcomm together have achieved the fastest 5G speeds recorded in the world However in March of 2021 Nokia achieved a new record of over 4 5 Gbps speed for the first time during a trial on live commercial equipment 5G Market 5G Applications and Services Market value expected USD 132B in 2020 to 663B in 2027 The global 5G Applications and Services Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 25 8 from 2020 to 2027 According to Digital Journal July 14 2021 Article A 25 8 CAGR sounds good to me Verticals Manufacturing Energy amp Utility Media amp Entertainment IT amp Telecom Transportation amp Logistics Healthcare Retail Agriculture O amp G and Mining BFSI Construction Real Estate NOK is listed among in the Article among the 5G Industry Major Market Players NOK offers a service that has unlimited applications My favorite type of technology According to Statista The global market for Internet of things IoT end user solutions is expected to grow to 212 billion U S dollars in size by the end of 2019 The technology reached 100 billion dollars in market revenue for the first time in 2017 and forecasts suggest that this figure will grow to around 1 6 trillion by 2025 5G 6G is the LIFEBLOOD of IoT 5G is much more than just fast downloads its unique combination of high speed connectivity very low latency and ubiquitous coverage will support smart vehicles and transport infrastructure such as connected cars trucks and buses where a split second delay could mean the difference between a smooth flow of traffic and a 4 way crash at an intersection What is the number 1 problem that EV manufactures wish to solve right now Completely independent self driving 5G 6G is part of the solution Why is Elon Musk focusing on Starlink now It is the solution for Tesla s biggest roadblock Don t forget the June 29 2021 article about Musk and Starlink began Don Joyce a Nokia manager working from home at a remote lake cottage in Canada recently abandoned his painfully slow phone line internet in favor of satellite broadband service Starlink offered by Elon Musk s SpaceX Moreover Musk said he was talking to possible partners as a number of countries require operators to provide rural coverage as conditions of their 5G licenses 5G infrastructures are the neurons for IoT 5G is huge It is of UTMOST importance Why would the US go to such lengths to cripple China s Huawei for YEARS Huawei seems to be their number 1 target Key contracts and partnerships July 13 2021 We are progressing well with our three phased plan to achieve sustainable profitable growth and technology leadership laid out at our Capital Markets Day in March said Pekka Lundmark Nokia president and chief executive officer in a statement The FIRST company contracted to set up internet on the moon Partnering with SpaceX Why would astronauts on Earth have access to 5G at home but not have the same access to the same technologies when they are on the Moon Thierry Klein head of Enterprise and Industrial Automation Research Lab at Nokia Bell Labs is addressing the gap between communication technology on the Moon and technology astronauts have access to on Earth In October Nokia was named a NASA partner for its Tipping Point technologies for the Moon program receiving a 14 million contract to deploy the first LTE 4G communications system on the Moon 5G 6G will be essential for space travel Sounds like ARKX will need to look into this one Dec 1 2020 Nokia and AT amp T extend Worldwide IoT Network Grid WING collaboration to deliver seamless IoT connectivity to enterprises around the world and support upgrades to 5G As IoT networks transition to 5G and with Nokia WING also supporting 5G network slicing AT amp T will be able to partition its 5G network

s AI ML and analytics technologies The solutions will run on Google s Anthos platform Yes a Google partnership Market Share Sources are varying and biased and there needs to be more rigorous audits in this sector However you will get the idea 5G Hardware Market Share 2020 1 Huawei 28 2 Nokia 16 3 Ericsson 14 but for 2021 NOK is targeting a 4G and 5G market share between 25 to 27 in FY21 On July 16 2021 ERIC tanked over 11 due to retaliation for Sweden s China ban ERIC had a 28 market share in China and due to the retaliation ERIC lost 60 of its market share in China amounting to 300M While NOK only has 1 market share in China NOK has no fear of retaliation and only what to gain particularly since China needs NOK for its cloud services NOK 5G Contracts in last 9 months have more than doubled Moreover NOK s contracts are growing by leaps and bounds On October 5 2020 NOK had secured 100 5G Contracts but as of today NOK s contracts and market share are way up NOK has 170 Commercial 5G Deals 67 5G Live Operator Networks 230 Commercial 5G Agreements Patents The following figures of the following 5g players are very conservative as to NOK Investors accumulate shares Research companies accumulate patents Those who own the patents are the power brokers in the industry According to a GreyB total 5G European patents owned and granted as a live patents as of June 20 2020 and those

leader in SEP s The argument is that SEP ownership materially affects which patents actually matter and as of April 28 2021 and independent study by PA Consulting firms confined that Nokia owns over 3 500 patent families declared essential to 5G As such NOK is now the leader in SEP s Nokia s industry leading patent portfolio is built on more than 130 billion invested in R amp D since 2000 and is composed of around 20 000 patent families including over 3 500 patent families declared essential to 5G NOK President and CEO Pekka Lundmark has been leading NOK since August 1 2021 he has been steady understated and rather than exaggerate NOK s position he has delivered an earnings beat for Q1 FY21 and is expected to do the same on Q2 FY21 on July 29 2021 He has avoided money pits and has helped NOK grab market share and profitable 5G contracts Compare NOK to Ericsson through March 21 2021 and Market Cap and contracts to date amp x200B Nokia revenue for the quarter ending March 31 2021 was 6

Ericsson MC 38 50B price 11 61 up 4 52 over last year Clearly NOK and Ericsson are converging NOK is gaining market share has more 5G contracts SEP s cash surplus and Ericson investors are jumping over to NOK Don t forget Ericsson settled with NOK regarding patent litigation and has to pay NOK damages Ericsson said the settlement followed investigations by the U S Department of Justice DOJ into corruption including the bribing of government officials Ericsson settled with the DOJ in 2019 and agreed to pay over 1 billion in penalties NOK is successful in its Patent Litigation On April of 2021 after NOK received several favorable rulings Nokia and Lenovo settled a patent dispute in May of 2021 Ericson settled with NOK and agreed to pay NOK 97M Euro in June of 2021 Daimler agreed to pay Nokia for using its patents and Nokia will license mobile telecommunications technology to Daimler in July NOK launched patent lawsuits against OnePlus Technology throughout Europe and Asia NOK upgraded by analysts across the board On July 5 2021 Exane BNP Paribas analyst Stefan Slowinski upgraded NOK to Outperform from Neutral with a 7 70 price target On July 15 2021 Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval upgraded NOK from neutral to buy and raised his price target from 4 90 to 6 50 On July 14 2021 JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande upgrading Nokia to Overweight and a 7 80 price target That s 32 upside from the previous day s close of 5 88 Part of the analyst upgrade is because on July 13 2021 NOK updated its financial guidance for full year 2021 In the second quarter Nokia saw continued strength in the business improving its expectations for the full year Nokia now expects to revise upwards its prior outlook ranges for 2021 Nokia plans to provide full details on its second

has 585 Institutional Holders holding 6 44 an over 50 increase from February Also Nokia has a very high chance of reinstating dividends in 2022 and owning now would lower the cost basis Institutional investors including mutual funds now that NOK has passed the 5 threshold are increasing buys of Nokia and are also anticipating the possibility of reinstated dividends The mid point for dividends of tech stocks is 4 75 however if an investor bust NOK at 5 7 and the price is 11 50 by 2022 and Nokia is paying dividends of 4 75 than that investor is earning 54 6 cents per share equaling a return of

bananas ,This is taken from the comment section of this post https www reddit com r AskReddit comments 24vzgl you just won a 656 million dollar lottery what do utm source share amp utm medium ios app amp utm name iossmf The post it self is more showing how people fail when coming into large amounts of money I found it a good read and hope you can too So what the hell DO you do if you are unlucky enough to win the MOAS This is the absolutely most important thing you can do right away NOTHING Yes Nothing DO NOT DECLARE YOURSELF THE WINNER yet Do NOT tell anyone The urge is going to be nearly irresistible Resist it Trust me 1 IMMEDIATELY retain an attorney Get a partner from a larger NATIONAL firm Don t let them pawn off junior partners or associates on you They might try all law firms might but insist instead that your lead be a partner who has been with the firm for awhile Do NOT use your local attorney Yes I mean your long standing family attorney who did your mother s will Do not use the guy who fought your dry cleaner bill Do not use the guy you have trusted your entire life because of his long and faithful service to your family In fact do not use any firm that has any connection to family or friends or community TRUST me This is bad You want someone who has never heard of you any of your friends or any member of your family Go the closest big city and walk into one of the national firms asking for one of the Trust and Estates partners you have previously looked up on http www martindale com from one of the largest 50 firms in the United States which has an office near you You can look up attorneys by practice area and firm on Martindale 2 Decide to take the lump sum Most lotteries pay a really pathetic rate for the annuity It usually hovers around 4 5 annual return or less depending It doesn t take much to do better than this and if you have the money already in cash rather than leaving it in the hands of the state you can pull from the capital whenever you like If you take the annuity you won t have access to that cash That could be good It could be bad It s probably bad unless you have a very addictive personality If you need an allowance managed by the state it is because you didn t listen to point 1 above Why not let the state just handle it for you and give you your allowance Many state lotteries pay you your allowance the annuity option by buying U S treasury instruments and running the interest payments through their bureaucracy before sending it to you along with a hunk of the principal every month You will not be beating inflation by much if at all There is no reason you couldn t do this yourself if a low single digit return is acceptable to you You aren t going to get even remotely the amount of the actual jackpot Take our old friend Mr Whittaker Using Whittaker is a good model both because of the reminder of his ignominious decline and the fact that his winning ticket was one of the larger ones on record If his situation looks less than stellar to you you might have a better perspective on how large your winnings aren t Whittaker s jackpot was 315 million He selected the lump sum cash up front option which knocked off 145 million or 46 of the total leaving him with 170 million That was then subject to withholding for taxes of 56 million 33 leaving him with 114 million In general you should expect to get about half of the original jackpot if you elect a lump sum maybe better it depends After that you should expect to lose around 33 of your already pruned figure to state and federal taxes Your mileage may vary particularly if you live in a state with aggressive taxation schemes 3 Decide right now how much you plan to give to family and friends This really shouldn t be more than 20 or so Figure it out right now Pick your number Tell your lawyer That s it Don t change it 20 of 114 million is 22 8 million That leaves you with 91 2 million DO NOT CONSULT WITH FAMILY when deciding how much to give to family You are going to get advice that is badly tainted by conflict of interest and if other family members find out that Aunt Flo was consulted and they weren t you will never hear the end of it Neither will Aunt Flo This might later form the basis for an allegation that Aunt Flo unduly influenced you and a lawsuit might magically appear on this basis No I m not kidding I know of one circumstance related to a business windfall not a lottery where the plaintiffs WON this case Do NOT give anyone cash Ever Period Just don t Do not buy them houses Do not buy them cars Tell your attorney that you want to provide for your family and that you want to set up a series of trusts for them that will total 20 of your after tax winnings Tell him you want the trust empowered to fund higher education some help not a total purchase of their first home some provision for weddings and the like whatever Do NOT put yourself in the position of handing out cash Once you do if you stop you will be accused of being a heartless bastard or bitch Trust me It won t go well It will be easy to lose perspective It is now the duty of your friends family relatives hangers on and their inner circle to skew your perspective and they take this job quite seriously Setting up a trust a managed fund for your family that is in the double digit millions is AMAZINGLY generous You need never have trouble sleeping because you didn t lend Uncle Jerry 20 000 in small denomination unmarked bills to start his chain of deep fried peanut butter pancake restaurants Deep n nutter Restaurants Your attorney will have a number of good ideas how to parse this wealth out without turning your siblings spouse children grandchildren cousins waitresses into the latest Paris Hilton EDIT Continued below due to character Limit 4 You will be encouraged to hire an investment manager Considerable pressure will be applied Don t Investment managers charge fees usually a percentage of assets Consider this If they charge 1 which is low I doubt you could find this deal actually they have to beat the market by 1 every year just to break even with a general market index fund It is not worth it and you don t need the extra return or the extra risk Go for the index fund instead if you must invest in stocks This is a hard rule to follow They will come recommended by friends They will come recommended by family They will be your second cousin on your mother s side Investment managers will sound smart They will have lots of cool acronyms They will have nice PowerPoint presentations They might MIGHT pay for your shrimp cocktail lunch at TGI Friday s while reminding you how poor their side of the family is They live for this stuff You should smile thank them for their time and then tell them you will get back to them next week Don t sign ANYTHING Don t write it on a cocktail napkin lottery lawsuit cases have been won and lost over drunkenly scrawled cocktail napkin addition and subtraction figures with lots of zeros on them Never call them back Trust me You will thank me later This tactic smiling thanking people for their time and promising to get back to people is going to have to become familiar You will have to learn to say no gently without saying the word no It sounds underhanded Sneaky It is And its part of your new survival strategy I mean the word survival quite literally Get all this figured out BEFORE you claim your winnings They aren t going anywhere Just relax 5 If you elect to be more global about your paranoia use between 20 00 and 33 00 of what you have not decided to commit to a family fund IMMEDIATELY to purchase a combination of longer term U S treasuries 5 or 10 year are a good idea and perhaps even another G7 treasury instrument This is your safety net You will be protected from yourself You are going to be really tempted to starting being a big investor You are going to be convinced that you can double your money in Vegas with your awesome Roulette system by funding your friend s amazing idea to sell Lemming dung buying land for oil drilling by shorting the North Pole Ice market global warming you know This all sounds tempting because Even if I lose it all I still have XX million left Anyone could live on that comfortably for the rest of their life Yeah except for 33 of everyone who won the lottery You re not going to double your money so cool it Let me say that again You re not going to double your money so cool it Right now you ll get around 3 5 on the 10 year U S treasury With 18 2 million 20 of 91 2 mil after your absurdly generous family gift invested in those you will pull down 638 400 per year If everything else blows up you still have that and you will be in the top 1 of income in the United States So how about you not fuck with it Eh And that s income that is damn safe If we get to the point where the United States defaults on those instruments we are in far worse shape than worrying about money If you are really paranoid you might consider picking another G7 or otherwise mainstream country other than the U S according to where you want to live if the United States dissolves into anarchy or Britney Spears is elected to the United States Senate Put some fraction in something like Swiss Government Bonds at 3 If the Swiss stop paying on their government debt well then you know money really means nothing anywhere on the globe anymore I d study small field sustainable agriculture if you think this is a possibility You might have to start feeding yourself 6 That leaves say 80 of 91 2 million or 72 9 million Here is where things start to get less clear Personally I think you should dump half of this or 36 4 million into a boring S amp P 500 index fund Find something with low fees You are going to be constantly tempted to retain sophisticated advisers who charge nominal fees Don t Period Even if you lose every other dime you have 638 400 per year you didn t have before that will keep coming in until the United States falls into chaos Fuck advisers and their fees Instead drop your 36 4 million in the market in a low fee vehicle Unless we have an unprecedented downturn the likes of which the United States has never seen should return around 7 00 or so over the next 10 years You should expect to touch not even a dime of this money for 10 or 15 or even 20 years In 20 years 36 4 million could easily become 115 million 7 So you have put a safety net in place You have provided for your family beyond your wildest dreams And you still have 36 4 million in cash You know you will be getting 638 400 per year unless the capital building is burning you don t ever need to give anyone you care about cash since they are provided for generously and responsibly and can t blow it in Vegas and you have a HUGE nest egg that is growing at market rates Given the recent dip you ll be buying in at great prices for the market What now Whatever you want Go ahead and burn through 36 4 million in hookers and blow if you want You ve got more security than 99 of the country A lot of it is in trusts so even if you are sued your family will live well and progress across generations If your lawyer is worth his salt I bet he is then you will be insulated from most lawsuits anyhow Buy a nice house or two make sure they aren t stupid investments though Go ahead and be an angel investor and fund some startups but REFUSE to do it for anyone you know Friends and money oil and water Michael Corleone Play Have fun You earned it by putting together the shoe sizes of your whole family on one ticket and winning the jackpot Excellent advice I used to work at a lottery I even gave out the big novelty cheques sometimes and I have told many family and friends that the smart people who win the lottery do not show up right away The smart people follow most of the advice given in this most excellent series of posts However they also do a couple of other things change all telephone numbers and ensure the new ones are unlisted before going to claim the prize stop home mail delivery Get a PO Box and if your postal service allows it ensure that mail is only delivered if it is addressed to the family members whose names are listed as belonging to the PO Box Change all your billing records to the new address and phone number before claiming the prize once you have eventually claimed the prize do not read mail from sources you do not know The sob stories will break your heart Save yourself the anguish and do not read them In some jurisdictions including mine you have to agree to some minor publicity when you collect your prize This can frequently mean a photograph and your name in the media I have a few pieces of advice for this only one person should collect the winnings You want to minimize the chance that you are going to be recognized If there is more than one person in the photo then there is double the chance that one of you might get recognized Try to be as anonymous as possible ask that the novelty cheque and subsequent media release name you without using your full name So if you are John Quincy Smith ask to be identified as J Q Smith This doesn t work as well if you have an uncommon family name but in some cases it can help anonymize you a bit if you re likely to be photographed then now s the time to play dress up Wear a hat Wear sunglasses if you can Men grow some facial hair You are going to get your 15 minutes of fame whether you like it or not so my advice is to look as unidentifiable as possible when you go to get your prize if the lottery corporation has prize offices in more than one location collect your prize at a location that is as far away as possible and or where you know the fewest people before collecting the prize you will have already made your arrangements for the funds Collect the cheque and immediately deliver it to the bank to your lawyer wherever you have made your previous arrangements as soon as you deposit your winnings you and your family need to disappear for a month Most of the excitement and focus will be in the immediate aftermath of you winning the prize Now is the time for you and your family to rent a cottage on a beach in a foreign country and lay low I think this advice combined with the most excellent advice given above will help you to manage your winnings and hopefully insulate you a bit from the madness of a jealous public

regarding SOFI Many of those DD s were just people trying to pump their position in order get some tendies I will make sure to only summarize and include some parts of those DD s that were not meant for pump amp dump This is a NON BIASED SOFI DD amp Analysis Let s get started amp x200B What is SOFI Social Finance Inc aka SoFi is an American online personal finance company A mobile first service based in San Francisco SoFi provides a suite of financial products that includes student loan refinancing checking accounts mortgages personal loans credit cards stock investing and banking through both their mobile app and desktop interfaces It is an ALL in one app for all your financial and investing needs Look at the products sofi has to offer The company has an amazing easy to use user interface and very smooth app amp x200B https preview redd it u1bam7fqzec71 png width 2658 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 64ff396904447a22bd4d94af98271f93887d63b1 amp x200B What separates SOFI from other competitors The one single factor that gains Sofi a lot of revenue and sales is Convenience Because they provide a lot of services they are able to attract their customers to get different products Let s say you decide to buy a car and go to Sofi for a car loan The Sofi team asks you to provide your Social security pay stubs previous bills etc and then finally grants you a car loan Now let s say after 3 months your friend who has been making a bank trading AMC and GME tells you to invest and you don t have a brokerage account You eventually would end up knocking SOFI s door and ask them to let you invest because why the fuck would you want to fill out forms and apply at other brokerages Now let s say after couple of months of trading you end up losing all your money because you re an APE who yolo ed entire savings into 1st ever options play Now you need money for that business degree because you suck at investing What would you do here Would you go to some student loan company and fill out all the forms provide credit history etc or would you just call up SOFI and ask them to loan you some tendies The simple answer is Call up SOFI because it s convenient amp x200B SOFI also came up with IPO investing You can now invest in IPO s even before they re traded on an exchange Cool innit Unlike Robinhood SOFI would never restrict the sale of the securities to the members in secondary markets However if you invest in an IPO and sell within 30 days then you might be restricted from IPO purchase for next 30 days or so More details can be found on their website

did it become such a big company SoFi was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney Dan Macklin James Finnigan and Ian Brady four students who met at the Stanford The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education The company s inaugural loan program was a 2 million pilot at Stanford For this pilot 40 alumni invested about 2 million in approximately 100 students for an average of 20 000 per student The founders were soon able to raise 1billion from softbank few years ago The company is very successful and trading way below their valuation price amp x200B Let s have a look at the SOFI s chart this year This is 1 year chart for Sofi it has a very very strong support at 15 The stock has gone below 15 only twice in 2021 and then rallied the following 2 weeks The movement of this stock is like a spring a huge dip is followed by an insane highs The earnings are due 8 20 and I strongly believe that this stock will run before the earnings amp x200B https preview redd it na00wbnszec71 png width 2134 amp format png amp auto webp amp s cb97b09ec2f01c7b8085470e82a09c6ac9243ca2 amp x200B Price Targets Michael Miller an equity

price in the last 7 8 months this stock has rallied after a huge dip With the earnings coming up for this company I am positive that there will be a rally amp x200B Sofi is positioned to be a 1 leader in the fintech sector They are jacks of all trades and offering different products to their customers all within one app or website amp x200B Convenience of being able to apply for student loans investing mortgages will attract consumers because who wants to end up applying at different companies for different needs amp x200B Sofi acquired GALILEO which is a very big company You haven t heard of this company yet because it s a B2B company Sofi paid about 1 2B for it They re basically a payment processing platform like stripe square paypal etc which is used by all top fintech companies around the globe amp x200B The main goal of SOFI is to be able to provide as many products and services they can to their consumers They are soon going to be a OneStopShop Their goal is to basically become an amazon of FinTech and provide all the services in one place By acting as a one stop shop for its customer s finances SoFi intends to create powerful cross selling advantages that will reduce its cost of acquisition and give it a competitive advantage in the marketplace amp x200B SOFI has acquired Golden Pacific Bancorp and applying to become a national bank in the US amp x200B The company saw its client growth accelerate in 2020 with more than 2 2 million members on its platform by the end of the first quarter of 2021 amp x200B The company s expanded product lineup along with increased adoption of digital banking during the pandemic has helped accelerate SoFi s growth with the number of members increasing by nearly 80 90 in 2020 Rapid growth has continued into 2021 and SoFi remains the only company utilizing a digital full service model giving it a clear product niche Source morningstar amp x200B It is projected that SOFI would get an approval to become a bank in late 2021 or early 2022 amp x200B It is projected that revenue will increase at a 43 CAGR over the next five years as the company benefits from its unique product offering as well as the revenue contributed by its 2020 acquisition of Galileo which is only the one section of SOFI amp x200B During the company s SPAC merger the company issued equity to PIPE investors to raise more than 1 2 billion in capital on top of the 800 million that was generated by the SPAC merger itself This along with debt paydown that occurred both immediately prior and during the SPAC merger has left the company in a good financial position amp x200B SoFi has more than 2 billion in cash and over 4 billion in debt but that entire debt money is used to finance its lending activities I believe that there is only little

July 2021,As many of you are aware the eviction amp foreclosure moratorium were implemented to provide relief to those who were affected by the economic turmoil caused by the COVID Pandemic What many folks aren t considering is the economic fallout as a result of these programs that will end on the 31st of July Observe that 1 The eviction moratorium prevented landlords from evicting tenants from apartments and rental homes 2 The foreclosure moratorium prevents banks from foreclosing on federally backed mortgages 3 The mortgage forbearance program allows homeowners to pause or reduce their mortgage payments for a limited time while they build back their finances Economic Repercussions of the Eviction Moratorium 1 As landlords could not evict tenants the price of rent likely increased to make up for those who simply stopped paying Of course this does not ring true for all markets but likely most markets in most areas Plenty of data out these showing rents going up by 9 2 However it would be na ve to assume that folks aren t gaming the eviction moratorium I personally know folks who rent out their homes who haven t received rent in over a year And the occupants aren t exactly wanting for money 2 Approximately 43m housing units in the US are occupied by renters The average rent is 1 100 a month conservative estimate If just 1m people stopped paying rent for one month that would mean there would be an additional 1 1b in the general economy that otherwise would not be spent if these people payed their rent Per annum that s a possible 13 2b spent The US averages 3 6m evictions a year So regardless if there is an eviction moratorium 3 6m people are going to get evicted for not paying rent Assuming these people who would have been evicted anyway are gaming the system this amounts to 3 96b per month 47b per year of money going into the general economy that otherwise would be going to rent Assuming COVID had an adverse economic impact of an additional 1 4m paying tenants this would amount to 5 5b per month or up to 66b per year that was spent in the general economy that otherwise would have been spent on rent Assuming COVID had a seriously And I do mean SERIOUSLY bad effect on renters say double the amount that would be normally evicted in one year Roughly 8m units we re looking at 8 8b per month or 105b per year However the Aspen Institute estimates that 20m renters suffered a COVID related job loss and 28 9m 39 9m tenants are at risk of eviction in 2020 Assuming a tannate household of 2 5 people that would mean a possible 12 7b mo 152 6b yr on the low side to 17 5b mo 211b per year on the high side You get the point Analysis There is no telling how much money is being spent in the general economy that otherwise would have gone to rent but we can assess that it s many billions As a result the general economy likely pumped quicker than it otherwise might have amid the pandemic ceteris paribus However the amount of money being withheld from landlords has likely resulted in higher rents for new tenants in most areas as renters attempt to make up for non paying tenants Rising rents likely played a role in the housing boom as well Combined with record low interest rates amp millennials buying first homes amp folks fleeing restrictive COVID cities as rent in many places exceed that of a mortgage Once the eviction moratorium ends we could be looking at hundreds of billions being sucked out of the general economy as a result of folks being forced to pay their rent again However when we take into account the marginal propensity for both businesses and individuals to consume this number changes drastically Remember that every dollar received by both business and people a certain percentage is spent on goods and services while a smaller percentage is saved This is what keeps our economic engine running For example if the average consumer spends 90 of their income and saves 10 that s 10 00 spent in the economy for every 1 received Se we are likely looking at trillions of dollars being sucked out of the economy not billions Moreover those who get evicted will have ruined credit which has further implications on future spending Economic Repercussions of Foreclosure Moratorium and Mortgage Forbearance I believe the foreclosure moratorium only applies to federally backed mortgages but it would not surprise me if there are lenders outside this realm are also participating Once again I would not be surprised if folks are gaming this benefit To what extent I have no clue but from 2019 to 2020 foreclosures fell by roughly 50 from 493 066 to 214 323 nationally Assuming much of this was due to the foreclosure moratorium we can expect foreclosures to skyrocket once the foreclosure moratorium and mortgage forbearance ends By how much Likely somewhere between 500 000 1 000 000 homes in 2022 ceteris paribus when we take into account the damage done by COVID This assumes the government takes no further action for mortgage relief Analysis Assuming the foreclosures hit in 2022 at the rate indicated above there could be as many as 1m homes flooding the market driving down the cost of housing and the demand for homebuilder products Like the rent moratorium mortgage forbearance is likely resulting in money flooding the economy that would have otherwise gone to a full mortgage payment If the Federal Reserve were to raise rates to reign in inflation this would seriously cool off the housing market Perhaps this is why the Fed is hesitant to raise rates Conclusions 1 Credit Crisis Both the foreclosure moratorium and the eviction moratorium are set to expire on July 31st 2021 As a result the rate of evictions and foreclosures will likely skyrocket Those foreclosed on or evicted will likely have some serious credit issues Their credit scores will be negatively impacted their ability to access credit hampered and liens will be placed on their property as renters pursue past rent due Many will have judgements against them As this will no doubt affect their general credit they will be hampered on how much they can spend on credit 2 Trillions Sucked out of the Economy For those evicted or foreclosed on particularly those who gamed the system a larger portion of their income will need to go back to renters banks as opposed to being spent in the general economy Reduced credit will also result in less spending on credit As a result of both these phenomena there could be trillions sucked out of the economy when we consider the marginal propensity for both businesses and individuals to consume Remember that every dollar received by both business and people a certain percentage is spent on goods and services while a smaller percentage is saved This is what keeps our economic engine running For example if the average consumer spends 90 of their income and saves 10 that s 10 00 spent in the economy for every 1 received 3 Cooling of the Housing Market amp Home Building Materials The housing market will cool off as more houses flood the market and so too will the cost of home building materials The demand for rentals may also cool but slowly 4 This is the Reason The Federal Reserve is Maintaining Low Rates The reason the Federal Reserve doesn t seem to be concerned about inflation is simply for the fact that they expect the ending of the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums to have a counter inflationary effect I avoided deflation for a reason the low rates are to ensure a steady rate of inflation amid what they foresee as inbound rough economic times No the Federal Reserve isn t talking about it because they don t want folks to panic So they will take their criticisms and knocks now so as long as when these housing programs end they can offset the negative effects However if the FED suddenly raises rates you can bet that the aforementioned issues will be amplified So keep an eye out What am I missing Please comment below Sorry for the hasty and incomplete analysis but its worth a conversation given that the eviction amp foreclosure moratoriums are set to end THIS MONTH No doubt much of this information will not pan out as expected above that s why this is an assessment a projection if you will But will the economy be negatively impacted I think so The only question is by how much However this all turns out you will want to watch the exposure in your portfolio and assess how this will affect the sectors you re invested in Note Many states have extended similar programs until September
