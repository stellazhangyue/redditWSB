of UC Davis which creates plastics out of scraps of organic material wood pulp rice hulls sugar cane stalks etc This process ends up capturing the carbon that would reenter the atmosphere when the scrap material decays into plastics making it an incredibly effective way to capture carbon Deloitte did some independent analysis and showed it captures 300 of the carbon used in the manufacturing process https mcusercontent com 3a3602da39d977d961969416f files da051d96 6c8e 4492 b78e d8774523cb4c Deloitte Origin Materials LCA of Coproducts pdf making it one of the first carbon negative production processes Not only that but since they are using scrap material the production costs are not tied to inflation or any other material such as oil In fact they estimate producing these bioplastics at a cost which will be competitive with current oil based plastics and that doesn t even include any carbon credit incentives Currently there is a supply of something like 900x what the company forecasts needing when at full capacity so this will continue to be a cost effective approach that isn t tied to a volatile commodity like oil corn or canola oil Positive EBITDA is still out at 2025 but from there things will scale fast Origin is currently building the Origin 1 plant due EOY 2022 which will be their testbed plant that is focused on refining and optimizing their full scale production for both current and future materials From there EOY 2024 will mark the completion of their Origin 2 plant which will be a full production scale facility and also create a positive EBITDA From there they plan for 5 more plants estimating a 2 3bln EBITDA by 2030 This company has the potential to absolutely boom Check out more information in their investor presentation https www originmaterials com assets uploads Origin Materials Analyst Day Presentation 04 2021 pdf but based on their estimated revenue and growth I put the stock today at a value of 22 lowball and 35 highball based on a DCF model lowball 20 discount rate highball 15 discount rate The lowball is also the analyst estimate which is quite a premium to the 10 NAV where it is now Even if I estimate the Origin 2 plant is delayed by a full year the current discounted value is 18 and on top of that adding in a 33 risk discount it s still worth 12 almost 50 above current value Leadership These folks know their chemistry Lots of names out of UC Davis where this tech was developed so this isn t just some pipe dream MBA bullshit They also have lots of leadership out of the chemicals production space from the likes of Dow Chemicals So that s great on that level but how do we know they will actually be able to execute Their board Chaired by Karen Richardson who is also a board member of BP They have Boon Sim who was part of the acquisition team and was a leader for both Credit Suisse and Temasek Holdings aka the sovereign wealth fund of Singapore which is known for being one of the most sophisticated funds in the world Along with that execs from Clorox Dupont and P amp G So tons of experience and connections with huge players I was on the fence until I saw who was on the board now I m stoked Insider Buying and Investment Just before merger Charles Drucker bought an additional 650k shares https fintel io n us orgn bringing his total ownership to 18 862 500 shares How often do you see the acquisition company CEO buying more shares of a stock they bring to market On top of that Apollo Funds invested 30m in Origin https www businesswire com news home 20210615005650 en Apollo Funds to

so close to merger is super bullish and shows continued interest in the company On June 25th Lior I Amram and Evergreen InvestCo bought 10m shares https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1802457 000119312521207655 d72044dsc13g htm furthering the large long term investments in the company Shareholder Redemptions It s not all sunshine and rainbows so not going to try and hide negative indicators Shareholders redeemed 60 of the stock or 43m shares https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1802457 000119312521206309 d152805d8k htm This is a bit of a blow to their financing plan as they had a 246m cushion in building Origin 2 However this is bad only if the share price stays below 11 50 Why There are 35m public warrants out there currently Each cashless redemption of those warrants public warrants typically don t have a cash redemption will net the company 15 more than the shares which were redeemed pre merger So overall they are missing out on 430m but will get 402m from the warrants and with the additional 30m from Apollo it brings them back up to 432m On top of that the float size is so much smaller now And as MP materials did in May they can force the redemption of these warrants to close the funding gap if they are at a higher price Overall they lost out on money but also have lower total shares so the value of the stock remains approximately the same Now it s just a matter of recapturing the potential capital for future funding hopefully through warrant redemption Ridiculously Tiny Float So due to the above the current available float is sitting at 29m but wait there s Less With the buying mentioned above this is reduced to only 18 23m shares That is tiny We are only starting to get a sense for institutional ownership There just aren t that many shares available right now so that means the price will be heavily affected by even a small increase in demand More volatile Yes but also will make a runup in price all the more likely That runup will enable the redemption of those warrants which puts ORGN back into a very comfortable spot Since that isn t likely to happen in 1 2 years l m looking for a significant upside reward to the risk of the stock Market The market is currently pegged at 1tln of potential so there is tons of room for expansion But let s take a look at Danimer Scientific https finance yahoo com quote DNMR p DNMR who was another

1089 9658 pdf Project Green PIPE Presentation Final pdf you can see they are further along but their maximum production after all their facilities are built is just a little above what one of the 6 production plants of Origin And on top of that they have to use vegetable oils so are prone to crop inflation Right now they are valued at 25 which according to their data puts them at a 14x multiple of their future EBITDA and a 15 discount rate The same comparison would put Origin up over 40 a share today Origin is primed to cash in on the current boom in ESG focus Their current projects look to double in EBITDA when forecasting for the potential of carbon capture premiums and other environmental opportunities They can also license their technology to other companies since there is a huge market which one company can never fill When looking at the demand they have already gotten 1bln in offtake commitments and while they could have more they have chosen to reserve capacity for higher margin items On top of all that Origin now has partnerships with Nestle Danone and Pepsico who are some of the largest plastic users in the world Match that with their connections from their board they have the chops to make this work and scale And to go along with that the merger with warrants will provide them with enough funding to get to their EBITDA positive timeframe with another 250mln in buffer So there is very little risk of dilution via share issuance Beyond their factories they are also looking at licensing hte technology for another revenue stream to further accelerate growth none of my calculations take this into account The potential for additional revenue is just absolutely massive since there is a 1 TRILLION addressable market opportunity Once in a lifetime opportunity

www tipranks com index nasdaq 100 SOFI https www tipranks com stocks sofi forecast SoFi or Social Finance was founded in 2011 and is a fintech or financial technology company that offers a suite of financial products through its platform a one stop shop app The company s three major business segments include lending a technology platform and financial services SoFi s lending services include student loan refinancing personal and home loans while its technology platform Galileo provides services including an authorization application programming interface API to financial and non financial institutions The company s financial services include insurance services under SoFi Protect a SoFi Credit Card and Lantern Credit a financial services marketplace Last month SoFi Technologies made its debut on the Nasdaq as an independent company following its SPAC merger with blank check company Social Capital Hedosophia In Q1 the company posted adjusted net revenues of 216 million while the company had guided for revenues ranging between 190 million and 195 million SoFi reported adjusted EBITDA of 4 million and ended the quarter with 2 281 thousand members a jump of 110 year over year On June 28 SoFi s lock up period expired The lock up period is the length of time after the company goes public when early employees or shareholders in the company may not sell their shares This time period can vary between 90 to 180 days Following the expiry of the lock up period Rosenblatt Securities analyst Sean Horgan https www tipranks com analysts sean horgan reiterated a Buy and a price target of 30 65 9 upside on the stock The analyst saw a unique buying opportunity as a result of this recent selling and ahead of a potentially significant upside catalyst bank charter approval In October last year SoFi received preliminary conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC in the United States regarding its application for a national bank charter However this application will still need to be reviewed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve See SoFi Technologies stock chart https www tipranks com stocks sofi stock charts on TipRanks Analyst Horgan expects the process for approval of the bank charter to conclude by the end of this year adding an upside of more than 25 to the analyst s EBITDA estimates The analyst said in a note to investors All the catalysts we expect in order of magnitude are 1 SOFI s bank charter approval denial expected 2021 2 lockup period ends June 28 employee trading restrictions expire post earnings expected mid August senior leadership lockup expiration Late December 3 federal student loan forbearance period expiration currently set for October 1 2021 4 rising interest rates However Horgan noted that a regulation that could allow for a four year college course without paying any tuition fees could pose a substantial downside to SOFI s core student lending business which we believe is a low single digit probability risk The analyst believes that students enrolled in four year undergraduate programs make up the largest piece of SOFI s student lending revenues and market opportunity In Q1 SoFi s lending segment had student loan originations worth 1 468 million Horgan also believes that a rise in regulatory scrutiny when it comes to payment for order flow PFOF regulations should not concern SoFi shareholders as its revenue exposure from its brokerage business is insignificant lt 1 of 2020 revenues in comparison to many retail brokers PFOF is the compensation a brokerage firm receives for directing orders to other parties to execute trades Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buys The average SoFi Technologies

The company charges referral fees to banks for every loan referred through the Upstart com website and originated by a bank partner UPST also charges a platform fee for every loan origination regardless of its source and servicing fees for loans as consumers repay them UPST helps consumers receive personal loans by connecting them to its bank and credit union partners It uses variables like employment and education to predict a consumer s creditworthiness Last month the company entered into a partnership with workflow application programming interface API connectivity provider NXTsoft to enable Upstart to streamline the implementation of its platform to financial institutions in the U S In Q1 UPST reported total revenues of 121 3 million a jump of 90 year over year that

73 billion across the company s platform an increase of 102 year over year The conversion rate was 22 on rate requests up 14 year over year Analyst Hecht stated the strong loan count and improving

from our prior ests estimates at the midpoint He continued on a positive note saying We continue to believe Upstart s cloudbased Artificial Intelligence AI lending platform results in a superior credit product with attractive economics for both consumers and lenders a win win model for both participants We see LT long term strong growth opportunities given a first mover advantage and a very

Upstart offers personal and auto loans through its platform It remains to be seen whether Upstart will expand its product offerings Upstart has stated in its company filing There is significant opportunity to expand from personal loans to auto loans credit cards mortgages student loans point of sale loans and home equity lines of credit HELOC While analysts are cautiously optimistic about

recently IPOed Handysize pure play Pacific Basin Shipping gt Taylor Maritime Investments Some of you will be familiar with Pacific Basin Shipping 2343 HK which has long been regarded as one of the standard bearers in the Handysize market Knowing them should peak your interest in Taylor Maritime Investments which include the founders of Pacific Basin Taylor Maritime was founded in 2014 but its roots can actually be traced back to the founding of Pacific Basin PB in 1987 Pacific Basin listed on the NASDAQ in 1994 and was subsequently taken private by Malaysian investors in 1996 at a profit to all shareholders In 1998 the original co founders of PB Chris Buttery and Paul Over re established Pacific Basin and IPOed the company at a market cap of 240 million Chris Buttery and Paul Over are non executive director and advisor to the board of Taylor Maritime Investments with Edward Buttery Chris s son as CEO Aging Fleet v Rising Demand As it stands new ordering is at a 20 year low and in that context Handysize is the oldest dry bulk fleet with 6 6 of the fleet over 25 years of age The current orderbook stands at only 3 3 of current fleet of which 2 4 to be delivered in 2021 0 8 in 2022 and 0 1 in 2023 before accounting for slippage Note typical lag between orders and deliveries 18 to 24 months with avg 30 slippage delay 10 year old Handysize values are currently 30 below replacement cost and 20 below long term historical averages With no major new builds in sight and as the Handysize fleet ages with many age candidates 25 years going to scrap leads to a market which is extremely short of available shipping capacity This dynamic has Taylor Maritime in prime position to capture a whole lot of value by executing on their strategy of buying 10 year old vessels locking in substantial yields and capturing capital upside This my friends is how real ship owners make money Post pandemic minor bulk and Handysize demand Source Clarksons https preview redd it

with shallower drafts able to call at a far greater number of ports than larger ships Shipping demand for these vessels have increased significantly giving rise to rates since May 2020 as countries have slowly made their way out of lockdown Covid restrictions and as governments central banks have provided stimulus and kept rates suppressed These economic levers have helped spur an enormous pent up demand for necessity goods which support the basic needs of populations These minor bulks and grains which Handysize transport are all key components in food agriculture and infrastructure As of May 29th 2020 rates were at 4 875 day and have since risen to 29 465 day as of July 8th2021 The consensus forecast for demand in minor bulks is predicted to grow 4 in 2021 alone Prime Position TMI is in prime position to make good on what is looking like an increasingly tight market in the Handysize segment Their stated objective on IPO was to complete the pre negotiated acquisition of 21 Japanese Built Handysize vessels with an average age of 10 7 years and average price of 12m per vessel The employment strategy for these vessels is very similar to that of Pacific Basin with an equal split between long short and spot charters The counter party risk will be extremely well managed as their customers will be made up of the world s largest grain and metals traders producers Focused on Cash Flow https preview redd it ra2ytqcin7a71 png width 624 amp format png amp auto webp amp s bc3f30e13fdd76c83dcbb7572d8bce6b042ed6b9 Annualized operating cash flow of 7 1m per ship based on 29 000 day rate With an average unlevered acquisition price of 12m per 10 year old vessel and a conservative average day rate of 13 000 with daily variable costs of 1 000 Ship Opex of 4600 day daily G amp A of 600 and dry dock cost of 500 day we get a Daily Operating Cash Flow of 6 300 That s an annualized Operating Cash Flow of 2 3m per vessel equating to a Gross Cash Yield of 19 Not bad right Based on these economics a single vessel will have produced 11 5m in total operating cash flow over 5 years and be completely de risked by year 4 based on 5 year average scrap price of 2 8m 377 LDT and 7 500 LDT for 32k dwt ship With the same vessel acquisition price and plugging in today s average market charter of 29 000 per day and adjusting for increased ship opex to 7500 day we arrive at 7 1m in annualized operating cash flow which is equal to 59 Gross Cash Yield unlevered If Taylor Maritime is managed with the same discipline as Pacific Basin then I would say it is safe to assume that they will have their costs nailed down pretty tight both onshore and offshore On a 12m purchase price Handysize earnings have supported average unlevered yields of 9 over the last 3 years and 8 over the last 10 years The longer historical averages are higher and based on the fact that there is a shortage in new tonnage supply demand imbalances will push yields higher in the coming years My 2 cents for what it s worth Considering TMI s 21 owned Handysize vessels with an average price of 12m in relation to where the current average Handysize day rate is and compare that with TMI s 52 day trading average of 1 07 share 271m Market Cap 253 68m Shares Outstanding it s easy to see the shares are trading at a steep discount to its peers Based on current rates TMI is trading at less than 2x

Dry Index has seen some volatility recently mainly driven by Cape smaller vessels have actually done very well over the same period and continue to push higher Just in June 2021 alone the Baltic Handysize Index has climbed 15 and since the beginning of July is up another 6 Continuing further into 2H21 and 2022 with Handysize spot rates gt 37 higher since the end of 1Q21 I would expect 2H21 to be one of the highest 6M profit periods for Handysize owners since 2H07 1H08 s bull market 2H dry bulk volumes are typically seasonally strong especially with iron ore and Northern Hemisphere grain season Much of what is going on in Handysize is similar to what has been witnessed in the container market Observers expected to see rates peak this year only to see rates push even further and reach new all time highs with shippers paying above spot rates for guaranteed space Given the success of Pacific Basin and the supply demand imbalance in the Handysize fleet I think it is well worth taking a look at TMI TMIP This is a great opportunity to pick up a pure play stock with exposure to fleet which is often overlooked but has the potential to outperform Disclaimer Again this is not financial

regarding Vertex s operations financials and future growth prospects amp x200B 1 TRIKAFTA Cystic fibrosis a rare progressive life threatening disease results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs digestive tract and other parts of the body It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene While there are approximately 2 000 known mutations of the CFTR gene the most common mutation is the F508del mutation Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation which affects 90 of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27 000 people in the United States US Food and Drug Administration Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90 of patients with the disorder Vertex currently has a firm ECONOMIC MOAT on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder Trikafta accounts for 70 of Vertex s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16 7 CAGR until 2025 Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever growing share in the market Essentially the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate Trikafta s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex s revenue growth rate with Trikafta With the drug s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries 57 increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020 2021 Trikafta could become an absolute CASH FLOW MACHINE for Vertex At the cost of 311 000 for Trikfta Vertex could mass up to 8 4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone While the drug brought in just over 3 8B in 2020 there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex s domestic

Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues On average analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20 for the upcoming year however with the average earnings surprise of 11 65 from the last four quarters I believe that earnings growth gt 30 is fair and to be expected Vertex s high return on equity of 23 0 exceeds the industry

sf2idk0lp7a71 png width 1200 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 8a2bb8815f89bf5ef84104e9775e85d16ca852e2 Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions Currently there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex VRTX is the single best biotech stock to buy right now Here is some analysis regarding Vertex s operations financials and future growth prospects amp x200B 1 TRIKAFTA Cystic fibrosis a rare progressive life threatening disease results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs digestive tract and other parts of the body It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene While there are approximately 2 000 known mutations of the CFTR gene the most common mutation is the F508del mutation Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation which affects 90 of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27 000 people in the United States US Food and Drug Administration Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90 of patients with the disorder Vertex currently has a firm ECONOMIC MOAT on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder Trikafta accounts for 70 of Vertex s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16 7 CAGR until 2025 Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever growing share in the market Essentially the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate Trikafta s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex s revenue growth rate with Trikafta With the drug s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries 57 increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020 2021 Trikafta could become an absolute CASH FLOW MACHINE for Vertex At the cost of 311 000 for Trikafta Vertex could mass up to 8 4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone While the drug brought in just over 3 8B in 2020 there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex s domestic market not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated https www grandviewresearch com press release global cystic fibrosis cf therapeutics market https www grandviewresearch com press release global cystic fibrosis cf therapeutics market amp x200B 2 GROWTH Revenue YoY Growth 33 10 LTM Diluted EPS YoY Growth 81 55 LTM Cash from Operations YoY Growth 63 03 LTM Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth 53 9 As Trikafta s patent has 16 years until expiry expiry in 2037 Vertex s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues On average analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20 for the upcoming year however with the average earnings surprise of 11 65 from the last four quarters I believe that earnings growth gt 30 is fair and to be expected Vertex s high return on equity of 23 0 exceeds the industry average of 16 6 which demonstrates the company s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing another positive and promising sign for future growth amp x200B 3 VALUATION VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P E multiple has significantly decreased The stock now trades at 18 81x earnings 15 96x forward earnings representing a 1 59 PEG This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings VRTX is currently EXTREMELY CHEAP based on the most common valuation metrics Based on a discounted cash flow analysis of VRTX an intrinsic value of 406 58 can be extrapolated which presents a gt 50 discount to its current share price of 197 74 assumptions include a discount rate of 6 5 based on the calculation cost of equity This is all to say that VRTX has some serious DEEP VALUE and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside gt 50 based on future outlook amp x200B 4 BALANCE SHEET Quick Ratio 4 20 Current Ratio 4 40 Debt Equity 0 00 LT Debt Equity 0 06 Vertex Pharmaceuticals balance sheet is extremely strong with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical biotech companies There is virtually no risk debt wise for Vertex a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all Vertex s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry amp x200B 5 RESEARCH amp DEVELOPMENT Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type 1 diabetes they could potentially cure type 1 diabetes and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to 24B by 2029 Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases Overall Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry Below is the stated progress on Vertex s R

replace insulin producing islet cells in patients with T1D We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients transplantation of islet cells alone using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device In January 2021 the FDA cleared our IND for VX 880 the islet cells alone program We expect to initiate a Phase 1 2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021 This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated functional islet cells

an ever growing therapeutics market as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at amp x200B I am long shares around 15 of my total portfolio but LEAPS

there s any information that needs to be updated I ll update it Given the current financial position of the company and their future prospects I m confident that this has huge upside Of course this isn t financial advice and I urge you to perform your own analysis BankruptcySpeedrun DISCLAIMER I own 515 000 shares of KMPH 9 50 Yes that is 5 million You can check my profile for proof and I say with full confidence that I intend to hold this position indefinitely I only ask that you read this report in its entirety before drawing your conclusions because nothing about this company is as it seems PART I DILUTION DEBT DOUBT On its surface KemPharm looks particularly depressing A casual glance at the KMPH chart will show you their stock price seems to know only one direction Down A deeper dive into their financial history doesn t improve their outlook either Dilution debt and doubt The triple Ds of woe that spell out doom for any company that dares to enter the biotech arena Their earnings are dismal and their quarterly reports are depressing Dreary forecasts and dreadful prospects detail a dismal decline of depleted reserves and desperate delusion In a word dangerous So why would anyone invest in this company Better yet why would anyone spend a single moment of their valuable time researching this company when everything they need to know is right out there in the open Had I looked at this company a few months ago I might have come to that exact conclusion But on March 3 2021 everything changed Meet Azstarys https azstarys com Azstarys is KemPharm s latest FDA approved medication specifically formulated for the treatment of ADHD A once daily pill of serdexmethylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate This is undoubtedly decent news but despite the medication showing promising potential this alone wasn t enough to convince me to make my investment The first glimmer of potential that caught my eye appeared like most things about this company in the smallest of details If you have ADHD as I do you may have noticed that you ve never heard of SER dexmethylphenidate Dexmethylphenidate the more active isomer of methylphenidate is in Focalin and Focalin XR but the SER is a new development Looking deeper into Azstarys I noted that SERdexmethylphenidate was described as a prodrug And the only other ADHD med with that designation is Vyvanse I was familiar with Vyvanse because it was my prescription prior to Focalin XR But I wasn t familiar of why it was called a prodrug so I decided to dig a little deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper until I found a thread A thread that led me all the way back to the year 2006 A year where a man by the name of Dr Travis Mickle made a rather important discovery gt Prior to founding KemPharm Dr Mickle served as Director of Drug Discovery and CMC at New River Pharmaceuticals where he was the principal inventor of Vyvanse a prodrug of amphetamine for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD Today Vyvanse is the branded market share leader in the estimated 17 billion plus ADHD market The success of Vyvanse along with a robust pipeline of prodrugs targeting ADHD pain and thyroid dysfunctions which Dr Mickle was responsible for creating led to New River Pharmaceuticals being acquired by Shire Pharmaceuticals PLC for 2 6 billion Source https kempharm com team https kempharm com team In 2006 after tendering his resignation to New River Pharmaceuticals the MickleMeister founded KemPharm with the sole intention of producing a plethora of prodrugs Shortly after his departure New River Pharmaceuticals was purchased by Shire for the bargain price of 2 6 billion I say bargain because Vyvanse now generates around 2 billion dollars in revenue every single year Subsequently Shire was purchased by Takeda in 2019 for the slightly higher price of 62 billion but this information will come into play a little later So this begs the question how did Vyvanse a single ADHD medication create such eye watering returns on an at the time equally eye watering 2 6 billion dollar investment The answer once again is hidden in the itty bitty details Vyvanse is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine known as LIS dexamfetamine And here is where the pattern finally begins to align after 800 words of backstory damn Basically a prodrug is a modified version of a drug that attaches another molecule a ligand in Azstarys s case that renders the active ingredient inert unless cleaved through your body s metabolic processes In summary it only works if you eat it This has quite a few benefits Not least of which is a longer duration as your body can only metabolize things so quickly due to the limitations of enzymatic action This gating effect even has the potential to reduce side effects Essentially a prodrug can improve qualities of the base medication But the more important distinction is that you can patent it Shire already had experience with ADHD medications They re flagship product Adderall XR had seen monumental success but was about to go off patent This would expose Shire to the profit decimating world of generics and so they eyeballed Vyvanse being the novel prodrug lisdexamfetamine for its brand new patent Considering Shire s experienced sales team and established connections converting Adderall users to Vyvanse would likely be as easy as informing doctor s and pharmacies of Vyvanse s improved qualities SO WHAT So what I hear you ask Apples and oranges That s a different drug with a different company so what does it have to do with KemPharm and Azstarys I promise you all of this backstory was necessary to explain exactly why KemPharm has so much potential PART II CONTRACTS CORIUM CAPITAL Azstarys will be brought to market Summer 2021 through their partner company Corium Inc Meet Corium https corium com The sales contract between the companies offers up to 590M in sales and regulatory milestone guarantees in addition to tiered royalty payments ranging from 9 to 25 This contract was recently renegotiated from 468M to 590M with a new higher top level royalty tier and the addition of 4 new sales milestones guarantees in exchange for 28M less on the upfront All in all a decent agreement Not earth shattering but probably good enough to keep KemPharm afloat for the foreseeable future But this still isn t enough to warrant an investment Guarantees mean nothing unless the drug can sell Sure Azstarys is a prodrug but the performance of Vyvanse can t guarantee the success of Azstarys especially considering that Corium doesn t have the sales experience of Shire but what if they did gt We all know that having the product is key but you also have to have a team that can effectively ramp up the distribution in order to be a blockbuster More than a decade ago Vyvanse was picked up by Shire Shire had an ace team led by Perry Sternberg that did a superb job in commercialization Source https www linkedin com pulse kempharm inc kmph builds repurposing molecules dan sfera https www linkedin com pulse kempharm inc kmph builds repurposing molecules dan sfera The current CEO of Corium is Perry Sternberg The very same Perry Sternberg that spearheaded the commercialization of Vyvanse during his tenure at Shire That alone raises an eyebrow but I invite you to go to Corium s website and look at their Leadership page https corium com leadership html https corium com leadership html Tell me if you can spot the pattern Robyn Lynch Head of Corporate Strategy Former Chief of Staff for U S Commercial Business and Neuroscience Division at Shire John Miller CFO Former Head of Finance for Global Commercial at Shire John Neeley Head of Market Access Former Head of Market Access at Shire Jamie Spaeth Head of HR Former Head of HR at Shire When I saw this I couldn t help but ask myself Why the hell are all these former Shire heads now working at Corium The answer Gurnet Point Capital gt Travis Mickle CEO Why are we co hosting this event today with our partner Corium We actually entered into a worldwide license with Gurnet Point Capital that was announced back in September of 2019 Corium is a GPC portfolio company and they have been assigned the rights to commercialize this product for GPC and for KemPharm We re excited about this because through our license process to look for the right partner certainly at one point Shire would have made a lot of sense Certainly Takeda had their own agendas and we are so fortunate that Perry and much of his team has landed at Corium and they ve had the foresight to bring in a product like KP415 Certainly this is the team that knows how to advance a product like this and it s a very exciting opportunity Source kp415 market opportunity and commercialization strategy https www transcriptshare com s kmph kp415 market opportunity and commercialization strategy Ok so who is Gurnet Point Capital Meet Gurnet Point Capital https www gurnetpointcapital com Gurnet Point Capital GPC is a healthcare fund founded by Ernesto Bertarelli former CEO of Serono gt The fund invests across all stages of product development through to commercialization and does so with an approach that is a hybrid of venture and private equity investing strategies It is governed by a guiding tenet that even the earliest of technologies must present a clear commercial case benefiting both patients and the healthcare system as a whole Consistent with the amount of capital time and energy that it dedicates Gurnet Point Capital will generally seek to be over time the majority or at least principal investor in each of its companies Source https www gurnetpointcapital com about https www gurnetpointcapital com about In late 2018 Gurnet Point Capital purchased Corium for a flat fee of 500 million The former CEO Peter Staple was replaced with Perry Sternberg in April of 2019 But it wasn t just Sternyburgy that came along for the ride GPC made a point to acquire his entire team Specifically the team that made Vyvanse a commercial success So why did they feel the need to recruit this exact team from Shire The answer Azstarys Obviously this has been a lot of information so let me try to summarize everything I ve detailed so far 1 KemPharm looks ugly 2 KemPharm s drug Azstarys approved on March 3 2021 3 Azstarys is a prodrug 4 The only other ADHD prodrug is Vyvanse 5 Vyvanse was made by Travis Mickle 6 Travis Mickle is the CEO of KemPharm 7 Azstarys will be sold through a partnership with Corium 8 Corium is has the Shire team that sold Vyvanse 9 Corium is owned by Gurnet Point Capital 10 Gurnet Point Capital is owned by Ernesto Bertarelli The thread is long and winding but the details are out there in the open You can look up and verify every single piece of information so far and I encourage you to do so and come to your own conclusions But I assure you that all of this information was needed to understand this next part PART III MARKETS MONEY MATH WARNING HERE THERE BE PERSONAL OPINIONS What follows from this point on is my investment thesis and represents the reason why I decided to make a substantial investment into KemPharm I want to be very clear that this is not financial advice nor a recommendation that you should invest in this company As always do your own research With that warning out of the way let s talk about the stock During KemPharm s latest Earnings Call on March 11 2021 Travis Mickle and team detailed the various changes that have taken place just in the past few months 1 Stock relisted on NASDAQ effective JAN 8 2021 2 No debt as of FEB 8 2021 3 77M Cash on Hand as of MAR 10 2021 4 28 3M Shares Outstanding as of MAR 10 2021 5 38 6M Fully diluted shares as of MAR 10 2021 Source https www transcriptshare com s kmph q4 2020 https www transcriptshare com s kmph q4 2020 All of these events occurred in Q1 and have led to considerable confusion across the internet in regards to the accuracy of information regarding KMPH But taking these new developments into account a very different picture begins to form in regards to KemPharm s future The current stock price as of the very moment I m writing this is 8 70 Assuming a full dilution of all 38 6M shares that gives a market cap of 340M Accounting for Cash on Hand that means that 260M of this company s worth is attributed to Azstarys Apadaz their pipeline their technology and Dr Mickle s brain in a jar NOTE This doesn t account for cash due from converted warrants and approval guarantees which could net an additional 80M and bring their CoH to 150M This will be clarified in the next ER Taking all of this into consideration I asked myself 2 questions 1 What market share MUST Azstarys capture in order to sustain KemPharm s operations for the foreseeable future 2 Will KemPharm be able to innovate with future products To answer the first question I needed to gain a better understanding of the ADHD market as a whole The 18B industry currently has 21 existing treatments spread across 3 primary classes 1 Amphetamines 2 Methylphenidates 3 Non stimulants The current largest player in the field is Vyvanse at a whopping 13 of the TOTAL market and 18 of the stimulant category class 1 amp 2 Competitors like Focalin XR amp Concerta comprise about 1 each So we have some comparatives for market performance but I still prefer to take the pessimistic approach My question is what is the bare minimum performance required to simply NOT GO BANKRUPT According to KemPharm they have a projected Annual Cash Burn of 4M source https www transcriptshare com s kmph kp415 approval call Considering this and assuming a low ball 10 royalty rate 8 25 potential with only 5 of the potential 550M in milestone guarantees received over a 10 year period how much market size would Azstarys have to capture in order for KemPharm to not go bankrupt in a worst case scenario WARNING HERE THERE BE NAPKIN MATH operating expenses total annual market required market share royalty rate milestone payments percent received 10 year period x required market share 4 000 000 18 000 000 000 x 0 1 550 000 000 0 05 10 4 000 000 1 800 000 000x 2 750 000 1 250 000 1 800 000 000x x 0 00069 0 069 required market share This obviously relies on guesswork and doesn t account for things like CAGR taxes manufacturing costs or inflation so let s make it even harder for KemPharm and double the required market share So in order for KemPharm to not go bankrupt assuming they sit on their ass and do nothing until the end of time Azstarys needs just 0 14 of the market or 25 2M in average annual sales over a 10 year period to earn an income of 4M Obviously this ignores the scaling royalty rate and any further sales milestones but I prefer err on the side of caution when making wild speculative assumptions Helps to keep things in perspective So that s the bare minimum amount that Azstarys is allowed to suck before KemPharm implodes Should Azstarys manage to perform on the same level as the lower competitors at around 1 you would certainly see a rise in KemPharm s stock price even with a below average P E ratio And given their partner Corium s experience with the commercialization of Vyvanse there s very little reason to believe that this goal couldn t be achieved Furthermore I believe that Azstarys will exceed it Source https www transcriptshare com s kmph kp415 approval call https www transcriptshare com s kmph kp415 approval call Additional data https kempharm gcs web com static files af3b9f16 a8f5 462d 80be 55266dccab75 https kempharm gcs web com static files af3b9f16 a8f5 462d 80be 55266dccab75 PART IV ALL AHEAD AZSTARYS It is my personal belief that KemPharm has crossed the threshold of uncertainty and has secured the financial stability necessary to confidently pursue the development of exponentially more prodrugs I believe that KemPharm s partner Corium has the ideal combination of experience and financial backing to optimize Azstarys s success I believe that Azstarys offers unique benefits that will improve the quality of care for patients with ADHD myself included I believe that KemPharm is extremely undervalued To view KemPharm as a company in peril is simply a matter of outdated information It seems to me that their value is hidden beneath layers of historical uncertainty and investor pessimism which makes it an excellent buying opportunity for those capable and willing to see its potential The arguments that Azstarys will fail to be competitive against its competitors or generics doesn t hold water considering the fact that Azstarys has no therapeutic equivalents source https www accessdata fda gov scripts cder daf index cfm event BasicSearch process and is patented until 2037 An additional point is that Azstarys was approved for all ages 6 and up https www azstarys com https www azstarys com instead of just 6 17 which was a surprise inclusion upon approval and serves to further expand the potential market The FDA also included a section in the label with clinical data suggesting that Azstarys has reduced impedance of childhood growth and development Section 6 1 https www azstarys com assets pdf AZSTARYS PI ENGLISH US pdf This particular issue is often cited as the primary complaint from parents of children with ADHD Critics of Azstarys focus heavily on the obscurity of it s potential duration the often referenced 30 13 and consider the inclusion of a chart without this specific language on the label as sufficient cause for dismissal To me this argument comes from a place of ignorance and a severe lack of perspective Yes certain terms of the sales agreement are contingent on this specific language but this point has yet to be confirmed or denied Furthermore this language s effect on actual sales is largely overestimated All extended release products are long lasting by design but the key differentiating factor between Azstarys and its competitors is that it is in fact a prodrug And as a prodrug its primary differentiation between it and other medications is the smooth downward efficacy ramp as the body metabolizes the medication at a consistent rate Section 12 3 Figure 1 https www azstarys com assets pdf AZSTARYS PI ENGLISH US pdf To put it plainly other extended release products are equivalent to a caffeine crash I know this because I experience it every single day The more interesting takeaway is that this medication s formula and prodrug status allows it to differentiate from not just Methylphenidate products but from Vyvanse itself The primary criticism for Vyvanse is its slow onset Up to 1 5 Hours https www psycom net vyvanse lisdexamfetamine but Azstarys is formulated with instant release dexmethylphenidate alongside serdexmethylphenidate for faster onset This opens up the possibility that Azstarys won t just be competing for market share on the Methylphenidate side but may be able to cross over to the Amphetamine side and capture market share directly from Vyvanse And while I don t assume that its performance will be equivalent to Vyvanse it is impossible to ignore the potent combination of product and people at play Corium s recruitment of the former Shire team has given Azstarys the best possible chance to succeed Who better to have on your product s side than the very same people that made Vyvanse the leading ADHD medication in the business And as a final anecdote I have already spoken to my doctor about Azstarys and we both agree that it will be my next medication Not because I believe in the company or want to help with sales But because I ve tried just about every medication on the market and want the best treatment possible And Azstarys just seems better So that just leaves one last question can KemPharm continue to innovate The answer Travis Mickle While there is no data in the world that can anticipate the future actions of any one person I have a gut feeling that there might just be some magic left in the old Mickster I ll end this overly long DD with a simple quote and leave it to you to decide for yourself gt It is akin to the Golden Goose that will just keep laying golden egg after golden egg Dr Mickle has stated that given sufficient funds he doesn t have enough life left to develop all of the possibilities This is perhaps the most valuable asset that KemPharm possesses Source https www linkedin com pulse kempharm inc kmph builds repurposing molecules dan sfera https www linkedin com pulse kempharm inc kmph builds

published this article elsewhere on the internet and am happy to confirm with mods if needed My single link post was previously removed Summary In 2018 the U S Army announced its intention to build next generation training amp simulation capabilities via the Integrated Visual Augmentation System IVAS In November 2018 Microsoft was awarded a two year prototyping contract worth 480 million for augmented reality headsets to be used as part of IVAS On March 31 2021 the Army awarded Microsoft a 10 year contract worth up to 21B to productionalize IVAS Since the same time as the IVAS announcement VirTra management has been signaling that it too is working toward a large military contract win in its case involving VirTra s patented recoil kits and possibly Threat Fire devices While no contract has been publicly announced my research leads me to believe VirTra will be supplying its industry leading recoil kits to the Army with a minimum expectation of 20M in revenue through FY23 and potential recurring and growing demand over the subsequent 8 years of the IVAS contract Company Description VirTra s Mission is to save lives by developing manufacturing and supporting the most powerful and immersive training simulators scenarios and accessories such as their patented recoil kits and Threat Fire devices Their largest business has historically been simulator sales to Law Enforcement but since late 2018 with the Army s announcement of building next generation simulation and training capabilities via the Integrated Visual Augmentation System IVAS VirTra has been attempting to expand its sales presence and footprint in the military market VirTra s Product Line Below is an overview of VirTra s core products Note that quotes in this section come directly from www virtra com http www virtra com High Fidelity Training Simulators VirTra s main product is its use of force and decision making training simulators designed to teach test and sustain officers knowledge and skills These simulators are equipped with extensive branching options where each scenario unfolds depending on the instructor or trainee s actions VirTra s complete scenario library offers a wide variety of situations that run from weapons manipulation drills and marksmanship to use of force de escalation and active shooter response allowing officers to train effectively and efficiently Recoil Kits patented VirTra s in house manufactured simulated firearm recoil kits are designed to convert a live firearm into a simulation ready weapon without permanent modification The drop in laser recoil kit is installed in the trainee s duty weapon without permanent modification while the CO2 magazine supplies realistic recoil Patents acquired in Feb 2019 make VirTra the only company who can provide both running out of ammunition and weapon jamming capabilities that do not require batteries or electronics These enhancements make weapons with VirTra s recoil kits installed the most realistic simulation ready weapons on the market Threat Fire devices patented Threat Fire devices are an in house manufactured accessory that greatly enhances training by bringing real life consequences into the simulation This product delivers an electric impulse that simulates consequence actions including gunfire explosions and dog attacks Importantly VirTra holds the only patent for electrical stimulation within a simulation and has successfully defended this patent against competition who tried to implement similar functionality Certified Curriculum V VICTA V VICTA Virtual Interactive Coursework Training Academy delivers the only nationally certified simulation curriculum for law enforcement training The curriculum is developed exclusively with nationally recognized partnerships and is designed to teach train test and sustain both inside and out of the police training simulation Custom Software V AUTHOR The V Author programs revolutionize training by placing training in the hands of the instructors who know their specific needs and locations These programs allow instructors to create and edit scenarios customized to their agency s training objectives thus providing more freedom and less limitation in training VirTra s Upcoming Growth Opportunities Military amp Law Enforcement Background The Army s IVAS program with state of the art training capabilities The Army s IVAS program is among other things building a cutting edge training solution that uses Microsoft s Hololens technology as Augmented Reality Mixed Reality headsets to enable tactical planning networked information sharing and an augmented reality Synthetic Training Environment that will enable Warfighters to fight 25 bloodless battles before engaging the enemy IVAS Mission Statement https www peosoldier army mil Equipment Equipment Portfolio Project Manager Integrated Visual Augmentation System The two main components as it relates to VirTra are the Heads Up Display HUD essentially an AR VR headset which likens to VirTra s simulator screens and the Synthetic Training Environment STE which likens to the software component that VirTra integrates their hardware into The Army s launch of the IVAS program as it relates to VirTra In August 2018 the government issued a Request For Proposal RFP for the IVAS program In VirTra s subsequent conference call CEO Bob Ferris made it clear that this is the opportunity VirTra had been waiting for CEO Ferris stated https seek ingalpha com article 4221929 virtras vtsi ceo bob ferris on q3 2018 results earnings call transcript source content type 3Areact 7Csection 3Amain content 7Cbutton 3Abody link we re also involved with changes occurring in the military simulation market Recently the U S army and the U S marines announced their acute focus on futuristic simulation training read IVAS VirTra products are very much in line with potential military requirements In some cases we will need to modify our current products in order to work on new advanced technology platforms such AR or Augmented Reality or Mixed Reality But these modifications are easily made given the way we design our products originally We actually anticipated growing demand in the space and the need for flexible products So we precisely built our technology to be modular We are extremely excited by this news and we think VirTra offers products that are industry leading well tested and simply a perfect fit for portions of the growing military appetite for effective simulation training Following that In January 2019 VirTra issued a statement https www virtra com virtra reviews 2018 operational progress and sets 2019 strategic priorities that it is their intention to strengthen and diversify our current business by bolstering our technological capabilities and increasing our sales footprint and resources in the military market This announcement came only a month after the army s announcement that Microsoft had won a 480M contract to build prototypes for the new IVAS program Importantly from that point forward VirTra conference calls and investor presentations have continually given general updates on the ever present military opportunity If not aware of the Army program this opportunity never seemed to materialize for VirTra and instead seemed like a never end carrot on a stick However with the first units of IVAS headsets set to be delivered in September 2021 things are becoming more clear it is my interpretation that VirTra is on the precipice of announcing a major contract for the IVAS program to provide thousands of recoil kits and potentially Threat Fire devices and or ballistic calculation software which could be worth north of 10 000 000 per year for the foreseeable future The following sections are some of the reasons why I think VirTra is on the verge of announcing a deal as part of the IVAS program Military s Requirement for Recoil Kits and Ballistic Accuracy The Army made it clear since the beginning of the program via it s Statement of Objectives https mk0uploadvrcom4bcwhj kinstacdn com wp content uploads 2018 11 Army AR Objectives pdf that they want recoil kits which integrate directly into real weapons VirTra is the clear leader in this space By using real weapons with simulation recoil kits the Army is trying to solve the following problems https web

this problem Non combat appended equipment Interferes with combat equipment and competes with weapon platform real estate limitations VirTra s recoil kits don t require any additional equipment whereas most other tetherless recoil kits on the market require extra equipment Hit location not used in casualty assessment VirTra has an industry leading ballistics calculator and already has After Action Review capabilities in their simulator to accurately measure where the simulation round hit From the VirTra website https www virtra com simulator law enforcement v st pro their V Marksmanship https www youtube com watch v BOSxNSwIlfc technology is equipped with the most accurate ballistic calculator in the industry This ballistic calculator mimics the real world trajectory of a projectile

tested for accuracy up to 2 500 meters within 02 milliradians thus providing a powerful training that other marksmanship training simulator programs cannot provide Unrealistic lethality ranges VirTra s ballistic calculators are built for and unique to each weapon s ballistic specs therefore staying true to the weapon in use Cannot lead moving targets VirTra s simulators have moving targets with which their users and weapons can interact VirTra bolstered their portfolio of patented products Knowing the above requirements in February 2019 VirTra was able to expand their recoil kit s capabilities which even better align with the requirements of the Army VirTra acquired patents from Tiberius Technology to officially cement their niche to be https www globenewswire com en news

STP 1 was set to take place in March I can t say for certain the following study took place specifically because of the IVAS requirements but the following month in April 2019 Army Research Lab s ran a clinical study using Threat Fire devices and a V 300 simulator This study scientifically validated the efficacy of Threat Fire use in training such that its use definitively leads to better real world performance Again from the press release https www virtra com new clinical study features virtra v 300 for stress induced training the simulation system paired with the VirTra s patented Threat Fire device induced the right amount of stress to impact their performance By impacting their performance in a significant way they are better able to perform properly in real world situations VirTra has been making connections within the US Army and the Training amp Simulation market The initial IVAS award was handed out in November 2018 VirTra s press release https www virtra com virtra engages top military simulation consultant in July 2019 reported In January 2019 https www virtra com investor relations virtra reviews 2018 operational progress and sets 2019 strategic priorities VirTra announced a concerted effort to allocate more of the company s attention and resources towards the military market As part of that strategy the company has hired Colonel Joe O Connell USAR Ret CEO of JL O Connell amp Associates to assist in advising and brokering relationships with current military leaders and decision makers JL O Connell amp Associates provides a full spectrum of business development services including early teaming and capturing as well as proposal and program management solutions A year later VirTra hired John Givens to the Board of Directors noting https www sec gov Archives edgar data 0001085243 000149315220020359 ex99 2 htm that he has a unique track record of successfully selling and implementing large military simulation contracts worldwide John established the US company of BISim and during his tenure as president of the company he led the business development of its military simulation products from inception to becoming one of the most widely used simulation products throughout all branches of the U S military Both of the above hires seem to have occurred specifically to make connections within the Army and military as a whole and the public statements provided made it clear that the intent was to bolster VirTra s military roster to enhance the company s chances of winning contracts with the Military H1 2021 consisted of hiring hiring and more hiring plus setup of a new ERP system and raising 18M CEO Ferris has stated numerous times that the company is conservative with their capital structure However in the first five months of 2021 VirTra took unprecedented action to bolster their capability for growth at the expense of spending In that time the following actions were taken which in my opinion signals a high likelihood that something big and imminent is on the horizon 17 headcount growth with an additional 14 new jobs currently posted in Q2 At the end of 2019 VirTra had 88 employees At the end of 2020 it was 92 By May 2021 VirTra already had 103 employees If a 17 increase in headcount wasn t fast enough growth as of a few days ago in mid June VirTra had an additional 14 new job postings 6 were specifically related to manufacturing or supply chain including CNC Machinist Inventory Controller Supply Chain Project Manager and Manufacturing Engineer As VirTra s in house manufacturing facility produces recoil kits and Threat Fire devices this is a clear indication that demand is increasing for these products Onboarded a new Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system A new ERP system requires an overhaul of a lot of existing processes requiring both significant time investment and money A company typically only takes this extreme measure when it fully expects significant growth in its future And from https

demonstrates that we are preparing our company to scale to an ever larger size and doing so demands a major overhaul of our logistical systems Capital Raise On March 30th VirTra s stock traded 165 956 500 shares For context the previous thirty days of trading averaged 60 000 shares traded Interestingly enough for conspiracy theorists but not my point is the following day on March 31st the Army announced their 21 9B award to Microsoft to build production IVAS units With all of this volume VirTra jumped at the opportunity to raise 18M by doing a direct offering of 3M shares now 10 78M shares outstanding of common stock at 6 share VirTra has historically been conservative with their balance sheet since paying down all debt when CEO Ferris took over the company and has not raised raised money nor taken on additional debt besides 1M in PPP loans since In my mind this raise signals significant strength for the company they believe this short term share count dilution is well worth the long term growth opportunities it may open up Material backlog amounts from the military in Q1 2021 Lastly once the Army signed a deal with Microsoft and it was official that they were moving forward with IVAS production work CEO Ferris hinted to what sounds like the mythical large military opportunity is officially in the pipeline I ll let CEO Ferris s comments from the most recent conference

up Demand for our solutions is reaching a fever pitch and our ability to fulfill that demand and continue to grow has never been more critical Today much of this transitional work is now behind us which means our attention is now focused on growth During our last call I discussed some of the details of our sales strategy as it pertains to the military market As a reminder we often find success by leveraging our industry leading patented products by partnering with larger players who are already ingrained with decision makers Due to the competitiveness of our industry and the sense of nature of many of our client relationships we are often prohibited from disclosing details related to current contracts as well as prospective growth areas We understand that the lack of large numbers of press releases can be frustrating for some investors who are eager to learn more details about where VirTra is growing and how However our mentality at VirTra is to put the business and the customer first especially when releasing too much information too early can endanger material opportunities We also believe actions speak louder than words We say as much as we can when we can but there are instances in which we are prohibited from disclosing details Unfortunately this is one of those instances But I can confirm that we ve made very real progress in the military market In fact the fruits of that labor have started to show up in our backlog in a material way As long as the need for quality training exists and as long as we re able to execute on our strategy we believe that our success could well continue It might even accelerate What s next for IVAS IVAS is set to field it s first units by September of 2021 Over the next two years Microsoft is supposed to continue to iterate and deliver up to 120 000 HUD units to the Army This only pertains to opportunities that are already public Through 2024 the military will continue to issue prototype and production contracts building out the STE more completely This consists of additional work for the Squad immersive Virtual Trainer SiVT STE Live and Soldier Virtual Trainer SVT All of these programs will build on what the HUD already provides which will significantly upgrade the Army s training programs I believe VirTra s products will be a core component of all of these programs IVAS Contract Potential While specific details about potential contracts are unknown we can come up with a good idea of an upper and lower bound for recoil kits as a baseline As a lower bound the CEO has stated https seek ingalpha com article 4251656 virtras vtsi ceo bob ferris on q4 2018 results earnings call transcript source content type 3Areact 7Csection 3Amain content 7Cbutton 3Abody link what we ve heard is the military is looking at buying thousands and thousands of recoil kits I ll use 10 000 as a rough estimate As an upper bound we can use the same ratio of recoil kits per IVAS unit delivered during STPs and prorating that to the 120k HUDunits to be delivered through 2023 During STP4 there were 540 recoil kits required and 1600 HUD s delivered or 33 of total HUD units This would mean there is a need for 40 000 recoil kits Using 3100 per recoil kit the current cost of VirTra s lowest priced recoil kit as a rough estimate revenues would be in the rtange of 31M and 124M CEO Ferris guided https seek ingalpha com article 4367903 virtra inc vtsi ceo bob ferris on q2 2020 results earnings call transcript source content type 3Areact 7Csection 3Amain content 7Cbutton 3Abody link that we do tend overall to be around 60 gross margins if you look back through our quarters in history And there are chances that based on other factors we could go after a large contract with lower margins So using 40 gross margins and annualizing the above that would translate into roughly 0 57 2 34 of additional EPS each of the following two years alone with add on orders likely in the future For context current estimates have VirTra earning 0 25 EPS in 2021 Other Growth Opportunities But that s not all Below are a few more near term growth opportunities which could also increase growth rates for VirTra While not as significant as the military deal these are non trivial opportunities which in their own rights could bring significant growth to the company from its current expected growth rate of low double digits STEP Program In early 2019 VirTra rolled out a subscription service which lowered upfront costs for their simulators from 100 300k down to as little as 900 month In the two plus years of the STEP program it has a 100 retention rate and expands Total Addressable Market TAgcM from roughly of the largest 18 000 U S law enforcement agencies to all 18 000 agencies As more time goes on more agencies will have the opportunity to purchase the cheaper up front option which has the added benefit of making VirTra s revenue stream much more predictable COVID related lockdowns are ending VirTra has not been able to deliver equipment as quickly as pre COVID due to lockdowns and travel restrictions Additionally CEO Ferris has mentioned that sales have not slowed down and their new and upgraded website which was implemented pre covid was a serendipitously timed expansion of their sales infrastructure This helped grow their bookings from 4 2M in Q4 2019 to 7 4M in Q1 2021 Since all of those bookings have not yet been delivered reopenings will allow VirTra to deliver goods and turn their current 16 1M backlog into revenue much faster Potential law enforcement de escalation training mandates VirTra s V VICTA is the only simulation company with de escalation training curriculum that s been nationally certified by an independent third party With recent events there is chatter of pushing for mandatory police training from either state or federal governments For example from CEO Ferris in the most recent conference call https seek ingalpha com article 4429473 virtras vtsi ceo bob ferris on q1 2021 results earnings call transcript source content type 3Areact 7Csection 3Amain content 7Cbutton 3Abody link Arizona mandated that before a person becomes a member of a civilian board that reviews the actions of peace officers in our state that person must complete several requirements And one of them is 20 hours of simulated event law enforcement training Additionally Georgia s CJCC https www justicegrants info GrantDetails aspx gid 59285 has allotted 15M for grants in 2021 to local law enforcement agencies to support scenario based hands on training for law enforcement officers in use of force or de escalation Additional government funding or mandates across the country could lead to significant accelerated growth for the industry s leader in the law enforcement simulation training industry A recent RFP for up to 24 5M with one of their largest customers Customs and Border Protection In mid May 2021 a sole source contract opportunity worth up to 24 5M over five years came through from Customs and Border Protection a long standing customer of VirTra While this was not an order for 24 5M nor was it a signed contract guaranteeing that amount of future revenue it stands to reason that a customer who has historically been using VirTra has reordered products and now submits an opportunity hinting at large long term orders is likely to follow through To back up the fact that CBP is very interested in VirTra s product a recent 800 000 order under a different 5M contract just came through on June 17 While a 24M IDIQ is nice to have historically these IDIQ contracts are not always fully funded VirTra has won a five year IDIQ worth up to 40M in 2016 that has only had roughly 15M of orders placed through it And the above 5M IDIQ has had less than 2M of orders placed through it Conclusion VirTra currently has a market cap of 85M The company is estimated to earn 0 25 share in EPS during 2021 With 20M in net cash shares are trading just north of 20x earnings which could be argued as a fair price for a small company that has minimal year over year revenue growth However as mentioned the core business has significant tailwinds supported by their recent growth in bookings and backlog which points to accelerating revenue in the quarters to come More importantly their opportunity for Military adoption has never been more compelling As discussed above the probability of Military success in the near term is high and would be a catalyst for significant increase in valuation if and when we do get confirmation The size of contracts and awards could be transformational By owning the stock at current prices you have exposure to a core business that is growing and profitable with significant optionality on Military wins that could lead to their valuation doubling or more based on the magnitude of their success

83,oh4tsd,t2_54f5jr7k,1625865147,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oh4tsd/gtn_stock/,1, GTN stock, Summary Recently I have been looking into a company called Gray Television GTN they are a communications company that owns television stations in the United States approx 24 another few interesting facts I found They are the largest owner of top rated local TV stations Right now they own 94 television stations they are acquiring 17 more soon Sales mostly come from advertising online and broadcasting as well as a retransmission fee Here are their revenues generated by the big 4 networks being CBS NBC ABC amp FOX amp x200B CBS 36 NBC 32 ABC 14 Fox 10 Other 8 Gray Televisions agreements with these companies expire in late 2023 so they would have to be renewed within that span of time There are a number of risks though that they do explain in depth in their 10k amp x200B Financials Most of their revenue at the moment comes from retransmission the second biggest is Local News Coverage Net income is also growing I have done a DCF model on this company and have gotten a fair value of 74 99 per share using low estimates of future revenue from YF and using a 1 5 perpetual growth rate this makes the company SEVERELY undervalued even with very conservative estimates there is still a 232 upside from the current price 22 54 at the time of writing amp x200B Metric Industry Average Gray Television PE 39 16 6 30 PB 4 3 0 87 PS 3 91 0 89 P FCF 43 45 3 70 amp x200B It might also be helpful to know that their Current Ratio is an astounding 5 21 Their Debt Equity Ratio is also 1 64 amp x200B Conclusion Gray Television definitely has some potential looking at the metrics alone it is severely undervalued But that can be a problem the company owns and operates local television stations and while the companies financials suggest it is wildly undervalued even with conservative estimates it is also likely that the company may only be slightly undervalued considering that there isnt much a future for TV lets be honest how many of us will be paying cable in the future I m betting not many of us Despite I am still currently Bullish on the company

breakouts As a PSFE holder who has watched this thing day in and day out for months Check and check PREFACE Honestly I wasn t sure a pt 3 would be necessary at least until we ended up closer to the end of the structure or behind the Wendy s dumpster which always remains a distinct possibility However we gained a lot of information this week that further validated what I had laid out in pt 2 and which I think you apes might be interested in reading those that like tendies at least My position 2009 15 21 and 30 August 12c so far and a few up the chain for July for good measure and because they ve already been eaten alive so why sell lol Okay now on to an update of where I see us in the schematic RECAP When last we talked PSFE had begun steadily coming back down from our 10 day following a suspicious pump here on WSB that I do believe was an orchestrated attempt by the tutes to generate more bag holders and in turn paper hands Remember they want every last weak handed retailer shaken out of this channel so that when they give the signal for liftoff they can be certain that all liquidity has been drained giving them a cement floor and a cabin full of all their tute friends and only the most battle tested diamond hands They need to know that they ve bought up all that they can and need to for a successful launch Here s our chart going into this past week as well as the Wyckoff schematic https preview redd it 5xacp17lj9a71 png width 2376 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f31cc33a10a22efc15a1b23f021f87a305bf9486 https preview redd it 4uybo8xlj9a71 png width 975 amp format

test for liquidity at each support line just hoping that they ll find paper hands waiting to be robbed With each move down they would put just a little more pressure on your diamond hands begging you to bail We had already seen it start following relatively high volume institutional accumulation happening at the 12 level on 6 29 and 6 30 with 7 1 s low volume bounce off of 11 67 to close at 11 77 corresponding support 11 72 and 7 2 s low volume close at 11 42 support 11 41 No paper hands or institutional unloading here What happened Tuesday and Wednesday 7 6 7 7 saw a move down into the original supply zone 11 08 11 28 on pitiful volume each with a bounce off of 11 13 and closes at 11 25 and 11 15 respectively No paper hands liquidity there either https preview redd it meq2h74tj9a71

schematic has to have one but it is the point in the structure where tutes attempt one final shake out by pulling the rug out from underneath the retail in an attempt to suck in every last paper hand they can before demand seizes back control These usually look like an aggressive sell off on suspiciously low volume that breaks beneath the structure and clenches rectums the world over I had said to look out for it It could have gone all the way down past the 10 23 the selling climax but it seemed to me that based on where our demand had shown up in the past it would likely see upper 10s at the lowest At last 7 8 PSFE opens all the way down at 10 81 smashing below the demand zone Admittedly it was in the midst of a brutal day in the market but surprisingly the bottom didn t fall out Diamond hands prevailed in our darkest hour and from there we would see bulls carry us all the way back to an 11 16 close while testing the bottom support of the demand zone To be honest I was hesitant to call the spring there as it was hard to discern how much of the plummet was the result of macro factors and how much was indeed that spring we were hoping for However today gave us even more information https preview redd it efryl62vj9a71 png width 2376 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 4caf26eb23810f7dd742d3f5d1a3cd849ffa3f01 Here it is with lines on the hourly if that s easier for you

gradual test of support resistances and liquidity this time on the ascent In other words I was hopeful that we would at least reclaim 11 28 on a move up today likely with some measure of volume restraint but tilted towards the bulls on moves up Remember the tutes are in total control still They aren t ready to mark her up yet They just want to know that the channel is bone dry What we got A 3 move up all the way to an 11 52 close on absolutely embarrassing volume Even more interesting buying volume seemed to increase throughout the day consistent with moves up What this tells me is that not only is liquidity pretty well completely drained from the channel much of the buying pressure was actually coming out of the float and not in their secretive price pinning sort of way Great sign in my opinion Why this matters for you After this week s action I believe the darkest night for Paysafe is now behind us in terms of the Wyckoff This looks like a textbook C phase to me with the potential of today being the start of a D phase Congratulations to those who jumped in this week looking for a spring but for those who didn t I do believe the rocket is looking to be in the final

possible that we have another test of that 11 28 level to complete a C phase and then our measured move up over the top of the structure for the final test of strength or it is possible that we are now currently sitting at the beginning of a D phase We ll need to see where it goes from here to determine that I ll post again if I see the signs of a sign of strength test when we get there and if anyone out there finds this content useful or at least mildly entertaining What follows the D phase The mark up This is when the rocket ship loaded to the brim with tutes seek the upper reaches of the galaxy with every tailwind they can muster at our back They will aim to get it as high as they can before either re accumulating more or entering into a distribution phase where the roles are reversed and they want to sell us all a rocket ship that s run out of fuel You ll know all this when you see it https preview redd it pzhgmkh3k9a71 png width 775 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3dfd0b06122bee6957c7f43ef14f6e122615e760 The point is make your own call and obviously remember I m an idiot who could be looking at this all wrong but it has played out in textbook enough fashion that I think it s worth continuing to hand over the plans as I see them to you apes because I like the idea of apes crashing the moon party I m always open to feedback Also worth noting Next Friday has a good amount of open call interest starting at 12 5 which falls dead center of the supply zone 11 4 11 64 That will be an interesting level to watch I have a hard time thinking they ll cede those options unless tutes are the ones loaded up though it ll be worth seeing what happens there Further check out the section of my last post that discusses the first PIPE lockup expiry language Like I said there I personally believe they re unlocked and clearly haven t been sold though there are some who interpret that expiration as happening on Monday July 12 It s finally going to be fun to watch the new 13Fs pouring in PSFE already had 58 11 institutional ownership and ranks 1 of all stocks for institutional accumulation on Fintel according to someone who has the pro subscription This is

99a946e59be43165bd1083f0eb75dde5e38b6a0e All in all safe travels apes TL DR After this week I believe even more strongly that Paysafe is playing out a textbook Wyckoff accumulation schematic where tutes have been buying up every last seat for an inevitable rocket launch under our noses Further I believe we fulfilled the spring of the C phase meaning the bottom is now behind us and we re currently witnessing the gradual raising of the rocket from the subterranean bunker up to the launch pad This is not investment advice I m an idiot after all It also still isn t me begging or telling you to buy here It s just me giving you some telltale signs to look out for as you do your own DD Some have suggested waiting until you can buy into the strength of a mark up phase your call Never a bad idea especially since the hallmark of this phase of the structure is painfully low volume indicating low liquidity but I personally believe tutes have been loading this entire channel for months at these very prices All in all I think the rocket engines are being gradually powered up here Whereas there is still so far as we know 30m shares shorted this isn t a squeeze play imo it s rather an opportunity to crash a moon party the tutes have been planning all for themselves for months Consider climbing aboard if it suits ya If you re already aboard hodl on tight

saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years Everything about the platform is great and like many others I have no plans of switching The algorithm is unlike anything I ve experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres I m sure you have felt a similar experience Unfortunately none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation As history has shown Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition and eventually was bought by Sirius XM Growing Sales Doesn t Justify its High Valuation Spotify is currently valued as a high margin wide moat business Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren t expected for at least four to five years Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth huge podcast signings and overall great product The question I always follow up and ask is How much more room is there to grow Spotify has already absorbed close to 35 of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year it s only going to get more competitive Some reports are claiming that Spotify s share has declined closer to 30 as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify If Spotify can t generate a profit now when will they Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term it doesn t imply a sustainable business model On top of that Spotify s high EV EBITDA can t use profit margins since negative imply it s trading well above fair value vs similar names such as Netflix Sirius XM or Apple Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples but to me that is the point I m trying to make Spotify doesn t deserve this valuation given its low margin business If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18 25 net income margins Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure 73 80 of the company s revenue is subject to this in a given year and it isn t going anywhere There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this it s a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify s revenue Figure 3 shows Spotify s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top line growth It s even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there There isn t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share Why is that important you might ask Well one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now has been for years revolves around artists who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so This does not bode well for Spotify s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists it s only going to hurt their bottom line Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify Earlier this year Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists It s a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high resolution stream offering there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify I m not claiming to be a music expert but many blogs articles are out there touting Apple s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move They may match what Apple has released but until then it has become a new near term risk for Spotify Don t Sleep on Spotify s Debt Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow it s important to recognize the 1 8 billion in debt on its balance sheet In early 2021 Spotify raised 1 3 billion in unsecured notes For what exactly Many are speculating on the uses An acquisition General corporate purposes Paying out more to artists That remains to be said but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026 The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation Prior to going public in 2018 Spotify had raised approximately 1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly 10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing Kind of weird when you re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate There aren t any fair comparables I ve seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples to accurately value it So what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues has a superior product but can t make a profit I m a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn t improve bottom line margins Does it take five years Ten After going public in mid 2018 Spotify traded range bound between 105 200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off In my opinion this more than 100 increase to 350 per share was not justified given the company s inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU s played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run up Even though Spotify s share price is down 28 from its February high there is still room to fall Don t catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low 100 s where it belongs
