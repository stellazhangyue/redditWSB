EV or FinTech but this space is important Let me tell you why Clover Health CLOV is going to the fucking moon soon CLOV merged with IPOC Chamath s SPAC Chamath s track record speaks for itself His investments including SPCE OPEN and his other current PIPE investment have all done really well and are quality companies Since the merger with Clover Health Chamath upped his stake in the Clover Health and now owns roughly 30 Not long after a 13D was filed by Clover s CEO to up his stake in the company and now owns around 37 The CEO has a proven track record of building successful healthcare businesses on the services side that he s sold for billions Another notable mention is Bill and Hillary Clinton s daughter Chelsea She is on the Board of Directors for Clover and has been a believer in the company for a while now She recently opted to exercise her shares rather than sell after merging because she s in it for the long haul if there s one thing we know it s that the Clinton family gets their bag Numerous other executives at Clover and Social Capital have done the same including Ian Osborne There s 70 institutions holding the stock but other notable smart money includes backing from Google and Sequoia Capital If you don t know what Sequoia capital is I encourage you to look up previous companies they ve invested in Follow the smart money Let s talk some numbers Medicare Advantage spending was 270 billion in 2019 and is expected to expand to 590 billion by 2025 As of now CLOV is only in 34 counties That doesn t sound that impressive at first glance However just being in 34 counties generated them 507M in revenue They already said this year they ll be in 108 counties which will take their revenue to just shy of a billion There s 3 000 counties in the US Being in 108 counties is just 0 03 penetration of the total addressable market They ve already said they want to be in every corner of the country and the cash generated from this IPO will help them expand to get there Their market share is growing exponentially 9x faster than its closest competitors and revenues are growing 50 Speaking of total addressable market 10 000 boomers turn 65 a day That s an extremely concrete and measurable customer base that can only expand We now have president Biden who has sworn to revamp Medicare and possibly lower age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 60 If that happens that s fucking millions of extra potential customers a month Let s talk a little more about what Clover does They ve proven to build Medicare Advantage plans that balance quality and cost They re fixated on how they can deliver the lowest cost possible Any business obsessed with delivering value and cost savings to consumers is always successful Always To me this is reinforced through their very impressive partnerships with retail giants in the counties they operate in including Walmart CVS Walgreens Kroger Costco But wait that s not all they do Here s what makes CLOV special Clover is a double edged sword In addition to their Medicare business the other side of the business that can be leveraged in conjunction to their Medicare plans is called Clover Assistant This is their proprietary AI focused and data driven software It allows doctors to leverage historical patient data in order to create more effective treatment plans This results in lowered costs fewer visits and better outcomes for everyone involved Think of this as Einstein for Salesforce CRM or Watson for IBM Clover Assistant can be the Einstein for the EHRS electronic health record systems This industry is prime for disruption There are very few tech advancements in the healthcare world from an operations perspective Keep in mind this side of the business is still in its infancy with only 2000 physicians on it They plan to ramp exponentially with an upcoming direct contracting model in addition to using proceeds from IPO for further market penetration Future catalysts include 20 price target from Bank of America doesn t seem to be on web yet but pic from Bloomberg Terminal shared on Twitter they were invited to speak at the prestigious JPM Health Conference on 1 12 Check out the deep dive presentation Tons of great growth states there JP Morgan coverage price target soon they are presenting at the 4th annual Medicare Advantage Leadership Innovations Conference on 1 27 where they mentioned they will reveal their latest currently announced partnership Could be great PR Biden has laid out themes of what he will discuss in the coming week each day He will discuss his healthcare plans on 1 28 where he will surely discuss his Medicare plans including his plans to lower the Medicare eligibility age future PR from Chamath Clover major news outlets and price targets There is very little PR on the web about Clover Health currently as a recent IPO Once that picks up we are going to the moon technicals there s been a lot of speculation that the suits have held this stock down to shake out weak hands and load up before the fireworks begin The stock has been heavily accumulating in a descending wedge Looks like the short volume is decreasing and when PR starts to come out shorts will cover basically making this a mini squeeze out Chart looks ready float a lot of the public float has been eaten up with the executives involved increasing their share 67 is owned between CLOV CEO Vivek and Chamath alone According to Yahoo Finance data there s only 11M float left of 145M shares outstanding That s not too much left for retail to buy especially once there s more eyeballs on this stock via PTs and PR That s getting close to low float levels Low float short squeeze This to me seems like a no brainer especially under this new administration See you all on the moon Position YOLO averaged up to 14 with entire life savings

room Chen s unpacking some homemade Yangzouh Fried Rice from his wife Tom is microwaving stale coffee and asking Chen if he s going to change his name to Cha Ching after he becomes a Billionaire in 2023 Chen smirks as he cracks open his wheel of fortune cookie the point is rocket is still fucking grounded I repeat the rocket is grounded Listen retards did you miss AMD Did you miss NVDA Did you miss trash ass Cringecoin Hell did you even miss TSLA Are you seething with FOMO up to your ears and out of your assholes watching these stocks mint fresh millennial millionaires while you twiddled your thumbs thinking GeE WiZ tHeY haVe To CoMe DoWn EveNtuAlLYyyyYyyYy Pro tip they never came down These rockets went to the fucking moon and left your ass behind on planet Earth living a shitty wage life flipping burgers while the retards that boarded these rockets are on the moon laying on beach chairs sunglasses on and rubbing sunscreen with SPF 9000 on their smooth brains because they got front row tickets to the sun FRONT ROW TICKETS TO THE FUCKING SUN this is the present state of affairs There is lucky you however another rocket with the inscription BBC fueling up and selling tickets to the moon AS WE SPEAK Current position missionary with 10 555 shares and reverse cowgirl with some calls I m holding unrealized profits of about 110k and realized profits of about 100k However if you ask me 10 years from now my biggest regret in life I will tell you two things 1 not getting my wife her bf earlier on and 2 booking 100k profit too soon in BB May Lord Chen forgive my moment of weakness Learn from me Buy and walk away Buy and hold Do not be tempted to sell before the moon To not sell when the rocket is still in the stratosphere Moon is 50 IF THE STOCK JUST TRADES ON PAR WITH ITS FUCKING PEERS MOON CAN EASILY BE 100 IF YOU FACTOR IN VERTICALS ECONOMIC MOAT and a 450 750 billion Auto Data Market as stated in Mckinsey amp Company s report on Monetizing Auto Data Yes that s not a mistake the overall revenue pool from Global Auto Data monetization could be as high as 750 BILLION in 2023 This is the market BB has cornered and is about to squeeze by the balls QNX was always the crown Jewel of all their verticals This was always the master plan for the turnaround We are on the fucking cusp of one of the greatest turnarounds in history Listen I don t think some of you rough brained retards realize what is happening Ask yourselves why is the EV sector so hot Why is every large tech corporation trying to get a piece of this Auto pie You wanna know why Because when the computer first came out it took the space of entire fucking floors in a building to do simple calculations when the cell phone first came out you needed a fucking brief case just to carry it and looked like an absolute tool making a phone call stopping everything you re doing laying down your suitcase opening it taking out the brick extending a massive antenna LMFAO what fucking tools boomers were anyways now look at the modern laptop and smartphone Look at the revolutions these products went through to become cemented into our lives Look at the markets these products opened up for us Now what current item is undergoing this type of revolution You guessed it you smooth brained criminal you the Automobile What was once dinosaur machinery unironically running on dead dinosaurs is now making the revolution on the scale that computers and phones went through to become what they are today And guess who created a business moat anticipating this move 10 years in advance Guess who cemented their ISO SAFETY CERTIFIED AUTO OS into 175 million automobiles as of today hint hint it s the same company that s so criminally undervalued and just took on AWS as their partner to scale up their business for next phase of the turnaround Revenue Growth Blackberry It s Blackberry Babe berry Member berry The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice boys whAt aBoUT GoOgLe aNd APpLe or TSLA TaKiNg OvEr the Auto OS mArKet Listen retards BlackBerry s MOAT is bullet proof You know why Because what s the one thing Google Apple and TSLA have in common They re actually in the fucking auto business You think Mercedes or Toyota wants to cede even more profit in the auto business to competitors by adopting their OS and giving them a boost Do you know how cutthroat and ruthless the corporate world is Let me demonstrate with the ol lemonade stand analogy Let s say you setup a lemonade stand outside your house and all the kids are going nuts for your lemonade Next thing you know Jimmy from next door opens a lemonade stand and throws in a Jolly Rancher inside each lemonade he makes You re fucked Jimmy just took your business your friends and your girl and her bf You need to level the playing field by adding Jolly Ranchers to your lemonade so how will you do this Are you gonna go up to Jimmy s stand and straight up buy Jolly Ranchers from your mortal enemy Is that what a smooth brained person would do NO you would walk your ass down the street to a neutral third party convenient store buy fucking Jolly Ranchers from them and while you re at it buy some cough syrup and add that as well to your fucking lemonade Because fuck Jimmy that s why Speaking of lemonade wHat iF ShiTrOn TaKeS a ShIT oN BB Andrew Left although the gayest bear of them all actually saw BB potential years ago calling it the next NVDA He was early on that call but he was right Back to the lemonade moat Listen retards Blackberry is not a competitor to any auto maker the same way Apple Google and TSLA are You think auto makers are going to use their competitors OS Or you think these non techy auto dinosaurs like Mercedes and Toyota are gonna reinvent the wheel and create their own OS Fuck no Don t be so rough brained and fall for that gay bear DD BlackBerry is a third party corporation that all auto makers can form an auto cartel around with Papa Chen as the cartel lord A couple automakers MIGHT create their own OS because they re a fucking tech company to begin with and they have the scale and reach to do so but don t think for A FUCKING SECOND their competitors are gonna just line up to use it and cede more their profits to them These other Auto OS if made will be specific and unique to that companies own car Think Use that smooth brain Blackberry has effectively become the gate keeper of the Auto Data Market Also this is a tough fucking market Cars are on of the most data rich endpoints in the world that need securing This isn t like a laptop you click the wrong link and next thing you know you have a million Hentai pop ups The car is more serious You click the wrong link and you re dead Are you getting the picture now Do you see why Cylance was bought Do you see why BlackBerry s moat is so secure Not only does QNX act as the gatekeeper of all auto data it fucking protects the super sensitive endpoints using AI driven cyber protection that gets better and better the more the data grows which it will exponentially Automakers are lined up like school boys on Easter Sunday ready for deliverance from Papa Chen as he blesses them with QNX Remember when Chen said when better days come we ll be ready to execute Better days are here This is what he was talking about They ve positioned and prepared themselves for 10 years to become the Auto Data Gatekeeper once the technology was ready The foresight on Papa Chen Absolute Genius The Ultimate DD by Mckinsey amp Company Read This and Get your Pee Pee Hard knowing BB will effectively be the gatekeeper of this New Market https www mckinsey com media mckinsey industries automotive 20and 20assembly our 20insights monetizing 20car 20data monetizing car data ashx

the scale that computers and phones went through to become what they are today And guess who created a business moat anticipating this move 10 years in advance Guess who cemented their ISO SAFETY CERTIFIED AUTO OS into 175 million automobiles as of today hint hint it s the same company that s so criminally undervalued and just took on AWS as their partner to scale up their business for next phase of the turnaround Revenue Growth Blackberry It s Blackberry Babe berry Member berry The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice boys whAt aBoUT GoOgLe aNd APpLe or TSLA TaKiNg OvEr the Auto OS mArKet Listen retards BlackBerry s MOAT is bullet proof You know why Because what s the one thing Google Apple and TSLA have in common They re actually in the fucking auto business You think Mercedes or Toyota wants to cede even more profit in the auto business to competitors by adopting their OS and giving them a boost Do you know how cutthroat and ruthless the corporate world is Let me demonstrate with the ol lemonade stand analogy Let s say you setup a lemonade stand outside your house and all the kids are going nuts for your lemonade Next thing you know Jimmy from next door opens a lemonade stand and throws in a Jolly Rancher inside each lemonade he makes You re fucked Jimmy just took your business your friends your girl and her bf You need to level the playing field by adding Jolly Ranchers to your lemonade so how will you do this Are you gonna go up to Jimmy s stand and straight up buy Jolly Ranchers from your mortal enemy Is that what a smooth brained person would do NO you would walk your ass down the street to a neutral third party convenient store buy fucking Jolly Ranchers from them and while you re at it buy some cough syrup and add that as well to your lemonade Because fuck Jimmy that s why Speaking of lemonade wHat iF ShiTrOn TaKeS a ShIT oN BB Andrew Left although the gayest bear of them all actually saw BB potential years ago calling it the next NVDA He was early on that call but he was right Back to the lemonade moat Listen retards Blackberry is not a competitor to any auto maker the same way Apple Google and TSLA are You think auto makers are going to use their competitors OS Or you think these non techy auto dinosaurs like Mercedes and Toyota are gonna reinvent the wheel and create their own OS Fuck no Don t be so rough brained and fall for that gay bear DD BlackBerry is a third party corporation that all auto makers can form an auto cartel around with Papa Chen as the cartel lord A couple automakers MIGHT create their own OS because they re a fucking tech company to begin with and they have the scale and reach to do so but don t think for A FUCKING SECOND their competitors are gonna just line up to use it and cede more their profits to them These other Auto OS if made will be specific and unique to that companies own car Think Use that smooth brain Blackberry has effectively become the gate keeper of the Auto Data Market Also this is a tough fucking market Cars are one of the most data rich endpoints in the world that need securing This isn t like a laptop you click the wrong link and next thing you know you have a million Hentai pop ups The car is more serious You click the wrong link and you re dead Are you getting the picture now Do you see why Cylance was bought Do you see why BlackBerry s moat is so secure Cylance has just been integrated into QNX and was shown off at CES How many of you missed that fine detail Not only does QNX now act as the gatekeeper of all auto data it fucking protects the super sensitive endpoints using AI driven cyber protection that gets better and better the more the data grows which it will exponentially Automakers are lined up like school boys on Easter Sunday ready for deliverance from Papa Chen as he blesses them with QNX Remember when Chen said when better days come we ll be ready to execute Better days are here This is what he was talking about They ve positioned and prepared themselves for 10 years to become the Auto Data Gatekeeper once the technology was ready The foresight on Papa Chen Absolute Genius Credits fo the DD https www reddit com r wallstreetbets

convinced that Apple is going to completely blow away their earnings expectations on 12 27 for 4 different reasons which I will go through in this post but first I ve gotta give some background on how I can speculate on all of this Background I am a co host of the YouTube channel Max Tech which has a heavy focus on covering Apple products I used to make videos for the channel Appleinsider so I started working and studying everything Apple way back in September of 2016 when I made my first Apple related videos Over the past 4 and a half years I ve never seen this much attention hype and

articles below and giving a short TLDR on why it s so bullish I will also include my own experience and bullish sentiment I ve noticed over the past couple of months Reason 1 Apple s iPhone 12 lineup is getting incredible amounts of demand due mostly to the new flat edged design and other features like MagSafe and camera software improvements There have been many reports of record sales growth in China and US sales being so good that Apple has increased production of the iPhone 12 due to demand I ve personally really enjoyed the iPhone 12 and I think it feels like a totally different phone due

that if they beat expectations it will be BIG Apple has been absolutely killing it this year and we ve definitely noticed greatly improved sentiment on YouTube Image Below If you look at Apple s one year chart There was a huge slump since their high on September 1st It s stayed very flat until recently I expect it to continue to run up this week as we get closer to earnings on Wednesday amp x200B

stimulus checks spent on Apple products very strong forecast for next quarter due to new products and higher end Macs and record breaking Services revenue How to play earnings Buy in on Monday If there is a huge run up this week which I think there will be sell before the market closes on Wednesday to avoid IV crush only for options If it stays flat or dips hold through earnings If the entire market starts to crash you should be selling because Apple very closely follows the S amp P 500 and drops if there s high volatility even when they destroy expectations Position AAPL 135c 2 19 Most

wallstreetbets comments ky9m34 unusual options activity 101 whale watching tips utm source share amp utm medium ios app amp utm name iossmf There is still time thanks to Biden s executive action flurry Why you should buy the oil dip Allow me to appeal to your inner boomer if you will With ugly headlines and the euphoric rush into clean energy Oil has become a laughingstock with those hunting for postworthy gains One explanation for crude s irrelevance is that it doesn t have the infinite meme potential of speculative tech but a more substantial explanation is rampant misconception about the potential of big oil to stage a comeback The way the energy landscape is shifting toward renewable sources particularly with Biden coming into office on a wave of promises has made natural oil amp gas a seeming relic That landscape shift is real undoubtedly but crude still has a large role to play in energy s immediate future and the transition to cleaner alternatives is far from concluded Oil can actually be one of the better bets of the year if you have a little patience particularly for those looking for some easy entry leaps without the buying power to park say 10k in TSLA 1 21 22 calls If you know why the oil crash happened know the realities of the changing energy landscape and know which companies are poised to actually thrive in the new administration because of not in spite of Biden s assault on fossil fuels you ll become a believer So what happened On April 20th of last year you literally had to pay somebody to take your oil Crude fell to about 40 a barrel everyone flipped their collective shit and USO went into freefall As Covid raged and the need for oil vanished in almost every everyday capacity no working meant no car gas no flying meant no jet fuel demand plummeted and facilities across the world were stuck with more oil than they knew what do with By the end of spring the cost of storage for oil was legitimately lower than the cost of the oil barrels themselves The industry had the biggest GUH moment of the crisis https i imgur com VzrSG02 jpg except for travel This unusual commodities event was made more unusual by the group controlling global oil flow The amount of oil produced internationally and therefore the price per barrel is controlled by the Saudi led Middle East oil cartel OPEC plus Russia so we call them OPEC They re a weird tense collection of profitable but problematic nations known for their internal discord but when the crash occurred they begrudgingly agreed to lower their collective oil output levels so that the supply side surplus situation wasn t AS crazy I mean things had gotten so bad by this point that there were cargo ships sitting off every coast with barrels upon barrels of oil just going to waste because they had no place to put it and nobody wanted to buy the physical barrels to store them Only Russia was still pushing production hard because they are Russia Here is a rough explanation pic https i imgur com JOhxmjQ jpg OPEC managed to stop the bleeding by decreasing production by millions of barrels per day for the remainder of 2020 but leading into the January 2021 OPEC meeting the market largely expected them to increase production again in anticipation of the seemingly imminent global reopening Here are the price points of the big names a year ago under Trump before the crash DVN was at 25 85 CVX was 111 RDS was 61 33 OXY was at 43 bucks COP was at 65 What s happening now OPEC surprisingly has been measured and bullish with their decision making when it comes to oil supply recently with nations making individual sacrifices for the greater global economy at the January meeting If you hop into oil with me you ll find that the OPEC meetings and consortium are a straight up Gossip Girl NBA level drama the collective is rife with shady politics internal conflict snubs and backstabbing particularly since the ME nations have a unique and complex power struggle with Russia Of importance to your tendies though is that the bickering ladies of OPEC made a decision that will boom oil profits in two ways This month Saudi Arabia surprisingly agreed to slash their production by 1 million barrels per day through March this was huge and bigly fucked the oil bears Check out this crazy ass quote the Saudi OPEC spokesman delivered to speculators who wanted to short oil believing OPEC didn t have the stones or the wherewithal lower output gt We have the responsibility of looking after the market and we will take all necessary actions I have said this repeatedly and even advised that no one should bet against our resolve Prince Abdulaziz said in an interview with Bloomberg News after the OPEC meeting Those who have listened are now bearing the fruits the others good luck with their ouching I don t know about you but I trust this fucking madman with my tendies and my life Bear r fuk he says These OPEC production cuts directly benefit United States shale producers US big oil profits were going to be SHOOK this year by the fact that the crash brought scrutiny and demand to their corporations similar to financial institutions in 2008 Because oil lending from banks became more tightened the oil companies agreed to first pay down debt and that combined with their commitment to oil and gas production slashes to hamper output left them few if any avenues to bring in profit after the COVID demand decline The only way they could significantly increase profit margins was by the price of crude miraculously increasing By choking the supply OPEC did just that putting money into the pockets of US and European oil companies by raising the price per barrel of WTI west texas intermediary crude as a sort of sympathy play US oil companies just got a free money lifeline the only way that was possible a miraculous increase in the price of crude due to outside supply pressure Barrel prices jumped over 5 the day this was announced alot Outlooks and PT were raised across the board So we ve established that the international supply and demand mechanisms for oil have a good forecast due to OPEC willingness to lower output But what about back home in the good ol USA Will we get any help Biden ironically is the second reason catalyst for an oil moooooooning Domestic oil companies are in for a boom due to dual demand pressures of a re opening and b Biden shutting down competition in the industry and choking supply through legislation intended as a commitment to renewables which instead functions as a commitment to the largest corporations A is easy we all get the reopening logic Shit opens people drive people fly gas jet fuel factories etc B is the one that s more interesting Biden s renewable crusade benefits certain major oil companies because the regulations and oversight eliminate production competition for bigger corporations rather than hurting their bottom line It s analogous to the reality that small businesses which shut down due to COVID are going to be swallowed up by the larger companies remaining open like WMT and TGT the COVID death knell for small oil in this case is government regulation intended to facilitate a transition into clean energy Why Well large oil companies are already locked into certain contracts that reach maturation years even decades from now regardless of coming regulation that s guaranteed production in perpetuity for big oil that smaller outfits don t have Many of these contracts are for leases on federal land drilling which is most targeted by Biden s administration By disallowing new oil leases revoking international permits and restricting available land Biden s is shutting out small and mid level energy companies that are looking to get their foot in the door or continue their growth momentum by accessing newer areas particularly shale deposits and federal land reserves By shrinking drilling real estate through his flurry of new policies Biden is creating a moat around the larger oil companies that are still flush with contracts from the Trump energy boom they locked in control of current and future production for years to come on the majority of the workable land that will ever be available during this administration and likely beyond those contracts cannot be rescinded Additionally major oil companies have all been pivoting to alternative renewable anticipating this very moment https i imgur com FJeNMYP jpg their clean energy R amp D and lobbying alone can shit on most mid level and small competition whose only hope for serious market share was expanded production Big oil companies know a renewable energy pivot is actually great for their bottom line through eliminating competition so much so that they fought HARD for it During Trump s administration they went against his repeal of methane gas regulation https www statesman com in depth news environment 2021 01 18 texas oil and bidens climate plan we examined impact 6553014002 gt ExxonMobil BP and Shell all tried to stop the Trump administration s rollbacks of methane regulations and have argued in favor of federal oversight on the issue according to Bloomberg Why would they do tees tings Are big oil companies suddenly altruistic Hell no it s profitable gt If you do that then conceivably you re still left with companies that are producing oil and gas they re just much larger karrIngham said And you ve eliminated a great deal of the fabric of the industry that s been around for decades upon decades in the state of Texas Ah yes By pushing for regulation big oil makes the little producer refiner obsolete since they are worlds behind in renewable energy initiatives Another moat So Biden is directly benefitting corporations by a providing a head start to those companies that have access to the resources and science for a pivot to renewables and b also increasing their market share of fossil fuel production supply due to a finite amount of land opportunity Need proof We already have two great examples of what kind of effect Biden s policies will have on large oil companies First proof This week Biden halted new leases on drilling for oil and gas on Federal Land At first you may think ohhhhhh shit that s a problem And it is for the little guys The largest oil companies can afford the hit because they are more diversified in holdings and also stocked up on the leases during Trump s last year in office More land leases by large oil companies were signed during Trump s last year in office than anytime in American history in preparation for this political action Muted big oil results from Biden s opening volley When this federal land ban was announced exciting federal land up and comers like EOG and DVN that rely on exploratory production fell over 7 while big boy XOM fell only 2 9 Crippling for the smaller market share corporations but for the larger companies that s negligible Second proof the new administration s affect with the Keystone Pipeline news Biden coldly revoked the permit with Canada it is kind of sad as they ve been building a world of infrastructure and jobs around sending us a shitload of their crude This is bad for Canada but fine for the big American and Euro oil producer He s shutting out foreign oil production which yes gives the US less oil to refine but again helps big oil companies who are not dependent on oil refineries through diversity of income HE HAS LITERALLY PUMPED DEMAND FOR THESE COMPANIES BY ELIMINATING THE LARGEST DIRECT FOREIGN PRODUCTION SOURCE IN HISTORY Don t want to take my word for it on how beneficial this is Listen to this guy an oil economist from Lubbock Texas gt If you are a developer in West Texas this is going to be a good thing for you because not as much oil from Canada is coming down here and that means less competition An additional pump hydrogen which is the key to much of the alternative energy we rely on and look forward to is largely produced via shale deposit mining by big oil Shale supply is drying up a because a lot of the sites had to close due to COVID demand plummeting and b existing and future environmental regulation Hydrogen is extremely cheap for renewable energy companies to purchase at the moment but relatively soon it is going to be a much more expensive process due to regulations on the land available and the types of shale drilling possible In review Big oil is set to pump not dump because 1 A crazy Saudi OPEC spokesman has said they would continue to pump oil prices by cutting production 2 BIden is creating a supply moat around foreign and domestic competition for big oil 3 The pivot to alternative energy sources and commitment to decarbonization is fine for large oil companies because they have prepared for it and eliminates smaller competition Alternative energy largely relies on hydrogen which is going to become more expensive to produce and therefore more profitable for big oil for a variety of reasons

then usually driven by value or the perception of value but in this case its driven by a bunch of lunatics As price moves up demand decreases and as price moves down Supply decreases Equilibrium is found where S amp D are balanced at a point where Sellers and Buyers agree on a price If however for example demand increases as price moves up the whole Demand curve red line will shift up the blue

yesterdays price action and volume it was clear the stock was very bullish For the last 4 years or so I have been in training with an institutional quant trader and we are taught to ask the following questions 1 What did the market do with volume and 2 What did it do with liquidity amp x200B Price Action 21st Jan https preview redd it ia1bwr2ft3d61 png width 1524 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e0a592116761382f98cf4a3f69a42a0aa5e752b1 1 Volume Look for the highest volume candles on the chart and see if price continued or if the candle reversed On Thurs we see the highest volume candles are all down selling candles however they where all reversed see the candles labelled with the red i e the selling volume was bought and not only was it bought it was most probably bought by large institutions as they are the ones with the order books to stop the market like that Institutions do not buy at the market but rather on the limit and they buy in large quantities so they need volume They either need to generate that volume through price action market manipulations enticing sellers into the market or they buy when the see volume increasing on the books They do not what the market to move before they have finished their accumulation so they enter at the limit at enough volume as to absorb as much as they can without scaring the price higher They might even cap the markets upside keeping the price low so the can accumulate So they buy 1000 and as price comes up the sell 500 to push the price back down rinse and repeat this is why accumulation patterns look like this amp x200B 1 Liquidity There will be liquidity for the large players to accumulate as the round numbers and above or below pivot points Institutions know where retarded traders like to keep their stops they keep them right above below pivots The biggest issue for institutions is finding enough volume to fill their books Now they want to buy low just like everyone else but as we know from S amp D they lower you go the more buyers you will find not more sellers For the institutions to fill their books they need to find SELLERS at lower price from whom they can buy But why would anyone sell at a lower price its less profitable for sellers Therefore the best place to find sellers at lower prices is by finding the buyers stops If the institutions can run the stops those buyers have to become sellers So look for what happens when price goes above or below a pivot point If price immediately goes back inside the pivot we know that that liquidity was bought or sold On the chart we see that everything price went below a pivot point green boxes it immediately bounced back inside showing that the liquidity was being bought This also coincides with the high volume candles So listen up retards to do not keep your stops in these areas as they will get run over leaving you on the sidelines watching as price moons amp x200B amp x200B Price Action 22 Jan https preview redd it

an important level and should be marked Its a good area to either buy or sell depending on your bias There where two opps to buy at the red arrows As price starts going up buying volume keeps increasing this shouldn t happen according to our S amp D dynamics When we see this we know that the market keeps finding more buyers at higher prices This encourages the institution as their biggest fear is being able to get rid of their stock ie finding buyers at higher prices that they can SELL to We have the rejection of the 76 level and price retraces to the 50 level This is an important level of defence for the buyers On the way back to the 50 we see the high volume candles being bought with the highest selling volume for the day being completely reversed This shows the buyers are still engaged The safest trade for is to wait for price to retrace back to and test the liquidity below that high vol candle This is tested and bought on high volume showing institutional interest in the stock and once you see price start going back up above the pivot this is where you should buy This is a very safe trade The buy was also off the moving VWAP again an important metric for the institutions who want to buy below the VWAP Many traders bonuses are calculated on this Later on we see buying volume increasing again as prices rise Lastly for the Market Profile guys we can see buyers have emerged above the POC as price has gone bullish amp x200B https preview redd it 3e3v728nt3d61 png width 1473 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 7a2407bc136640f767bd8c864ea92eefd0275716

financial situations ,I ve noticed a lot of users making similar threads and those are all wonderful I ve been trying to get attention to Children s hospital for over a month but my efforts haven t gotten any attention I m also including other people because of things I ve seen whenever I ve gone to GME stores This post will include 3 scenarios where we can help out There are plenty on Autism already just don t do Autism Speaks You don t have read all of them just navigate to what interests you 1 Children s Hospitals This one is close to my heart and a brief story about it will be included at the bottom I m buying PUR Memberships https ibb co CKmS9h0 on their behalf AFTER speaking with someone in charge and verifying etc Full details at bottom 2 Sad side of GME I ve seen so many young customers come with their parents usually minorities and want to buy a product but the parent realizes it is above what they were expecting and could afford Given how small stores are everyone in the store hears that and the kid is just embarrassed 3 The employees remember today is a pro day sale Perfect time to drop by with pizza amp goodies or something else Shoutout to u txbustanut but not everyone has to do something similar It s all relative just like how many shares we can buy 4 Offer few 10 GC to random people maybe even to customers who are in store today but aren t pro members they can use it and become one Speaking of shares Never feel bad or ashamed that you can t buy as some people on here Buy anything you can you don t need to be a whale you need to be an ant Ever noticed how ants work together and carry big pieces of food Well folks we are all ants some just bigger than others Do your part we break down walls and we all feast together and can spread the wealth Alright I m going to include my original post from after we went private but couldn t post here mainly because I m going to own up to what I said about BB and PLTR I was wrong about it however the money put into those would ve still got more returns yesterday in GME and definitely going forward 1 Children s Hospital Call up your local children s hospital ask for the donations department and speak with them little story time I have a cousin who had major health problems when he was 9 he spent most of the year in the children s hospital I spent many days taking care of my other cousin his 8 year old brother when the parents were working It wrecked havoc on their life but nothing gets me more than seeing how it affected my cousins The one in the hospital would question if he would be normal again The other one that I would look after one time he turned around and asked if God really exists and if he did why is he doing this Holy fuck I was just in my 20s trying to bang chicks before Tinder I didn t know how to handle situations like this Anyways now that I got your attention Ask the person in charge of the Donations Children s Lifea department of what s acceptable etc If you ve remembered my posts I ve always had plans of starting a mass donation charity effort Based on my conversation with the lady in charge of the department this is what she said would be the best option for that specific location yours may vary I offered to have a PUR membership and give them a choice of digital vs physical copy of Game Informer Digital would require every kid signing in to same account so not a possibility and best to go with Physical No this isn t specific to GME but if you re playing If you re not playing GME you can still make some kid s day Anyways the lady said physical copy would be best because they can decide who would be the best candidate to enjoy it You can also use the hospital s phone number and let them know to utilize the account s certificates for toys etc There s usually quite a few stuff on clearance that they can pick up or you can etc Maybe you ve got more tendies to spare ask them if they would be interested in Nintendo switches or traditional consoles Buy used ones with warranty so if something happens they can easily be swapped out Ultimately it s about making some kid s life a little better in the dark alone segregated even more now with Covid and miserable time they are going through Love you all even the the ones who think BB has a chance and the PLTR buyers in end of Nov 2 Sad side of GME Well it s not because of GME but GME s tiny store and close proximity layout makes it more noticeable than any other store Ever been in there and you see a kid lt 14 come in with a parent They come in for a product and the kid is excited then the parent finds out the price and realizes that it was beyond what they were expecting Needless to say the whole store hears it and the kid is crushed and visibly affected by embarrassment Anyways it happens often it may not be every time you go in but I ve noticed it too often I ve thought about offering to cover but that would add on to the embarrassment of a stranger doing it in person So how about making a great relationship with the store manager or lead etc and offer to have a special GC for that reason Fill it up with 50 or whatever you feel like on a monthly or however often after big plays and ask them to use a portion of it for such customers This shouldn t be customer wanted 80 product but up sold them with 100 product and offer to cover 50 with that GC It should really be like hey we ve got a customer who has donated some money and we can cover the extra 15 here etc Thoughts 3 Employees Goes without saying they are the front line and face of the company to the average customer Today is PRO day even dropping buy with pizza and drinks would make a huge difference 4 Random people Buy 1 or a few 10 GC offer them separately and different times places for people to claim them for free You ve now made someone save 10 and they will use it towards something at GME Let them know it was made possible with the PUR membership and now they can have their own rewards and benefits for only 5 customer for life Thanks for reading make your tendies in whatever ticker you want but hand with GME because we haven t even started the squeeze PS I personally believe in the long haul 2023 turnaround

,Long time first time yada yada yada tldr at bottom So did you see what all those stupid articles on whatever ad infested websites were saying yesterday GameStop soars another 50 from EPIC short squeeze up 69 nice at time of halt You see this and think omg it s actually happening Wrong Anyone with half a brain that doesn t use the word retard while writing an article can work for those asinine media companies So while a couple of us are partly qualified for those jobs and are able to fit the rectangle block in the rectangle hole our pristine vernacular of the English language may have us shown the door maybe the same one our friend at the helm of Citron is on his way through Now even a former Boglehead like me should be able to figure out that the short squeeze has not been mcsquozen Quick quote before we get into things I think it was Denzel Washington who once said If you don t read the newspaper you re uninformed But if you do read the newspaper you re misinformed Definitely something to think about in this day and age Anyway moving on As probably many people at this point have already said what happened on Friday was a gamma squeeze This comes from MM s having to hedge from all of us degenerates buying options They however work a little differently than us when it comes to limiting their exposure Us morons have to have 100 shares of a stock to be able to sell a covered call against it If we had less than 100 shares we may as well be as naked as the GameStop shorts There s this little guy called delta frankly if you don t know the Greeks it may be wise to take a quick break from options and learn those little buggers that MM s use as their indicator of how many shares they need to limit their exposure Delta is a number between 0 and 1 Say you buy an option and the delta is 41 MM s have to buy 41 shares to limit their downward exposure But as the share price moves closer to the strike price delta will increase and thus the MM s will have to buy a few more shares and vice versa with price moving down So with the sheer amount of those otm options purchased yesterday looking at you 55 60 calls MM s had to hedge accordingly but as more people bought those calls as the price became closer and closer to the strike it created a fun feedback loop where the MM s were then forced purchase those additional shares as delta increased So then after the halts call buyers near and far took their profits which caused the MM s to unwind their exposure bringing the stock price back down If you bought 3 000 worth of 60c 0DTE and sold at the right time you would ve made a cool million I know right what the fuck So could this happen again next Friday If a lot people expect a gamma squeeze like this to happen and buy a shitload of way otm calls then it could be a self fulfilling prophecy and there will be many new millionaires made next Friday I personally have some PLTR calls I ll be selling next week after demo day to try and fuck around with some 0DTE s and most likely get burned lol But don t you ever listen to someone who says they know exactly where a stock price is going in the future and always do your own DD Anyone else find it very odd that the highest strike price call option was only 60 AND THAT IT FINISHED ITM Either way calls with new strikes have been written anyone see those 1 29 115 s lmao So moving forward into next week don t be scared or discouraged if we have some relatively flatter days we ve been this far Personally I would sort of like to see GME consolidate a little bit in the beginning part of the week this is healthy for a stock increasing exponential growth of 50 every day while it looks just dandy on your account cannot be kept up at any longer term rate Also as of today GME has 8 more days for their fourth quarter earnings You know what this means Buy PowerUp rewards buy a console for your wife s bf preferably a bundle buy used games maximize profit margin or fuck even buy Thor s battle axe and use it as a butt plug for all I care we know after the past two weeks that s about the only thing that will fucking fit An unexpected revenue and earnings beat as well as profitability may absolutely send this thing to the stratosphere Why is nobody talking about Reggie as well as our three wise men from RC Ventures As a side note there s also a lot of new blood entering from this publicity Be nice to them we were all beginners at one time so answer their questions as basic as they may seem Also be careful about what DD s you may read they could be using this platform for their own malicious benefit rather than the good of the group TL DR gamma squeeze made some people rich as fuck may happen again next Friday but it also may not Don t be scared of consolidation next week Buy some shit from GameStop in the next eight days Squeeze has not been squozed And finally thank the O G GME gang for the hundreds probably even thousands of hours they collectively put in to help us all Be patient be well sighs Positions 1541 GME shares bought at 13 17 18 32 35 42 52 66 lol 5 GME 1 21 2022 30c 609 PLTR shares bought at 19 24 26 27 10 PLTR 5 21 40c And energy and metals mining mutual

lot of this has been overdone in this subreddit but in summary Approaching 1B software and licensing revenue on 7 85B market cap very reasonable price to sales for SAAS CEO John Chen has a technical background BS in Electrical Engineering from Brown MS in EE from Caltech from Wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki John S Chen This is super important for tech companies because a technical CEO will actually understand their product and not just be a bean counter case study Bob Swan and Intel CEO John Chen made the bold move of pivoting from a doomed hardware business to software and has stuck at it for the last 7 years he s not going anywhere until he accomplishes his mission Recent Sony AWS etc partnerships They are the incumbent in auto OS with Blackberry QNX running on 175 million cars right now PR Newswire source https www prnewswire com news releases blackberry qnx software now embedded in more than 175 million vehicles 301081594 html 5 years ago they were at 60 million so that s a CAGR of 23 8 per year though that s starting to slow 2019 to 2020 was 150M gt 175M so 16 7 as they reach saturation I imagine COVID Diversified revenue streams licensing patents QNX Spark etc IEC safety certs possibility of integrating with their own security products https blackberry qnx com en resource center qnx certifications https blackberry qnx com en resource center qnx certifications I haven t found anything similar for Android Automotive yet let me know if there is What is Android Automotive hint not the same as Android Auto First off Google made this very confusing by having two different things called Android Automotive the OS and Android Auto the app Here s what they say https source android com devices automotive start what automotive gt Android Automotive is Android Android Automotive is not a fork or parallel development of Android It is the same codebase and lives in the same repository as the Android shipped on phones tablets etc It builds on a robust platform and feature set developed over 10 years enabling it to leverage the existing security model compatibility program developer tools and infrastructure while continuing to be highly customizable and portable completely free and open source gt gt Android Automotive extends Android In the course of building Android into a full featured platform for infotainment we re adding support for automotive specific requirements features and technologies Android Automotive will be a full stack turnkey automotive infotainment platform just as Android is for mobile today Android Automotive is Android That s a big thing That means Android Automotive is backed by Google and Google s Android teams Android Automotive is backed by the Android open source community Android Automotive can integrate closer with Google Play Store Google Maps and Google Assistant literal quote from Nissan s press release here https global nissannews com en releases release 860852d7040eed420ffbaebb22094eb4 180918 01 e which I cover later Any Android developers should theoretically be able to write an app for Android Automotive without too much retraining We re talking about software here so ultimately it s up to engineers and developers to actually use it In the past software deals were signed by taking CTOs and account executives to steakhouses and golfing excursions These days engineers are a lot more involved oftentimes spinning up prototypes to demo for their leadership before any deals are signed Or if they aren t that s a huge red flag for any company that relies on tech Developer friendliness case study documentation This sounds dumb but let s look at what documentation engineers would have to work with Virgin Blackberry QNX docs http www qnx com download group html programid 29183 http www qnx com download group html programid 29183 Folder icons and entire page literally look out of Windows XP You have to download PDFs what are you going to do print them all out and arrange them in your cubicle Chad Android Automotive docs https source android com devices automotive evs camera system https source android com devices automotive evs camera system Super clean super easy to read all in the browser well organized Compare these to successful API based SAAS services like Stripe https stripe com docs api or Twilio https www twilio com docs usage api If you were a developer and learning auto OS for the first time what would you rather use Obviously no company is going to pick an operating system based on their documentation alone but I think it reveals a lot about the development ecosystem that their engineers will have to operate in And ever more these days engineers are empowered to guide their leadership in what software they want to use e g engineers would rather use easy to use MongoDB than stuffy old Oracle Market Share As mentioned at the beginning Blackberry QNX is killing it with 175M cars on the road That s the main reason why I like it in the short term huge amounts of recurring SAAS revenue I m worried that in 5 10 years Apple and Google are going to come in and eat Blackberry s lunch just like they did with mobile GM will use Android Automotive in all their cars starting in 2021 The Verge https www theverge com 2019 9 5 20851021 general motors android auto google infotainment gt General Motors will use Google s new Android

big tech companies may soon edge out automakers with advanced While BB still gets their share if the Apple Intel developments are any indication Apple will use 3rd parties to get going but their obsession with seamless hardware software in their products makes me wonder how long it ll take before Apple does their own car OS Summary Big picture the auto OS market is huge expected to hit 4 5B by 2026 so there s plenty of money to go around It s possible Blackberry QNX Android Automotive and other OS may all flourish together global news wire source https www globenewswire com news release 2020 11 24 2132346 0 en Automotive OS Market to hit USD 4 5 Bn by 2026 Global Market Insights Inc html That said I find it very worrying that companies like GM Nissan Porsche are deciding to partner with the Google and Apple for their new models obviously they have no incentive to retrofit old existing cars with new OS Short term BB s biggest moat comes from their incumbent market share security guarantees ie as a customer you d get IEC certs for free by using BB QNX I think their next few years will remain cushy Long term I don t see any guarantee that auto manufacturers especially start ups composed of SV engineers wouldn t go with open source Android Automotive over closed source Windows XP docs BB QNX that reeks of like IBM Oracle HP type boomer software BB does have diversified revenue with their security offerings so though QNX is a large portion of their revenue it s not all As mentioned earlier I do have shares of BB as well as GOOGL and think BB will have a jolly good time in the next 3 5 years But I do worry that Google and Apple will come in and repeat what they did to Blackberry with mobile Obligatory Cheers

around in my head and don t represent the feelings of the community Feel free to downvote and move on if 1 it s too much text or 2 you actually disagree There is a tl dr for the smoothest of brains at the bottom Wallstreetbets in the mainstream media As we all know WSB is receiving the most mainstream media coverage that it has ever had thanks to the action over the past couple of weeks Not only people who have never heard of WSB but people who have never spared the stock market a thought in their entire life are hearing about this wonderfully autistic community GameStop was the second most trending Google search at the tail end of this week But many of us are unhappy with the mainstream media attention that WSB has been getting and for good reason Reddit is painted as some collective entity that planned to pump a stock to the moon with all of our individual hundreds of dollars something that was not at all helped by that horrendous Twitter account Weeks upon weeks of incredibly meticulous research and due diligence done by u Uberkikz11 and u Deepfuckingvalue have been reduced to so much as Reddit mob pumps stock in the eyes of the public In the days and weeks to come WSB will be getting a large influx of new members thanks to all this public attention Posts will ascend to levels of retardation never before seen People asking WSB to pump penny stocks People asking how do I sign up for Robinhood Remember the perception of many new members will be WSB made themselves rich by pumping GME they can make me rich too I urge all of you to keep the spirit of WSB alive and not let the influx of new degenerates dilute this place into a get rich quick forum for morons with a thirst for unscrupulous market manipulation tactics The mods will have their work cut out for them so use your downvotes and help them out as much as possible At the same time however remember that dumb money is still money Do not reject people from the community because of their ignorance because their ignorance is only the result of being misled by the media Do not validate people s claims that WSB is an angry mob of Redditors baselessly campaigning for GME Rather educate them and gently caress the wrinkles out of their brains in a manner befitting a true WSB autist From Melvin and Citron s perspectives this has turned from a struggle against a single online forum into a widespread battle against retail traders across the board The pressure is on even more so than before Wallstreetbets in the eyes of Wall Street What has transpired over the past week and what will continue to transpire going into the next few is likely the greatest redistribution of wealth from Wall Street to Main Street that has ever been seen And Wall Street as one would imagine is not happy In an ironic but perhaps not unexpected twist of fate Larry Summers the man who bailed out one of the largest corporate fraud rings in world history in 2008 while simultaneously fighting to keep everyday American mortgage holders underwater https www propublica org article dems obama broke pledge to force banks to help homeowners is calling for SEC regulation of a subreddit full of retail clowns https www youtube com watch t 2590 amp v mo5MGKM0Lds In every conceivable scenario big money has seized every opportunity to milk Main Street leaving retail traders high and dry while Wall Street fills its pockets with cash In the words of everyone s favorite movie Wall Street loves to use confusing terms to make you think only they can do what they do Or even better for you just to leave them the fuck alone This is an opportunity to punish firms like Melvin for the underhanded tactics that they ve employed and given free passes for for too long When people say democratize Wall Street this is exactly what they mean This is an opportunity to level the playing field and illustrate that retail traders can come up with a good fundamental thesis and when it comes down to it we can and will put our money where our mouth is For those of you who are new to WSB I can speak only for myself but I welcome the true artists amongst you But if you re here because you believe Reddit can get you rich by pumping any stock that you choose to champion you don t belong here and while I don t speak for anyone else I would kindly ask you to leave I d strongly encourage any new members to filter for Loss flairs for a dose of reality However if you are here because your interest as been genuinely piqued take a moment to read some of the content by u Uberkikz11 and u Deepfuckingvalue to understand why so many have taken an interest in GME I can confidently assure you that there is far far more to this company than Reddit mob pumps stock This is an amazing community that has given back to charity far more selflessly than any Wall Street big wigs The majority of us are not sending pizzas and merch to someone s personal address in real life We rejoice in one another s victories commiserate but glorify in one another losses and encourage one another with memes of varying levels of quality This is the side of the community that I want people to see when the mainstream media directs them here amp x200B tl dr mainstream media is bad but also turned the larger public on to a chance to profit off of Melvin s tomfoolery retail traders are slowly gaining traction in a space still largely dominated by Wall Street keep the WSB spirit alive but behave yourself outside of the Reddit sphere Positions 3 7MM in GME 1 15MM in BB Check my post history for proof

corner down the block and to the right I m in with 100 7c 1 21 22s this new CEO isn t fucking around with partnerships with Google and NASA among others Plus the company is buying back shares along with Finland Eating Huawei dropped contracts and opportunities Nokia selected for U S Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project https www nokia com about us news releases 2021 01 14 nokia selected for us

year expansion deal Nokia and M1 have signed a partnership agreement to deploy Nokia s cloud native Core software in order to drive Singapore s 5G standalone network launch in 2021 https www nokia com about us news releases 2021 01 13 nokia and m1 partner with 5g standalone core to drive singapores 5g ecosystem You ve convinced me throwing 200 into 2023 7 calls and holding forever Nokia just SOUNDS like it s gonna touch 10 in the next two years Nokia has a great conversion rate from 4G to 5G and looks like a real solid bet despite its high stock volume I notice a lot of ppl are very skeptical on Nokia However considering all the deals they just recently made and looking over there 10Q I believe they have tons of potential for growth with 5G I m in on them and I m ready NOK made me tendies on the Q3 dip That shit is so staked to 4 there was no way it wouldn t return Not a bad idea They have agreements with the big carriers like ATT where they provide the Radios and get to install them as well so it s double dip time They recently 2 years started hiring actual cell techs to do the installation instead of parting the work out to contractors Source I work for a boomer cell tower REIT Nokia bb this ain t 1999 anymore fools Nokia is the new Nio I m in 5G 5 Expecting this shit to go up during the next 2 weeks before earnings In on 5 calls 4 calls for Jan 22 and 2000 shares long avg 4 19 Idgaf what anyone here does I m gonna buy more as soon as I get my severance payout 5g play even at 33 every other day in 2 yrs this can print big IMRO a huge jack up in price despite the massive float isn t an unlikely scenario Approximately 727 886 076 shares under current institutional ownership As it starts trending up and hits a few successful ERs it could easily increase by 50 60 conservatively Shit starts moving when the tutes want it to Then say perhaps some big name makes public a huge buy in the hundreds of millions of shares That would definitely set off retail jumping on board as normies start flooding into it and boomers see the gains in their dusty portfolios and increase their positions Then developmentally disabled YOLOers start going balls deep into it And for the coup de grace NOK either reinstates its dividend or does a small to moderate share buy back Then its moon time Loaded to the tits with the trifecta shares 4c July calls and fat 5c January 22 amp 7c January 23 LEAPs Been watching this for a year and the sentiment is finally taking off Bullish AF Incoming gainz pr0n My NOK leaps are shockingly making me money But GME is making me far more money far faster The only way NOK is gonna move if and when they are able to payout dividents again I like the energy if we could bring this shit from the basement to the moon Wsb can do anything I have faith in papa Pekka in wsb we trust New CEO was a high ranking exec during the period in which NOKIA was at is peak in the 00s 6G in the work 5G they are all in Starting up making appliances US and EU are shunning Huawei Government 5G security contract FCC just sold 80b worth of 5G spectrum Contracts with many major mobile players NASA 4G contract for the moon Finnish government took a 5 stake Mounting pressure for other governments to take a controlling stake to protect global data security Google cloud contract Chinas largest telecom just tested their AI software 70 cost saving was discovered using Nokia Mining contracts Airport contracts Port Contracts 5G smart car AI connectivity in the works They are a 5G and logistics company Not a phone company They license out the Nokia name to HMD but don t actually make or develop phones Nokia up next for the boom for sure I m loading up Still got all my BB and GME though big fuckin NOKers I m 20k in LFG boys BUY SHARES RETARDS The only way to support this is to dump all your savings on actual shares calls do nothing ALLIN Totally restructured the company Hired a new CEO with an excellent track record who got his start as an executive at the company this is personal for him a triumphant return to his roots so he ll be motivated Totally revamped both smartphone and feature phone offerings to optimize their portfolio for growth markets Stand to gain massively from the Western world s recent spate of bans on Huawei s network tech Shifted their telecom business strategy to go all in on Open RAN and will be the best positioned network tech manufacturer to offer future proof tech including both hardware and software solutions that will be used by other Open RAN adopters

this year Thread, Disclaimer I am not a tax specialist nor an accountant In fact I just learned half of this 15 minutes ago I will describe what I have learned over a few hours of research and if something is false tell me in a DM or a comment I will be diligent with my edits I saw a few people having no idea how to handle this situation earlier in a comment section so I did a few hours of research in an attempt to assist So here s the rules for IRA s Roth and Traditional maximum limit for both is 6k year As in I could put 3k in one and 3k in the other Additionally you can only add the 6k if it s REAL income from your job at Wendy s You can t make 0 in income and convert 6k in brokerage shares to an IRA Traditional IRA Practically anyone can contribute to this It removes your initial tax burden but you pay taxes when it comes out So if I put 6k in today it would deduct that 6k from my income for tax purposes But when I withdraw it if I m even still alive at 59 5 the withdrawals will be taxed like income In between now and then the CAPITAL GAINS are not taxed So I can turn my 6k into 1M in the IRA and it s tax free but if I pull out 100k it s taxed like 100k income Roth IRA Same as trad but opposite no tax deductions now but you don t pay tax when it comes out I can withdraw 100k from my Roth at 60 and not a penny goes to the government However there are INCOME LIMITS ON A ROTH It begins graduating your contribution lower at 125k Right now income above 140k in a given year means you cannot contribute to a Roth AT ALL This includes long and short term capital gains if I make 70k in income and realize a 70k gain in shares of whatever my Roth is fuk AND THERE IS THE PROBLEM if you re retarded like me and already contributed to a Roth but have a fair and unexpected chance of exceeding that 140k in GME YOLO gains regular income So what happens now Here are your options 1 Withdraw the excess contribution While this does not count as a distribution and you won t be penalized it s basically an undo function you must also take out your proportional gains for the time your money was in the account So if you YOLO GME in your roth sell make 140k income then pull out your 6k you also need to take out the proportion of your GME earnings And you bet your ass those are getting taxed Which is why this should be done if your IRA grows slowly but you ve seen a giant windfall in your income This is touched on in more detail after point 2 2 Move the money to a trad You should be keen on this if for example you have 1M in unrealized gains in your trading account and no major difference in your IRA and you can get ahead right now because you know for a fact you re going over that s 140k Why Because once again tax man is gonna steal your money based on the value of your ENTIRE IRA FOR 1 AND 2 HERE IS THE FORMULA Excess contribution x adjusted closing balance adjusted opening balance adjusted opening balance So say I added 6k to an 18k Roth on Jan 1 made 100 000 bucks in the IRA on Jan 2 and then moved the 6k to a trad on Jan 3 25k of that 100 000 made on Jan 2 would be taxed as income because 6k is 1 4 of 24k and 25k is 1 4 of a 100k SHIT LIKE THAT IS GENUINELY POSSIBLE WITH GME RIGHT NOW so be wary Normally this isn t a big deal pulling 6k out of a million dollar account will not be an issue but an account that has seen a huge difference in value relative to the 6k withdrawal will be hurt 3 Don t do shit If your regular income is not going to exceed 140k you may want to do this if you find yourself in dire straits because it s too late to take alternate action However that shouldn t happen because I m telling you how to handle this 12 months in advance IRS will charge you a 6 tax on your excess contribution for the year BUT the 6 will stop being charged once the difference is accounted for So if I qualify for a Roth next year but don t contribute because I was over by 6k this year I pay my 6 360 for this year and then don t have to worry about it The issue is if I make 140k again next year the 6 excise tax will continue on in perpetuity Which means forever retards 4 Rollover your contribution to next year You DEFINITELY want to do this if you make huge gains in your regular account AND your IRA at the same time This is basically the better version of not doing shit If you re not gonna make 140k again next year just rollover your 6k contribution to next year contribute 6k to your trad this year and that s it Problem solved Well unless you re gonna make over 140k again next year But if that was in the cards you d probably not be using a Roth in the first place I HAVE NOT FOUND DATA ON WHETHER THE SAME 6K CAN BE ROLLED OVER MORE THAN ONCE but I believe that s kosher 5 Back door roth This is optimal for rich phucks but requires planning Add money to trad hold it there for a year then convert it to a Roth Though you have to pay taxes when you transfer that amount but that s no different than a regular roth contribution but you re allowed to do it with your income being over 140k Alright fellas now go make some tendies

Because the trading dynamic has changed I think shorts will choose to cover this week and next which lends strong support to price assuming it happens I also think MMs will put their guard up a little And I think the company will make actions soon though maybe not this week I find it impossible to predict Monday as there s a lot of option settlement stuff and Friday was way up but I think this week is likelier than not green on short covering Finally There is downside risk with the massive gamma ramp down but I don t think it will get activated this week Disclaimer I have a few long duration puts I grabbed around 70 that I intend to dump as soon as possible because they no longer match my views and I may initiate long position after because I m currently short term bullish on this stock having through though the current dynamics this weekend Yes this has been my worst trade this year you are welcome longs No I don t have updated gamma charts those become available Monday morning I too am curious One key perspective in trading is how are the other groups trading going to trade and what is the structure of the market Trades only make sense in the context of the market the stock exists in This stock does not exist in the same market it existed in even a week ago and certainly 2 weeks ago and as such many trade theses became very obviously invalid Friday That means the value based short GME trade that made sense from a value basis a few weeks ago no longer make sense even though the price is even higher The key actors here are Majors Retail which can be summarized as net long The Market Makers Option Dealers Long Short Hedge Funds The Company Minors Value Mutual Funds Wildcard Other hedge funds Here s my analysis of each Market Context Before this week you could see GME as a battle to determine fair value of a stock At this point though you can look at the GME chart in a 6 month or 1 yr view and it looks like more like a hyberbolic bubble situation like the most popular SPACs of last year or that digital money thing we don t talk about here in the earlier days or that battery company that has a ticker that starts with a Q or Tilray during it s original bubble period In other words this market looks like a bubble That doesn t mean we are above a stable exit price It just means the market has bubble like characteristics which is important to the actions of the actors Bubbles pop when the capital inflows flip But more importantly bubbles scare the hell out of shorts Shorts know not to short bubbles unless they can precisely predict when the capital inflows will flip If they don t know this they figure it out fast Retail Retail in particular WSB and retail have made it s intentions clear Buy at any price until the shorts capitulate and WSB and other retail traders have shown a lot more capital available than in the past in these scenarios which makes it a very credible threat alongside the obvious emotional investment That leads to some behavior outcomes elsewhere in this It is unknown what retail will do if this has a 30 drawdown but I personally think it would be more durable than usual in bid Some retail will buy long term puts but those will be low gamma and shouldn t matter a lot MMs Option Dealers They got burned hard Friday Normally they are happy to sell you guys tons of options and provide liquidity on exits and lend out their long shares to short sellers for fees and this kind of volume and volatility sounds like enormous profit to them But because they over sold 60 calls and could not hedge smoothly they got burned to the tune of low 9 figures as a group They are going to be careful to not get burned again They will accomplish this through a few methods First they are going to charge you more for options That s already happening and it means building gamma ramps are harder but also means more of you will just buy shares Secondly they may choose to hedge your calls at higher delta than mathematically standard so they might buy 30 shares to hedge a call that normally would get 20 This would guarantee smooth hedging ahead of upwards momentum into big strikes like 75 or 115 Overall I don t think this really matters much it just means you are not going to see a market breaking gamma degenerity like Friday and more gradual gamma squeezes like that first Wednesday squeeze It is worth noting that there is a 50m share gamma ramp DOWN should this stock enter free fall selling in which dealers being so long stock could end up being forced to dump it and then even short but I don t know what would cause that this week so I think it s very unlikely to be a factor this week unless net capital flows go negative from retail Long Short Hedge Funds These are the guys who account for most of the short interest and have not been margin called because they have huge diversified books with dynamic risk management They look at GME They think it generously justifies a 20 target and really think it s worth 10 They are dead certain without a raise the company is out of business in 3 years They expect a capital raise and dilution and also expect selling They have traditional valuation metrics to think this They saw this happening and thought wow these guys are retail traders they ll just take their money and run and this will come crashing down If a stock is smart to short at 7 it must be brilliant to short at 60 right The problem is that thesis depends on the market context of this being an orderly market around a value stock That s not what this market is after Friday at least from a raw glance at the chart on 6m view and that s on top of very high short borrow fees that are bleeding money for them Most importantly this market is closer to a bubble and one DOES NOT short a bubble that is moving up or is stable You only short a bubble while it is clearly collapsing I would expect a rational CIO at one of those funds to point out the context mismatch what was a value short is now a bubble short and tell the traders to get the hell out ASAP maybe even tomorrow or Friday at the close which might have been some of that melt up to 64 Or hedge it which means buying now very expensive OTM calls which ends up helping the stock price In short I think after Friday these funds are going to try to get an orderly cover of their short ASAP and expect short interest to fall quickly on that Other shorts may show up but they won t be as committed And I think a lot of shorting will shift to long term OTM put options betting on a regression to mean some months from now but those don t add selling by dealers when written I think this is a change of context that will finally cause short covering and is why I m bullish the stock this week There was also some recent news about short funds just getting out of shorting in this market because it s a loser right now The Company GME is here for long term shareholder value Their goal is not to screw the shorts and it is also not to get the stock to the highest value possible in a 3 day period They should and can issue new shares but should do that with a growth story about why they are doing it in order to hopefully make a bid as they do it I think that could happen any time and it might come with a new role for Cohen which of course make sit a bid So I think they will raise and I think the current market will bid the raise Value Mutual Funds A lot picked up GME in the single digits They ve been selling example is the orderly position reduction of that GME board members stake I expect they are mostly or entirely out by now since these are now growth stock prices and they thus will have little impact on this stock Wildcard Hedge funds A sufficiently large hedge fund can do very odd things to this stock by tossing a quarter to a half a billion of capital at it They could bid it up with you they also could try to trigger the gamma ramp down and pair with OTM puts They could also do the Stevie Cohen Sell an enormous amount of near the money calls or puts to dealers so as to ceiling or floor the price Really hard to know But this stock will attract some very smart money in this context waiting for opportunities which could be to GME long s benefit or detraction Impact Chaos Wildcard Insiders Cohen can t swing trade for a profit anything he hasn t held 6 months or more as a 10 holder and I think that s bad for his reputation anyway Most other board members and execs could and may but I don t think that will be negatively received by this market really I don t expect this to matter much I also don t think Cohen is going to buy since he can become CEO at this point if he wants to out of the next election between the support of this sub his reputation his current votes etc
