independent analysis and showed it captures 300 of the carbon used in the manufacturing process making it one of the first carbon negative production processes Not only that but since they are using scrap material the production costs are not tied to inflation or any other material such as oil In fact they estimate producing these bioplastics at a cost which will be competitive with current oil based plastics and that doesn t even include any carbon credit incentives Origin is currently building the Origin 1 plant due EOY 2022 which will be their testbed plant that is focused on refining and optimizing their full scale production for both current and future materials From there EOY 2024 will mark the completion of their Origin 2 plant which will be a full production scale facility and

their maximum production after all their facilities are built is just a little above what one of the 6 production plants of Origin And on top of that they have to use vegetable oils so are prone to crop inflation Right now they are valued at 25 which according to their data puts them at a 14x multiple of their future EBITDA and a 15 discount rate The same comparison would put Origin up over 40 a share today Origin is primed to cash in on the current boom in ESG focus Their current projects look to double in EBITDA when forecasting for the potential of carbon capture premiums and other environmental opportunities They can also license their technology to other companies since there is a huge market which one company can never fill When looking at the demand they have already gotten 1bln in offtake commitments and while they could have more they have chosen to reserve capacity for higher margin items On top of all that Origin now has partnerships with Nestle Danone and Pepsico who are some of the largest plastic users in the world Match that with their connections from their board they have the chops to make this work and scale And to go along with that the merger with warrants will provide them with enough funding to get to their EBITDA positive timeframe with another 250mln in buffer So there is very little risk of dilution via share issuance Beyond their factories they are also looking at licensing hte technology for another revenue stream to further accelerate growth none of my calculations take this into account The potential for additional revenue is just absolutely massive since there is a 1 TRILLION addressable market opportunity Once in a lifetime opportunity Competitors Origin doesn t have any direct competitors but it does have some analogs PureCycle is one but their focus is on biodegradable plastics They use canola oil as their feedstock so their price is tied to the price of the commodity and even at relatively low costs today they still cost 1 lb vs 0 29 lb for Origin Also there are a ton of products that shouldn t be biodegradable car parts for example shouldn t be degrading Danimer Scientific is another analogue but has the same issues as Purecycle In the end there is no other company that is looking to make carbon negative plastics Elephant in the Room Plastics are an environmental problem There are microplastics that are increasing in concentration in the ocean and in ocean life specifically and they have become a disease on the planet Why am I okay with this personally for Origin Well simply it is a step in the right direction There are a large number of applications which require non biodegradability but ultimately this begins to get market penetration with zero modification for carbon reduction It s a trade off for sure but it s only the start Things start to look much better with net zero fuel pellets and water filters carbon black and agricultural applications which aside from the fuel are all carbon negative In the end this is an insanely huge step towards reducing our carbon footprint and right now that takes priority for me Risks They currently have no revenue and are building their first plant Origin 1 This plant is still just a testing plant and they are quite far away from revenue positive The plant was also delayed a year likely due to COVID but they now have the equipment on site Overall There is a huge push for countries and companies to reduce their carbon footprint and this company is set to not only make a very profitable and sustainable product but to also capture a shitton of carbon doing it In the long run this company is likely going to explode in value as they have the talent experience and in demand product There are real risks here but the upside is

independent analysis and showed it captures 300 of the carbon used in the manufacturing process making it one of the first carbon negative production processes Not only that but since they are using scrap material the production costs are not tied to inflation or any other material such as oil In fact they estimate producing these bioplastics at a cost which will be competitive with current oil based plastics and that doesn t even include any carbon credit incentives Origin is currently building the Origin 1 plant due EOY 2022 which will be their testbed plant that is focused on refining and optimizing their full scale production for both current and future materials From there EOY 2024 will mark the completion of their Origin 2 plant which will be a full production scale facility and also create a positive EBITDA From there they plan for 5 more plants estimating a 2 3bln EBITDA by 2030 This company has the potential to absolutely boom Leadership These folks know their chemistry Lots of names out of UC Davis where this tech was developed so this isn t just some pipe dream MBA bullshit They also have lots of leadership out of the chemicals production space from the likes of Dow Chemicals So that s great on that level but how do we know they will actually be able to execute 1 Board Chair Karen Richardson who is also a board member of BP 2 Boon Sim Leader for both Credit Suisse and Temasek Holdings aka the sovereign wealth fund of Singapore which is known for being one of the most sophisticated funds in the world 3 Along with that execs from Clorox Dupont and P amp G So tons of experience and connections with huge players I was on the fence until I saw who was on the board now I m stoked Insider Buying and Investment 1 Just before merger Charles Drucker bought an additional 650k shares bringing his total ownership to 18 862 500 shares 2 On top of that Apollo Funds invested 30m in Origin furthering my confidence in the company 3 On June 25th Lior I Amram and Evergreen InvestCo bought 10m shares furthering the large long term investments in the company Ridiculously Tiny FloatSo due to the above the current available float is sitting at 29m but wait there s Less With the buying mentioned above this is reduced to only 18 23m shares That is tiny We are only starting to get a sense for institutional ownership There just aren t that many shares available right now so that means the price will be heavily affected by even a small increase in demand More volatile Yes but also will make a runup in price all the more likely Market The market is currently pegged at 1tln of potential so there is tons of room for expansion But let s take a look at Danimer Scientific who was another company which merged last year and also looks to produce bioplastics If you look at their investor presentation you can see they are further along but their maximum production after all their facilities are built is just a little above what one of the 6 production plants of Origin And on top of that they have to use vegetable oils so are prone to crop inflation Right now they are valued at 25 which according to their data puts them at a 14x multiple of their future EBITDA and a 15 discount rate The same comparison would put Origin up over 40 a share today Origin is primed to cash in on the current boom Their current projects look to double in EBITDA when forecasting for the potential of carbon capture premiums and other environmental opportunities They can also license their technology to other companies since there is a huge market which one company can never fill When looking at the demand they have already gotten 1bln in offtake commitments and while they could have more they have chosen to reserve capacity for higher margin items On top of all that Origin now has partnerships with Nestle Danone and Pepsico who are some of the largest plastic users in the world Match that with their connections from their board they have the chops to make this work and scale And to go along with that the merger with warrants will provide them with enough funding to get to their EBITDA positive timeframe with another 250mln in buffer So there is very little risk of dilution via share issuance Beyond their factories they are also looking at licensing hte technology for another revenue stream to further accelerate growth none of my calculations take this into account The potential for additional revenue is just absolutely massive since there is a 1 TRILLION addressable market opportunity Once in a lifetime opportunity Competitors Origin doesn t have any direct competitors but it does have some analogs PureCycle is one but their focus is on biodegradable plastics They use canola oil as their feedstock so their price is tied to the price of the commodity and even at relatively low costs today they still cost 1 lb vs 0 29 lb for Origin Also there are a ton of products that shouldn t be biodegradable car parts for example shouldn t be degrading Danimer Scientific is another analogue but has the same issues as Purecycle In the end there is no other company that is looking to make carbon negative plastics Elephant in the Room Plastics are an environmental problem There are microplastics that are increasing in concentration in the ocean and in ocean life specifically and they have become a disease on the planet Why am I okay with this personally for Origin Well simply it is a step in the right direction There are a large number of applications which require non biodegradability but ultimately this begins to get market penetration with zero modification for carbon reduction It s a trade off for sure but it s only the start Things start to look much better with net zero fuel pellets and water filters carbon black and agricultural applications which aside from the fuel are all carbon negative In the end this is an insanely huge step towards reducing our carbon footprint and right now that takes priority for me Risks They currently have no revenue and are building their first plant Origin 1 This plant is still just a testing plant and they are quite far away from revenue positive The plant was also delayed a year likely due to COVID but they now have the equipment on site Overall There is a huge push for countries and companies to reduce their carbon footprint and this company is set to not only make a very profitable and sustainable product but to also capture a shitton of carbon doing it In the long run this company is likely going to explode in value as they have the talent experience and in demand product There are real risks here but the upside is enormous as this is a true potential unicorn I m looking at a potential return of 10 30x Disclosure Long Origin in LEAPS and Shares

short position on the COMEX even bigger than the one on gold It is a semi monetary metal so the banks fear it just like gold and silver It was briefly used as money in Russia in the 1820s and 30s In the east it is also considered a precious metal rather than an industrial one Investment demand for physical platinum however matches just one tenth the value of silver investing each year and less than 1 of investors demand to buy gold The majority about 80 percent of platinum is mined in only one country South Africa For those who are not aware there is a chaotic situation in South Africa right now which is only continuing to get worse see ZeroHedge for live updates and some believe that South Africa may soon become a failed state Rick Rule has been consistently saying for years that any chaos in South Africa would quickly lead to soaring platinum prices Here is a recent interview where he says it The demand side for the platinum group elements is very much intact The supply side is what s curious Most of the PGEs in the world come from three countries South Africa not the model of stability Zimbabwe almost not a country And Russia which of the three is a paragon of stability But if you were to experience social and political disruption in any of those markets you would see markedly tightened PGE supplies and I would argue higher prices If you shut down production in any of the markets I described I expect you d see a price explosion I m not saying that South Africa Russia or Zimbabwe is going to blow up I m just saying that the production of this element is constrained to countries that are well let s just say it isn t Western Australia https youtu be xeIorlppdaI t 755 https youtu be xeIorlppdaI t 755 Here are some further thoughts from Rick Rule on the subject of platinum over the years as well as Doug Casey Rick Rule interview from March 2020 Platinum is viewed in the U S as an industrial material rather than a precious metal Were you a retail physical dealer in Japan or Korea or China you would be feeling substantial demand for platinum investment products but culturally that isn t the way that Americans respond Americans look at platinum as a component in catalytic conversion Platinum is on my shopping list I have a reasonable proxy in physical platinum in the Sprott Physical Platinum and Palladium Trust I should note parenthetically that at my age I m 67 it s simply easier for me to buy physical precious metals on the New York Stock Exchange through the Sprott products I don t discourage physical ownership in fact I encourage physical ownership But for me it s just easier to buy the stuff and sell the stuff online in an account and I like the tax advantages of the Sprott product Were I younger and more inclined to take physical delivery and store it in a safe deposit box I would likely be a platinum buyer now The reason for that is that the utility of platinum is so extraordinary The amount of platinum that it takes to deliver the air quality that we enjoy today relative to the cost of the vehicle that that platinum enables the sale of is incredible At today s platinum prices it takes about a 100 or 125 worth of platinum in catalytic converter to sell a 40 000 car Were the price of platinum to double it wouldn t impact the price of the vehicle whatsoever Also the disparity in price between platinum and palladium means that people are investing like crazy in fabrication technology that will allow us over time and by time I mean two to five years to begin to substitute platinum for palladium in many fabrication applications but particularly in gasoline powered internal combustion engines So I think that the price disparity between platinum and palladium will begin to close Palladium price 2700 Platinum price 1100 Rick Rule interview from January 2019 I think that supply chain disruptions in South Africa are in fact a probability rather than a possibility The industry has not made sufficient sustaining capital investments for 10 or 12 years The industry has been required politically sometimes with state assistance to keep uneconomic shafts open And you have a circumstance now where the lack of sustaining capital means that literally billions of dollars must be put in place to rehabilitate these old shafts so that they can continue to produce At the same time workers wages must increase These two circumstances are confronting an industry that loses more than a billion dollars a year The money has to come from somewhere and there is nowhere for it to come from The second circumstance that this discussion needs to include is the fact that although South Africa has abundant resources including human resources the government mismanagement has been so incredible For example while South Africa is an exporter of coal and uranium the domestic power supplier in South Africa Eskom can t pay its bills or meet demand for electricity The mining industry in South Africa is extremely power intensive But Eskom is run more politically So ironically the part of South Africa that pays its power bills which is the mining industry experiences rolling brownouts Eskom needs to invest more money money that it doesn t have in power generation and distribution This again augurs very dramatically for supply disruptions For example if there were an extended brownout it could cause the pumps for water evacuations in the deep shafts to go down for very short periods of time I m talking about a week or so That would cause material destruction to the ventilation and electrification of these deep shafts My suspicion is over two or three years that s a probability as opposed to a possibility too Doug Casey interview from 2019 On the supply side of platinum the three countries in the world that matter are South Africa Zimbabwe and Russia I believe that Russia is in better shape than most people allege it to be The primary platinum producer there I believe is in robust shape But the truth is that both Zimbabwe and South Africa in the two to five year timeframe are likely to disappoint That s especially true in South Africa where the cost pressures are unbelievable Because of the lack of property rights in South Africa the mining industry has been unwilling to substitute capital for labor In other words it has been unwilling to invest in sustaining capital or expansion capital in the platinum mines in South Africa The consequence of that is that probably 60 maybe more of platinum production in South Africa is unprofitable The industry needs to invest more but can t because it s losing money on every gram that is produced currently And the situation is only going to get worse Mining platinum is a labor intensive business You have partially politically inspired and partially reality inspired labor actions from the unions agitating for higher payment to workers The workers absolutely need to be paid more But the companies can t pay them more because there is no money There s no sustaining capital to continue employment and they re losing money on the unit of production business right now at current wage rates So it s going to be impossible for the companies to pay workers more This is literally the case where you re stuck between a rock and a hard place I think we are going to see some sort of reckoning within the next two years It s a very ugly situation in the near term with no way out If anybody is interested in buying premium free platinum there s an allocated ETF called SPPP which seems to be a platinum Sprott equivalent of PHYS gold and PSLV silver However it seems to be both platinum and palladium not simply platinum If you re signed up to GoldMoney or BullionVault you can buy allocated premium free platinum purely on its own And of course platinum bullion with premiums is available in many places

,Alright I m gonna keep this DD donkey dick short and sweet I m traditionally bullish but with the rotation out of meme stocks and back into SPY there s some fuckery afoot and this is on a global scale Unless your entire portfolio is FB AMZN NFLX GOOGL AAPL then you ve felt the pain of watching your portfolio get hammered 3 to 10 daily I m here to provide a slight glimmer of hope that is actually backed up by some fucking fact take it or leave I won t kick you out of bed for eatin crackers I don t date chicks from China because that s a big red flag get it but I am gonna fuck China and here s why Inflation say what you want but it s looming And in theory papa Powell can just keep printing all day long and as long as the doesn t physically leave the fed then we re okay HOWEVER this leads me to 2 Student Loans September 15th is right around the corner and our commander in queef has a decision to make either extend the current relief where no one is paying anything forgive some or all student debt or say fuck it time to start paying again It s a LOSE LOSE LOSE situation for the market Extend the relief and the discussion around inflation becomes an even more real thing Forgive some or all all that money that s been printed just flew out the fucking fed door faster than the dude I caught banging my wife Start paying again all the savings people have in the market gets liquidated to start paying the student loans and rugpull Also this announcement isn t going to come on September 14th where ByeDon is going to surprise everyone and say no student loans or start paying bucko this announcement should come at the next fed meeting at the end of July or in August which will obviously immediately get priced in and impact the market How does this tie to China Good question Because the U S amp Europe have pursued extraordinary monetary policy in the last 2 years low interest rates other to support economic growth this has caused a rise in commodity prices creating an imported inflation issue for China I ll go even farther CHINA is the largest consumer in the world of Copper and Copper prices have hit a 20 year high with no signs of slowing down We haven t seen these prices in 10 years I anticipate copper prices to keep rising Just look at the chart So as the price rises so do production costs amp x200B https preview redd it v8hr7paqjlb71 png width 942 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0dd699fd6eec4f27ca8db3b8dfc421ffc820ac0a Still not enough Alright while the greenback is getting it s dick kicked in by Yao Ming and the world shifts away from U S denominated assets let s take a look at China s housing market China is trying to contain this smoking hot property market without capping the prices of the houses they re just requiring people who want to buy houses to put down more of a down payment Essentially just limiting the financing opportunities This in turn will just drive the principal price of the house up So now we ve got propped up housing prices people who want the house need to put more down to buy said house where are they gonna get their savings The same place I m gonna go to access my savings when I have to eventually pay off my student loans the market Okay I m interested but what stock do I play FXI why Because it s the ETF that tracks the top 50 largest Chinese stocks in a single fund It s used to express a single country view similar to our good ol friend SPY but more representative of a country TL DR very real inflation threat triggered by student debt decision and rising commodity prices will impact the global markets more so China due to them holding trillions of U S denominated foreign exchange assets and being the worlds largest consumer of copper rising copper prices create rising production costs couple that with red hot housing market and more required for a down payment to buy housing props up the housing price creates a perfect storm in the Chinese market position amp further proof I am long 100x FXI September 40 puts And at the beginning of this week someone laid down a 500k spread on August 40 42p 22 500x each I went out another month just to buy some more time
