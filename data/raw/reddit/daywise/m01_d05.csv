model not just a bunch of emojis It is so long because of the niche field it is operating in and how a lot of key points are not understood well by the WSB community This company really is a diamond in the rough and a great way to play future trends with less risk as you re not picking winners Its the picks and shovels play of electrification and renewable energies I ll explain the realistic case for how this company is soon going to be running the best tendie mine for decades to come amp x200B This is my second DD post on now MP formerly FVAC and i m back to discuss the developments of the company since my pre merger post and add some further analysis about the valuation of the company and its future There has been too much really shitty DD from both bulls and bears on this company where very few people on here have a real understanding of this company their business model and the future First read my original DD post in order to have a decent understanding of the backstory cause I m not about to type out all that shit again or explain what I ve already written Read that first then come back https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments jgvarn fvac dd evchina tension play https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments jgvarn fvac dd evchina tension play That post discusses mainly international tensions and the role REE s but this one i ll speak more on the business case of this company and how even without geopolitical tensions it is a true tendie mine Second no I m not a bag holder Ive been in since it was a pre merged SPAC my average on my shares is about 14 and my LEAP is far far ITM and no I m not selling any of them Also as i referenced in the post I work in a very similar field and interned in college at a mineral mine in the refining aspect as a chemical engineer so while I m not an expert at this I have more insight than the average retard and I am trying to give out tendies before the boomers take them from us I will try my best to explain the business model of a mining company and why this company is the most unique and interesting way to get tech company level growth with the associated free cash flow while not having to be anywhere near as innovative Ill discuss a lot of the bear arguments for this company as well and try to de bunk them as most don t really hold water once you look into them the slightest bit Background of NdPr While the company produces as basket of Rare Earth the plant is aiming to focus on NdPr and other permanent magnet materials in order to play the trend of EV s and electrification These magnets are extremely important for so many technologies due to how Electric motors work To put it simply at current technology the only way to convert electricity to motion or the only way to convert motion to electricity relies on permanent magnets Im not gonna try to explain more than that because I too am retarded but if you don t believe me or want to learn how watch this video https www youtube com watch v CWulQ1ZSE3c yeah i know you didn t watch that video but just imagine you did and now believe me However because it works both ways BOTH electric motors AND electric generators rely on this technology This is key for understanding how NdPr is the best way to play both the trends of electrification AND renewables First electrification is most embodied by the rise in EV s in the future and while that is predicted to be the fastest growing segment of NdPr demand it is foolish to not to account for other evolving technologies reliant on electric motors as well Robotics will be a huge growth market and electrification of other industries will rely on NdPr permanent magnets The other massive growth opportunity for permanent magnets is through renewable energies Wind energy and possible future motion based energy harvesting tech like tidal energy work through harvesting mechanical motion and turning a generator to create electricity Wind power doesn t work without electric generators which don t work without magnets In addition wind tech is advancing down a path to require even more magnets due to improvements is Permanent Magnet Direct Drive PMDD technology from the current Gearbox doubly fed induction Generator DFIG Essentially what that means is the new technology will take out the gearbox currently used in wind mills and replacing them with more efficient direct driving technology allowing more mechanical motion into electricity These new generators require stronger magnets thus more magnetic material Read more about that here https www goldwindamericas com pmdd TLDR They mine mainly permanent magnet materials that at current scientific understanding CANNOT be replaced due to their unique electromagnetic properties TLDR on the TLDR Special Rocks no replacing Need special rocks MP s expansion plans A lot of bears like to bring up the fact that MP is still reliant on China to do their refining and they re correct for now Currently they mine on site and refine to REE concentrates which they then send to china to refine into Rare Earth Oxides REO s which then get send to become metal alloys and then finally to magnets Currently is the only location in the world to refine past concentrate material so MP is forced to send their material there but that is why the went public The intent of them going public was to raise funds in order build an on site REO facitility which is scheduled for completion in 2022 and is already started They already have enough cash on hand to furnish this upgrade as they had over 500M on hand at the end of Q3 and they also are a cash flow positive company already before even moving downstream There are EV infrastructure plays with much worse valuations and years away from breaking even on cash flow yes I m talking to you QS bagholders that tech is unproven and there are so many battery competitors in a field where there WILL be a winner Why would they want to move downstream when they re already profitable Because the further downstream they go the higher margins they earn and the more tendies they can mine for us Refining raw materials to useful materials is a value adding process and thus creates more value for the company that does it Once they complete this expansion they plan on going to stage 3 of their business model the ability to build magnets and other final products of REE s in America They have not decided disclosed their plans for this whether it is through construction of an onsite facility an acquisition or a joint venture but it is in the plans This is expected to come online around 2025 and when the insane cash flow can begin for the company I don t have any reason to doubt the validity of their intention as its just a continuation of the business model they are currently implementing and the majority of the corporate rhetoric is related to mine to magnet and restoring the REE supply chain to America What does this mean for the company as they move further and further downstream they will increase their margins from this action alone but it gets even better This can be shown in their in house calculations of their 2023 adj EBITDA target of 252M amp x200B Q3 Investors Presentation https s25 q4cdn com 570172628 files doc financials 2020 q3 MP 3Q20 Earnings Deck FINAL 11 23 2020 pdf https preview redd it ro8md6f9wd961 png width 1258 amp

expansion is a way to increase margins and therefore free cash flow for the company TLDR of TLDR Special rock get more special Get more tendies for special rock Business model of mining companies and why MP has insane growth potential This is the most important part of this long ass post if you read one section then read this A big disconnect on a lot of DD in this sub and analysis elsewhere is the economics of how a mining company works A mine is by definition a COMMODITY PLAY which I know is not as exciting as a tech company BUT it will experience tech sector growth for a period of time and then experience a period of time in which develop into a cash cow business reaping huge dividends for shareholders What i mean by a commodity play is through the economics of how a mine operates Given a mine at a fixed production volume the costs on a year in year out basis are relatively similar What i mean by this is the cost MP to mine and refine into concentrate will be the same no matter the price of their product However the revenue they receive is dependent on the market price of their product which is what varies the most An easy way to describe this is through taking a look at their Q3 2020 financial results presentation amp x200B Q3 Investors Presentation https s25 q4cdn com 570172628 files doc financials 2020 q3 MP 3Q20 Earnings Deck FINAL 11 23 2020 pdf https preview

will realistically stay the same as that value is from the cost of labor energy for machinery administrative costs etc While these numbers will vary from quarter to quarter these are costs not predicted to experience rapid growth and this is what is important to realize It costs roughly the same amount of money to pay someone to blast ore dig it into dump trucks pay operators to refine into ore etc Don t trust me look into how steel companies operate like this sub s favorite MT The revenue they receive is dependent on the price of REE s which is NOT PREDICTED TO BE FLAT Here is the historic graph of Neodymium from 2011 current amp x200B Processing img yjvqqeb5yd961 If you are an investor in MP which you should be this is an important website to pay attention to because understanding the market dynamics of their product is important to understanding the valuation of this company Allow me to disect that graph a little bit 1st Peak From the aftermath of the supply shock from 2010 2011 from the Japanese Navy and Chinese fisherman story i discusses in my previous FVAC post i linked above China lowered exports by 40 and the price shot up drastically as industries across the world tried to gobble up as much NdPr as fast as possible in order to ensure their production lines That was then followed by china flooding the market and selling back that backlog that caused prices to fall off a cliff and ended up taking molyorp out of business I ll discuss the Molycorp saga later more in depth and the differences of them and MP 2nd Peak This peak late 2017 is from the Trade war trump caused with china and is another good explanation of the correlation between REE s and geopolitics i discussed in my last DD post The middle 2019 peak is again the trade war heating up again 3rd peak where we are now This is from the increased tailwind of EV adoption more from asia and Europe than the US and because china has been threatening to use REE s as a political tool again which again i referenced more in my last DD post However going forward if you want to predict the amount of revenue MP will earn its important to understand the market dynamic and I d like to discuss why the price is geopolitics aside predicted to steadily increase at a very fast rate MP like any other commodity play relies on the supply demand dynamic of the sector and REE demand growth is on track to far outstrip the supply growth This will result increased prices per ton but MP s costs stay the same This is the beauty of the company as the price goes up their margins go up too MP and market analysts predicted over a 100 growth in NdPr magnets in the next 10 years amp x200B Processing img 1q97aczw1e961 Don t believe that metric check this more in depth one source https www arultd com products supply and demand html https preview redd it i9ekm3vh2e961 jpg width 6279 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s add6e8adf823297fa701d25d31319422b7ab5696 This graph shows most important metric as it shows that the world at current rate is not scaling up to meet demand THIS GRAPH INCLUDES CURRENT PLANNED EXPANSIONS INCLUDING INCREASED RECYCLING What does this mean There is a huge mismatch in projected demand and supply and if you don t know what that will mean then ask your wife s boyfriend about supply demand graphs from their economics class The result will be massively increased prices of permanent magnet materials because the world will not be able to mine and refine enough to satisfy demand so they will be able to increase their prices BUT AS I SAID EARLIER MP S COSTS PER TON WILL REMAIN THE SAME So what is the gist of this coupled with MP moving toward downstream expansion MP s margins will increase incredibly from a double whammy of moving downstream AND supply demand imbalance Now what does that mean for you that means MP has a very realistic and conservative path toward becoming a company with RIDICULOUS free cash flow What does that mean for MP That means that the company will be raking in cash and will be extremely flexible due to their balance sheet They will be able to expand operations or acquire competitors in order to increase their market share and production volumes OR they will be able to transition into a boomer dividend company that will pay you tendies each year They could do either of those very easily because the company HAS NO DEBT In fact MP ended Q3 2020 with 507M CASH on hand to finance their future expansions Okay i know dividends are boring but the market will begin to price in that future dividend potential and give your calls many tendies along the path to pricing in their dividend power TLDR Supply demand imbalance with geopolitical tensions as a wild card will result in insane free cash flow in the future for this company TLDR of the TLDR People want more special rock more than can make special rock People give you more tendies for special rocks Why Supply won t be able to scale up as fast A very important assumption in my analysis is the inability for supply to scale up as fast as demand and I d like to explain this more in depth as it is the crux of this DD This is where my experience in mineral refining is valuable as I can weigh in on this aspect Over time there will be more suppliers that come into the business and we are seeing that already however this is where the timetables of that come into play Simply put supply can t go up because companies will be slowed greatly due to the time it will take to get up and running and the incredible amount of upfront capital needed before even starting up the mine If a company is interested in getting into the field there isn t a fast path in because the companies can t just decide to go into the business and then go to the REE refining machinery store and buy the equipment and have them get set up All the machinery in chemical manufacturing plants REE refining counts as chemical engineering so hear me out has a long path in order to reach the optimum design Ill outline the gist of this here 1 Lab Scale Testing This is laboratory scale testing in which very small batches are prepared testing different procedures and methods in order to find the optimum refining process for the goals of the operation This is when the deciding of the catalysts solvents additive chemicals etc is done in order to decide what to do to the ore to get the best product 2 Pilot Plant Design and Testing This step in the design process is designing and building a small scale model of machinery to run the process decided upon in lab scale testing in order to determine different operating conditions determine control points etc This is when different tests and procedures are determined and also a proof of concept to begin economic calculations for designing the next step 3 Full scale design and building This is when the full size real deal machinery is designed and constructed But again there is not REE refining manufacturing store to get much of this machinery Refining plants are custom designed minus certain machinery like pumps and basic ass shit like that and custom built These are custom designed custom fabricated large scale machinery designed in every aspect from material area volume and depth in order to lower manufacturing costs while also allowing for 24 7 continuous operation The 24 7 operation aspect is important because it is why the machinery is designed so meticulously The most economic operations are ones that require little down time and little maintenance and a lot of work is put in to optimize this aspect That means it takes even more time to produce 4 Permitting and Certification Now at this point the company is years into the development of REE refining but they still can t start operating despite the entire operation up and running In the US now the lovely and very fast government gets to come in Mining and refining operations don t operate under OSHA rules and procedures they get to operate under OSHA s much meaner expensive and safety prone brother the Mining Safety and Health Administration MSHA Government inspectors have to come in and permit and certify EVERY PIECE OF MACHINERY inspect every single moving part and permit them and do a shit ton of other stuff for the government to allow you to begin operations Now due to the stimulus bill s provisions toward stimulating REE capabilities in the United states I assume that MSHA will be or already has been told to prioritize REE companies and they will probably be fast tracked but even fast tracking them will take a lot of time In addition EPA has to come in and sign off on the environmental plans of the company and probably even more government entities will have to come in to sign off on stuff that was past my exposure when I interned in the field Now you ve seen how long it would take to get up and running but another constraint worth mentioning is who does these Larger Chemical or mining companies Dow DuPont Chemours BASF etc looking to enter the field probably have their own design teams that would be able to do it in house Smaller non conglomerate entities would have to hire a chemical engineering design consulting firm to come in and do the designing write the procedures and train the production engineers and operators That means there is some decent intellectual constraints as to how many people have the know how to design at the rate needed to scale up amp x200B Here is what is important any entity trying to enter the sector will have enormous upfront costs in buying the land designing the plant buying the machinery like excavators dump trucks pipelines pay employees well before starting due to training on the machinery Im not sure the exact amounts of money needed but it would easily be in the 100s of millions at least Then once all that upfront capital is sourced plant designed people trained etc the operation would take YEARS to get out of all that debt and achieve meaningful positive cash flow It is only a matter of time for MP to have significant domestic competition but by the time these operations could begin operating MP will be so far ahead in production and have a significantly stronger balance sheet than these companies could have MP will remain years ahead of any other domestic competitors even though competition will come TLDR At current outlook supply growth won t match demand growth and even if more competitors pop up to compete it ll take years to start operating and even more years to match MP s ability TLDR on the TLDR Not enough people finding special rock More people want special rock than can get special rock They pay more for special rock MP s competitors both domestic and international A large argument that bears like to make is that competition is coming in the US and they are 100 correct but it won t matter because AGAIN this is a commodity play not a tech company They make magnets their revenue will depend on the price of their product Buyers from this are not looking at MP like you would look at TSLA vs NIO or apple vs android where you could argue one is better than the other or consumers will adopt one over the other There isn t brand recognition increased utility or consumer favorites in magnets they re fucking magnets Think about it like another commodity lumber If you go to HD to buy some wood you aren t staring at two different planks of the same type of tree and picking one because of which timber company felled it or which milling company milled it You just buy lumber and go home because it is wood A timber company isn t outright threatened by another timber company popping up as long as the demand supply dynamic in the market stays the same the first timber company is unaffected That is why it won t matter WHEN more domestic and international competitors pop up As long as demand outstrips supply then commodity companies will make more and more money Now I am not trying to bullshit people so I ll discuss the international and domestic competition but Ill explain more in depth why i don t give a shit about them Domestic The ticker that cannot be named due to it being banned Hint it is 4 letters long and the only letter in the ticker is U Put those hints together and its pretty easy to find it This is the one I ve sparred the most with people about in DD posts and I would like to explain how it is a complement play not a competitor Here is a link discussing this company s plans https www streetinsider com Corporate News Energy Fuels 28UUUU 29 Set to Enter Commercial Rare Earth Business in Q1 17713617 html If you take a look at that company it is a Uranium producer that is going to re purpose machinery onsite from uranium production to REE production and they have successfully done pilot plant level processing However if you analyze their production numbers you ll see that the scale they plan on producing is not quite at the level MP will They plan on refining 15 000 tons of ore per year with an estimated 55 REE concentration which leaves an estimated 8 250 tons of REE per year of which 22 is NdP all their numbers not mine which leaves annual production of 1 815 tons yr These numbers are pretty good and I do own a stake in this company because I like the potential but its scale is not quite the scale of MP MP is predicting a run rate of 6 075 tons yr of NdPr so yes the banned ticker is a decent competitor but its only predicting to be 1 3 the size of MP annual production volume A downside of the banned ticker is that they still are focusing on Uranium production so its not a pure REE play but Uranium has a pretty decent bull case for the future so i don t want to slander that ticker too much However again these are commodity plays MP having competition even domestic doest really affect their business plans or bull case Additionally the banned ticker is sourcing its ore rom Chemours location in GA but getting milled in Utah so this is a long term inefficiency to consider as well that MP won t have to worry about once their stage 2 REO mill is complete the banned tickers financial health is pretty decent but its market cap is 516M at close 1 4 which is just slightly above amount of cash on hand MP had at the end of Q3 2020 502M That company is more of an investment opportunity than a competitor if its even worth investing in Other emerging domestic competitors link to article explaining them all https www reuters com article us usa rareearths projects factbox factbox rare earths projects under development in u s idUSKCN2241L6 Im not going to go deep into each one but you can see that many are slowed down to the process I explained above about how expensive and time consuming it is to reach operational status These companies will be coming online but won t be profitable for a while and won t be able to provide the same returns to investors for even longer International competitors Lynas Corp This is an Australian mining company that has also received pentagon funds to improve the non China production capacity They trade over the counter and are a real deal competitor and also worth investing in but their growth potential isn t as clear or easy as in the US They have pentagon funding more so out of desperation by the pentagon to get more production in the western world than loving to invest in an Australian company In the future I would imagine a lot of this government support will go toward US based companies International competitors all the china ones yes they produce the largest amount of material in the world and do it the cheapest but this is the result of none to very little environmental protection Once the supply chain can go mine to magnet many companies will look to diminish their exposure to chinese companies to ensure their supply chains are not at the whims of the Chinese government In addition MP is the cleanest REE mine in the world and a lot of environmentally conscious companies will want to support clean mined REE s and once domestic production is high enough there could be regulations passed to further incentivize purchasing domestically produced REE s All these companies were included in the forecast of supply in 2030 Even with these companies coming online MP is still positioned for incredible returns TLDR Yes competition is coming but there is already competition Its also a commodity play so its not facing replacement or redundancy like many other growth markets TLDR on the TLDR Others find special rock Your special rock still worth many tendies You still get many tendies Why this is NOT molycorp 2 0 The most common point of argument against this company is that people bring up the fact that the mine MP operates used to be run by Molycorp which went bankrupt However if you read into that transaction it really isn t that scary Molycorp did go under but this was in a period of price instability and they were not running as good of an operation Molycorp operated during the 2010 2011 peak of REE s when china restricted supply Molycorp stock went up a ton in addition to their revenue and thus they decided to invest in milling capabilities to create REO s I know this is MP s plan but don t get scared yet Because of US EPA restrictions it was wildly expensive and at bankruptcy they had 1 7B in investments into capital projects to improve their refining capability but the subsequent REE price collapse when china turned the taps back on to the world supply caused them to not afford operation The site then changed hands back and forth until it was bought by MP s current management for 40M https en wikipedia org wiki Molycorp They then invested in it after literally buying for less than pennies on the dollar and got it up and running more efficiently than before Last quarter Q3 2020 they ran 3 2x the REE concentrate production volume than Molycorp ever did amp x200B Q3 Investors Presentation https

operations prioritized Cerium production for FCC catalysts MP has transitioned the goal product to be NdPr as it has much better growth potential to give it long term possibility In addition the market climate Molycorp operated under was not as forgiving as now Back then there wasn t the tailwind of increasing EV adoption or the rise of other high tech growth sector reliant on REE s Molycorp was too early and inefficient to win in the market and didn t have anywhere close to the amount of governmental support for the industry There is bipartisan support on all levels i mentioned this a bit in my last DD post but since then and this is big and shows the scale of gov support THE LAST STIMULUS BILL HAD 800M IN SUPPORT OF INCREASING DOMESTIC REE PRODUCTION https www spglobal com marketintelligence en news insights latest news headlines miners laud 800m rare earth fund in omnibus bill 61939620 Molycorp didn t have anywhere close to this level of government support And again the pentagon invested 9M into MP to help fund their REO mill because the pentagon views the ability to refine REO s as a matter of national security Discussing Concerns about Biden Presidency People who say this shit clearly have no idea what they are talking about Biden or his puppet masters but who cares money is all green has said he supports REE mining multiple times source https www reuters com article usa election mining exclusive biden campaign tells miners it supports domestic production of ev metals idUSKBN27808B His team knows their big environmental initiatives rely on REE production and that domestic production is important to keep American industry at the whims of China Yeah Trump was more hawkish with china but lets not act like a democratic presidency is going to let china walk all over the US or that Biden and other democrats will stop their push for EV s and clean energy REE s are a cornerstone piece to so many of Biden s plans there is no way he turns his back on this company Discussion of Shenghe Resources and China and their relationships with MP The one real concern that people have is their partnership with Shenghe Resources where Shenghe has agreed to buy all MP concentrate through 2021 and shenghe is a stakeholder in MP Many view this as a negative but i think it should be seen as a good way to ensure survival in the gap between now and the final magnet production A big issue would be if China chose to stop importing the MP concentrate which would give MP no customers Since this would adversely affect Shenge it makes it less likely and also the fact that MP produces 15 of the world s REE concentrate it would hurt the supply in china which is huge In fact China removed their 25 tariff on importing REE material read this source https www argusmedia com en news 2104418 china to remove import tariff on us rare earth ores as it also shows how china is buying up all the concentrate they can Japan has the capability to go from REO to NdPr magnet as well so if china ends up fucking MP starting in 2022 when their REO site is in operation then they will be able to sell their REO to Japanese companies to bridge the gap before they have their own magnet making capability amp x200B Q3 Investors Presentation https s25 q4cdn com 570172628 files doc financials 2020 q3 MP 3Q20 Earnings Deck FINAL 11 23 2020 pdf https preview

hurt china s wallet and ability to produce goods while only increasing the US government support for going mine to magnet domestically China realistically views their dominance as ending at some point now but they know they will still be able to control the market because of their scale regardless of whether they buy MP concentrates or not Also if Shenghe doesn t buy their concentrates then they forfeit their stake in MP they wouldn t be allowed to sell them on the market the shares would just disappear so it would effectively be a massive stock buyback and as long as the REO mill is complete then they just sell to Japanese magnet makers Mine Life discussion Their S 1 states that at current proven reserves they have about 47 years of mine life left That can be grown from drilling and exploration of more mineable material which they stated they plan on doing in addition if they for some reason don t find more mineable ore on their land and don t buy more land with ore then they could simply refine ore from other mines as the real cost barrier isn t the digging out of the ground it is the milling amp x200B TLDR MP will to the moon over the next few years Postions shares for

s,WARNING 8TH GRADE READING LEVEL REQUIRED FOR MATERIAL Intro Disclaimer yeah its long as fuck but read for tendies If its too long suck a bear dick and move on This is real analysis of the business model not just a bunch of emojis It is so long because of the niche field it is operating in and how a lot of key points are not understood well by the WSB community This company really is a diamond in the rough and a great way to play future trends with less risk as you re not picking winners Its the picks and shovels play of electrification and renewable energies I ll explain the realistic case for how this company is soon going to be running the best tendie mine for decades to come This is my second DD post on now MP formerly FVAC and i m back to discuss the developments of the company since my pre merger post and add some further analysis about the valuation of the company and its future There has been too much really shitty DD from both bulls and bears on this company where very few people on here have a real understanding of this company their business model and the future First read my original DD post in order to have a decent understanding of the backstory cause I m not about to type out all that shit again or explain what I ve already written Read that first then come back https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments jgvarn fvac dd evchina tension play https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments jgvarn fvac dd evchina tension play That post discusses mainly international tensions and the role REE s but this one i ll speak more on the business case of this company and how even without geopolitical tensions it is a true tendie mine Second no I m not a bag holder Ive been in since it was a pre merged SPAC my average on my shares is about 14 and my LEAP is far far ITM and no I m not selling any of them Also as i referenced in the post I work in a very similar field and interned in college at a mineral mine in the refining aspect as a chemical engineer so while I m not an expert at this I have more insight than the average retard and I am trying to give out tendies before the boomers take them from us I will try my best to explain the business model of a mining company and why this company is the most unique and interesting way to get tech company level growth with the associated free cash flow while not having to be anywhere near as innovative Ill discuss a lot of the bear arguments for this company as well and try to de bunk them as most don t really hold water once you look into them the slightest bit Background of NdPr While the company produces as basket of Rare Earth the plant is aiming to focus on NdPr and other permanent magnet materials in order to play the trend of EV s and electrification These magnets are extremely important for so many technologies due to how Electric motors work To put it simply at current technology the only way to convert electricity to motion or the only way to convert motion to electricity relies on permanent magnets Im not gonna try to explain more than that because I too am retarded but if you don t believe me or want to learn how watch this video https www youtube com watch v CWulQ1ZSE3c yeah i know you didn t watch that video but just imagine you did and now believe me However because it works both ways BOTH electric motors AND electric generators rely on this technology This is key for understanding how NdPr is the best way to play both the trends of electrification AND renewables First electrification is most embodied by the rise in EV s in the future and while that is predicted to be the fastest growing segment of NdPr demand it is foolish to not to account for other evolving technologies reliant on electric motors as well Robotics will be a huge growth market and electrification of other industries will rely on NdPr permanent magnets The other massive growth opportunity for permanent magnets is through renewable energies Wind energy and possible future motion based energy harvesting tech like tidal energy work through harvesting mechanical motion and turning a generator to create electricity Wind power doesn t work without electric generators which don t work without magnets In addition wind tech is advancing down a path to require even more magnets due to improvements is Permanent Magnet Direct Drive PMDD technology from the current Gearbox doubly fed induction Generator DFIG Essentially what that means is the new technology will take out the gearbox currently used in wind mills and replacing them with more efficient direct driving technology allowing more mechanical motion into electricity These new generators require stronger magnets thus more magnetic material Read more about that here https www goldwindamericas com pmdd TLDR They mine mainly permanent magnet materials that at current scientific understanding CANNOT be replaced due to their unique electromagnetic properties TLDR on the TLDR Special Rocks no replacing Need special rocks MP s expansion plans A lot of bears like to bring up the fact that MP is still reliant on China to do their refining and they re correct for now Currently they mine on site and refine to REE concentrates which they then send to china to refine into Rare Earth Oxides REO s which then get send to become metal alloys and then finally to magnets Currently is the only location in the world to refine past concentrate material so MP is forced to send their material there but that is why the went public The intent of them going public was to raise funds in order build an on site REO facitility which is scheduled for completion in 2022 and is already started They already have enough cash on hand to furnish this upgrade as they had over 500M on hand at the end of Q3 and they also are a cash flow positive company already before even moving downstream There are EV infrastructure plays with much worse valuations and years away from breaking even on cash flow yes I m talking to you QS bagholders that tech is unproven and there are so many battery competitors in a field where there WILL be a winner Why would they want to move downstream when they re already profitable Because the further downstream they go the higher margins they earn and the more tendies they can mine for us Refining raw materials to useful materials is a value adding process and thus creates more value for the company that does it Once they complete this expansion they plan on going to stage 3 of their business model the ability to build magnets and other final products of REE s in America They have not decided disclosed their plans for this whether it is through construction of an onsite facility an acquisition or a joint venture but it is in the plans This is expected to come online around 2025 and when the insane cash flow can begin for the company I don t have any reason to doubt the validity of their intention as its just a continuation of the business model they are currently implementing and the majority of the corporate rhetoric is related to mine to magnet and restoring the REE supply chain to America What does this mean for the company as they move further and further downstream they will increase their margins from this action alone but it gets even better This can be shown in their in house calculations of their 2023 adj EBITDA target of 252M amp x200B Processing img 7eiobfp84f961 it is important to note that those numbers are from the current step they are taking right now in building the REO refining facility Adding further downstream capabilities will only cause that EBITDA value to grow as margins improve but next I ll discuss where their margins will improve from EVEN MORE TLDR downstream expansion is a way to increase margins and therefore free cash flow for the company TLDR of TLDR Special rock get more special Get more tendies for special rock Business model of mining companies and why MP has insane growth potential This is the most important part of this long ass post if you read one section then read this A big disconnect on a lot of DD in this sub and analysis elsewhere is the economics of how a mining company works A mine is by definition a COMMODITY PLAY which I know is not as exciting as a tech company BUT it will experience tech sector growth for a period of time and then experience a period of time in which develop into a cash cow business reaping huge dividends for shareholders What i mean by a commodity play is through the economics of how a mine operates Given a mine at a fixed production volume the costs on a year in year out basis are relatively similar What i mean by this is the cost MP to mine and refine into concentrate will be the same no matter the price of their product However the revenue they receive is dependent on the market price of their product which is what varies the most An easy way to describe this is through taking a look at their Q3 2020 financial results presentation amp x200B Processing img ijzcpgmc4f961 That value of Production cost at the current stage of just creating REE concentrates will realistically stay the same as that value is from the cost of labor energy for machinery administrative costs etc While these numbers will vary from quarter to quarter these are costs not predicted to experience rapid growth and this is what is important to realize It costs roughly the same amount of money to pay someone to blast ore dig it into dump trucks pay operators to refine into ore etc Don t trust me look into how steel companies operate like this sub s favorite MT The revenue they receive is dependent on the price of REE s which is NOT PREDICTED TO BE FLAT Here is the historic graph of Neodymium from 2011 current amp x200B Processing img q1ytv5ch4f961 If you are an investor in MP which you should be this is an important website to pay attention to because understanding the market dynamics of their product is important to understanding the valuation of this company Allow me to disect that graph a little bit 1st Peak From the aftermath of the supply shock from 2010 2011 from the Japanese Navy and Chinese fisherman story i discusses in my previous FVAC post i linked above China lowered exports by 40 and the price shot up drastically as industries across the world tried to gobble up as much NdPr as fast as possible in order to ensure their production lines That was then followed by china flooding the market and selling back that backlog that caused prices to fall off a cliff and ended up taking molyorp out of business I ll discuss the Molycorp saga later more in depth and the differences of them and MP 2nd Peak This peak late 2017 is from the Trade war trump caused with china and is another good explanation of the correlation between REE s and geopolitics i discussed in my last DD post The middle 2019 peak is again the trade war heating up again 3rd peak where we are now This is from the increased tailwind of EV adoption more from asia and Europe than the US and because china has been threatening to use REE s as a political tool again which again i referenced more in my last DD post However going forward if you want to predict the amount of revenue MP will earn its important to understand the market dynamic and I d like to discuss why the price is geopolitics aside predicted to steadily increase at a very fast rate MP like any other commodity play relies on the supply demand dynamic of the sector and REE demand growth is on track to far outstrip the supply growth This will result increased prices per ton but MP s costs stay the same This is the beauty of the company as the price goes up their margins go up too MP and market analysts predicted over a 100 growth in NdPr magnets in the next 10 years amp x200B Processing img v0ta2r1l4f961 Don t believe that metric check this more in depth one amp x200B Processing img 7kjnncgn4f961 This graph shows most important metric as it shows that the world at current rate is not scaling up to meet demand THIS GRAPH INCLUDES CURRENT PLANNED EXPANSIONS INCLUDING INCREASED RECYCLING What does this mean There is a huge mismatch in projected demand and supply and if you don t know what that will mean then ask your wife s boyfriend about supply demand graphs from their economics class The result will be massively increased prices of permanent magnet materials because the world will not be able to mine and refine enough to satisfy demand so they will be able to increase their prices BUT AS I SAID EARLIER MP S COSTS PER TON WILL REMAIN THE SAME So what is the gist of this coupled with MP moving toward downstream expansion MP s margins will increase incredibly from a double whammy of moving downstream AND supply demand imbalance Now what does that mean for you that means MP has a very realistic and conservative path toward becoming a company with RIDICULOUS free cash flow What does that mean for MP That means that the company will be raking in cash and will be extremely flexible due to their balance sheet They will be able to expand operations or acquire competitors in order to increase their market share and production volumes OR they will be able to transition into a boomer dividend company that will pay you tendies each year They could do either of those very easily because the company HAS NO DEBT In fact MP ended Q3 2020 with 507M CASH on hand to finance their future expansions Okay i know dividends are boring but the market will begin to price in that future dividend potential and give your calls many tendies along the path to pricing in their dividend power TLDR Supply demand imbalance with geopolitical tensions as a wild card will result in insane free cash flow in the future for this company TLDR of the TLDR People want more special rock more than can make special rock People give you more tendies for special rocks Why Supply won t be able to scale up as fast A very important assumption in my analysis is the inability for supply to scale up as fast as demand and I d like to explain this more in depth as it is the crux of this DD This is where my experience in mineral refining is valuable as I can weigh in on this aspect Over time there will be more suppliers that come into the business and we are seeing that already however this is where the timetables of that come into play Simply put supply can t go up because companies will be slowed greatly due to the time it will take to get up and running and the incredible amount of upfront capital needed before even starting up the mine If a company is interested in getting into the field there isn t a fast path in because the companies can t just decide to go into the business and then go to the REE refining machinery store and buy the equipment and have them get set up All the machinery in chemical manufacturing plants REE refining counts as chemical engineering so hear me out has a long path in order to reach the optimum design Ill outline the gist of this here 1 Lab Scale Testing This is laboratory scale testing in which very small batches are prepared testing different procedures and methods in order to find the optimum refining process for the goals of the operation This is when the deciding of the catalysts solvents additive chemicals etc is done in order to decide what to do to the ore to get the best product 2 Pilot Plant Design and Testing This step in the design process is designing and building a small scale model of machinery to run the process decided upon in lab scale testing in order to determine different operating conditions determine control points etc This is when different tests and procedures are determined and also a proof of concept to begin economic calculations for designing the next step 3 Full scale design and building This is when the full size real deal machinery is designed and constructed But again there is not REE refining manufacturing store to get much of this machinery Refining plants are custom designed minus certain machinery like pumps and basic ass shit like that and custom built These are custom designed custom fabricated large scale machinery designed in every aspect from material area volume and depth in order to lower manufacturing costs while also allowing for 24 7 continuous operation The 24 7 operation aspect is important because it is why the machinery is designed so meticulously The most economic operations are ones that require little down time and little maintenance and a lot of work is put in to optimize this aspect That means it takes even more time to produce 4 Permitting and Certification Now at this point the company is years into the development of REE refining but they still can t start operating despite the entire operation up and running In the US now the lovely and very fast government gets to come in Mining and refining operations don t operate under OSHA rules and procedures they get to operate under OSHA s much meaner expensive and safety prone brother the Mining Safety and Health Administration MSHA Government inspectors have to come in and permit and certify EVERY PIECE OF MACHINERY inspect every single moving part and permit them and do a shit ton of other stuff for the government to allow you to begin operations Now due to the stimulus bill s provisions toward stimulating REE capabilities in the United states I assume that MSHA will be or already has been told to prioritize REE companies and they will probably be fast tracked but even fast tracking them will take a lot of time In addition EPA has to come in and sign off on the environmental plans of the company and probably even more government entities will have to come in to sign off on stuff that was past my exposure when I interned in the field Now you ve seen how long it would take to get up and running but another constraint worth mentioning is who does these Larger Chemical or mining companies Dow DuPont Chemours BASF etc looking to enter the field probably have their own design teams that would be able to do it in house Smaller non conglomerate entities would have to hire a chemical engineering design consulting firm to come in and do the designing write the procedures and train the production engineers and operators That means there is some decent intellectual constraints as to how many people have the know how to design at the rate needed to scale up Here is what is important any entity trying to enter the sector will have enormous upfront costs in buying the land designing the plant buying the machinery like excavators dump trucks pipelines pay employees well before starting due to training on the machinery Im not sure the exact amounts of money needed but it would easily be in the 100s of millions at least Then once all that upfront capital is sourced plant designed people trained etc the operation would take YEARS to get out of all that debt and achieve meaningful positive cash flow It is only a matter of time for MP to have significant domestic competition but by the time these operations could begin operating MP will be so far ahead in production and have a significantly stronger balance sheet than these companies could have MP will remain years ahead of any other domestic competitors even though competition will come TLDR At current outlook supply growth won t match demand growth and even if more competitors pop up to compete it ll take years to start operating and even more years to match MP s ability TLDR on the TLDR Not enough people finding special rock More people want special rock than can get special rock They pay more for special rock MP s competitors both domestic and international A large argument that bears like to make is that competition is coming in the US and they are 100 correct but it won t matter because AGAIN this is a commodity play not a tech company They make magnets their revenue will depend on the price of their product Buyers from this are not looking at MP like you would look at TSLA vs NIO or apple vs android where you could argue one is better than the other or consumers will adopt one over the other There isn t brand recognition increased utility or consumer favorites in magnets they re fucking magnets Think about it like another commodity lumber If you go to HD to buy some wood you aren t staring at two different planks of the same type of tree and picking one because of which timber company felled it or which milling company milled it You just buy lumber and go home because it is wood A timber company isn t outright threatened by another timber company popping up as long as the demand supply dynamic in the market stays the same the first timber company is unaffected That is why it won t matter WHEN more domestic and international competitors pop up As long as demand outstrips supply then commodity companies will make more and more money Now I am not trying to bullshit people so I ll discuss the international and domestic competition but Ill explain more in depth why i don t give a shit about them Domestic The ticker that cannot be named due to it being banned If you take a look at that company it is a Uranium producer that is going to re purpose machinery onsite from uranium production to REE production and they have successfully done pilot plant level processing However if you analyze their production numbers you ll see that the scale they plan on producing is not quite at the level MP will They plan on refining 15 000 tons of ore per year with an estimated 55 REE concentration which leaves an estimated 8 250 tons of REE per year of which 22 is NdP all their numbers not mine which leaves annual production of 1 815 tons yr These numbers are pretty good and I do own a stake in this company because I like the potential but its scale is not quite the scale of MP MP is predicting a run rate of 6 075 tons yr of NdPr so yes the banned ticker is a decent competitor but its only predicting to be 1 3 the size of MP annual production volume A downside of the banned ticker is that they still are focusing on Uranium production so its not a pure REE play but Uranium has a pretty decent bull case for the future so i don t want to slander that ticker too much However again these are commodity plays MP having competition even domestic doest really affect their business plans or bull case Additionally the banned ticker is sourcing its ore rom Chemours location in GA but getting milled in Utah so this is a long term inefficiency to consider as well that MP won t have to worry about once their stage 2 REO mill is complete the banned tickers financial health is pretty decent but its market cap is 516M at close 1 4 which is just slightly above amount of cash on hand MP had at the end of Q3 2020 502M That company is more of an investment opportunity than a competitor if its even worth investing in Other emerging domestic competitors link to article explaining them all https www reuters com article us usa rareearths projects factbox factbox rare earths projects under development in u s idUSKCN2241L6 Im not going to go deep into each one but you can see that many are slowed down to the process I explained above about how expensive and time consuming it is to reach operational status These companies will be coming online but won t be profitable for a while and won t be able to provide the same returns to investors for even longer International competitors Lynas Corp This is an Australian mining company that has also received pentagon funds to improve the non China production capacity They trade over the counter and are a real deal competitor and also worth investing in but their growth potential isn t as clear or easy as in the US They have pentagon funding more so out of desperation by the pentagon to get more production in the western world than loving to invest in an Australian company In the future I would imagine a lot of this government support will go toward US based companies International competitors all the china ones yes they produce the largest amount of material in the world and do it the cheapest but this is the result of none to very little environmental protection Once the supply chain can go mine to magnet many companies will look to diminish their exposure to chinese companies to ensure their supply chains are not at the whims of the Chinese government In addition MP is the cleanest REE mine in the world and a lot of environmentally conscious companies will want to support clean mined REE s and once domestic production is high enough there could be regulations passed to further incentivize purchasing domestically produced REE s All these companies were included in the forecast of supply in 2030 Even with these companies coming online MP is still positioned for incredible returns TLDR Yes competition is coming but there is already competition Its also a commodity play so its not facing replacement or redundancy like many other growth markets TLDR on the TLDR Others find special rock Your special rock still worth many tendies You still get many tendies Why this is NOT molycorp 2 0 The most common point of argument against this company is that people bring up the fact that the mine MP operates used to be run by Molycorp which went bankrupt However if you read into that transaction it really isn t that scary Molycorp did go under but this was in a period of price instability and they were not running as good of an operation Molycorp operated during the 2010 2011 peak of REE s when china restricted supply Molycorp stock went up a ton in addition to their revenue and thus they decided to invest in milling capabilities to create REO s I know this is MP s plan but don t get scared yet Because of US EPA restrictions it was wildly expensive and at bankruptcy they had 1 7B in investments into capital projects to improve their refining capability but the subsequent REE price collapse when china turned the taps back on to the world supply caused them to not afford operation The site then changed hands back and forth until it was bought by MP s current management for 40M https en wikipedia org wiki Molycorp They then invested in it after literally buying for less than pennies on the dollar and got it up and running more efficiently than before Last quarter Q3 2020 they ran 3 2x the REE concentrate production volume than Molycorp ever did amp x200B https s25 q4cdn com 570172628 files doc financials 2020 q3 MP 3Q20 Earnings Deck FINAL 11 23 2020 pdf https preview redd it

investments into operating profit In addition previous operations prioritized Cerium production for FCC catalysts MP has transitioned the goal product to be NdPr as it has much better growth potential to give it long term possibility In addition the market climate Molycorp operated under was not as forgiving as now Back then there wasn t the tailwind of increasing EV adoption or the rise of other high tech growth sector reliant on REE s Molycorp was too early and inefficient to win in the market and didn t have anywhere close to the amount of governmental support for the industry There is bipartisan support on all levels i mentioned this a bit in my last DD post but since then and this is big and shows the scale of gov support THE LAST STIMULUS BILL HAD 800M IN SUPPORT OF INCREASING DOMESTIC REE PRODUCTION https www spglobal com marketintelligence en news insights latest news headlines miners laud 800m rare earth fund in omnibus bill 61939620 Molycorp didn t have anywhere close to this level of government support And again the pentagon invested 9M into MP to help fund their REO mill because the pentagon views the ability to refine REO s as a matter of national security Discussing Concerns about Biden Presidency People who say this shit clearly have no idea what they are talking about Biden or his puppet masters but who cares money is all green has said he supports REE mining multiple times source https www reuters com article usa election mining exclusive biden campaign tells miners it supports domestic production of ev metals idUSKBN27808B His team knows their big environmental initiatives rely on REE production and that domestic production is important to keep American industry at the whims of China Yeah Trump was more hawkish with china but lets not act like a democratic presidency is going to let china walk all over the US or that Biden and other democrats will stop their push for EV s and clean energy REE s are a cornerstone piece to so many of Biden s plans there is no way he turns his back on this company Discussion of Shenghe Resources and China and their relationships with MP The one real concern that people have is their partnership with Shenghe Resources where Shenghe has agreed to buy all MP concentrate through 2021 and shenghe is a stakeholder in MP Many view this as a negative but i think it should be seen as a good way to ensure survival in the gap between now and the final magnet production A big issue would be if China chose to stop importing the MP concentrate which would give MP no customers Since this would adversely affect Shenge it makes it less likely and also the fact that MP produces 15 of the world s REE concentrate it would hurt the supply in china which is huge In fact China removed their 25 tariff on importing REE material read this source https www argusmedia com en news 2104418 china to remove import tariff on us rare earth ores as it also shows how china is buying up all the concentrate they can Japan has the capability to go from REO to NdPr magnet as well so if china ends up fucking MP starting in 2022 when their REO site is in operation then they will be able to sell their REO to Japanese companies to bridge the gap before they have their own magnet making capability amp x200B https s25 q4cdn com 570172628 files doc financials 2020 q3 MP 3Q20 Earnings Deck FINAL

concentrate as it will hurt china s wallet and ability to produce goods while only increasing the US government support for going mine to magnet domestically China realistically views their dominance as ending at some point now but they know they will still be able to control the market because of their scale regardless of whether they buy MP concentrates or not Also if Shenghe doesn t buy their concentrates then they forfeit their stake in MP they wouldn t be allowed to sell them on the market the shares would just disappear so it would effectively be a massive stock buyback and as long as the REO mill is complete then they just sell to Japanese magnet makers Mine Life discussion Their S 1 states that at current proven reserves they have about 47 years of mine life left That can be grown from drilling and exploration of more mineable material which they stated they plan on doing in addition if they for some reason don t find more mineable ore on their land and don t buy more land with ore then they could simply refine ore from other mines as the real cost barrier isn t the digging out of the ground it is the milling TLDR MP will to the moon over the next few years

Q4 2020 these guys know value If you don t know who MAC is Macerich is a fully integrated self managed and self administered real estate investment trust which focuses on the acquisition leasing management development and redevelopment of regional malls throughout the United States Macerich currently owns 51 million square feet of real estate consisting primarily of interests in 47 regional shopping centers Macerich owns some of the nation s highest earning malls including Tysons Corner Center in Northern Virginia https wamu org story 20 12 18 despite the pandemic and popularity of online retail shoppers are still flocking to tysons mall MAC is an owner of a multitude of well positioned high end shopping centers We aren t talking about your local mall that is half vacant and has been for years their properties are high end destination attractions https www macerich com Leasing Find The low interest rates benefit REIT s and allow MAC to do deals like this https www google com

bricks and mortar but as you saw above at Tyson s Corner people are out and shopping Pent up demand stimulus profits As of October 7th all 47 of the Company s major retail properties nationwide were fully open for business now that LA County has approved indoor mall reopenings In LA as of 12 27 http publichealth lacounty gov media coronavirus docs protocols Reopening ShoppingCenters pdf REIT s Real Estate Investment Trusts some of the most beaten down stocks by the pandemic and this one I believe has significant upside from its current price level What I like about MAC is this Rent collections continued to improve with collection rates increasing to approximately 81 in October of 2020 and 80 in the third quarter of 2020 up from approximately 61 in the second quarter of 2020 Mall portfolio occupancy including closed centers was 90 8 at September 30 2020 compared to 91 3 at June 30 2020 Mall tenant annual sales per square foot for the portfolio was 718 for the twelve months ended September 30 2020 compared to 800 for the twelve months ended September 30 2019 This sales metric excludes the period of COVID 19 closure for each tenant Average rent per square foot increased 1 8 to 62 29 at September 30 2020 compared to 61 16 at September 30 2019 Approximately 93 of the square footage that was open prior to COVID 19 is now open and operating Cash receipts continued to improve increasing to approximately 80 in the third quarter of 2020 from approximately 61 in the second quarter of 2020 As of November 2 2020 the Company has collected approximately 81 of rent for October With continued improvement in operating cash flow liquidity also continued to improve Cash and cash equivalents increased from 573 million at June 30 2020 to 630 million as of September 30 2020 Bottom line this company is getting healthier and owns prime real estate with stimulus and vaccines upon us the animal spirits are ready to be unleashed What I like THE MOST above the value is the potential short squeeze that is coming re GME and dare I say TSLA Short Interest Shares Short 80 670 000 Short Interest Ratio Days To Cover 14 7 Short Percent of Float 58 46 Shares Float 137 990 000 Lastly I put this together for everyone that has said I m just a steel pumper I m anything but I believe Tech has had its year in 2020 2021 will be the year of finding value with all of the current stretched valuations Commodities travel shopping real estate they will all benefit from a weakened dollar vaccines stimulus and low interest borrowing rates Good luck and do your own research

News 01 05 , Stocks take a plunge to start 2021 so is this the start of the next stock market crash Why did QuantumScape take a plunge yesterday Let s talk about this and other stock market news Very Long Post Hello everyone and Good Morning So let s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the broad stock market having a red day ahead of important events like the Georgia Election https ibb co VtxQdmk of Today while the US Congress is scheduled https ibb co wzqV8PW to certify the electoral results tomorrow which will remove any remaining uncertainty due to the political environment as the next president will be inaugurated 2 weeks after that Yesterday both the broad stock market SP500 https ibb co HByWLx9 and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite https ibb co k04mKGP finished down almost 1 5 while the Dow Jones https ibb co Cht7kGV did slightly better finishing down 380 points finishing down on the first trading day of the year for the first time since 2016 as all 3 of them did recovered somewhat after trading even lower intraday We also saw the VIX https ibb co rmHnjZj rising more than 4 points or 18 5 finishing the day near the 27 level which hasn t been touched since https ibb co mznW197 after the November elections We saw most of the companies losing ground yesterday https ibb co h8sJKh7 with the number of stocks that were trading above the 50 day moving average finally going down below 60 which in my opinion is a good amp healthy correction amp consolidation for the stock market as the volume did pick up after the year end slow markets Yesterday 10 of the 11 SECTORS https ibb co j4MprMG finished in the red with Real Estate Utilities amp Industrial losing more than 2 4 while the only small gaining sector was Energy Meanwhile on a FACTOR https ibb co Lzzvr0N basis the market was more neutral with most of the groups finishing pretty flat but the HEAT MAP https ibb co v3Yk8PG from yesterday reveals to us a bloodbath pretty much in the market as stocks were dropping left amp right with only a couple of companies posting gains like Tesla Zoom Walmart alongside the semis amp materials I think this slight pullback was expected by most analysts as the greed and bullishness in the stock market was still very high https ibb co PDHM90J to end the year as we ended the year with more than 46 of investors having a bullish sentiment pretty near the 1 year high of 55 achieved after the election in November We didn t receive many important economic data yesterday as the construction spending https ibb co kXFvYvT came in at a 9 increase in November slightly lower than expected and the previous month but in aggregate it was an increase of 3 8 year year while the Manufacturing PMI index https ibb co Xkpj85W came in at just over 57 better than expected and the previous reports with production growth and new orders being the biggest catalysts While TODAY https ibb co FDyT24L we receive auto sales numbers the Redbook chain store sales amp the manufacturing index from the ISM Meanwhile today we do start to see some of the most anticipated earnings results https ibb co 4KZBBBW as this will pick up starting in the middle of January In some other stock market news we saw QuantumScape plummeting more than 40 yesterday https ibb co 0GpXy3f after they filled to sell more than 300M shares as this will significantly affect the shares https ibb co L0CGPkV float and the dilution of the company This is a very high risk with most of the high flying stocks right now as the companies are incentivized to issue shares to raise capital regardless of the share dilution and the impact on shareholders You can also see this with Bilibili https ibb co tYspLZj that just filled for a 2B offering in Hong Kong We also saw Taiwan Semi announced a record CAPEX https ibb co HN2zPGF spending for this year as they continue https ibb co m9s85DC to invest in capital expenditure to improve process capacity and future products as they are expected to have the leading market share https ibb co DLZ0jd6 in foundry business this year which has seen a 24 increase year year to over 84B Meanwhile the New York Stock Exchange reversed its decision https ibb co Ry4gfLM on delisting Chinese telecom companies which finished the day down but all of them have seen a huge spike after this reversal in after hours while most of the Chinese EVs and not only those but pretty much the whole industry https ibb co 7QcRM9s saw a big spike yesterday after strong sales to finished the year and strong reported demand from China In the auto industry we also saw Fiat Chrysler finally agree on a merger https ibb co mv4Kp3x with PSA The merger will conclude with the company becoming the world s fourth largest carmaker They do unfortunately have a lot of things to figure out as neither of the companies has much exposure in the biggest auto market in the world China So let s also take a look at what has usually happened in the stock market after a decline of at least 1 in the first trading day of the year You can see this has happened 18 times https ibb co CPkZzP8 with the Dow Jones but this has led the index to finish down only 40 of the time in January and for the year while for the SP500 this has happened just 12 times https ibb co MPHN34j but also only saw a decline for the month and for the year of about 42 of the time with the last 2 of the 3 times that this has happened being at the end of the dot com bubble and in the 2008 big financial crisis So I think yesterday was a good mix of political volatility combined with profit taking after a huge run in 2020 portfolio rebalancing and of course the treat of new lockdowns https ibb co 88pj0Yj just like they started in the UK which is a pretty perfect storm for the market to have a bad day I don t think there is any crash possibilities but a correction or pullback is possible in the short term before moving on higher as companies start to have easy comps restrictions get eased and many more good things toward the end of the year So let s hope for a good day today instead in the market as the US FUTURES https ibb co bmsPDqL seem to be pointing to a red open with the while the rest of the world is pretty mixed https ibb co xLfGFHT with Japan France and Germany down while China amp Hong Kong are up Thank you everyone for reading Hope you enjoyed the content Be sure to leave a comment

own DD and feel free to verify anything I mention below Make your own financial decisions Building a Launch Pad in 2019 Supply and Demand You have all heard demand is up and supply is down but what the hell does that actually mean for steel stocks To clarify a few points Global Steel demand has remained largely flat through 2020 and is only expected to rise 4 in 2021 Supply is and has always been the issue here because of this I will largely ignore the increased demand arguments as they will have minimal impact on current prices unless something major changes like a new infrastructure stimulus bill which is very unlikely short term When talking about global Steel Iron ore prices you are almost always talking about Chinese Supply demand There are other factors that can affect domestic demand supply in countries see India but for the sake of this DD I will limit the scope to the Asia Pacific With that said let s begin In January of 2019 the C rrego do Feij o mining complex in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais collapsed setting the stage for what will now be called the Great Global Steel Shortage of 2021 VALE bois turn away RIP Jan 2019 calls https www canadianminingjournal com news iron ore video shows exact moment when vales dam collapsed This disaster not only caused extensive loss of life with more than 240 reported deaths but it also severely constrained Vale s iron ore supply slated for seaborne markets Authorities ordered a halt in production across many of Vale s Brazil mines including at Brucutu the largest in the Minas Gerais state output capacity totalling nearly one quarter of the mining company s initial 2019 production target of 400 million tonnes was taken offline an amount equivalent to around 6 percent of the entire annual global seaborne iron ore market By February Vale had declared force majeure unforeseeable circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract on the sales contracts of several iron ore qualities while volatile weather conditions in the north of Brazil also had an adverse impact on the mining company s iron ore operations By the second quarter Vale s production levels were a hefty 34 percent lower vis a vis second quarter 2018 levels It has also posted two consecutive quarters of losses in 2019 with a 133 million loss for the second quarter against a 76 million gain in net income recorded for the same quarter in 2018 adding to the whopping 1 6 billion loss Vale notched up in the first quarter Across the ocean in March 2019 Cyclone Veronica decided to stop by Western Australia s Pilbara Coast and force major local iron ore mines to shut down production As a result prices sailed past the 100 per tonne mark before being driven even further skywards during the second quarter after Rio Tinto reported dramatic declines in output The Australian mining giant s iron ore production dropped by 7 percent to 80 million tonnes during the second quarter compared to the previous year as bad weather and operational challenges at their mines continued to weigh heavily on capacity Rio Tinto also slashed its forecast for 2019 shipments Fellow mining major BHP meanwhile also saw annual output for fiscal 2019 decline by 2 percent to 269 6 million tonnes again partly stemming from the devastating impacts of Australia s tropical cyclones The two countries represent China s largest iron ore suppliers and given the hugely consequential supply problems in Brazil and Australia China struggled to buy iron ore from the global market as easily as has normally been the case Data from China s General Administration of Customs shows that imports declined in June to 75 18 million tonnes the lowest level since February 2016 and almost 11 percent lower than June 2018 levels China therefore tapped its own stockpiles of the commodity to satiate demand from its rampant steel sector At 115 million tonnes at the end of June 2019 port stockpiles fell to their lowest level in more than two years and were 18 percent lower than 12 months prior This also meant that only four weeks of inventory supply were on hand for steel producers Today those levels are even further diminished to 104 62 tonnes S amp P Global Market Intelligence for example calculated that a 54 million tonne deficit will transpire for the global seaborne iron ore market in 2019 and estimates that it could take another three years before the market returns to a state of balance between production and consumption S amp P chiefly holds the Australian and Brazilian supply disruption responsible for this deficit Assembling the Ship with Excess Steel Steel Oversupply Covid and Destocking By March 2020 Chinese steel producers were dealing with soaring finished and semi finished steel inventories due to a covid infected export market Global moves to idle furnaces and lockdown restrictions were put into effect This halt in steel supply put all eyes on China who short of Feb March had been increasing production month over month Then something interesting happened Chinese steel overstocks started to decrease By June 2020 those inventories had dissolved global producers were STILL scaling down furnace production and China for the first time in a decade became a net importer of steel Lack of steel inventory and capped out Chinese production literally hit an all time production high in October 2020 paired with a global market who had been destocking inventories over the last 2 years and idled production set sent prices soaring A rush to increase production internationally was met with hesitation due to ongoing lockdown concerns increased ore prices and lack of global supply iron Furnace restarts only started happening in early December Hopefully this helps everyone gain an understanding of the current steel situation The entire supply chain is currently five months behind production work orders extending out 20 weeks for finished semi finished steel products and spot inventories are non existent The idea that we can just ramp up production to fill this gap is met by extreme iron ore shortages Recycled scrap has offered temporary relief but they are also hitting 10 year highs Pair all this with a La Ni a year in 2021 which will further impact iron supply it is becoming increasingly apparent that there is no release available for these prices Buy Steel
