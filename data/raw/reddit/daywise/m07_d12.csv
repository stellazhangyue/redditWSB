16,What s up fuckers its been awhile After taking some time off learning about the dangers of short term Capital Gains Tax and how to be ir responsible with money I am fully ready to get back into things What I do is model options hedging to find the significant strikes and predict short medium term behavior I nailed the GameStore squeeze https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kvjbuk gamestop melvin capital put positions utm source share amp utm medium web2x amp context 3 the week prior doing the same thing It works TLDR Not much options activity to move SPY past 435 Look at Put credit spreads 334p 332p and a small gamble on 7 23 439c Some requisite information and assumptions before getting started Options are extremely volatile That s why we re all here but Market Makers have to follow rules about hedging risks and for good reason Near all options liquidity is provided by these firms which write the contracts and make money scalping the Bid Ask literally making the market MM s usually have both ends of a trade i e short both calls and puts which balances out but the net difference is an extremely risky position MM s are much more boring than retail makes them out to be and as such having billions of dollars in net short options obligations on the books is not acceptable MM s avoid this risk and client broker conflicts by hedging directional risk Mathematically this is done by buying or selling one share of the underlying for each 0 01 increase in Delta Delta is arguably the most important greek and technically represents the rate of change of the option s price with respect to a 1 change in the underlying An alternative understanding of delta is the chance a contract expires ITM An ATM option is 50 delta 50 chance a far OTM option is 0 00 0 and so on The most important realization is that the trading of options affects the price of the underlying Buying a contract inadvertently moves shares In fact this typically attracts the underlying spot price towards the strike of the contract This model assumes this is true and the spot price will gravitate towards certain strikes with greater open interest roughly The options market in the last year has grown far beyond anything in the past thanks to retail and increasingly risk on firms You could make the argument options are mostly responsible for the melt up over the last year but thats a different story Regardless the options market has been extremely predictive of underlying equities so pay attention The Goods This data includes all option expirations from tomorrow 12 JUL until the August monthlies OPEX The further expirations are not as important since Gamma D Delta is lower and therefore less reactive to underlying spot price This is the Delta weighted OI model for SPY Think about the height of each candle as the weight of each strike like a mass in a gravitational field A larger mass casts a larger field of gravity and is more attractive Two key things The largest candles are 427 and 435 On Thursday SPY consolidated at 427 428 before immediately ramping to 435 where it closed on Friday There are no heavy strikes after 435 Put Delta is in red Call Delta

489960ed7cc93208ccbe96093b39bf69b1a45b46 The significant strikes remain mostly the same with 427 435 This is mostly expected but there are two interesting spots to note There is no significant options activity above 435 to continue SPY bleeding upwards A gap needs to be filled and more contracts bought between 437 and 442 to continue the bleed upwards I believe that will happen this week after that push on Friday so keep an eye out for elevated volume on those contracts OI won t update intraday 440 marginally builds as a significant strike assuming a slight increase in price This is a guess but 440 is in play if OI on contracts 437 440 increases I will probably do an update on Tuesday after close and take a look at if that has changed I prefer to go a week further out and one strike under SPY 439c 7 23 Positions Disregarding any macroeconomic factors SPY should remain bound within 432 and 436 until the options market fills in the gap Even though stocks only go up I would bet SPY

Years When it comes to this company I believe we have potential for both long term and short potential In this post I am going to break down everything I know about this company and explain why it is my largest position in my portfolio Grab your crayons folks and follow along amp x200B INTRODUCTION Here is a quick run down of Tattooed Chef and what they do They are a food company selling frozen foods products in the freezer isle at major grocery outlets Products are plant based to take advantage of vegan vegetarian and plant based food trends While products are sold in the United States production takes place in Italy Production costs are much cheaper overseas and allows for higher margins here in the U S TTCF is vertically integrated allowing for greater control of product quality and adaptation It s a new age food company clicking on all cylinders and picking up steam competing against companies of yesteryear Revenue Growth For TTCF This company is growing like a BEAST Here s some of the numbers from 2017 and on 2017 Revenue 32 5 Million 2018 Revenue 47 9 Million 47 4 2019 Revenue 84 9 Million 77 2 2020 Revenue 148 5 Million 74 9 2021 Revenue Projected 239 3 Million 61 1

EVERYONE Is Ignoring The growth numbers up top seem impressive right Well this is a case where just top line revenues do not tell the whole story TTCF sells Tattooed Chef branded products as well as some private label products What are some of the most valuable assets in the world Loyal brands Tattooed Chef realizes this and for the last few years they have been solely focused on its core brand rather than private label deals Why does Coca Cola dominate the drink space for decades Because the brand is globally recognized and it s a product people trust Is TTCF there yet No Will it ever get there Maybe But so far they are on the right track to do so amp x200B HERE ARE THE GROWTH NUMBERS FOR ONLY TTCF LABELED PRODUCTS amp x200B FULL YEAR 2019 18 3 Million FULL YEAR 2020 84 6 Million 363

for this company The CEO himself has publicly stated that private label revenue over time will be phased out In my opinion private label revenue is mostly irrelevant with this growth story While 50 60 and 70 revenue growth may be impressive the numbers that really matter branded products are growing well over 100 year over year Earnings amp Profitability Potential The CEO and founder of the company see information below has had a long history of running food businesses Before running public companies the businesses were ran to feed his family and live a prosperous life So Tattooed Chef is ran with the intention of being profitable AND growing rapidly For a company in its early growth stages this is very rare Most businesses regardless of the industry typically lose money hand over fist The fast cash burn usually requires companies in these early growth stages to take on debt and issue additional shares This usually leads to weaker balance sheets and diluted long term shareholder value For Tattooed Chef this is not the case Shareholder dilution is unlikely and debt is unnecessary for the ALREADY profitable business I doubt long term debt will accumulate unless a large acquisition is made amp x200B https preview redd it 27k7qikk9sa71 png width 1101 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 7a68cab583ba52338202aacbb401dd1db9267c41 So far TTCF has produced minimal profits This is mainly due to them reinvesting virtually all profits back into the business for further growth The chart is more accurate for results from late 2019 and early 2020 The chart is unfortunately skewed heavily in the last few quarters due to a large tax benefit changing from S corporation to C corporation and other things such as the recent acquisition More on that later But as you can see the company can make money AND grow revenue for their flagship Tattooed Chef branded products gt 100 The hardest part of this analysis is trying to determine future profitability While profits are growing it is hard to know what type of net income and EPS numbers this company will be doing in 2026 In the chart below revenue is expected to reach 1 0 Billion annually in 2026 Forecasts this far out can sometimes be a far cry from actual results But in this case I believe it is an attainable number by 2026 The big question here is How much of that will turn into profit amp x200B Photo From December 2020 Guidance

again trying to forecast net income for a company like this in 2026 is very difficult But we will use an assumption of 10 of revenue turning into net income in 2026 Margins will be higher for TTCF versus competitors such as Tyson Foods See Below A Tyson Foods for example generally turns 5 into net income TTCF could make 10 an attainable number in the next five years So assuming 10 into net income out of 1 0 Billion in revenue that means net income would be an assumed 100 Million in 2026 Here are valuation stock price estimates based on those profitability estimates The stock currently currently trades at almost exactly 20 00 as of the time of writing at 07 10 2021 Lower End 2026 PE Ratio of 20 Market Cap of 2 0 Billion Stock Price of 24 40 The Middle 2026 PE Ratio of 25 Market Cap

23f549da93a89860c7d42d742c2a4f71438e5d0b VALUATION Tattooed Chef currently trades at a market cap of 1 65 Billion For a growth company at this stage P S ratio likely a better metric to use in terms of valuation rather than P E ratio Here are the numbers for 2021 and 2022 2021 P S Ratio 6 89 2022 P S Ratio 5 11 This company is trading at 5 times next years revenue Considering the growth trajectory moving forward I would consider this to have considerable value The company also has 185 Million in cash Considering this very large cash pile relative to the company s size it makes the company s market cap a bit more attractive MERGERS amp ACQUISITIONS In May of this year Tattooed Chef announced the acquisition New Mexico Food Distributors Inc and Karsten Tortilla Factory This acquisition was approximately 35 Million The company still has 185 Million in cash as of the last earnings report This leaves lots of room for further expansions and acquisitions While only 35 Million was spent a significant amount of revenue will be generated from this acquisition We will be immediately addressing the 1 billion Frozen Mexican Food category once the transactions close At full capacity we believe Foods of New Mexico can contribute up to 200 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years and create significant value for all our stakeholders 200 Million in annual revenue for

deal been announced yet Nope But I have some good news I am in a discord chat full of other TTCF shareholders It appears that while it has not been publicly announced by Tattooed Chef a soft launch of their products are being sold at a few Kroger locations Photos and prices can be found listed online in certain areas of Kroger s website Two different shareholders I have personally spoken to have

massive growth numbers we talked about for Tattooed Chef branded products Well until 2021 the budget for marketing and advertising TTCF products has been 0 00 Until this year 100 of their growth has been through their own making NOT with a massive marketing budget Small TV campaigns and mobile ads are being paid for as of the last few months More importantly brand ambassadors influencers will also be sponsoring TTCF as well Now that advertising will be impacting the company I expect brand recognition to steadily increase TARGET LAUNCH IN THE LAST QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL THE CEO STATED THAT TARGET CLAIMED TATTOOED CHEF WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FROZEN FOOD LAUNCH IN THE HISTORY OF TARGET This is obviously huge for the company Target is already a big deal for this company and this level of confidence from Target is exciting BALANCE SHEET Going over everything on a balance sheet would make this already long post even longer But I have two main things on the balance sheet I would like to point out Cash as of 03 31 2021 is 185 Million Meanwhile long term debt 1 9 Million The company currently has almost no debt and is cash loaded Considering this is a company which has 1 65 Billion market cap 185 Million is a considerable amount of cash So technically the valuation of the company is over 10 strictly in cold hard cash This is very appealing amp x200B https preview redd it

an extremely competitive market The food industry will always have big money moving products in and out and competition will continue to be ruthless The many retailers TTCF has gotten into could give away the hard earned shelf space This goes hand and hand with competition risks If Target Walmart Costco etc finds a better product TTCF is at risk of losing the valuable real estate of shelf space Sam and Sarah are the backbone of the company The bulk of shares are owned by them and they are what makes the company the success that it is If for whatever reason they were to part ways with the company it is questionable how successful this business would be I believe plant based diets are a trend not a fad But if vegetarian vegan plant diets die off in popularity then Tattooed Chef would likely begin to follow suit as well Low margins are kind of the norm for food based businesses Low margins means less room for error Profits will likely remain constrained to certain levels for the lifespan of the business Inflation has been a big talk in the markets recently and rising costs of raw materials for their products could rise This could potentially hurt profitability Risk free rate of return drives valuation for all equity securities The risk free rate of return is currently at rock bottom If this were to change then stocks with profits that are future oriented would likely see their valuation contract TTCF falls into this category of valuation contraction DISCLOSURE I own 700 shares of TTCF stock at 17 21 each Over half of my net worth I own 13 calls at 20 strike for 1 55 each expiring 08 20 2021 I am selling 7 calls against all of my shares at 35 strike expiring 07 16 2021

included it on my list of competitors in that post but it hadn t merged at the time I see this company as a potential 2 3x bagger either in the short term or within 1 2 years and here s why Overview Beachbody BODY is a fitness company that s been operating for 20 years founded in 1998 They ve just recently completed a three way merger with FRX and Myx Fitness Beachbody has brought their digital content fitness instructors and subscribers as well as nutritional products to the table Myx Fitness has brought their fitness equipment Under the name Beachbody they plan to be a competitor of Peloton but aiming at the everyman market as opposed to the health nut upper income market like Peloton For that reason their subscriptions and equipment are cheaper Here s what makes it look so good 400 million in cash on hand Zero debt that s right zero 3 2 million subscribers 95 8 month over month digital retention 1 billion in combined revenue estimated for 2021 Has some big names on board Arnold Schwarzenegger LeBron James Shaq Has experienced CEOS directing things especially in the area of digital content service Kevin Mayer ex CEO of TikTok and ex VP of Disney Carl Daikeler CEO and founder of Beachbody Jon Longdon CEO of OpenFit and co founder of Beachbody Carl Daikeler claims he doesn t plan to sell a single share You can read more about the merger and the company s info in this article https www marketwatch com press release forest road acquisition corp and the beachbody company announce combined first quarter 2021 financial results for beachbody and myx 2021 05 19 91591019 siteid bigcharts amp dist bigcharts amp tesla y So basically we ve got a company with experience seemingly good financials a massive subscriber pool many of whom are fanatical like PTON subscribers and excellent retention rate Below is the projected revenue for 2021 2025 Beachbody Revenue Projected Revenue 2018 2025 https preview redd it dmodbiadgsa71 png width 1545 amp format png

just merged and a drop after de spacing while people lock in profits is common Also Beachbody hasn t had much PR so there hasn t been a lot to push this stock up It s relatively undiscovered by the wider market and volume is low Market makers have been using this to their advantage and are having a great time stomping on retail They ve been shorting it heavily taking it as low as it can go to make maximum profit For this reason buying shares rather than options is the better choice imo Last month the MMs took the stock price down to precisely 9 99 at the very end of the day of expiry of 10 calls so that they d all expire worthless The manipulation was blatant So if MMs are controlling this stock why am I bullish Because all it takes is a bit of PR and volume and this stock could explode The MMs are controlling this right now BECAUSE THEY CAN but it s impossible for that to last forever once there s PR earnings and the wider market recognises its value They ve shorted it HEAVILY and last I read it was at approx 27 short interest percentage and only 40 000 shares https fintel io ss us BODy available to short It s also been the only NYSE stock along with AMC on the SSR list this past week Catalysts are already starting which is pushing up the share price The first 2 analysts have brought out their PTs one at 12 and another at 16 so analysts are decidedly bullish on BODY Beachbody s CEO Carl states they plan to spend a lot of their cash on marketing so we can expect to hear more and more about Beachbody in the coming months Now I can t say how much the MMs are allowing this price rise right now and how much is organic but the fact of the matter is in this current market and with all the catalysts expected to come it s not possible for them to maintain this low share price permanently At some point they have to cover or reverse position Short Squeeze Some people are talking about a short squeeze which yes it s a potential short squeeze candidate but if there s one thing GME and AMC has shown us it s that you need a LOT of buying pressure and diamond handed apes to even have a chance of that It s pretty rare to have a short squeeze happen and I m not hanging my hopes on that The thing is in my opinion we don t even NEED a short squeeze here The MMs must know that this isn t a sustainable position for a growing company but since we re still early in the game they can eke as much money as possible out of retail before more big boys and more retail buyers load in A lot of people including myself aren t selling because it s obvious this stock is worth more than its current price It s only a matter of time Bearish Points 1 There are many who say this company will fail because it s got some MLM practices That would worry me if they hadn t been in operation for 20 years and as shitty as I sound I m not bothered since other MLM type companies like Herbalife do just fine I just want to make money on the stock The fact that it s got ex Disney and ex TikTok CEO on board and has been trading profitably makes me even more confident 2 Things are still speculative We haven t seen their earnings yet Yep fair enough There is still some risk in that regard There s also the likelihood this merger and future expenses like R amp D and marketing will cut into their profits possibly making it negative for a year or two like Peloton was However this current market is very bullish and forward looking so I could see the stock price going up or maintaining anyhow especially since it s already so low 3 This is a pandemic stock After the pandemic is over it ll crash along with Peloton A lot of people are saying we seem to be in a bubble right now and many are holding their breath for when that bubble might burst or at least have a bunch of

included it on my list of competitors in that post but it hadn t merged at the time I see this company as a potential 2 3x bagger either in the short term or within 1 2 years and here s why Overview Beachbody BODY is a fitness company that s been operating for 20 years founded in 1998 They ve just recently completed a three way merger with FRX and Myx Fitness Beachbody has brought their digital content fitness instructors and subscribers as well as nutritional products to the table Myx Fitness has brought their fitness equipment Under the name Beachbody they plan to be a competitor of Peloton but aiming at the everyman market as opposed to the health nut upper income market like Peloton For that reason their subscriptions and equipment are cheaper Here s what makes it look so good 400 million in cash on hand Zero debt that s right zero 3 2 million subscribers 95 8 month over month digital retention 1 billion in combined revenue estimated for 2021 Has some big names on board Arnold Schwarzenegger LeBron James Shaq Has experienced CEOS directing things especially in the area of digital content service Kevin Mayer ex CEO of TikTok and ex VP of Disney Carl Daikeler CEO and founder of Beachbody Jon Longdon CEO of OpenFit and co founder of Beachbody Carl Daikeler claims he doesn t plan to sell a single share So basically we ve got a company with experience seemingly good financials a massive subscriber pool many of whom are fanatical like PTON subscribers and excellent retention rate Below is the projected revenue for 2021 2025 amp x200B Beachbody Revenue Projected Revenue 2018 2025 https preview redd it k08k4h2dmsa71 png width 1545 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 027e29c79da76b25eda7c338bea23bb7b49840e9 You can read about the details of expected earnings

with all this promise why is the price of the stock so low Well for one thing it has just merged and a drop after de spacing while people lock in profits is common Also Beachbody hasn t had much PR so there hasn t been a lot to push this stock up It s relatively undiscovered by the wider market and volume is low Market makers have been using this to their advantage and are having a great time stomping on retail They ve been shorting it heavily taking it as low as it can go to make maximum profit For this reason buying shares rather than options is the better choice imo Last month the MMs took the stock price down to precisely 9 99 at the very end of the day of expiry of 10 calls so that they d all expire worthless The manipulation was blatant So if MMs are controlling this stock why am I bullish Because all it takes is a bit of PR and volume and this stock could explode The MMs are controlling this right now BECAUSE THEY CAN but it s impossible for that to last forever once there s PR earnings and the wider market recognises its value They ve shorted it HEAVILY and last I read it was at approx 27 short interest percentage and only 40 000 shares https fintel io ss us BODy https fintel io ss us BODy available to short It s also been the only NYSE stock along with AMC on the SSR list this past week Catalysts are already starting which is pushing up the share price The first 2 analysts have brought out their PTs one at 12 and another at 16 so analysts are decidedly bullish on BODY Beachbody s CEO Carl states they plan to spend a lot of their cash on marketing so we can expect to hear more and more about Beachbody in the coming months Now I can t say how much the MMs are allowing this price rise right now and how much is organic but the fact of the matter is in this current market and with all the catalysts expected to come it s not possible for them to maintain this low share price permanently At some point they have to cover or reverse position Short Squeeze Some people are talking about a short squeeze which yes it s a potential short squeeze candidate but if there s one thing GME and AMC has shown us it s that you need a LOT of buying pressure and diamond handed apes to even have a chance of that It s pretty rare to have a short squeeze happen and I m not hanging my hopes on that The thing is in my opinion we don t even NEED a short squeeze here The MMs must know that this isn t a sustainable position for a growing company but since we re still early in the game they can eke as much money as possible out of retail before more big boys and more retail buyers load in A lot of people including myself aren t selling because it s obvious this stock is worth more than its current price It s only a matter of time Bearish Points 1 There are many who say this company will fail because it s got some MLM practices That would worry me if they hadn t been in operation for 20 years and as shitty as I sound I m not bothered since other MLM type companies like Herbalife do just fine I just want to make money on the stock The fact that it s got ex Disney and ex TikTok CEO on board and has been trading profitably makes me even more confident 2 Things are still speculative We haven t seen their earnings yet Yep fair enough There is still some risk in that regard There s also the likelihood this merger and future expenses like R amp D and marketing will cut into their profits possibly making it negative for a year or two like Peloton was However this current market is very bullish and forward looking so I could see the stock price going up or maintaining anyhow especially since it s already so low 3 This is a pandemic stock After the pandemic is over it ll crash along with Peloton A lot of people are saying we seem to be in a bubble right now and many are holding their breath for when that bubble might burst or at least have a bunch of corrections I can see it happening with Peloton at some point it s already had a correction though it s climbing back up but this stock price is already so low it can t really fall much further so in that way it s very low risk compared to a lot of other investments Great upside small downside Also the pandemic has changed things permanently and while it s given stocks like PTON a big boost I m of the belief that this technology is going to be the future so I d expect both PTON and BODY to recover eventually even if they happen to be brought down by corrections Disclosure I currently have 1 100 shares at 10 34 My PT is between 15 18 in the short term providing the

MMs took the stock price down to precisely 9 99 at the very end of the day of expiry of 10 calls so that they d all expire worthless The manipulation was blatant So if MMs are controlling this stock why am I bullish Because all it takes is a bit of PR and volume and this stock could explode The MMs are controlling this right now BECAUSE THEY CAN but it s impossible for that to last forever once there s PR earnings and the wider market recognises its value They ve shorted it HEAVILY and last I read it was at approx 27 short interest percentage and only 40 000 shares available to short It s also been the only NYSE stock along with AMC on the SSR list this past week Catalysts are already starting which is pushing up the share price The first 2 analysts have brought out their PTs one at 12 and another at 16 so analysts are decidedly bullish on BODY Beachbody s CEO Carl states they plan to spend a lot of their cash on marketing so we can expect to hear more and more about Beachbody in the coming months Now I can t say how much the MMs are allowing this price rise right now and how much is organic but the fact of the matter is in this current market and with all the catalysts expected to come it s not possible for them to maintain this low share price permanently At some point they have to cover or reverse position Short Squeeze Some people are talking about a short squeeze which yes it s a potential short squeeze candidate but if there s one thing GME and AMC has shown us it s that you need a LOT of buying pressure and diamond handed apes to even have a chance of that It s pretty rare to have a short squeeze happen and I m not hanging my hopes on that The thing is in my opinion we don t even NEED a short squeeze here The MMs must know that this isn t a sustainable position for a growing company but since we re still early in the game they can eke as much money as possible out of retail before more big boys and more retail buyers load in A lot of people including myself aren t selling because it s obvious this stock is worth more than its current price It s only a matter of time Bearish Points 1 There are many who say this company will fail because it s got some MLM practices That would worry me if they hadn t been in operation for 20 years and as shitty as I sound I m not bothered since other MLM type companies like Herbalife do just fine I just want to make money on the stock The fact that it s got ex Disney and ex TikTok CEO on board and has been trading profitably makes me even more confident 2 Things are still speculative We haven t seen their earnings yet Yep fair enough There is still some risk in that regard There s also the likelihood this merger and future expenses like R amp D and marketing will cut into their profits possibly making it negative for a year or two like Peloton was However this current market is very bullish and forward looking so I could see the stock price going up or maintaining anyhow especially since it s already so low 3 This is a pandemic stock After the pandemic is over it ll crash along with Peloton A lot of people are saying we seem to be in a bubble right now and many are holding their breath for when that bubble might burst or at least have a bunch of corrections I can see it happening with Peloton at some point it s already had a correction though it s climbing back up but this stock price is already so low it can t really fall much further so in that way it s very low risk compared to a lot of other investments Great upside small downside Also the pandemic has changed things permanently and while it s given stocks like PTON a big boost I m of the belief that this technology is going to be the future so I d expect both PTON and BODY to recover eventually even if they happen to be brought down by corrections Disclosure I currently have 1 100 shares at 10 34 My PT is between 15 18 in the short term providing the overall market stays bullish and 25 35

included it on my list of competitors in that post but it hadn t merged at the time I see this company as a potential 2 3x bagger either in the short term or within 1 2 years and here s why Overview Beachbody BODY is a fitness company that s been operating for 20 years founded in 1998 They ve just recently completed a three way merger with Forest Road and Myx Fitness Beachbody has brought their digital content fitness instructors and subscribers as well as nutritional products to the table Myx Fitness has brought their fitness equipment Under the name Beachbody they plan to be a competitor of Peloton but aiming at the everyman market as opposed to the health nut upper income market like Peloton For that reason their subscriptions and equipment are cheaper Here s what makes it look so good 400 million in cash on hand Zero debt that s right zero 3 2 million subscribers 95 8 month over month digital retention 1 billion in combined revenue estimated for 2021 Has some big names on board Arnold Schwarzenegger LeBron James Shaq Has experienced CEOS directing things especially in the area of digital content service Kevin Mayer ex CEO of TikTok and ex VP of Disney Carl Daikeler CEO and founder of Beachbody Jon Longdon CEO of OpenFit and co founder of Beachbody Carl Daikeler claims he doesn t plan to sell a single share So basically we ve got a company with experience seemingly good financials a massive subscriber pool many of whom are fanatical like PTON subscribers and excellent retention rate Below is the projected revenue for 2021 2025 amp x200B Beachbody Revenue Projected Revenue 2018 2025 https preview redd it 913utts6qsa71 png width 1545 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 9f24ad2953221fbb1d6d719b85ad1a8046f4c279 You can read about the details of expected

pdf So with all this promise why is the price of the stock so low Well for one thing it has just merged and a drop after de spacing while people lock in profits is common Also Beachbody hasn t had much PR so there hasn t been a lot to push this stock up It s relatively undiscovered by the wider market and volume is low Market makers have been using this to their advantage and are having a great time stomping on retail They ve been shorting it heavily taking it as low as it can go to make maximum profit For this reason buying shares rather than options is the better choice imo Last month the MMs took the stock price down to precisely 9 99 at the very end of the day of expiry of 10 calls so that they d all expire worthless The manipulation was blatant So if MMs are controlling this stock why am I bullish Because all it takes is a bit of PR and volume and this stock could explode The MMs are controlling this right now BECAUSE THEY CAN but it s impossible for that to last forever once there s PR earnings and the wider market recognises its value They ve shorted it HEAVILY and last I read it was at approx 27 short interest percentage and only 40 000 shares available to short It s

Swedish Crowns SEK at the moment 1 USD 8 58 SEK amp x200B What kind of company is AAC AAC is a NewSpace company that develops produces and supplies CubeSats micro satellites As of recent acquisitions it also provides SaaS Space as a Service It s public customer base is well known including the two most obvious names NASA and ESA European Space Agency Information provided by the company AAC Clyde

market and finally broken the pattern with force The why and the how is unknown to most Some however speculate that the previous owner of Clyde Space has been spewing out stocks since 2017 for private purposes However there is no official data to support this The past month the stock has grown 37 from it s ATL Current company value is 618 MSEK 72M USD 4 The company has during 2020 and early 2021 through re organization and further acqusitions pulled their EBIDTA from negative to break even in Q1 The company claims that they will reach a positive EBITDA by 2022 Observe by not during This is a

SERIOUS runup within the next couple months if you don t like rocket emojis large price increases or DD created by an idiot keep scrolling For everyone else lets begin Recently I have been looking into the utilization rates of different stocks throughout their run ups For those of you who don t know what the utilization rate is Utilization is defined as loaned shares divided by available shares in the securities lending market expressed as a percentage If utilization is high or maxed out at 100 it means that pretty much all shares that are available to be loaned out at that current time are loaned out presumably to be shorted I will be using ORTEX to view this data and they get roughly 2 3 of the securities lending data so take the numbers with a grain of salt Utilization basically represents the demand to short a stock the higher the percentage means higher demand and this can be bearish for lots of stocks although for MEME stocks this has NOT been the case in fact it has seemingly provided rocket fuel Ultimately I have found that utilization has been an important indicator to tell if stocks have the ability for incredibly large price increases and when those price increases are over After analyzing these trends I have reason to believe CLOV could within the next couple months have a large run up RELEASE THE ROCKETS Firstly lets take a fundamental look into CLOV https www reddit com r CLOV comments ofzwnx clov fundamental analysis https www reddit com r CLOV comments ofzwnx clov fundamental analysis Author u anjuna freak https www reddit com user anjuna freak I don t want to rewrite this so go read that if you want to read up on CLOV s fundamentals Now let s look into the utilization rate of different stocks and how that has related to stock price in the past These stocks also had high short interest although I wanted to keep the graphs as simple as possible for the apes Firstly let s look at GameStop GME These graphs show utilization as a percentage YELLOW price candles RED GREEN and volume BLUE GameStop was at 100 amp 37 utilization beginning on September 4th 2020 at a price of 9 20 https preview redd it 7mupfemf9ua71 png width 1603 amp format png amp auto webp amp s cc50bb6fbfdaa56dfed8e0ec20cbe31f56893c2b we being to see volume pickup around Jan 12th for GME and the price increases to 20 then over the next couple weeks GME rockets to a high of 485 During all of this the utilization stays at 100 amp 37 BUT one week later from that price high we see utilization drop to 69 amp 37 and price drop over 50 amp 37 https preview redd it axwom99j9ua71 png width 1546 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 1a5473c8f55b4f7c840fd1168b2069575d67ce21 What trend do we see We see our peak price while utilization is high and a 20 30 utilization drop following our peak The drop in utilization is ultimately the indicator to tell us the run up is done for now The price throughout all of January was increasing heavily but had no effect on utilization this run up only ended once utilization fell steeply GME is a much simpler stock to look at because it was so heavily shorted that its utilization was much more stable at above 100 But now lets take a look at AMC we see a very similar situation Utilization hits 100 amp 37 in Mid April price action remains fairly calm until May 24th we see a volume pickup and the run up begins The price increases from 12 to a high of 72 on June 2nd We see utilization fall after June 2nd from 99 100 amp 37 to roughly 79 amp 37 During this time the price falls https preview redd it vvhx9u3n9ua71 png width 1588 amp format png amp auto webp amp s a6dbaa5ee8563c0355bccc9f4cc2725a088d4e1e Once again we see utilization being the indicator that our runup is over despite some large red and green days during the run up the utilization still stays solid it is only when the utilization falls significantly roughly 20 30 that we have hit a price peak Now lets take a look at AMC a couple months earlier in March where it had another runup March 5th utilization hits 100 amp 37 AMC price increases roughly 50 amp 37 in next two days The utilization then falls and price continues to rise for a week or two This runup was small although we see the same trend of utilization only decreasing with a strong price increase We then see utilization return to 100 amp 37 in late April leading up to the huge May24th June2nd run up Keep in mind that in this example utilization falls but returns very quick which to me says that another run up is viable and that is exactly what happened https preview redd it sdeg2wbs9ua71 png width 858 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 4d17c31d11a0a29a02a6b9def0ca117c144600b4 Now lets take a look at SNDL another stock with a very similar run up In January SNDL has a utilization of 100 amp 37 at a price of 0 50 From January 27th February 11th the utilization stayed in the high 90 s only coming down to 88 amp 37 for a short period During this same period the price went from 1 00 to 4 00 We see utilization fall on February 18th down to 58 amp 37 and this is ultimately the end of the runup confirmed https preview redd it wi0qzq9u9ua71 png width 1592 amp format png amp auto webp amp s ea96f883af54f21ce65529e4986b409b18c98d20 I m including SNDL s run up because it shows the same trend Utilization hits 100 it stays at least above around 90 until a huge price runup Then shortly after the utilization drops significantly to roughly 50 70 and the run up is over Finally lets take a look at SPCE In December 2020 SPCE hits 100 amp 37 utilization In late January volume picks up and a run up begins Price goes from 24 63 while utilization sits at over 95 amp 37 Utilization then falls sharply down to 60 amp 37 after hitting its run up high of 63 Utilization in April goes from 60 amp 37 back to high 90 amp 37 s and once again the price surges from 24 now to roughly 40 https preview redd it i7dnkh7x9ua71 png width 1585 amp format png amp auto webp amp s ca781fdad911483399e73cf9484fe0c332925c4f Of course SPCE has had some fundamental drivers as well but its utilization price trend stays consistent with all the other runups TLDR Almost all large meme stock runups have begun with utilization at 100 and a large volume increase Utilization appears to act inversely with price meaning when utilization is at 100 usually it only drops with a rise in price SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR CLOV Well lets take a look into the utilization for CLOV CLOV hit 100 amp 37 utilization on June 8th while it ran from 6 28 and after this runup the utilization has stayed at 100 amp 37 only dipping down to 93 amp 37 on June 24th https preview redd it nw0w0mwz9ua71 png width 2529 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 28971f454857effa933ccf136f3a4b911bb2b51b CLOV is currently waiting for a volume increase to start its BIG run up It had a smaller run up about a month ago although just look at the utilization it barely dipped If you go back and look at the other stocks I featured specifically AMC in march you will see that smaller run ups will dip the utilization although until it drops 20 30 the true run up is not done I cannot tell you when the volume increase will come although I can confidently say that if people don t give up on CLOV its going to the moon In my opinion this high of a short interest isn t warranted based on CLOV s fundamentals which you can go read about ew reading back at the top of this DD Not only that but there is SOME potential for a gamma squeeze this week YELLOW volume today RED Open interest BLUE strike price https preview redd it pdqvsxanbua71 png width 804 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 94329b8c790461c4f7a2143287dfc25e90abf76d The call open interest between the 10 and 15 dollar strike price is 100 000 Meaning those contracts will have to be hedged for as the price runs up Hedging is buying pressure by those who sold those contracts to cover their risk Each contract represents 100 shares so millions of shares would have to be bought back in we make it to 15 by the end of this week in between 4 8 mill roughly This is straight buying pressure and doesn t account for anyone else buying stock or more contracts Currently CLOV is sitting at 9 70 in after hours and had almost a ten percent gain in the last hour and a half of todays trading Position July 16 10 calls July 30 10 calls keeping powder dry for volume spike TLDR CLOV is setup to explode with the next volume surge Fundamentally it doesn t deserve to be so shorted The same Utilization trends have been seen is most meme stocks Utilization doesn t usually fall without price going up Currently CLOV has 100 utilization and 35 short interest MOON SOON next volume surge POSSIBLE gamma ramp this week as well NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE THIS IS BASED OFF THE TREND OF 1 STATISTIC AND IGNORES LOTS OF OTHER FACTORS BUT WERE SIMPLE APES SO WHO CARES

stated they are already modestly ahead of expectations on revenue and adjusted EBITDA because of strong booking growth They have a strong product pipeline and are also converting their revenue to BPAAS revenues which hold higher gross margins M amp A They have a strong acquisition streak and their most recent one which was announced recently was the Aon Retiree Health Exchange for America which complements their Choice Health Program The deal terms were beneficial because Aon sold it as they are trying to get their M amp A with Willis Towers approved and they have an anti trust trial they need to get through Product Pipeline in the 2nd Half of 2021 Next Gen Health Wealth and Payroll Cloud Mobile First Workplace App Going For Live Enrollment in the Fall The Numbers They had 96 revenue retention last year to this year and an average of 15 year client tenure for their top 25 customers by revenue They re also diversified by field as companies from all segments need the services provided by Alight 81 of their revenue is recurring Subscription while the rest is project based and the CEO is trying to increase subscription revenues They also expect 50 BPAAS revenue by 2023 which give higher margins and the bundled health benefit BPAAS offers 50 more annual recurring revenue benefits They also have strong FCF and net leverage at a 3x ratio which means they can pursue M amp A safely to grow and it s helpful that there are a large fragmented and global pool of acquisition targets With Bill Foley s experience they ll be able to hone in on the best acquisition targets since he will become the chairman These services can be integrated and cross sold which Alight has already done with its current acquisitions as well They are looking to get 60 gross margin long term and 40 by FYE 2023 Adjusted EBITDA Margin should be 24 in 2023 Expected BPAAS Revenues NOT TOTAL BOOKINGS are 363M 2021E 509M 202E and 743M by 2023E You can see their expectation for how much of that BPAAS revenue will comprise in the deck but to sum it up it s 13 17 23 In addition to margins BPAAS will accelerate implementation and revenue recognition from the current 12 18 months to 6 9 months Total Revenue in 2021 is expected to be 2 76B in 2021 2 945B in 2022 and 3 235B in 2023 Free Cash Flow for 2021 is expected to be 465M 493M in 2022 and 607M in 2023 Which means they can easily service the 300M bond in 2025 and the 1 976B Term Loan in 2026 I know they referenced potentially getting the terms changed so they pay a lower interest rate but I m not sure if they will Regardless after the merger they received 360M to the balance sheet The best part of all this is that they are expected to have net income excluding tax affected shareholder based compensation at a tax rate of 26 in 2021 2023E of 9M at the end of 2021 This includes a one time 76M charge to extinguish their debt post merger and one time restructuring costs regarding the merger which impact 2021 earnings for 44M It also includes IT Optimus Investments which will run through 2021 and 2022 and can be found on page 20 of the slide deck Finally intangible amortization is 201M and Depreciation is 112M They expect Net income of 221M at the end of 2023 Conclusion There are a few AMAZING gems in the shit pile that is SPACS This one is my favorite and I expect a 200 return in 2 3 years because of the stickiness of the model and the cross sell opportunities that this company has as a full service provider the only one for employee benefits and retirement I was thinking of doing another one in a week for another SPAC company that is merging that are good but I need to acquire a strong enough stake in them first For Alight I bought 2 7 5 Calls at an average of 2 43 for Feb 2022 which are nearly in the money I had hoped to buy more but with nearly 10K tied in options on both Cannae and CCS I felt constricted by risk management and so that s what I put in I also have 523 shares in the company I had talked in the yacht club about this company for a few days now and there was a point before today and yesterday where you could have bought the 7 5 calls for Feb and had a breakeven below 9 90 9 95 which is ridiculous considering the NAV price was 10 70 and most SPACS are priced at 10 This is the type of company with the moat growth and operating margins That are expanding that I want The CEO is a rockstar if you look him up There s a strong board and mergers and acquisitions have consistently been good Strong FCF quarterly execution that is coming out the gate strong with a slight beat already and a clear path to GAAP profitability on a net income basis Here you can find the CEO being interviewed on July 6th when the company officially went public Alight Solutions CEO

investment thesis is you can only fire a bullet once Lockheed Martin is aerospace and defense company which provides high end military equipment Aircraft is where they particularly shine with the F 35 accounting for about 30 of the company s revenue The lion s share of the company s revenue comes the united states government Most of all aircraft used by the USAF comes from this one company CEO INFORMATION Lockheed recently announced 2020 a new CEO in 2020 to run the company His name is Jim Taiclet While having several years of experience with Lockheed his previous experience as CEO was not with another defense company Most of his career was spent running the successful REIT known as American Tower AMT The company has been very successful both during and after his tenure Which is another great dividend growth company which shows his experience returning capital and his dedication to increasing shareholder value https www lockheedmartin com en us who we are leadership governance james

BUYBACKS Quarterly Payout 2020 2 60 2019 2 40 2018 2 20 2017 2 00 2016 1 82 2015 1 65 Dividend Yield 2 68 Payout Ratio 40 Very Safe Let me start be saying that this company is EXTREMELY profitable The company is currently on an 18 year consecutive dividend streak Not to mention the company buys back BILLIONS of its own stock year in and year out with the share count having decreased by 50 since 2009 I fully expect this company to be a dividend aristocrat in a few years The dividend yield is about double that of the S amp P as of today and only has a Payout Ratio of about 40 This means that not only does this company have a good yield while buying back stock but this company can EASILY afford to maintain and RAISE the dividend over time dramatically https www google com amp s finance

com stock information dividend history https investors lockheedmartin com stock information dividend history MERGERS amp ACQUISITIONS The company has a long history of M amp A activity and the most recent example of this Aerojet Rocketdyne AJRD This is yet another example of the company using its financial fortress of a balance sheet and exemplary cash flows to acquire other businesses AJRD is a space and aeronautics company which could potentially extend more deals with NASA and the U S government This was recently announced about six months ago in December 2020 and is likely to finalize in 2021 https news lockheedmartin com 2020 12 20 Lockheed Martin to Acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne Strengthening Position as Leading Provider of Technologies to Deter Threats and Help Secure the United States and its Allies https news lockheedmartin com 2020 12 20 Lockheed Martin to Acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne Strengthening Position as Leading Provider of Technologies to Deter Threats and Help Secure the United States and its Allies FINANCIAL INFORMATION The company has incredible financials The balance sheet is a financial fortress The debt load is very controllable Cash flows continue to pour in record numbers year after year and 2021 guidance issued by the company expects record revenue and record EPS for the year The Biden administration just issued an increase in defense spending of about 1 earlier this year All the more reason for this company s financials to continue to stay healthy Financials linked below https finance yahoo com quote LMT balance sheet https finance yahoo com quote

LMT financials p LMT GROWTH STORY MOVING FORWARD LMT is expected to grow top line revenue numbers 4 50 in 2021 and 3 70 in 2022 Earnings per share for the company in 2020 finished at 24 58 This is expected to grow to 26 68 in 2021 and 27 90 in 2022 Contracts are usually signed many years in advance Revenues can be easily forecasted for the next several years due to the timelines of the contracts Furthermore innovation is not only encouraged but expected by shareholders AND the united states military is order for our nation to maintain relevant in terms of weaponry New age military equipment is usually pretty hush hush on what is in the works but Lockheed Martin does disclose some of these new products including technologies such as new highly intelligent drones missile systems and even targeted lasers One thing is for sure the military will continue come out with bigger and more powerful weapons as time goes on Who will likely be selling it to them Probably good ole LMT Newer acquisitions such as the recent AJRD deal allows Lockheed to also focus on other products in the space category and is another wildcard with some potential https finance yahoo com quote LMT analysis p LMT https finance yahoo com quote LMT analysis p LMT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BARRIER TO ENTRY The regulations are incredibly strict The demand for capital is VERY HIGH with projects frequently running into the billions of dollars Switching from one business to another poses risks for the government and our military and are usually avoided This makes the U S government very loyal and sticky to LMT business and this is very likely to continue While there are competitors in the space Lockheed continues to dominate this market VALUATION WHY IT S A GREAT BUY IMO As mentioned earlier the company is expected to produce 27 90 in EPS in 2022 Based of of today s price of 390 this gives this company a forward PE ratio of 13 9 This is an EXTREMELY low forward PE ratio for a company putting up record numbers and dominating the market that it operates in This is even more impressive considering it s still off a fair amount from it s previous all time highs I am very bullish and this is one of my largest positions I am not remotely interested in selling I am buying at these prices or really anything even close to these levels I wouldn t sell a share if this company were to go to 800 a share tomorrow morning https finance yahoo com quote LMT analysis p LMT https finance yahoo com quote LMT analysis p LMT RISK FACTORS TO CONSIDER Almost all revenue comes from one customer the government It is steady and consistent but if the government were to fall out of love with Lockheed then this company would be negatively impacted There aren t many who could take down LMTs throne but their main competitor is Boeing Boeing has the capital and leverage to compete with Lockheed Martin long term This company is susceptible to a number of different geopolitical risks Conflicts with other countries could be both a Negative AND a positive for Lockheed The current political climate is leaning harder and harder towards a more relaxed defense budget

pricing for social media advertising due to the pandemic which led to lower advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue The change in Adjusted EBITDA margin is the result of a decrease in net loss margin which was attributed to increase in revenue and gross profit in 2021 BULL ARGUMENT In 2017 the American Kennel Club stated the cost of owning a dog from a puppy to senior years could range from 14 5K 15 8K while Forbes estimated between 17 6K 93 5K depending on the size of the dog According to the American Veterinary Medical Association in 2018 48 2M or 38 4 of households in the United States owned dogs and the average number owned per household was 1 6 dogs The 2019 2020 American Pet Products Association National Pet Owners Survey showed 67 of U S households owned a pet which equates to 84 9M homes 63 4M of which had dogs The first year the survey was conducted 1988 showed 56 of U S households owned a pet The 2021 State of the Industry presentation on March 24 2021 stated there are more pets today than pre COVID which means more supplies food beds collars leashes toys As a result there was an increase in demand and manufacturers could not produce quickly enough COVID safety protocols meant enhanced cleaning slowing machinery and worker separation among other things Add competition from Amazon and other competitors with enhanced benefits and compensation which made it hard to fill open positions for production workers Supply chain challenges and shortages began February 2020 and demand surged in May for imported products Some challenges continue today and are likely to continue through 2021 and into 2022 such as Ground transportation equipment shortages Fewer ships containers available Container prices increased to 9 10K West coast ports are jammed Overall the demand is real and will not go away anytime soon The increased costs for shipping and raw materials will be passed along Demand from a country full of pent up spending energy has pushed all three ports on the West Coast to record import levels over the past year Of the pet owners in 2020 47 reported they increased the number of times

pet care market size is projected to expand at 6 1 CAGR from 2021 to 2027 This growth will be driven by an increase in animal healthcare expenditure growing pet adoption rising prevalence of food borne and zoonotic diseases and increasing demand for protein in foods The pet food segment accounted for 94 2B and the dog segment held a market share of 41 or 96 5B in 2020 E commerce accounted for 17 of the revenue share in 2020 and is observed as a potential growth driver for the industry Additionally there is a growing shift towards premium food which is boosting industry demand Changes in perception of animals specifically dogs in China and India will result in significant adoptions of dogs in the coming years From 2015 to 2020 the worldwide relative search volume RSV for dog adoption

that are left untouched are medical veterinary expenses For instance Veterinary Care and Product sales are estimated to grow 32 3B or 3 in 2021 Other services such as grooming training boarding and walking pet sitting will account for 9 7B or a growth of 20 Moreover it is a newer company that is still developing the product line when it comes to health In turn it leaves a large chunk of the 6 growth for Supplies Live and over the counter medications as well as a portion of Product sales up for grabs for competitors CONCLUSION I am bullish over the next 12 months What happens after that

point until it is no longer true we have never seen anything like the SPAC boom from the back half of last year and the first few months of this year and that presents all sorts of opportunities So far this year gt 350 SPACs have gone public raising over 10B All of those SPACs will need to find companies to merge with or else their sponsors will lose millions of dollars of risk capital In a typical year 200 normal companies would go public so to have that many SPACs with that much capital searching for deals means that the public markets are going to see companies and industries that traditionally would not have been public ready hit the market as the sponsors get more and more desperate for deals Why does that matter for investors Because there are now hundreds of SPACs looking to merge that s hundreds of new stocks companies that have basically no sellside coverage at the start that investors can due diligence I ve generally been skeptical of SPACs given the poor incentive structure but with that many SPACs out there and reasonably limited coverage it is impossible for me to imagine that someone willing to think creatively and put in work won t be able to find some alpha in SPAC land Traditionally my favorite way to play SPACs has been the simple vanilla way buy SPACs with good sponsors around trus https yetanothervalueblog substack com p how the treb system1

recommending any of these companies nothing on this site is ever investing advice or a recommendation I just wanted to highlight how interesting deSPACs can get because I don t see a lot of people talking about them So the first and maybe best example I want to highlight of deSPACs presenting opportunity is Alight ALIT Alight announced a merger with WPF https www sec gov Archives edgar data

check That s more than 10 of their equity so it s not a small commitment Still when they had the opportunity to increase their commitment at the end of the deSPACing Cannae jumped at it So here you have a sponsor with a great track record committing a material portion of their invested capital into a deal And then several months later when they were offered the opportunity to commit even more they jumped at it amp x200B https preview redd it dujjt90pcva71 png width 1068 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 9bb213955d72a12f985413bc66ce429545fd2a23 Obviously nothing in life is guaranteed Cannae Foley could just be wrong with what they re underwriting at Alight or the business could fail to perform in the future But imagine a different world where Alight was just a normal publicly traded company and Cannae their largest shareholder with a 10 ownership in Alight increased their stake by 10 and bought 1 of Alight s shares on the open market How do you think the market would respond I d guess the stock would go up a nice bit But one week after Cannae did exactly that by buying 5 6m shares of Alight to cover redemptions the stock is trading 10 below what Cannae paid With a normal company value investors would be screaming at each other to look at the opportunity Because Alight is a SPAC no one is talking about that combo yet Here s the other interesting thing because CNNE bought the shares directly from the company normal insider trading rules don t apply I don t mean that in a sketchy way what I mean is that CNNE Foley almost certainly have access to up to the second data on Alight giving they sponsored this deal and will be joining the board https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1809104 000119312521202176 d153572d425 htm Normally if they had that access they wouldn t be able to buy Alight s stock on the open market But because they did redemption guarantee in a negotiated transaction with Alight CNNE can make that deal with full knowledge of exactly how the business is performing So walk through the what if Alight was a normal company scenario I framed earlier again except this time ask yourself how the market would respond if Alight put out a press release saying Cannae is a major shareholder of ours and has access to up to the minute granularity on how our business is performing with that data they ve gone and increased their position in ALIT by 10 by buying 1 of our shares on the open market How would the stock respond to that announcement I m guessing it would go parabolic But in this case ALIT and CNNE basically did just that and the stock dropped 10 Of course it s possible I m wrong on that point Maybe CNNE Foley firewalled themselves off from new information heading into the deal announcement their board seats Perhaps that s

is that CNNE Foley are sponsors with a very good track record and they are not only writing a big check into WPF but actually adding to that bet at prices well above the current levels Maybe WPF is

CNNE isn t just the SPAC sponsor a borderline insider buying shares of ALIT on the open market through covering redemptions CNNE is all of that plus an investor with a good track record in the space

the great stock CLNE was apeified a little bit ago This DD isn t about some crazy ladder climb short delta theta jump Howdy As we all know CLNE has been trading flatter than your wife for the better portion of a month now However I think that is all about to change Also I think it has actually been a good thing that the flatness has been getting tighter and tighter each day seriously CLNE moved like 5 cents back and forth today Before I get into why it s about to run here s some background on why CLNE is an amazing company especially at 9 WHAT THE FUCK DOES CLNE DO Clean Energy Fuels CLNE is in the business of creating Renewable Natural Gas out of organic waste Cow shit and other shit Renewable Natural Gas is one of the best bridges to move into green energy EV s Hydrogen Solar all are not prepared to power the worlds trucking fleets despite their claims They are in fact years away It is exponentially cheaper to convert a long haul trucking rig to natural gas than to buy an EV rig If you re an average trucker your truck is where pretty much all your money and value is stored It would be bonkers to buy a new EV vs to spend the 20 000 to convert your current rig to Nat gas Clean Energy Fuels already fuels more than 250 000 vehicles with RNG daily This isn t some start up or nonsense gravity truck firm looking at you NKLA They have over 570 stations across North America already CLNE is fervently building new stations at a breakneck pace What that really amounts to is a substantial lead over any competitor Which really means that you d have to either use them or buy them out to try outpace them at their current rate Renewable Natural Gas is good for the planet also I know this is a stock presentation what is the environment but hold on The current administration in the USA and honestly the next ones too if they want the youth vote are highly motivate to shift to green solutions But they have to deal with the people who will drag their feet and won t want to spend millions on all new green solutions RNG is the perfect bridge between the two You can convert your trucks your mail delivery fleet whatever all to RNG much cheaper than buying a new one Renewable Natural Gas reduces carbon emissions especially on big trucks by a minimum of 70 CLNE is committed to reducing that to 0 by 2025 This makes it highly likely to be chosen as a green solution Methane is 20 of greenhouse gas emissions so it s a double whammy stopping two sources of pollution Finally CLNE already has contracts with big companies The ever so touted Amazon contract is one of them UPS already has a contract with them They are the largest provider in California s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program People are coming aboard before they re forced to convert a much higher price California especially is stopping a lot of non green shipping but that s a whole other rabbit hole There has been institutional buying of the stock over the past month and before as these prices are a steal WAIT WASN T THERE A BIG SELL OFF EARLIER OMFG That was Total taking a profit on their shares they bought for next to nothing years ago It has already been announced over the twitter that they

is also following a similar drop and spike pattern as from May to June suggesting another upward jump coming CLNE has consistently bounced off the 200 SMA which suggests that that will stay a strong support So 9 is a pretty safe entry point to buy some long dated options at and a downright boomer safe entry point if you re buying shares Over the last 6 months we ve stayed trading above 8 and

CLNE to run The first the more unlikely and the more ape like option tbf is that CLNE starts to rally as it did near the June option expiry This sent CLNE to a spike of 14 60 ish If CLNE gains the interest of an institution looking to start getting foolish or becomes back in favor to fickle fools then CLNE would already jump past where we we ve been holding for weeks and your investment would already be profitable or it would set up to become more profitable in the real run to come for July Expiring option dates have generally been good to CLNE based on past performance The more realistic route is that the options all expire OTM This seems bad and indeed is for those option holders but would actually still be good for CLNE After we are finally away from an option expiry CLNE can begin its run to August earnings It has been announced that there will be a conference call immediately following the earnings report Now Clean Energy Fuels usually likes to wait to announce big deals for their earnings They got very close with their Amazon deal to the May earnings call 15 ish days That sent CLNE jumping up to the near 20 s price I think there is a high level of anticipation for this earnings call While I personally believe a new contract will be announced I think new expanded UPS deal but that s pure speculation so is not necessarily relevant in a DD besides that is SEEMS like it ll happen haha I think the belief of institutions and the average buyer that CLNE wants to announce a deal will cause CLNE to run up until earnings CLNE already has received interest as a top trending stock on reddit among other places and the CEO went on Cramer and roused some interest there There is also a suspicion that there might be more to the Amazon deal as he stated that he couldn t go much more into it as Amazon wanted to talk more about it So I think the belief of an Amazon deal or belief of a new contract will fuel CLNE to run until earnings After earnings is anybody s guess especially depending on the conference call However it is an easy run up to earnings as I think most people including analysts below expect it to be pretty great Also with the temptation of a new contract it will double the general excitement leading up to earnings Earnings will also most likely be good Most people panic at CLNE s past earnings with just a glance but they almost always are 0 00 because they reinvest every penny into building more RNG stations just furthering their lead in the sector So even if CLNE holds on to 0 01 for the quarter it will be gangbusters in terms of their earnings which makes it very easy for CLNE to smash earnings amp x200B https preview redd it 1xo3of4meva71 png width 644 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3363ca2c18ebd48e86c517dde7044826e9808607 Analysts have high projections for CLNE for the next 12 months Even the lowest is 2 above close and the median is 20 There is clear real belief in the stock besides just WSB think Most analysts put it at a buy rating because it is criminally undervalued TL DR CLNE will have a a gangbusters run up to earnings after 7 16 options expire or an even higher climb if they somehow expire ITM due to sentiment and belief that CLNE will announce new contracts have an even okay earnings report CLNE is also an extremely safe bet at these levels as it has consistently held them Personal price target 18 the day before August 5th earnings POSITIONS 500 Shares 80 ish September 20 calls 5 7 16 13 calls and 5 7 16 12 calls the July ones are just for fun FD gambling
