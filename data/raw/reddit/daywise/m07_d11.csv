2021 03 29 virtu ceo doug cifu explains payment for order flow and the future of hft and tell me you don t want to own this business Recently decided to take a position in it after my DD which I will share below The Business VIRT is classified as a Financial stock but I really think it s a tech stock They basically pay a bunch of really smart developers engineers and data scientists to design and run fully automated trading systems that provide liquidity across thousands of different stocks currencies bonds commodities in hundreds of different marketplaces As well as that they offer a trading platform to businesses with sophisticated trading requirements hedge funds banks airlines energy utilities commodity corps etc to execute and analyse trades Quoting from the most recent Quarterly https s21 q4cdn com 422114427 files doc financials 2021 q1 Virtu Financial Inc Earnings Release 2021 Q1 1 pdf gt The Company has two operating segments Market Making and Execution Services gt Market Making principally consists of market making in the cash futures and options markets across global equities options fixed income currencies and commodities As a market maker the Company commits capital on a principal basis by offering to buy securities from or sell securities to broker dealers banks and institutions Think of Market Making like the guy who punches your ticket when you go on a ride at the fair Every time you want to go on the YOLOcoaster if VIRT is doing a good job they get to be the one to punch your ticket More and more types of market trading are impossible to profit from compared to 30 years ago when you could go long above some moving average and exit a week later for a nice profit Market Making is one of the few profitable trading games left in town and it has the nice property of making more money when markets are volatile or volumes are high Buying VIRT gets you ownership in a successful business that makes money doing trading that is impossible for someone to do from their basement on Robinhood VIRT has to compete for this against other market makers like Citadel or Susquehanna but if they re good then make a tiny little bit of money in every trade they successfully compete on Hopefully lightbulbs are starting to go off The more WSB and Robinhood and weekly YOLO options keep growing the more opportunities for VIRT to compete and make tiny slices of money selling you AMC calls or whatever the next thing is Aside from all the usual stuff they make markets in there was also a recent announcement they are going to partner with Pyth Network https ir virtu com press releases press release details 2021 Virtu Financial Joins Pyth Network as Newest Partner default aspx to start operating in cr ptocurrencies as well Now cr pto markets are probably the least efficient in the world so firms like VIRT can really make some hay while the sun is shining there gt Execution Services comprises agency based trading and trading venues offering execution services in global equities options futures and fixed income on behalf of institutions banks and broker dealers The Company also provides proprietary technology and infrastructure workflow technology and trading analytics services to select third parties Market Making is definitely the biggest chunk of their earnings but Execution Services definitely seems like it s really growing approaching 20 of total revenues and now over 20 of their Adjusted Net Trading Income their preferred measure of earnings and is a much more high margin business as well This is light the white glove part of their business where some investment bank or whatever might not sneeze at paying millions of dollars to get some analytics on how their traders are executing on the NYSE or some endowments wants to get out of a big position in a dark liquidity pool without show volume on the exchange There are many other interesting use cases and tools of Execution Services listed here https www virtu com solutions execution A nice little side hustle for VIRT with big potential because it has a much higher profit margin 80 of revenues go to into ANTI here and much less competition If they can grow this it ll be a big deal and I feel like right now the market trades VIRT as if it was just doing Market Making so you are kind of getting Execution Services for free Fundamentals I don t do my own fundamental analysis but rather I get my numbers from NewConstructs https www newconstructs com who s analysts go through Annual and Quarterly reports and with the help of machine learning tools make adjustments to generate more accurate fundamental numbers If you have an Interactive Brokers account you can get the info for a particular stock by going to the News tab of the stock without needing a NewConstructs account But I m going to share some of their most recent analysis of VIRT below anyway Below information is from the VIRT Forensic Stock Earnings amp Valuation report released July 1 2021 Ranks in 98th percentile of 2800 stocks covered Ranks 9th out of 427 financial sector stocks covered Their economic EPS https www newconstructs com education education close the loopholes education economic earnings measure is 8 56 vs reported EPS of 6 So their analysts think that VIRT has even better earnings than GAAP earnings report Their economic book value per share https www newconstructs com education economic book value of 325 So you can pay 28 today for what their analysts view as worth 325 ROIC gt 50 vs WACC 5 FCF yield near 15 Growth Appreciation Period https www newconstructs com growth appreciation period lt 1 year Quoting NewConstructs here gt at VIRT s current stock price the market is expecting almost no profit growth over the remainder of the company s life As a result expectations in VIRT s price are very conservative Rated Very Attractive the highest rating https www newconstructs com stock rating methodology All that to say VIRT is a phenomenal business with megacap tech stock like ROIC and FCF values And you can buy it today for less than a tenth of what it s worth The company is paying a decent dividend every year since listing and they ve been using some profits to do buybacks since Nov 2020 of about 150 million As of the most recent Quarterly they still have 319 million 6 of the current market cap available to keep doing buybacks until May 4 2022 Risks The price was recently trending up around 30 and got the big 10 smack down when Gary Gensler came out in June and said he was reviewing payment for order flow a k a PFOF https www cnbc com 2021 06 09 cnbc exclusive cnbc transcript sec chairman gary gensler speaks with cnbcs the exchange today html Now I think the market has this wrong Because Firstly I don t think PFOF will go away PFOF is how Robinhood and other brokers are offering commission free trading If Gensler bans it he would be smashing the business model that all the big brokers and Robinhood have adopted Who s going to want to start paying commissions again after it was free Secondly even if PFOF goes away what does that mean for VIRT Market Making doesn t disappear it s still essential So they shed some costs by not having to pay to get the order flow and now it s just pure competition between them and other Market Makers for that business Listen to the CEO on OddLots linked up the top and see how he talks about their competitive position Another major risk is that all markets globally go into a low volume low volatility period because this is the least profitable environment for Market Making But I think this risk is mitigated by the valuation Even if there is a big decline in the business and everything is halved their ROIC would be 25 FCF yield 7 economic book value 150 Second opinions Here

what the fuck even is ATNF 180 Life Sciences is developing new treatments for one of the world s biggest drivers of disease inflammation The company consists of three programs developing novel drugs for treating distinct inflammatory diseases These programs are led by world leading scientists at prestigious universities who have already developed blockbuster drugs and made ground breaking discoveries in their fields One of the programs is conducting a phase 2b 3 trial and expects its first results in Q4 2021 Other clinical trials are expected to begin by the end of 2021 Their biggest and most important program is the Fibrosis Anti TNF hence their ticker ATNF Now I know all you feckless twats don t know what TNF is SO Wikipedia to the goddamn rescue A TNF inhibitor is a pharmaceutical drug that suppresses the physiologic response to tumor necrosis factor TNF which is part of the inflammatory response TNF is involved in autoimmune and immune mediated disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis ankylosing spondylitis inflammatory bowel disease psoriasis hidradenitis suppurativa and refractory asthma so TNF inhibitors may be used in their treatment The important side effects of TNF inhibitors include lymphomas infections especially reactivation of latent tuberculosis congestive heart failure demyelinating disease a lupus like syndrome induction of auto antibodies injection site reactions and systemic side effects 1 amp x200B The global market for TNF inhibitors in 2008 was 13 5 billion 2 and 22 billion in 2009 3 Do you see that shit up there Fucking 22 Billion in 2009 and that shit boomed to 39 billion in 2020 More people more market Here s a look at the pipeline it s been adjusted further out which sucks a bit but that s how these clinical stage companies

at the University of Oxford in the UK The team is led by Professor Jagdeep Nanchahal a surgeon scientist who has been running the phase 2b 3 trials and Professor Sir Marc Feldmann a renowned

theglobeandmail com investing markets inside the market article reaching a peak the economic rebound is topping out and stocks are at Reaching a peak The economic rebound is topping out and stocks are at risk Sometime soon the Great Reopening will hit its high water mark and the groundswell of growth now underway will crest and begin to recede In the moment it can be difficult to pinpoint the peak obscured as it is by all the noise chaos and euphoria generated by the revival of the global economy as normal daily life gradually returns around the world But the peak is coming if it hasn t happened already Nothing is likely to change dramatically at least not right away As long as the COVID 19 pandemic continues to fade an economic boom of historic proportions should keep gaining traction Policy makers will undoubtedly maintain extraordinary levels of support for the economy and financial markets Growth in GDP corporate earnings and manufacturing activity should continue on at lofty levels at least by prepandemic standards Once the tipping point is hit however the pace of change will begin to slow Growth will remain positive but it will decelerate The problem is that even with growth at a very high level we re going to now experience a reduction said Frances Donald global chief economist and global head of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife Investment Management And for markets it s often not the level of growth but the change in growth that can be most powerful There are a variety of ways a cyclical peak can be defined and measured including peak growth peak liquidity and peak macroeconomic support But they more or less tend to coincide with one another and none of them are positive signals for the stock market When the preponderance of growth indicators starts to decline history suggests that investors on average take that as a cue to start reducing risk It s also around that time that the outlook for market index returns typically dims The challenge now is to find areas that have not yet reached peak Ms Donald said If it feels far too soon to be discussing peak anything when the reopening is just getting started in many countries including Canada this is part of the great contradiction of pandemic era investing Even in the nascent stages of a formidable economic boom it s entirely possible for the investing climate to worsen There can be a great deal of daylight between financial markets and the broader economy The first wave of COVID 19 in early 2020 made that abundantly clear Amidst the economic devastation and human tragedy of the worst pandemic in 100 years stock markets worldwide plunged initially then staged a comeback for the ages The most rewarding time to buy equities is typically when sentiment is gloomy and macro fundamentals are crumbling Paul O Connor head of the multi asset team at Janus Henderson Investors wrote in a note Late March 2020 would certainly qualify as life under lockdown was just beginning and a depression scale economic shock was dawning An investor with the nerve to sink money into the Canadian stock market at that point for example would have been rewarded with gains now sitting at nearly 80 per cent On a global scale the MSCI All Country World Index took just six months from the start of the crisis to revisit its prepandemic high In the United States the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite Index made a full recovery from the pandemic sell off more than a year ago and has added another 48 per cent or so since then Three momentous forces have combined to nourish such an incredible bull run the unleashing of central banks full firepower in unison the steady drumbeat of towering economic results and the development and rollout of highly effective COVID 19 vaccines For the past year or so virtually all the data that influence financial markets have moved in one direction upward and aggressively so Consider U S GDP After a disastrous collapse of 31 4 per cent at an annualized rate in the second quarter of 2020 the American economy snapped back with comparable ferocity to the upside This pattern marks the sharpest economic V in history with its deep recession and rapid recovery both contained within just five quarters Jeffrey Kleintop the chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab amp Co Inc wrote in a recent note Third quarter U S GDP grew by 33 4 per cent doubling the previous post Second World War record set in 1950 That is a difficult number for investors to evaluate especially in contrast to the 2 per cent rate of growth the U S economy averaged over the previous decade Likewise on the corporate earnings front In the first quarter of this year Standard amp Poor s 500 Index companies collectively grew their profits by 53 per cent over the prior year according to Refinitiv data Embedded in that number however is a base effect which inflates growth rates when compared to depressed conditions last year This is also known as an easy comp and it s one factor that makes it difficult to get a true reading of underlying growth As a result consensus forecasts have repeatedly missed actual results by a wide margin on everything from inflation to retail sales to individual company earnings One of the biggest challenges for market strategists right now is that our data is extraordinarily distorted Ms Donald said Investors haven t had to worry too much about the absolute numbers however so long as the data has moved in a positive direction What s a few percentage points give or take when considered against an era defining economic resurgence Up until recently you still had easy comps reopening was all in front of us China s credit impulse was all positive and we weren t really worried about supply chain construction yet said Ashley Misquitta senior portfolio manager at Empire Life Investments It s certainly less unabashedly positive now than it was There is momentum still building on the public health front with more than 3 3 billion vaccine doses already administered worldwide But the major financial and monetary catalysts are showing indications of losing power It is becoming increasingly difficult for the economy to surprise to the upside The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index which measures the extent to which the data is ahead of or behind expectations is barely in positive territory having plummeted from a record high set last July It is clear that the most explosive period of growth has come and gone Eric Lascelles chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management wrote in a report The U S economy s second quarter growth rate is expected to come in at about 9 per cent annualized The consensus forecast for subsequent quarters predicts steadily declining but still positive rates of expansion A similar path is expected for U S corporate earnings which should hit a peak in the second quarter with 65 per cent profit growth moderating to 25 per cent and 17 per cent in the final two quarters of the year according to Refinitiv estimates Other key metrics are also showing signs of topping out China s credit impulse which measures new lending as a proportion of the economy has turned sharply lower in recent months As a crucial buyer of resources including 60 per cent of base metals worldwide China s credit activity can have a big impact on global demand Meanwhile the manufacturing sector s blistering comeback is starting to lose steam Data firm IHS Markit reported a U S manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index value of 62 1 for June tied with May for the highest reading on record for this measure of factory activity but lower than an earlier flash estimate of 62 6 The survey also found that manufacturers are struggling mightily to secure raw materials with the global supply chain clogged up and they are having trouble finding qualified workers When the manufacturing sector cools off as many observers believe it will from here the stock market tends to follow suit One year returns for the S amp P 500 Index following a manufacturing PMI peak are less than 3 per cent on average according to the Janus Henderson report Why the connection between manufacturing activity and stock market performance Because around the same time growth peaks central bankers are getting started on the process of withdrawing stimulus Martin Roberge a portfolio strategist at Canaccord Genuity wrote in a report In other words investors de risk portfolios as the liquidity impulse turns negative Mr Roberge said So add another peak to the list peak liquidity By now every major central bank has indicated plans to slowly ease off the gas pedal According to Janus Henderson the total level of global quantitative easing is expected to decline to US 0 4 trillion next year down from US 8 5 trillion in 2020 And of the 23 interest rate change decisions made by central banks around the world in 2021 up to early June 19 of them were rate hikes Mr Roberge said So the point of peak macro support is here or perhaps already in the rear view mirror That doesn t necessarily pose an immediate threat to the bull market Given the continuing pandemic history may be an imperfect guide in charting the path ahead Policy makers will have to be mindful of what s happening around the world with the pandemic That could allow them to let things run a little hotter than through other economic cycles when you didn t have this looming level of uncertainty said Lesley Marks chief investment officer at Mackenzie Investments Peak growth also doesn t mean growth is peaking everywhere at the same time Additional support for stocks should come from corporate share buybacks for example which are expected to surge in the second half of the year Canada s big banks in particular are sitting on billions of dollars in extra cash some of which will be paid out to shareholders in the form of dividend increases and or buybacks once regulators allow it Additionally certain sectors such as energy are well positioned to benefit from the continuing global reopening Manulife s Ms Donald said If we are at an inflection point in the economic story it could mean we need to get a little bit more clever about our stock and our sector selection

own opinion but I did some intense deep research into each and every industry and tried to make this post as objective and accurate as possible I hope you get something out of this In general In high interest rates bonds do better and stocks do worse than in lower interest rates High interest rates means more difficulty growing It also implies the risk free rate is high so bond yields must rise with it in order to have any demand for corporate paper Basic Materials The interest rate to commodity price index is inverted This is because the demand for commodities falls with the level of economic activity This can be seen quite clearly by comparing a chart of interest rates with commodity prices The implications of high interest rates are divided across the industry Commodity producers will have more difficulty staying profitable and expanding operations Cash generation will be severely strained Commodity buyers on the other hand will find that expenses are much lower and it easier to get competitive prices There are some material producers that will suffer less than others In general smaller companies suffer more because the larger ones are more capable of providing the most competitive prices Communication services Communications services do well in low interest rates and tend to struggle in higher rates This sector is generally the most overpriced and most leveraged Stock prices in this sector may decrease more than the average market does In addition to lower stock prices companies that require a lot of leverage will have difficulty expanding or continuing operations Established companies that have less capital intensive operations will fare much better but still won t be able to come up with the same revolutionary technologies that come from lower interest rate environments Technology This sector is unique because it is much newer and has not been exposed to high interest rates If the current environment of startups are extended many startups will find difficulty finding funding and small companies with high debt will face similar problems For larger companies a unique situation is presented These companies are known for constant acquisitions and with high interest rates all of the talent in niche tech businesses will suddenly look much more attractive It is possible that the mega cap tech companies will be nearly unaffected because of their massive operating cash flows that are vital to normal life Many companies in tech have become very large with a low interest rate for the entirety of their existence It is possible that these companies suffer more than older companies of similar operations and size because of a lack of experience operating at higher interest rates Industrials These companies have mixed implications On one end commodities and other material input are cheaper but on the other end there is less demand for industrial products in an economic slowdown Revenue and cost of goods sold could be expected to decrease creating smaller more profitable businesses A nice way to think about this is to examine the airplane manufacturing industry in a high interest rate environment The manufacturer can acquire the materials and possibly prefabs for the plane for cheaper The gross margin on the individual plane is higher as a result but in the general economy consumer activity is lower so there is less traveling and a resulting lower demand for aircraft Health Care Health care is much less volatile than the average market because the demand for healthcare services is mostly disjoint from economic activity The main concerns in health care are shared with the rest of the economy mostly issues arising in debt refinancing and upgrading or acquiring fixed assets Utilities Utilities generally under perform in high interest rates They take on more debt require consistent servicing of fixed assets and are slower to increase revenue than other industries When operating conditions are staying similar utility costs for consumers are not increasing much and interest rates are high utilities have a much more difficult time covering capex and depreciation Consumer staples Consumer staples are historically less volatile than most of the market Consumers may not be buying luxury goods or a second home at high interest rates but like healthcare consumer staples are not things that are optional for most people Most Consumers are not going to stop purchasing food and toiletries just because their variable rate debts are becoming more costly Finance Finance tends to do well in high interest rate environments They are able to write higher rate loans and demand for loans increases Insurance historically issued higher premiums Financial firms can be viewed as the most obvious beneficiaries of high interest rates at the cost of most other industries

investments GME AMC BB BBBY CLOV SPCE RKT WOOF ,Did you come to Wallstreetbets today to read a novel We ll you ve come to right post friend This hot off the presses steaming pile of trash has it all charts and text With a side of disappointment and shattered dreams All for the low price of wasting time you didn t need anyway amp x200B Table of Contents Part 1 The Meme Demystified Part 2 The Meme Charts 1 GME 2 AMC 3 BB 4 BBBY 5 CLOV 6 SPCE Part 3 The U S S Failboat 1 RKT 2 WOOF Part 4 The Week Ahead amp x200B Part 1 The Meme Demystified My basic thesis for the meme stocks is that they are all following a relatively similar and somewhat predictable pattern There was a recent post here that claimed all the meme stocks were totally different plays This is wrong In fact they are all basically the same play with some variation Here is a list of the essential elements of the meme stock pattern amp x200B 1 Memes This just boils down to retail attention DDs memes ppl posting stupid yolos etc 2 Option wizardry Seeing there is a new thing over on the ol internets and it s going up some big money motherfuckers starting buying call options in stupid quantities forcing market makers to hedge the thing then happens 3 Diamond handing A bunch of idiots catch a case of FOMO and pile into the stock at terrible prices then once they re sitting on devastating losses they say to themselves you know I always believed in this company and promptly declare they are diamond handed apes and they ll never sell 4 Higher low The refusal to sell by the retards brilliant new investors who see value that others don t causes the rapidly falling stock price to stabilize at a new higher low proving the case that their diamond handing actually did something 5 Go back to 1 and repeat for another leg higher amp x200B Looking at the charts in the next part it s my contention that the higher low should be at the same level the stock broke out of on the prior move In other words spike drop to breakout stabilize there spike again drop to second breakout stabilize there repeat until lambo SPCE is an example of a case were the stock fell all the way back down after it s early year breakouts but I m not sure it ever properly fit the pattern There s no fucking pattern dipshit TA doesn t work on meme stocks It s just randomness I hear you typing in your comment I see a pattern in these moves Further the underlying mechanism of call option wizardry appears the same as well GME part 1 notwithstanding As does the effect of diamond handing amp x200B Part 2 The Meme Charts First let me say the State of the Memes this week is wounded As the charts show across the board except SPCE the whole of Memelandia got pretty well beat to shit Starting with GME GME https preview redd it ukgcqozlnma71

stages of a break down of the pattern You can fiddle around with were you think Launch 4 should be drawn and put it around 195 then squint and turn you head a little to the right and everything will look just dandy Is GME dead No Just wounded Get back up into the Support Zone 4 and it s game on amp x200B Next AMC Processing img dbivb5gkoma71 AMC is that weird kid you went to school with He was nice enough but it was always a little awkward to hang out with him Like you were never quite sure what he was going to do say next The reason underlying this is likely the fact that y all bought damn near the whole company already Is AMC dead No It s a weirdo that I expect should drop all the way back to 14 54 before finding support But at this point it could literally do anything Except go up again That s definitely not happening until we get some kind of consolidation somewhere amp x200B Everyone s favorite Canadian BB Oh Canada https preview redd it 6haay06epma71 png width 1570 amp

but you weren t going to pick her sober Is BB dead No We ve broken under Support Zone 3 or 2 if you don t want to count the Dec jump as a proper meme launch However we haven t completely collapsed and

it just got kicked straight in the nuts and is lying on the ground writhing in pain wondering why a girl that likes you would kick you in the balls to show that she likes you The 9 mark is basically

SPCE dead Of course not Branson survived and that means SPCE is going to be just fine Still I think a retrace back to 40 looking for support would not be unwarranted amp x200B Part 3 The U S S

was bad across the board for everyone not in SPCE or somehow someway for reasons I ll never understand holding NEGG It s not over yet though Wounded is not dead Hell even dead can just be mostly dead That s what the Princess Bride taught me and I ve learned everything I know from movies so it must be true However a stand must be made A line in the sand must be drawn Someone somewhere needs to stand up and say enough is enough We are human beings just oversized children god damnit If we have another week of across the board bleeding shit has the potential to go south and fast On top of it this coming week has a bunch of options expiring because monthlys Expect maximum pressure When you ve got your opponent on his back foot you don t let off you hit harder If they smell blood in the water and the charts look to me like blood in the water they are going to try to finish the job and obliterate the Defenders of Memelandia once and for all Do I honestly think the whole of the Suits is some cabal that would like to see this crazy ass party stop No I m quite sure a bunch of them are on the long side of these moves They are the Options Wizards But there are definitely some that want this boat roll over and if it looks like they can do it then they go for it amp x200B Good luck and may the lambos be with you amp x200B Positions or ban CLOV amp F a fateful pairing https

SERIOUS runup within the next couple months if you don t like rocket emojis large price increases or DD created by an idiot keep scrolling For everyone else lets begin Recently I have been looking into the utilization rates of different stocks throughout their run ups For those of you who don t know what the utilization rate is Utilization is defined as loaned shares divided by available shares in the securities lending market expressed as a percentage If utilization is high or maxed out at 100 it means that pretty much all shares that are available to be loaned out at that current time are loaned out presumably to be shorted I will be using ORTEX to view this data and they get roughly 2 3 of the securities lending data so take the numbers with a grain of salt Utilization basically represents the demand to short a stock the higher the percentage means higher demand and this can be bearish for lots of stocks although for MEME stocks this has NOT been the case in fact it has seemingly provided rocket fuel Ultimately I have found that utilization has been an important indicator to tell if stocks have the ability for incredibly large price increases and when those price increases are over After analyzing these trends I have reason to believe CLOV could within the next couple months have a large run up RELEASE THE ROCKETS Firstly lets take a fundamental look into CLOV https www reddit com r CLOV comments ofzwnx clov fundamental analysis https www reddit com r CLOV comments ofzwnx clov fundamental analysis Author u anjuna freak https www reddit com user anjuna freak I don t want to rewrite this so go read that if you want to read up on CLOV s fundamentals i know most of you don t get your tits jacked by fundamentals but that s okay neither do I Lets continue Now let s look into the utilization rate of different stocks and how that has related to stock price in the past These stocks also had high short interest although I wanted to keep the graphs as simple as possible for the apes s Firstly let s look at GameStop GME These graphs show utilization as a percentage YELLOW price candles RED GREEN and volume BLUE GameStop was at 100 amp 37 utilization beginning on September 4th 2020 at a price of 9 20 https preview redd it nf4q2ck06na71 png width 1603 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 38b2dc0be089e1613eaa79f61460b45fed6e0386 we being to see volume pickup around Jan 12th for GME and the price increases to 20 then over the next couple weeks GME rockets to a high of 485 During all of this the utilization stays at 100 amp 37 BUT one week later from that price high we see utilization drop to 69 amp 37 and price drop over 50 amp 37 https preview redd it jmduti757na71 png width 1546 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 4e57f88e5c643addcf6ac94afba2f15974b56559 What trend do we see We see our peak price while utilization is high and a 20 30 utilization drop following our peak The drop in utilization is ultimately the indicator to tell us the run up is done for now The price throughout all of January was increasing heavily but had no effect on utilization this run up only ended once utilization fell steeply GME is a much simpler stock to look at because it was so heavily shorted that its utilization was much more stable at above 100 But now lets take a look at AMC we see a very similar situation Utilization hits 100 amp 37 in Mid April price action remains fairly calm until May 24th we see a volume pickup and the run up begins The price increases from 12 to a high of 72 on June 2nd We see utilization fall after June 2nd from 99 100 amp 37 to roughly 79 amp 37 During this time the price falls https preview redd it 7oosrk1y9na71 png width 1588 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 789dac1fbc378006357127009d3d3903664ef0f7 Once again we see utilization being the indicator that our runup is over despite some large red and green days during the run up the utilization still stays solid it is only when the utilization falls significantly roughly 20 30 that we have hit a price peak Now lets take a look at AMC a couple months earlier in March where it had another runup March 5th utilization hits 100 amp 37 AMC price increases roughly 50 amp 37 in next two days The utilization then falls and price continues to rise for a week or two This runup was small although we see the same trend of utilization only decreasing with a strong price increase We then see utilization return to 100 amp 37 in late April leading up to the huge May24th June2nd run up Keep in mind that in this example utilization falls but returns very quick which to me says that another run up is viable and that is exactly what happened https preview redd it 7w8tgu8bcna71 png width 858 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3f2ff85e733c2a2d1d0f8f03add30664dd44681d Now lets take a look at SNDL another stock with a very similar run up In January SNDL has a utilization of 100 amp 37 at a price of 0 50 From January 27th February 11th the utilization stayed in the high 90 s only coming down to 88 amp 37 for a short period During this same period the price went from 1 00 to 4 00 We see utilization fall on February 18th down to 58 amp 37 and this is ultimately the end of the runup confirmed https preview redd it by9ealxvgna71 png width 1592 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 2a5f8d74797e7d01c876335879e381bc6e5378ea I m including SNDL s run up because it shows the same trend Utilization hits 100 it stays at least above around 90 until a huge price runup Then shortly after the utilization drops significantly to roughly 50 70 and the run up is over Finally lets take a look at SPCE In December 2020 SPCE hits 100 amp 37 utilization In late January volume picks up and a run up begins Price goes from 24 63 while utilization sits at over 95 amp 37 Utilization then falls sharply down to 60 amp 37 after hitting its run up high of 63 Utilization in April goes from 60 amp 37 back to high 90 amp 37 s and once again the price surges from 24 now to roughly 40 https preview redd it z43lvjjnjna71 png width 1585 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 77dbae6670b0a295a016e2b345db1b28131c9e7b Of course SPCE has had some fundamental drivers as well but its utilization price trend stays consistent with all the other runups TLDR Almost all large meme stock runups have begun with utilization at 100 and a large volume increase Utilization appears to act inversely with price meaning when utilization is at 100 usually it only drops with a rise in price SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR CLOV Well lets take a look into the utilization for CLOV CLOV hit 100 amp 37 utilization on June 8th while it ran from 6 28 and after this runup the utilization has stayed at 100 amp 37 only dipping down to 93 amp 37 on June 24th https preview redd it tkxy3a6tnna71 png width 2686 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0be1457b866d5d84386eb4bff7bc971d6b8b371d CLOV is currently waiting for a volume increase to start its BIG run up It had a smaller run up about a month ago although just look at the utilization it barely dipped If you go back and look at the other stocks I featured specifically AMC in march you will see that smaller run ups will dip the utilization although until it drops 20 30 the true run up is not done I cannot tell you when the volume increase will come although I can confidently say that if people don t give up on CLOV its going to the moon Also who doesn t like seeing 35 amp 37 short interest To put this into perspective AMC had a maximum of 19 amp 37 short interest https preview redd it w6pb59xbuna71 png width 139 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e0de4f0b7a3e690710a10daa1a4cf0ee6df4aa4b In my opinion this high of a short interest isn t warranted based on CLOV s fundamentals which you can go read about ew reading back at the top of this DD TLDR CLOV is setup to explode with the next volume surge Fundamentally it doesn t deserve to be so shorted The same Utilization trends have been seen is most meme stocks Utilization doesn t usually fall without price going up Currently CLOV has 100 utilization and 35 short interest MOON SOON next volume surge NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE THIS IS BASED OFF THE TREND OF 1 STATISTIC AND IGNORES LOTS OF OTHER FACTORS But that s what 99 of our stock picks come from so who cares

a Growth Stocks Average Cost Investing Invest 50 of the Total Money you wish to invest in a stock gt then Average Cost Invest incremental amounts on a monthly basis if the price drops below your cost basis ,The stock market is a mechanism for transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient I have been investing for a long time now I don t have all the answers but I have become very successful gaining my financial independence as an investor in both growth and growth amp income investments What follows is my experience in investing in growth stocks I invested in PLUG back in 2013 now with an average cost of 1 51 per share because I thought the company had large scaling growth potential in multiple markets similar to HMBL PLUG spiked high very high then the shorts jumped all over it spreading FUD daily infiltrating message boards and spreading false amp misleading views even into the financial news media to the point that hit piece articles were published almost daily giving a constant negative biased slant I held firm I never sold 1 share for SEVEN LONG YEARS not one of the 16 271 shares I acquired in 2013 Guess what happened Finally in 2020 after holding for seven very long years PLUG POWER s fundamentals gained traction and the revenues soared HUMBL s revenues could soar even higher I gained in excess of 1 3 Million on that investment because I was patient It has since pulled back in price but the long term fundamental growth of PLUG is more solid than ever Important to note During the long 7 year hold time PLUG POWER never had 5 Billion in Cash to execute upon their strategic growth plans That s right gt In 2021 PLUG POWER has 5 Billion in Cash gt and PLUG POWER is executing on their growth plans to build a Rochester New York Gigafactory and also build a Green Hydrogen Generation Plant Network throughout the USA I plan to hold PLUG for the long term because I see the long term scaling growth potential PLUG POWER manufacturing costs are expected to be lowered by 50 on economies of scale benefits Gigafactory LGH2 Plant Network I project my investment in PLUG will be worth approximately 17 Million in the next 5 years gt based upon PLUG POWER having a sustained CAGR of 50 Top Line Revenue Growth gt propelling PLUG up to 1 100 00 per share Several days back I began buying HMBL gt because I see a company with large scaling growth potential in multiple scalable markets My first purchase was for 50 000 shares The share price immediately dropped and I smiled saying to myself it wants me to buy more So I have continued to accumulate more HMBL shares because I see the exact same parallels to the prior investment in PLUG stock HUMBL the company has the same large scaling growth potential in multiple markets and the top line revenue growth is increasing rapidly via acquisitions in the ticketing sector HUMBL just recently acquired a Hollywood Creative Studio MONSTER LA gt giving them a new mission Create Sports NFT s Folks the NFT Market is on fire gt with 2 companies TOPPS amp TOP SHOT both printing 500 Million in Top Line Revenue growth selling Sports NFT s in 2020 HUMBL s Blockchain Super App will offer Payments Park Money and earn up to 6 and send money Peer to Peer cross border for about 1 3 the fees both in development using blockchain technology again saving about 1 3rd in fees Marketplace Ticketing Unique NFT s Tokenized Rental Properties Unique Artwork amp Artisan Merchandise amp Investing Active Passive Block ETX s gt Algo bots trade for you for a low fee of only 4 99 per month The HUMBL Blockchain Platform is still in development but it s beautiful gt I can hardly wait to park money on it gt and earn up to 6 Interest Income in Being developed now Bullish move gt HUMBL CEO Brian Foote just retired 93 500 000 shares That stock would have been worth about 100 Million to him Class act gt He did it to increase shareholder value and prevent dilution from the past 2 acquisitions Forward Guidance After HUMBL printing their FIRST 1 Million in Revenues in April 2021 gt On June 30 2021 during the HUMBL Investor Call Update Linked on the HUMBLPAY website CEO Brian Foote provided very bullish forward guidance that HUMBL will have 100 Million in Annual Revenues by the EOY 2021 WOW gt In 1 year gt Print your first 1 Million in Revenues gt and now HUMBL is targeting 100 Million in Revenues SUPER FAST GROWTH is projected Very rarely to you see a company growing so fast with large scaling growth potential in multiple markets Payments Marketplace amp Block ETX Investing too I believe the HUMBL Blockchain Platform will attract the masses first with Parking Money on the platform to Earn Interest at 6 Then being able to send money at 1 3rd the fees to family amp friends And then you have the ability to buy Tickets for Sporting Events Concerts amp Festivals on your HUMBL App And also you ll have the ability to invest amp trade Unique Sports Music amp Art NFT s In addition gt Invest amp own a fractional tokenized piece of a Rental Single Family Home Real Estate Property too and lastly invest in BLOCK ETX s gt Both Active amp Passive The Active BLOCK ETX s have ALGORITHM BOTS that do the trading for you for only 4 99 per month Folks gt This is all on 1 App gt HUMBL s goal is to make everything super easy gt just 1 or 2 clicks I see clearly the large scaling growth potential of HMBL gt because blockchain technology does everything more efficiently gt with less fees to customers e g gt Sending money around the world to friends and family at 1 3 the fee rate will save customers lots of money Seriously my heart goes out to anyone that invests in stock only to see it plunge lower days later I have been there experienced it first hand But now I have learned from my experience When I go into a stock it s with 50 of what I can purchase with plans to buy the additional 50 on a dip if one happens I add incrementally monthly via an Average Cost Investing strategy I have learned from my experience and I hope this post is helpful to others I will continue to add more HMBL shares based upon the price action If it drops then I add monthly potentially increasing my total shares to 100 000 shares where I will cap it This is the way I invest I see clearly the upward fundamental strengthening From 1 Million in Revenues to the CEO s projected 100 Million by EOY 2021 This is SUPER FAST GROWTH according to any analysis therefore I am committed to my investment and I will buy more HMBL when the price is at a discount The HUMBL CEO Brian Foote is a CEO that only
