seemed to enjoy my telecom company analysis https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments n8ok60 fundamental comps analysis for vz t and tmus fair I thought I would share this one I put together for cruise ship companies I had a suspicion that because this industry suffered so much during Covid there might be a value opportunity here but based on my analysis the financials simply don t support that thesis With VZ looking at the financials led me to further efforts researching the nature of the telecommunications industry the management team wall street sentiment and much more before I eventually purchased for myself bought 55 87 Here I have not been nearly as thorough in investigating these intangibles because for me and my portfolio the financials of these companies are a non starter If I had to pick a favourite it would be CCL LIND for least favourite but I do not own any of these companies and have no plans to purchase If you have more info than me and think one or more of these companies are strong buys then tell me I would love to have my mind changed and make some Model https docs google com spreadsheets d 1bOtF0m9AiS8OLVCeCfISRfiTwQGIGQ1cjWj3goP ro4 edit usp sharing https docs google com spreadsheets d 1bOtF0m9AiS8OLVCeCfISRfiTwQGIGQ1cjWj3goP ro4 edit usp sharing Methodology Created a three statement model for Carnival Corp Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd and Lindblad Expeditions Holdings Inc Combined these with a WACC build up to create an unlevered DCF and derived a fair value per share estimate using a growth in perpetuity and an exit EBITDA multiple approach Spread comparable companies these 4 Combined results from DCF and select comps valuations to arrive at final estimates How to use the model Anywhere you see blue text is OK to edit and should not result in breaking anything Green text taken from another worksheet so if you want to change one of those cells I recommend following the trail first To make meaningful changes to the 3 statement model scroll to the bottom of each Financials page to tweak assumptions about revenue growth GPM and other assumptions You can also adjust the specifics for each case scenario from here I have tried to supply somewhat pessimistic assumptions about terminal growth rates and exit EBITDA multiples in the DCF models Feel free to adjust as needed keeping in mind the model is very sensitive to these inputs WACC buildup can be done however you want If you have access to a Bloomberg terminal you can get a better adjusted beta than I used and a more precise cost of debt more on that below or you can just use the override cell to put in a WACC directly Trading Comps Input essentially works to arrive at normalized multiples before converting to an output Do not be intimidated by non Gaap disclosures Everything here is available on annual reports quarterly reports and press releases For trading comps outputs simply toggle the companies in column B until you have the company you wish to analyze in the first position and the other comps below it then head to Valuation Matrix to see the results Feel free to adjust the assumptions there are a lot of them If you can think of an assumption better than something I have here or if you spot a mistake let me know Other Notes The analyst consensus for revenue increases from 2021 gt 2022 are insanely high but yes cruises are expected to rebound by that much The glaring issue with the comps analysis is that there simply aren t enough of them I considered including Disney as a sort of look at what these cruise lines would all dream of being one day but that was too much of a reach If Disney Cruises released their financials separately that would be a different story and beyond that I couldn t find any reasonable comps Sadly the best comparable missing MSG cruises is a private company Super low valuations for RCL and LIND are not mistakes unless they are valuations so separated from fundamentals like this make me think something else is going on industry consolidation Upcoming M amp A Who knows I try to be harsh on my fair value estimates to protect myself from making bad buys Keep that in mind I only want to put my capital where there is undeniably a value opportunity I Imported the model from excel to Google Sheets before sharing so if something is broken let me know so I can go in and fix it ASAP Used 10Y YTM bond data on FINRA when possible to arrive at assumptions for cost of debt used in WACC build up If you have access to a bloomberg terminal you can grab the bond with the best volume and use that I apologize for ambiguity especially on the non gaap stuff but I couldn t figure out how to remove my name from the comments quickly if you know how to do this other than going one by one through each comment let me know and I ll reupload Most comments were simply memos to myself to remember what each cell consists of beyond the label i e components of other current assets A thousand more things If you want to know just ask None of this is financial advice This is an exercise I did for my own use and thought this sub might find it entertaining Do your own Due Diligence I do not own any of these stocks Fair Value Price Estimates CCL 26 39 NCLH 22 71 RCL 39 31 LIND 5 37 Stay tuned for my next one Ecommerce There are definitely some ecommerce companies I believe in and are worth a greater dive so that one won t be up for awhile yet

board to GME that appears to have included a number of other meme stocks which all saw sympathetic squeeze action in January February 2021 and where several continue today is an example of a massive

242,nhnung,t2_4st8xu46,1621587092,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhnung/cumulative_short_interest/,1,Cumulative Short Interest,I ve recently started analyzing data from FINRA and the SEC in an attempt to determine a worst case scenario for short interest Initially I was focusing on GME and other meme stocks but have also applied the same technique to the broader S amp P500 index list as well with some interesting results FINRA Short Volume information scraped from http regsho finra org regsho June html http regsho finra org regsho June html SEC FTD Data scraped from https www sec gov data foiadocsfailsdatahtm https www sec gov data foiadocsfailsdatahtm Like any good math problem we need to prove our work There are a few fields that we receive from the data feeds that can be used for further calculations The most notable ones for this case are Short Volume Short Exempt Volume Total Volume and FTD per day by ticker Short Volume and FTD are likely familiar with those reading this but Short Exempt volume may not be https www investopedia com terms s shortexempt asp https www investopedia com terms s shortexempt asp MATH Regular Volume Total Volume Short Volume Total Short Volume Short Volume Short Exempt Volume Delta Volume Total Short Volume Regular Volume Cumulative SI Cumulative SI Delta Volume If Cumulative SI dips to negative reset to 0 Short Volume Percent Total Short Volume Total Volume ASSUMPTION This calculation is conservative and a worst case scenario for the retail investor The assumption made is that any trade that is in excess of the daily short volume is used to close a prior short sale i e no retail or investor buying or holding The goal is to identify situations where abusive or excessive shorting may be happening and to visually identify shorting and volume trends between tickers CAVEATS The data is incomplete the data is outright wrong the rules are made up and the points don t matter From FINRA s site directly amp x200B Short Sale Volume excludes any trading activity that is not publicly disseminated As a result some offsetting buying activity related to reported short selling would not be reflected in the Daily Volume and may result in the appearance of a higher concentration of short sale volume to total volume The Short Sale Volume is not consolidated with exchange data To obtain a complete picture of the short sale volume to total volume for a particular exchange listed stock market participants must combine data from each of the TRFs and the ADF as well as from each exchange Short Sale Volume does not and is not intended to equate to bi monthly reported short interest position information The short interest data reflects aggregate short positions held by market participants at a specific moment in time on two discrete days each month while the Daily Short Sale Volume reflects the aggregate volume of trades executed and reported as short sales on each trade date As a result this approach is intended to give an indication of general short interest over time correlated with volume and price and provide an easy to understand visual representation of short sale trends and worst case covering scenarios PROCESS After scraping available SEC and FINRA feeds for each relevant ticker the data is merged and run through a fairly simple script to calculate the missing fields and plot out using numpy and pandas RESULTS RH Halts two GME ETFs and a few controls https postimg cc gallery z3NGnx9 https postimg cc gallery z3NGnx9 S amp P 500 https postimg cc gallery hJ6XmYw https postimg cc gallery hJ6XmYw

it lends some credence to the bUt ThE sHoRtS cLoSeD narrative if you only look at it from the perspective of the officially reported data and what the graph shows It also indicates a massive resurgence of short interest that hasn t gone away and is at a significantly higher entry price so I d argue a short squeeze is still on the menu even based on this 2 On the bull side there has been a fair amount of evidence detailing options manipulation dark pool orders and possible naked shorting that isn t making it to the official FINRA and SEC reports We ve also learned that the maximum reported short interest is 140 and its not impossible that back in May 2020 I see you Jim Bell they may have doubled down on synthetic shares and naked shorting such that that the small 100 million share jump around the beginning of May reflected in the official numbers should actually extend significantly higher and trend further up as the shorts continued to pile on and try to drive them into the ground until they were forced to allow the price to spike and shut off many brokers buy buttons to cancel the short squeeze at that time amp x200B Nothing to see here move along https preview redd

this can t be good for an ETF to be overshorted more or less all the time when compared to its constituent stocks CONCLUSION THEORIES There s a lot to unpack in this A marked difference exists in the behavior of the cumulative SI trend between normal and meme stocks I don t believe that it s a coincidence that there are a number of stocks that follow nearly identical price trends and have very similar graphs KOSS and GME are a perfect example of this from January through now I believe that there are some clear trends you can see in the graphs that begin to paint a picture showing a large institutional entity running short sale campaigns against one or more companies tickers either simultaneously or in serial in an attempt to profit off of price action and retail order manipulation The campaign which started in 2019 when Jim Bell came on board to GME that appears to have included a number of other meme stocks which all saw sympathetic squeeze action in January February 2021 and where several continue today is an example of a massive miscalculation and error of risk management by one or more institutions In short squeezes are back on the menu boys Do with this information

thing certain in life is death and taxes well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you ll double your money This isn t some wishy washy bullshit oh it s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it s just a question of when How can I be so sure They already own 54 of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95 premium in the fall Should you trust me Am I financial advisor good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can t lose What is it Their drug is a GNRH antagonist What the fuck does that mean fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock Ready for Primetime They didn t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine kind of a big deal They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe think FDA is going to delay Sell themselves at any cost Hell no They got a 4 2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted Added bonus Pfizer s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill Buyout Price This sucker ain t going cheap They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner Sumi owns 54 of the outstanding shares but isn t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth The non SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius not piece of shit pharma we have here Going rate for takeovers is at least 100 premium and they have even ticked up to 130 in recent times Sumiwho Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks You don t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article Why buy now Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like 17 50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost 2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R amp D expenses going way down whatever could they do with that cash 44 a share wouldn t even cost them that 2 billion and would lock this down With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in remember this isn t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they ve already approved in new indications like this one Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them 50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point It s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density the solution they will monitor bone density That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies Summary Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on doesn t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer Even if they don t Myovant has zero debt zero risk of an offering cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs Truly can t fucking lose so why is it trading so cheap Well cause no one knows about it and the upside is only written down in Japanese

thing certain in life is death and taxes well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you ll double your money This isn t some wishy washy bullshit oh it s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it s just a question of when How can I be so sure They already own 54 of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95 premium in the fall Should you trust me Am I financial advisor good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can t lose What is it Their drug is a GNRH antagonist What the fuck does that mean fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock Ready for Primetime They didn t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine kind of a big deal They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe think FDA is going to delay Sell themselves at any cost Hell no They got a 4 2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted Added bonus Pfizer s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill Buyout Price This sucker ain t going cheap They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner Sumi owns 54 of the outstanding shares but isn t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth The non SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius not piece of shit pharma we have here Going rate for takeovers is at least 100 premium and they have even ticked up to 130 in recent times Sumiwho Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks You don t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article Why buy now Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like 17 50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost 2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R amp D expenses going way down whatever could they do with that cash 44 a share wouldn t even cost them that 2 billion and would lock this down With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in remember this isn t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they ve already approved in new indications like this one Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them 50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point It s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density the solution they will monitor bone density That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies Summary Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on doesn t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer Even if they don t Myovant has zero debt zero risk of an offering cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs Truly can t fucking lose so why is it trading so cheap Well cause no one knows about it and the upside is only written down in Japanese

target to 225 approx 9 5 upside I decided to do a quick company analysis and outlook to see if I agree with their PT Company Overview LendingTree NASDAQ TREE is America s largest online marketplace connecting lenders and borrowers LendingTree empowers lenders to shop for financial services the same way one would shop for hotel stays or airline tickets comparing multiple offers from a nationwide network of over 800 partners that offer their customers services such as mortgage loans mortgage refinances auto loans personal loans business loans and much more Their service also provides lenders with free credit scores monitoring and improvements and etc Revenue Segments Home Segment Generating revenue from real estate brokerage services through match fees paid by the real estate brokers participating in their marketplace Accounts for 35 3 of total revenue in 2020 Consumer Segment Generating revenue from credit repair and debt relief services through subscription fees from consumers that are enrolled in their credit repair product Accounts for 27 8 of total revenue in 2020 Insurance Segment Generating revenue from match fees when connecting leading insurance companies to consumers Accounts for 36 7 of total revenue in 2020 Holdings Insight Institutional Holdings BlackRock Inc raised its holding by 45 3 during the 4Q Nikko Asset Management Americas Inc raised holdings by 15 4 during 4Q Insider Transactions Independent Director G Thompson purchase 1 4M worth of share at about 282 share Suggests a positive outlook for the company as the price was bought above the price it was trading at then Industry Overview and Outlook Low interest rates have fueled consumer demand for refinancing existing debt and access to new debt Industry consolidation is occurring due to shrinking margins and increased regulatory costs Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to encourage consumer lending Strong economy coupled with strong employment numbers have led to a surge in home sales Pandemic drriven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006 5 6 increase YoY for homes sold Sales in January 2020 were 22 stronger than in December 2019 51 of mortgage lenders are non banks 5 of the largest mortgage lenders in the U S are non banks Projected 73 7B in loan origination for 2022 35 6B from personal loans 13 6B from small and medium entrepreneur loans and 24 5B from refinancing student debt Approx 79 3 growth since loan origination value of 41 4B from 2017 Pandemic driven demand sent total home sales to the highest since 2006 Investment Thesis I Established Leader in the Marketplace LendingTree s competitive advantages in the marketplace differentiate them from other loan or insurance comparison shopping marketplaces Speed easy use apply for loans in minutes and lock in rates Convenience search and apply for quotes 24 7 from anywhere in the world Competitive Rates average buyer saves 125 163 per month for interest LendingTree has saved refinanced borrowers the most in San Francisco San Diego and Los Angeles with median savings of 80 211 77 740 and 73 954 respectively Even in cities with refinancing savings like Detroit present median savings of 23 409 Investment Thesis II Insurance Growth The insurance segment profit increased 16 5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and the number of consumers seeking insurance coverage Refer to chart Segment Revenue Insurance segment profit increased 16 5M during 2020 primarily due to increases in revenue and number of consumers seeking insurance coverage Expected revenue growth of 30 compared to 2Q2020 Acquisitions of QuoteWizard in 4Q2018 and ValuePenguin in 1Q2019 allowed them to enhance their insurance products QuoteWizard one of the largest insurance comparison marketplaces in the growing online insurance advertising market This acquisition established LendingTree as a leading player in the online insurance advertising industry while also allowing them to diversify their financial services category Significant portion of their revenue growth in 2020 2019 and 2018 was driven by their insurance leads business from this acquisition ValuePenguin personal finance website that offers consumers objective analysis on variety of financial topics from insurance to credit cards This acquisition provided immense value to insurance carriers and agents through their high quality content and SEO capability allowing them further scale in the insurance space New Medicare category for insurance growth showed significant promise during their first open enrollment period in the 4Q2020 Presents a significant opportunity for their insurance segment Major Risks Consumer Demand Risk a general increase in interest rates may affect the ability of LendingTree s mortgage Network Partners to close loans which will translate to lower revenues for LendingTree and ultimately affect their financial position Interest Rate Risk The Federal Reserve is currently printing out more money in order to keep the markets afloat due to COVID 19 In the long term this will cause inflation and the decreasing value of the USD To combat this the Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates Final Thoughts The positive industry outlook and the prospective insurance segment of LendingTree that has generated high growth YoY strengthen analysts recommendations to BUY Given a stock price forecast projecting a median price target of 320 60 7 upside and a low price target of 200 0 5 upside I believe this stock still has a low of room for growth as they continue to diversify its revenue streams and expanding their financial services Furthermore I ve provided a chart of analyst recommendations retrieved from CNN Business that strengthens the recommendation to BUY Originally posted here https www reddit com r Utradea comments ni1mlk easy 10 upside on lendingtree tree after pt Btw check out Utradea https utradea com for some
