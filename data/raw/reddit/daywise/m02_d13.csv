STOCK Company profile Cerence builds AI powered virtual assistants for the mobility transportation market including but not limited to two wheel vehicles planes tractors cruise ships and elevators Our solutions power natural conversational and intuitive interactions between vehicles drivers and passengers and the broader digital world We are a premier provider of AI powered assistants and innovations for connected and autonomous vehicles including one of the world s most popular software platforms for building automotive virtual assistants such as Hey BMW and Ni hao Banma Market Capitalization Cerence has a market cap of just 5 billion As a play on two of the hottest growth segments EV and AI Cerence has and likely will continue to see prolific growth Customer Profile CERENCE products are in 53 OF ALL NEW CARS SHIPPED in 2020 This equates to 38 MILLION cars alone in 2020 and 325 million vehicles to date Customers include all major automobile original equipment manufacturers or OEMs or their tier 1 suppliers worldwide including BMW Daimler FCA Group Ford Geely GM Renault Nissan SAIC Toyota Volkswagen Group Aptiv Bosch Continental DENSO TEN and Harman We deliver our solutions on a white label basis enabling our customers to deliver customized virtual assistants with unique branded personalities and ultimately strengthening the bond between their brands and end users Our vision is to enable a more enjoyable safer journey for everyone Competitive Strengths directly from 10K Industry leading speech related technology Hybrid edge cloud system architecture Our software platform s hybrid architecture combines the performance reliability and tight integration that only edge software can provide with the flexibility of cloud connectivity Bespoke vehicle integration and acoustic tuning Cognitive assistance for categories such as navigation entertainment and control require tight integration with onboard vehicle components which vary widely among vehicle models Separately speech interaction systems can be significantly hampered by the noisy environment of a vehicle cabin and must be tuned for particular acoustics and audio system components To achieve the tight vehicle integration necessary to address these concerns our professional services team works closely with OEMs and suppliers to customize our offerings for the particular characteristics of specific vehicle models Broad language coverage Our software platform supports over 70 languages and dialects far more than any of our competitors As a result of our broad language support our customers are already delivering cognitive assistance based on our software platform in over 60 countries across the Americas Europe and Asia including China the U S and all other large automotive markets Our language support also enables multi lingual capabilities for domains such as music selection point of interest selection and cross border navigation among others representing a critical feature for markets such as Continental Europe in which automobiles may routinely traverse multiple lingual zones We believe that our portfolio of languages and multi lingual capabilities represent an important competitive advantage as the development of capabilities to support a new language is expensive and time consuming Broad global network of deep relationships with OEMs and tier 1 suppliers We have supplied speech recognition systems to OEMs and suppliers for over 20 years working closely with our customers through our global professional services organization to design and integrate our solutions into their brands Competitors A real DD always addresses the competitive landscape Large technology companies Many large technology companies including Amazon Apple Google Microsoft Alibaba Baidu and Tencent offer Internet based virtual assistants Given the popularity in general of these virtual assistants we believe that automobile drivers and riders increasingly desire the ability to use them as part of the mobility experience Small focused competitors We compete for business directly with certain companies focused on voice based virtual assistance including SoundHound in the U S iFlyTek in China and other regional and technology focused competitors These companies have had some success selling into our customer base However we believe that we have multiple meaningful competitive advantages including our scale our globally distributed team our best in class portfolio of compatible languages and our deep focus on the automotive market We also believe that our technology particularly our speech signal enhancement and acoustic tuning is superior based on benchmarking results against our competitors We believe we will continue to be able to compete successfully against these competitors as we continue to invest in our offerings Competitors My analysis I appreciate that Cerence s auditors make sure they address all potential risks However I do not see big tech as a threat I see them as a gain guarantee Cerence s AI is years ahead of the big players and Cerence s small peers The biggest risk I see here is that a company ahem like AAPL or Google might purchase Cerence Cerence s market cap makes it a likely candidate of a buyout in the future Revenues Revenues are up to 326 Million for fiscal year 2020 95 Million in Q1 2021 literally on pace for 25 revenue growth Here s a chart with Revenue growth for the last three years https imgur com a eNKnHnR Gross Margin 72 gross margin in the most recent fiscal quarter Huge margins which is extremely attractive Research and Development The best expense on the income statement in my opinion Cerence has had negative net incomes in the past few fiscal years due primarily to R amp D costs This maintains and expands their already vast competitive advantage We believe that continued investment in research and development will be critical for us to continue to deliver market leading solutions for automotive cognitive assistance Accordingly we intend to continue to invest in our product portfolio and allocate capital and resources to our growth opportunities Balance Sheet 1 700 000 000 assets to 700 000 000 liabilities For my finance guys a 1 37 current ratio 266 bil in LTD Goodwill is a concentrated risk that makes up most of their assets

ignored or deleted but hey ree ddit is free to post I m a drunk retard rn so bare with me let me bring the light from the Man of Gold Short squeezes happen all the time and they happen exclusively for a mechanical reason Nothing to do with fundamentals hope company performance nothing Its all down to market mechanics which is completely different from the real world its their own universe or real life game if you will Even with the suspicious events seem in the marketplace the stock is exactly where it is supposed to be except for the timing Let me explain why Lets say you have 10 000 in your account and you decided to short ABC stock You are wise and decided to use only 20 of your portfolio to short it Great You sell 2 000 worth of ABC 200 shares which are trading at 10 a share and hope it crashes and burn soon You are still paying lets say 10 borrow rate annual rate but its not a big deal since you expect to close the trade in less than 2 months for a much higher profit than that Lets say the margin required is 150 100 of the amount of cash you received plus 50 since you cant open a position with zero money of course so your maintenance margin for this position is 3 000 But hey something happens the stock spikes to 15 share that being whatever reason even just Elon Musk tweeting about it which makes zero real world difference for the company So the 2 000 you sold and need to eventually buy back are valued at 3 000 You lost 1000 and your account is now worth 9000 Also your new maintenance margin is 4 500 now tying up half of your whole balance since you already lost 1 000 and your equity is 9 000 You can see how quickly this can spiral out of control See the table below and note that if the stock goes to 40 it is sufficient to wipe out 90 of your account at which point you will be under margin and auto liquidated by your broker leading you to moan on internet forums how brokers screwed you over for the rest of your life The stock goes to 40 and poof now you blew up your account https preview redd it 8pk75r6x47h61 png width 569 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f291d5ec44b66b08e7592bb2774e468e5fb4bdc6 Note the for a stock to go from 10 to 40 is not an ordinary event which is why it makes short squeezes so interesting Now lets look at the GME example You start with the same 10 000 on January 22nd but this time you only sell the equivalent of 10 of your portfolio roughly 26 shares at 38 50 What happens Grab your credit card and buy yourself something pretty you will need it in your new evening profession https preview redd it pxe37q4w47h61 png width 571 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 812eb0e77460e5c1d8d5c78e775aac4a53cbe9e7 By January 27th when the stock hit 347 51 your whole account would be wiped out and the broker closed out your short You owe the broker almost 2 000 they will likely close out your position before that when you go under margin but you can t count on that if the stock gaps up in the open Make no mistake they WILL buy you out close your short at ANY price They do not care In just 3 business days your account is done and your short is closed That s all it took I m not assuming investment companies would operate in the same manner or even risk 10 of their whole book in a short but the emergency capital inflow some of them needed tells you all They also have their loss limits risk management and when they kick in they kick in just as the same Now what is the signature component in a short squeeze Time It is a fast and explosive event that s the definition of short squeezes You will have a short squeeze happen when there is a time crunch between stock movement and margin requirement appetite for losses happen That said if a short seller believes a squeeze happen but he has plenty of time to wait cash and confidence the squeeze will end soon he WONT close it because he doesn t NEED to close He can close it or not Squeezes are not about having options they are about panic and necessity Short squeezes do not take months It takes hours days maybe one week depending on the size of the fuck up I mean Icahn vs Ackman and Herbalife happened so I guess it can happen maybe but that s a different case If the trading restrictions imposed on the retail investor caused a cool down of the squeeze it did its a different fact its a different fact it is not reason to believe the squeeze didn t happen when it clearly did Now for a bit of reflection if the stock hit 350 and short seller Joe did not close his short despite this obnoxious ramp up what makes you think they need to close in such a hurry now Stock is way down and going downer also if they sold more at the top why would they hurry to buy back and cause another squeeze instead of buying it back slowly to cash the profits The squeeze happened what was due to burn burned and now the players had their positions are readjusted It was an event it happened fun was had not for all and its over Like all other short squeezes what I have observed is that the price spikes a few times like GME did then crashes for a while and then hangs around at a level usually higher than the initial level of the squeeze for a while After that who knows I wonder who closed their position at the top https www cnbc com 2021 01 27 chamath palihapitiya closes gamestop position but defends individual investors right to html amp x200B nothing personal kid https preview redd it j2yw0eep57h61 png width 383 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 636153e795b4cb9af2127fe335a72be72d905191 There is no such thing as squeeze squooze I m sorry to break the news But hey you learn that s what counts right If you want anything to believe in go after the institutions that unilaterally imposed trade restrictions on the weakest link of the market retail investors One group of players was free to trade as please while other group was cornered into submission with no recourse That s the issue here The game was honked from the start What should have happened Trade suspension on the security on the exchange why the different set of rules now Nothing changes the fact the squeeze went its course Can we get ANOTHER squeeze Yes Likely I don t think so we went to hell and back already Those who survived are battle hardened and been there done that By the way I m not american I m not a US resident for tax purposes I am not a financial

going down with Robinhood lots of obvious stuff that has affected many many people But there s even more shady stuff that s been going on the past few weeks that I haven t seen anyone mention So let me share with you my GME timeline I d been watching GME since it was around 30 The weekend that it closed at 60 I decided I was going to buy in and spent most of the weekend preparing that I started by reinstalling Robinhood which I hadn t used since 2018 and funding it with 300 I did this to keep it separate from my main portfolio I chose 300 because I was almost positive it would fail and I was willing to watch 300 go to zero with no skin off my back On Monday I bought in at 95 I traded it once that day to increase my principle to about 350 then bought back in around 90 After spending most of that night lurking wsb I bought into the hype and decided I was going to invest more Tuesday morning premarket around 3 4 am I initiated another transfer to Robinhood for 550 I chose this number because it made my initial investment stay below the 1000 instant deposit limit meaning I could invest it at market open However this same thought process led me to believe it may be a longer play and I might want to invest more So at that same point in time I upgraded to Robinhood gold to increase my instant deposit limit to 2500 I proceeded to return to Reddit for a few hours with an idea of what price point I was looking for i was hoping to get at least 4 5 more on a Dip Since I knew how much I had I didn t spend much of that time on Robinhood til around 9 At that point I go to set my limit orders for open and I see that none of my funds are available to trade After the initial run around I find out a few things 1 the 550 deposit I made was put on margin and since my other principle was less than that it restricted me from trading it It also allowed Robinhood to charge me fees for the time that it was on margin To clarify I did not have margin trading enabled which was shown clearly on the same exact page that showed I had 550 on margin 2 My instant deposits were restricted So even though I paid to get Robinhood gold and even though I still hadn t deposited the initial FREE 1 000 instant limit they decided they didn t want me trading instantly 3 My withdrawals were restricted My 300 principal settled that same morning meaning I shouldn t have had any restrictions on withdrawing that or any profits that it made So what do I do I bitch to Robinhood They tell me they ll get back to me in 2 3 days Fuck that I call my bank and reverse the 550 deposit I put it in fidelity later that day I sell the dog coin and free stock I d had since 2018 and prepare to liquidate the account at first chance aside from the GME which I didn t want caught in limbo for Wednesday Wednesday comes and goes and I stare helplessly as the price continues to rise unable to buy more And then Thursday happened We all know most of the details of that and what has happened since so I won t put too much time there But guess what Friday Robinhood emailed me back The very courteous and official sounding email informed me that my account was restricted due to a failed deposit of 550 the reversal So now I ve got official correspondence from these guys telling me that they can see into the future and that they restricted my account for a reversed payment before it was reversed Said restriction being what lead to the reversal in the first place At this point I felt pretty hopeless and have been kinda sluggish all week but have tried to stay optimistic and continue to hold After all I was Prepared to lose the money from the get go Sometime during this period I discover that selling the free Robinhood stock creates a 30 day period with which you can t withdraw your money So after playing sundial on Tuesday tilray on Wednesday At this point I made about 80 on sundial which allowed me to buy 4 tilray stocks at 42 when added with the rest of my floating power Made another 80 on that the next morning and staring at the market Thursday I sold all but one of my gme for a 40 loss and put the rest of my purchasing power into PLTR at the dip yesterday Figure I ll try to play with it on Robinhood if they re forcing me to keep it there for a few weeks But then this morning I wake up and check my email to find These two lovely messages https imgur com gallery vP5eSss from Robinhood As of a few hours ago they have officially restricted all of my securities to sell only and restricted my withdrawal capabilities The reason given was because of a failed deposit So now they ve basically taken away from me everything that the app offers except the ability to sell my positions But if I sell my positions not only can I not withdraw the money I can t reinvest it into other positions There s not a lot I can do I ve spent a lot of time thinking about it and I realized that just about the only thing that I can do is to make sure that other people know this wasn t just some simple market manipulation and it didn t just start on that Thursday They are literally in the process of stealing from people in any way that they can Please do not let this issue fade from your radar The extreme and constant news over the past 5 years has tamed us making us indifferent and more likely to move onto the next issue Let s not drop this issue people for the sake of our average citizen the tax payer the working people the people that actually run this country with their blood sweat and tears Don t let Robinhoods assault on our free market fade to obscurity

dip,Alright guys This is going to be long but if you want actual DD sit back and enjoy NET is doing excellent and will only continue to excel as it continues to grab market share and boom in the background What is Cloudflare Cloudflare is going to make a leading player in next generation computing From their blog https blog cloudflare com rendering react on the edge with flareact and cloudflare workers https blog cloudflare com rendering react on the edge with flareact and cloudflare workers Excerpt gt Imagine you re the maintainer of a high traffic media website and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare Page speed is critical You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism you re going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly efficiently and at scale Instead of paying for a server to host your code you can host it directly inside the datacenter Seriously this is cool and it s only beginning Cloudflare is innovating every day Their customers absolutely love them As a software engineer they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers I think what s going to help them into a powerhouse is this gt Over the coming months we ll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience It ll work the exact same way Pages does just write your code git push and we ll deploy it for you The only difference is it won t just be your frontend it ll be your backend too And just to be clear this is not just for stateless functions With Workers KV and Durable Objects we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform Soon developers will be able to make full stack applications end to end using Cloudflare s network Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment And they ll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction If you re not a developer you probably didn t understand most of that but essentially they re making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure This is actually genuinely cool and will save the average developer tons of time and money I can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50 And if this thing inches up to 60 65 YoY as it expands it s profitability And even if it doesn t and stays at 50 it will still but slower Regardless it s going up BuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs That drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren t long Plus it s hardly a tank when it s at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher Its earnings was good and to those who haven t read it do so https www cloudflare com press releases 2021 cloudflare announces fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 financial results besides relying on a stock s immediate reaction To the 90 who will completely ignore that sentence gt Revenue growth was 50 YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings Revenue right now is 125 million Doesn t sound like much at first but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped 5 years from now that s 1 billion a year In 8 it will be 3 billion Yes 5 8 years is a long time This is a buy and hold stock That s why I m long Jan 21 115c The revenue and growth isn t the impressive part The margins are gt GAAP gross profit was 96 9 million or 76 9 gross margin compared to 65 7 million or 78 3 in the fourth quarter of 2019 High 70s margins is absolutely incredible And it s consistent quarter to quarter That means once NET does reach profitability they re going to be raking in dough That being said NET isn t profitable yet which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster that and high valuation but more on that later Keep in mind they ve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn t stopped it But once profitability is out of the way there s nothing stopping it from being a 300 stock Here s why Like I mentioned earlier their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct they will reach profitability by early 22 Currently 15 of the internet goes through Cloudflare s network and that number is increasing Literally 1 6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth 25 billion In comparison a bike company PTON is worth double that Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security Not to mention their prices are dirt cheap compared to their competitors CONS The only cons are people concerned with profitability covered already and evaluation priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous However I think this is still short sighted As long as the bull market remains intact big IF but I m a bull so as long interest rates are 0 there s no reason to believe the rocket rally will end As we see with SHOP and TSLA traditional valuations don t matter if the product has a dream vision and story which with Cloudflare s Build a Better Internet shtick I think it does Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare s already enormous Cloudflare network This stock already got multiple https www thestreet com investing cloudflare drops despite multiple price target upgrades analysts upgrades The drop was a blessing to those who aren t in Start investing in quality and innovation 85 share is a whole lot less than 300 which is where they will be by 2025 I want to say 2022 but I m trying to be conservative here Seriously give this a second look I ve been playing NET since 37 It s a shit stock that consolidates for months then rockets 30 in a week Earnings being great and not excellent is the only reason NET hasn t done its 30 move I m completely assured that it will soon

morning to all of you here on r wallstreetbets I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and is ready for the new trading week ahead Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 15th 2021 Stimulus prospects could boost the stock market and interest rates in the week ahead Source https www cnbc com 2021 02 12 stimulus prospects could boost the stock market and interest rates in the week ahead html gt The prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead gt Earnings season is beginning to wind down but some big names have yet to report gt Walmart s earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer as should the government s retail sales report for January also expected Wednesday gt The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank s view on inflation gt Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects gt Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law gt The market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be It s going to be important They can get it through reconciliation said Quincy Krosby chief market strategist at Prudential Financial gt Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans gt Some in the markets had anticipated a package of 1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal but that now looks unlikely Strategists have changed their view on the proposed 1 9 trillion package gt There is less pushback to President Biden s proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected so a price tag of around 1 5 trillion seems likely which is higher than we initially thought noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts gt They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb 22 and that it could become law by the first week of March Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress gt Market pros expect the bigger the spending package the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term That has helped send Treasury yields which move opposite price to higher levels gt It has also increased concerns about inflation gt Inflation and rising yields In the past week the 10 year yield a key benchmark touched 1 2 for the first time since March It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday gt Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy but also as inflation expectations also move higher gt If you think about the big drivers they re related vaccines stimulus and inflation said Michael Schumacher head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities If there s more talk out of D C about moving the stimulus package forward that sets the stage for yields to go up gt The market is concerned about the economy running hotter since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy gt At the same time the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2 target gt Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor gt Because there s such a debate on inflationary trends I know the CPI consumer price index came in comfortable but the producer price index is coming in and we ll see if that has eased she said gt Obviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building said Krosby gt Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1 4 in January gt Housing statistics Housing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday shortened week gt The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales gt On Thursday the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits Finally the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday gt Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes Stocks were higher in the past week with energy tech and financials as the best performers The S amp P 500 rose 1 2 ending the week at 3 934 gt There were some market hot spots like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community The stocks shot higher Wednesday adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains gt Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily shorted names gt Robinhood s CEO is expected to testify as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel gt The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated But Ari Wald head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer said the broader market s advance is intact gt Overall it s a bull market I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated Wald said He said the market technicals are healthy Breadth is broad based and there s cyclical leadership gt The low volatility high dividend paying sectors are at risk said Wald Utilities and consumer staples stocks which both fit that category were lower on the week gt The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald

steady drift lower until Friday when the S amp P 500 has tended to rebound We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all day event As shown performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years though in years that the S amp P 500 was down YTD headed

gains than losses on the Tuesday after but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of 0 49 and a median loss of 0 11 gt Wednesday is all red for all three major averages NASDAQ

slaughtered Old Wall Street saying gt The Chinese New Year often called the Lunar New Year will kick off Friday February 12 and with it will begin the Year of the Ox Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs it is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat Good riddance to the Rat as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020 not the best years for many reasons gt Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late January and mid February we looked at the 12 month return of the S amp P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950 And wouldn t you know it The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13 on average with a median advance of nearly 18 suggesting bulls are smiling indeed gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https i2 wp com lplresearch com wp content uploads 2021 02 2 10 21 Blog Chart 1 png ssl 1 gt The year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence persistence and honesty Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick gt The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically with the Goat Tiger and Ox as the best while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https i1 wp com lplresearch com wp content uploads 2021 02 2 10 21 Blog Chart 2 png ssl 1 gt We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs This relationship is random and the sample size is small Still here s hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again gt Short Interest Update gt Yesterday bi weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th In the chart below we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile s stock s median change in short interest from then to yesterday s release As shown with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2 65 percentage points Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines though they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks On the other hand the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020 gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2021 02 021020 SI Deciles F png gt In the table below we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float After the historic move higher short squeeze poster child GameStop GME is no longer the Russell 3000 s most heavily shorted name Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year only 42 61 of shares are now short compared to 43 57 for Gogo GOGO currently the most shorted stock in the index GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point Of the other stocks in the index only Tanger Outlets SKT and Dillard s DDS also currently have more than 40 of the float sold short gt On the January 27th closing high GME was up 1 744 53 year to date But with the short squeeze unwinding the stock has fallen over 86 Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges For example National Beverage FIZZ had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak but since then it has been cut by 33 78 Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though Fulgent Genetics have similarly seen big gains of over 30 gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2021 02 021020 SI Table Current High png gt Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings BIGC and Dillard s DDS which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners a baker s dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points Additionally of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most only three nCino NCNO Berkeley Lights BLI and 3D Systems DDD now have a single digit short interest as a percent of float gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https media bespokepremium com uploads 2021 02 021020 SI Table Decline png gt Given the massive short squeezes there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year In fact of the Russell 3000 stocks 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase In the table below we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year As shown there is only one

Increase png gt Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest To quantify this in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020 As shown just as it was at the start of the year retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group but it has greatly improved with only 5 86 short compared to 8 15 at the end of 2020 That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5 08 to 4 13 Conversely there are two industries Banks and Materials that

Macerich is a REIT that specialize in shopping centers you know that thing that you don t go to anymore because of Amazon and the pandemic The company has performed very poorly company wise occupancy dropped to 89 8 in 2020 from 95 4 in 2018 and in stock price it dropped from 90 in July 2016 to 6 in April 2020 and is now at 12 90 There are a few worrying things about this company So let s go through them one by one and see how bad they are Their debt They ve increased their debt from 54 5 in 2018 to 66 4 in 2019 to a whopping 83 5 of their market cap in end 2020 Leverage like that on shopping centers you know that thing you don t go to anymore because of amazon and the pandemic could be ok they don t really care about the declining revenue of those shopping centers they just need them to pay their leases But 2 things are pretty worrisome i some retail stores might go bankrupt and ii Macerich is using 1 5bn of their line of credit To counteract that The bankruptcy issue for retail stores is not that big of a deal for Macerich and they have a good plan if they have to repurpose a shopping mall both explained below And for the line of credit thingy their unencumbered assets an asset or property that is free and clear of any encumbrances such as creditor claims or liens are sufficient enough to cover their 1 5bn in line of credit if it s needed They can also dilute the shares to raise more capital They ve also filed for an ATM offering for up to 500 million Occupancy Rent collection Their occupancy is at 89 7 for the shopping centers that are not under development nor redevelopment This is down from the 95 4 it was at in 2018 or the 94 in 2019 The good news however is that rent collections for example during April and May were 35 that grew to 80 in the third quarter And as of today the fourth quarter rent collections were at 92 and rising by the week said Tom O Hern CEO of Macerich in their recent Earnings call The declining trend of brick and mortar stores and shopping malls in general That s a big one and this has been a much bigger trend as the pandemic forced some people to buy things online This trend is also not new at all as this Vox article shows very well https www vox com recode 21561046 death rebirth department stores retail charts But the silver lining is that as some retail stores are going bankrupt the big shopping centers are getting stronger from having less competition And since Macerich has mostly big shopping centers that s pretty good for them What about the bankrupt stores in the near future Green Street Advisors expects about a little more than half of all mall based department stores to close by the end of 2021 That can be a big problem but they seem to be prepared for it They re planning on doing some mixed use development and I like it Doug said in their most recent earnings call gt However we know our shoppers want more than just traditional retail And that s why we continue to focus on bringing alternative uses to our campuses and not just retail Uses like office residential hospitality medical wellness education fitness grocery service and even storage and that s why we continue to refer to our properties as town centers because that s what they re becoming They re transformational and will be something for everyone And they have to be because that s what our modern day shopper wants What makes me even more optimistic is that most of the estate they own is in California 25 8 and New York 23 1 Those are very high density locations which are the most promising places for redevelopment or for mixed use purposes The repurpose of their buildings That s great to know that they re planning on bringing alternative uses to their campuses but how faisible is it and how much will that help them First let s see what Macerich could convert its buildings to Offices but there s a lot of uncertainty in this area We re in the middle of a big shift in this regard which might benefit them or not Other retail stores but jesus christ this market is not doing good right now and has not been doing well years before the pandemic Industrial complexes like warehouses are booming right now thanks to e commerce and the pandemic This looks really promising if they go down that road but they need to do this quickly and strategically as all locations are not necessarily interesting Housing which a lot of real estate have mixed feelings about Or Macerich could do another interesting thing mixed use development gt It is a type of urban development urban planning and or a zoning type that blends residential commercial cultural institutional or entertainment uses into one space where those functions are to some degree physically and functionally integrated and that provides pedestrian connections Most of the estate they own is in California 25 8 and New York 23 1 So let s evaluate their possibilities in those locations that they ve invested in California Let s start with California and use the Allen Matkins UCLA Anderson 2021 winter forecast https www allenmatkins com anderson forecast allen matkins ucla anderson forecast california cre survey html They ve polled a lot of real estate professionals in California and here are the results They re pretty pessimistic about offices ROI today but they re confident that demand will increase HOWEVER the panelists believe that newly built space in addition to that freed by companies reducing their existing space will outstrip any near term increased demand for office space Outch Right in the feels Ok so not offices how about retail spaces That one is short 62 of panelists indicated that they will not develop any new properties in the coming 12 months Also gt Overall the level of new retail property construction is expected to significantly decline from 2020 through 2023 and some existing space lacking sufficient demand will be converted to other uses However for the industrial space market they re really optimistic approximately 30 percent of the panelists stated that the experience of the recession has caused them to consider increasing the amount of development they will undertake They re also expecting that the housing market will grow steadily when the economy rebounds So I m pretty optimistic for California if they need to repurpose their buildings they could turn those spaces into housing or warehouses industrial complexes or in mixed use schemes And how about Ney York New York Well The short term outlook is not that pretty In end of July 2020 Metro Manhattan reports that Office sales have dropped 58 https www metro manhattan com blog report new york city office sales drop 58 during lockdown and retail sales activity dropped 78 https www metro manhattan com blog report retail sales activity drops 78 during nyc lockdown during the lockdown Also https therealdeal com 2020 10 19 new yorks cre woes could spread nationwide investors gt Citing Trepp the Journal reported that more than 3 billion worth of loans backing commercial property in the five boroughs are delinquent and loans in creditor negotiations amount to an additional 4 billion Finally a lot of people are leaving the city because i it s the epicenter of the pandemic and ii it s a very dense city that was attractive because most of the activity is there Now that people can work from home they re no longer trapped in the city and 110 00 people left during the lockdown as a result https www mymove com moving covid 19 coronavirus moving trends So all of this hurts offices housing market and retail stores because less people means less sales in the short term For the long term long story short that s going to be the same as California but they will need to repurpose a lot more buildings as the situation is much worse in New York An the rest of the commercial real estate though There s a nice report https www2 deloitte com us en insights industry financial services commercial real estate outlook html by Deloitte The key messages summarize it well but I encourage you to read the whole thing as this is pretty interesting not only for Macerich but for all REIT investing in shopping centers in the US Conclusion Macerich is pretty undervalued right now with a maket cap close to 2bn It s pretty understandable because of the situation it is in right now their debt is pretty important and commercial real estate is in terrible state right now in general But their finances getting better as of end 2020 their occupancy approaching 90 their interesting plans for unoccupied stores and the promising long term outlook in California and New York the 2 locations they re mostly invested in shows a very good upside while the downside seems to be already priced in

shorted but WHICH gt 100 it may be, Thesis GME short interest may stand at minimum 107 since January 27th Only 35 of pre squeeze shorts may have been covered since January 27th I The Short Interest Numbers Short interest SI is calculated by shares shorted over total outstanding shares https www investopedia com terms s shortinterest asp https www investopedia com terms s shortinterest asp Apparently other firms have used different versions of float All other forms of float are likely incorrect and not likely used by Finra This is an important assumption if I am wrong here then fuck Total outstanding shares of GME is 69 75 million See https finance yahoo com quote GME key statistics https finance yahoo com quote GME key statistics Finra SI of GME is 78 as of January 27th See http finra markets morningstar com MarketData EquityOptions detail jsp query 126 3A0P000002CH amp sdkVersion 2 58 0 http finra markets morningstar com MarketData EquityOptions detail jsp query 126 3A0P000002CH amp sdkVersion 2 58 0 78 69 75 million 54 405m Thus 54 045m million shares are short GME of January 27th To calculate real SI we remove insider ownership Another big assumption Insider ownership stands at 19 06m See https finance yahoo com quote GME insider transactions https finance yahoo com quote GME insider transactions Thus free float is outstanding shares less insider ownership shares 50 750 000 shares Real SI appears at minimum 1 07 54 405m 50 750m II The Shorts Remaining and Covered On January 15th GME SI stood at 121 See https www nasdaq com articles are these the best heavily shorted stocks to buy right now 5 names to watch 2021 01 31 https www nasdaq com articles are these the best heavily shorted stocks to buy right now 5 names to watch 2021 01 31 Thus from January 15th to the 27th we know at least 84 397m shares were shorted 1 21 outstanding shares By January 27th 54 405m shorts remained previous short amounts minus current shorts remaining as of 1 27 The number of shorts that covered from Jan 15th to the 27th was was 29 992m 29 992m 84 397m shares 35 Thus 65 of shorts pre squeeze remain owing APR Around 35 of covering resulted in a 1 600 rise Thus a 65 cover rate conservative can yield a 2 971 rise Let s apply this math to now From 50 this is a 1 485 50 GME price result Could this happen No idea Notice the problem with this I m assuming only covering led to this rise So this is simply a demonstrative point New shorts from Jan 27th to present likely opened at higher prices 65 of those from 5 10 20 etc probably remain This is bad news for HF s III The Effect Based on estimated remaining covers price stagnation at 50 could result in further covering and collateral calls This burden is reduced if HF s opened new shorts at the peak and they are substantially ITM This part is unclear We know it s very likely that HF s opened new shorts at the peak what isn t clear is that it was within their risk department s policy to open new shorts during a fucking squeeze In my opinion it wasn t until drops below lt 200 the HF s felt safe opening up new shorts This is a substantial point if the new shorts are at much lower price points than thought then the pain points for HF s are far lower It s just unclear Nonetheless HF s may be bleeding substantially every week because of those remaining shorts Consider the current liquidity and volume of GME It appears that retail buying power is spent People either cashed out or are holding So they are unlikely to trigger the next squeeze or a gamma one for that matter Thus the fighting grounds has likely gone institutional Not all hedge funds are short GME nor are all financial whales In my view this has become an institutional fight with both sides pointing the gun at each other waiting who s going to pull the trigger first Retail is simply on the sidelines holding the clips in for both their guns smirking of course How long until every chump with a few million bucks laying around realizes this is still the most shorted stock on the market before they infuse substantial buying pressure My reservations in these predictions is that HF s are smart they can t be fooled twice etc and all of that non sense But before intelligence comes greed And I know greed and desperation has always governed the financial system IV Parting Thoughts It would take half brained monkey 45 seconds to crunch the short interest numbers Yet Finra was late posted after hours I think This is the most shorted stock on the market according to my numbers yet again dead silence from the mainstream media Sources are using various version of float to calculate SI as if suddenly short interest is something that be manipulated based on our interests Americans with 2 000 in their checkings account are being investigated for stock fraud The Big Short is illustrative It depicts how corruption and fraud has always been the building blocks of our financial institutions Put differently fraud doesn t just pervade the system nay it is the system Everything I ve seen just doesn t feel right Understand at this point I m speculating But I trust my gut There are also posts suggesting OTM ITM options are encouraging institutional price manipulations of GME This is beyond my knowledge span However if you looked at the bid ask spreads this week of GME they were at times pennies apart for days I ve never seen that before Seriously what the fuck DFV is testifying alongside the CEO s of Robinhood Citadel and Melvin Capital Next Thursday is a day to watch for me Again GME will be the most discussed and watched stock in America and arguably the globe Americans and the world will be reminded why their holdings in GME tanked 50 90 For many their life savings No it wasn t a result of imprudent investments to invest money into a squeezing stock is a good idea It was the clearing houses pulling the plugs because the financial system was never designed for working people to make that much money So when the risk of you getting that rich increased they stopped the game pun intended We don t even need to get into whether there was intentional collusion that s just speculation and it doesn t even matter to establish how messed up this is But think of how this plays out these institutions either bullshit their way through the hearing and everyone and their moms sees past it Or they tell you the truth that based on risk management and capital models they never thought retail would get that rich that fast Either way I don t think it ll play out well for them other than DFV on national television A key element here AOC grilling the hell out of these folks And to set the record straight I don t think retail is propping GME at 50 because they have diamond hands middle America is holding because they have nothing to lose after the clearing houses and Robinhood tanked their portfolios by over half So their plan to kill off retail interest backfired In the process of stunting buying pressure they inadvertently made all of working America diamond holders Poetic justice and fucking hilarious Look I m not demonizing rich people We all want financial freedom I m demonizing cheating the game However this ends one thing is clear The Big Squeeze is going to be an epic movie Disclaimer because working people are vilified when the financial system is exposed does this sound familiar It should because it s a reoccurring pattern When rich people lose poor people are blamed and we foot the bill I m a random guy on the internet stating my opinions so if you take my advice to do anything without your own research you are dumb If you disagree with anything I ve said comment below and counter me I don t want an echo chamber

autists let me explain why I believe GameStop has a strong fundamental case without mentioning diamond hands and short squeeze If Ryan Cohen can successfully execute his vision this leaky vessel will turn into a rocket ship blasting past the moon to the edge of the observable universe On November 16 2020 Ryan Cohen sent a letter to the GameStop s Board of Directors titled Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the Ultimate Destination for Gamers In it Ryan Cohen outlined the roadmap for GameStop to pivot and become a technology first company Let me boil this down for you in simple language for you smooth brain apes The Mission Statement GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences the successful and durable players of tomorrow will be technology first companies that specialize in gaming products experiences and services The Landscape Explosive Growth in the Gaming Industry The size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2 5x since the last console cycle The global gaming market expected to be 174 9 billion this year and reach 217 9 billion by 2023 Valuable Assets Existing strong brand and recent Reddit frenzy is net positive to the brand increases awareness and strengthens its base Large customer base and 55 million PowerUp members Large retail and physical footprint The Roadmap Evolve into a Technology first company Technology is changing nearly every aspect of the gaming world ranging from the way gamers shop to how they interact and compete with one another GameStop will have to begin building a powerful e commerce platform that provides competitive pricing broad gaming selection fast shipping and a truly high touch experience that excites and delights customers Ryan successfully executed this vision with Chewy and he can do it again in gaming GameStop will have to hire the right talent So far Ryan has recruited 5 rock stars from Chewy and Amazon to join the team more on that later Create the Ultimate Gaming Platform Shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors Create a marketplace of wanted products and services i e Amazon Target App Store Provide and expand larger gaming catalogs Capture all games Create community experiences This could be both physical and digital experiences Provide streaming services New vertical opportunity for content creation tournaments and others Support Esports Expanding scene that is not going away Transition to Digital Industry developments in recent years include transition from physical hardware to digital streaming and the explosion of mobile Expand digital content This needs to be a focus as it s competing against Steam Blizzard App Store etc Allow online trade ins This would be a game changer Cut Excessive costs Cut its excessive real estate costs and identify duplicative under performing stores and plan to forgo lease renewals Streamline Non core operations in Europe and Australia in order to reduce losses and potentially generate cash Near term increases in cash flow stemming from the console cycle can also help finance the future The Financials Analysts are valuing GameStop as a traditional brick and mortar business If Ryan can properly execute and transform the company I believe they can become the Target and Chewy of Gaming with potential verticals of streaming and Esports not factored into this calculation for now GameStop makes roughly 8 Billion in Revenue however it is currently valued at a 3 5B Market Cap as it bleeds cash Target makes roughly 78B in Revenue with 3 3B in Net Income and a Market Cap of 96 Billion Chewy makes roughly 4 8B in Revenue losing money but growing quickly and is valued at 44B in Market Cap Target and Chewy are valued at 1 25x to 9x Price to Sales respectively This equates to 10B to 72B Market Cap transposed to GameStop Obviously this is very simplistic and does not consider their balance sheet and other factors but given these metrics GameStop stock price potential is between 143 to 1 032 a share based on a current revenues Note this is assuming 8B in Revenue If GameStop can grow revenues focus on digital to improve margins and expand within the growing total addressable market I see potential for higher prices and achieving Target to Chewy like multiples The X Factor I believe Ryan Cohen was offered to lead GameStop s transition with significant control and autonomy Otherwise I do not believe he would have joined the Board In his letter Ryan simply stated that RC Ventures is not interested in receiving a lone seat on GameStop s ten member Board It is not enticing to become an isolated stockholder advocate on a Board that has overlooked years of digital revenue opportunities and presided over massive value destruction without assuming full accountability With the recent additions of two Chewy Executives to the Board of Directors a new Chief Technology Officer who was the Engineering Lead in Amazon Web Services a new Customer Care Executive from Chewy and a new Fulfillment Executive from Amazon I believe Ryan is executing his vision and revamping the GameStop team Notice his hires are from Chewy and Amazon Ryan Cohen was obsessed with Amazon s customer centric philosophy and built Chewy to follow that same model He is hiring digital and e commerce focused leaders to manage this transformation Ryan s customer centric obsession is what allowed Chewy to beat Amazon If GameStop pivots to digital and follows that same obsession this will be a great opportunity to win Furthermore I believe Ryan s vision is the right roadmap for GameStop Digital e commerce streaming and mobile is the future and Ryan fully acknowledges and embraces that future GameStop will need to revamp and modernize their website and phone app but I am sure that will follow in the months ahead GameStop has the financial and brand assets that should weather this storm but execution will be key Ryan owns nearly 10 of GameStop so he has a vested interest in its success and has much more to lose than my stake So degens I say think with your heart and not with your smooth brain Strap in and sit tight this rocket ship may turn into a long journey to Mars Maybe Papa Elon will be our catalyst P S If we all buy something from GameStop this quarter we can load this rocket ship ourselves TLDR Ryan Cohen is Jesus Buy and Hold GME

imo and unnoticed player in the cryp to world Its share price is now 7 44 actually 4 few days ago I am writing this post because I think this stock has potential for a huge profit when comparing to stocks already grew up like MARA 38 and RIOT 49 I am certain that SOS can actually hit 30 in the near future TL DR at the bottom Cryp to is getting more and more attention when Cathie Wood and Elon Musk being bullish on it Tesla bought about 1 5b of BitC and is going to accept it as a payment method BitC hit its ATH and helped MARA and RIOT As BitC s price going up it will also help SOS to the

fc0864d7ea0440dd665fd352d61877c40bb3e198 When comparing MARA or RIOT to SOS you can find that SOS has only gone up around 250 actually only 100 few days ago when MARA RIOT going up over 1500 and 1100 respectively in the last three months SOS is just a train with untapped potential When comparing MARA or RIOT to SOS then we can see that SOS has been unnoticed so far and with those two companies going up over 1500 and 1100 respectively in the last three months while SOS has only gone up around 200 This is just untapped potential and I hope you get on the train while it s still in the station

484 million Take a look at others like MARA and RIOT MARA currently has a market cap of 3 6b and RIOT has a 3 3b market cap With the catalysts I will mention below I can see SOS going at least 5x this year from the current price For the sake of being conservative I will only give it a price target of 30 Market cap 2b About SOS Limited SOS is an emerging block chain based and big data driven marketing and solution provider with a nationwide membership base of approximately 20 million in China Recently SOS has outlined its strategy in block chain and cryp to which include a series of initiatives to expand its business into cryp to mining as well as cryp to security and insurance The core infrastructure of SOS marketing data technology and solutions to insurance and emergency rescue services is built on big date block chain based technology cloud computing AI satellite and 5G network etc We have created a SOS cloud emergency rescue service software as a service SaaS platform with three major product categories basic cloud cooperative cloud and information This system provides innovative marketing solutions to clients such as insurance companies financial institutions medical institutions healthcare providers auto manufacturers security providers senior living assistance providers and other service providers in the emergency rescue services industry

industry SOS is the first cryp to insurance cryp to bank and on top of that they re also mining cryp to They re mining BitC and Ether Their goal is to be the first complete cryp to institution Recently they just bought a cloud computing company which is capable enough to mine 3 4 BitC daily and over 50 Ether Now with the rising value of cryp to their revenue is only going to keep going up Announced on February 5th SOS Ltd entered a framework agreement with Leibodong Hydropower station in Heijang to secure cheap and renewable electricity for its cloud cryp to mining center Adding on top of that February 9th they announced their receipt of 5000 pcs of Mining rigs which arrived ahead on schedule This rigs can generate about BitC Hash Power 175P and Ether Hash Power 350G If these machine operates as expected the annual ROI return on investment is projected to be significant based on the current cryp to price momentum The seller also confirmed that they have enough inventories of cryp to mining rigs and that they can fulfill the next two batches of shipments as scheduled SOS Chairman Yandai Wang commented we have secured supply of cryp to mining equipment that is expected to generate sufficient cryp to hash power to allow us to promptly capture the rising cryp to price SOS actually purchased 15645 Mining Rigs They have another 10645 Mining Rigs on the way which will provide good news as catalysts in the future when they arrive From my understanding MARA only has near amount of mining rigs right now but is valued at 10x SOS current price SOS just announced a 110 million direct offering on 12 Feb This sent the price down to 5 48 13 before it promptly skyrocketed back up to close at 7 44 up 18 from the previous day despite the offering SOS has announced intent to acquire FXK Tech Corporation FXK a Canadian based company specializing in the block chain technology consulting and operations and support for cryp to exchanges and cloud cryp to algorithmic power exchanges to further extend SOS ecosystem of block chain and cryp to as well as to expand its operations to North America Financials SOS Ltd s balance sheet is just beautiful Here we can see that they have a really good amount of cash in hand to improve and their debt is only 200k amp x200B Processing img 5ew5f8alnah61 Market cap is 484m with the share price of 7 44 as of market close 12 02 2021 If we take a look at the performance of the stock we can see that it hasn t had its boom yet unlike MARA and RIOT who have gained over 1000 in the last few months This gives me more confidence that there might be a breakout soon when more people find out about this company SOS is projected to make more than 277k USD day in revenue once all 15645 Mining Rigs are running This is projected from the current cryp to prices Actually it s only 200k USD day before tesla bought BitC the price of BitC is going up So you can understand the potential SOS Technical indicators The technical indicators are also looking positive We re seeing a good volume increase which usually indicates a breakout soon and it getting more traction We recently just broke the last resistance ceiling as well and we are in a continuous upwards trend at the moment Volume increase is also usually a bullish indicator Summary TL DR SOS Ltd is a stock which has not boomed yet or just started to boom maybe in this bull market We still have chance to get on the train before it SOS has a great balance sheet and positive technical indicators showing an upwards trend at the moment SOS s revenue will increase by each year as we can expect BitC and Ether to soar in the next few years probably even few months as BitC just hit a new ATH BitC has a lot more confidence now growing as well since the most well known and richest man on Earth Elon Musk just invested into BitC worth 1 5b With good performance this week we can expect it to do better in the future Let s Position 1800 5 5 Unfortunately for those reading this post but not yet holding SOS this post maybe a little bit late SOS announced an offering on Friday yesterday so it was the best time to buy the dip although it actually close at up 18 finally I bought in at 5 5 yesterday I am 90 sure that SOS will blow up next week and it may be hard to find an entry point It somehow managed to with offering news I am not a financial advisor nor is this investment advice

Well as I predicted they kept the price over 50 so that the stack of 10 000 yes ten thousand options Put contracts didn t get executed That tells me that they aren t just tanking the price and that they are playing the options spread at the moment It also tells me that they are scared shitless of shares needing to be delivered and taken off of the open market They d rather keep the price boosted over 50 to stop delivery than to risk an extra 1 000 000 shares getting into long hands But thankfully that also let s us know that they re still playing the game If they were giving up and going into all or nothing mode they wouldn t give a shit about the deliveries They d either flood the market with 25 000 000 FTDs while tanking the price to cover at 20 while hoping they have enough left over for the fines Or they d cash out what they have left now and file for bankruptcy while leaving the clearing houses to pay the bad debt No they re still planning on finding the cheapest way out of this without any or minimal legal trouble That means we re still getting paid Eventually I ve been watching this for a while now and I think I ve gotten a hand on what they are doing This coming week will be the tell all And I m going to explain why I believe the price can only go up So Let s crunch the 2 19 option chain and see where this train is headed This Week oooon Gaaaaaame Theeeeory queue intro music Current price 52 Put ITM 59 434 Put OTM 346 288 Call ITM 29 930 Call OTM 87 111 At Current Price a total of 89 364 option contracts are ITM Now let s look at possible price movement See they are keeping Gee em eee at the line of demarcation between the single dollar price change contracts 41 42 43 et al And the five dollar price change per contract 50 55 60 et al That means that for every dollar that the stock drops it executes a new Put option contract But it would need to climb five dollars to execute a new call option That s why I told you in the last thread that they are playing between the 50 54 99 range all week See because of the contract price structuring it actually costs them MORE to knock the price down any lower Allow me to explain Lets look at both the Call and Put sides of the option chain And for the nearest 10 swing in prices There are 29 337 Put Options for 40 50 strike There are 2 459 Put Options for 51 59 strike There are 13 187 Call Options for 40 50 strike There are 3 066 Call Options for 51 59 strike Now lemme explain why I believe this matters in predicting where the price is going to drift this week If the price were to drop by 10 the net difference would be an ADDITIONAL 16 150 options that would be executed because of the contract price structuring 10 Put Options would become in the money Conversely if the price went UP by 9 the net difference would be 507 extra contracts that would be able to be executed Because of the price structuring only two new Call Option strikes would be able to be executed between 55 59 If we were to just look at the next five Put Option contracts below the current strike price it equals up to 22 175 That means if the price were to DROP 5 they would need to find delivery for an EXTRA 2 217 500 shares If the price were to go UP by 5 they would only need to find 85 600 extra shares to cover the extra contracts that would be ITM at 55 Let me say that again If the price goes DOWN It takes MORE shares off the market because of the Put Options going in dollar increments while the Call Options go up in 5 increments It is also interesting to note that ending the week at 59 would cause less deliveries than ending at 55 My hypothesis They can t hold the price at 50 this upcoming week simply due to the lack of shares available and the buyer demand staying so consistent We only had 12mil 13mil volume the last two days The shares are drying up So if they can t hold the price steady they need to decide which direction to move it And based on the math moving the price UP would save the shorts money by causing the lesser of two evils in extra deliveries But one thing is for sure They can t let the price tank any lower this upcoming week It would trigger too many new deliveries There s actually some serious game theory that says the best move to trigger the squeeze would be for us to ALLOW the price to drop to exactly 39 99 at close of next week as odd as that seems So what s my non financially advising crystal ball predict that this weeks close will be on 2 19 58 47 They are going to allow some big single day swings Tuesday and Wednesday to send the stock price from 52 up to tickle the 60 mark so that they can go balls deep selling 60C Premium And then they will hold the price just below the line The next target after that would be 69 giggity as there is a large off set of Calls vs Puts at 70 that would cause the delivery equilibrium to start going net positive again I just don t think they re going to let us get 19 in a single week as that would cause retail
