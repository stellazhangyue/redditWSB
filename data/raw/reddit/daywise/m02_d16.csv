Got it You don t want to mess with commodity futures No problem there are more than enough stocks and ETFs proxies through which you can place your bets But before tackling tickers let s talk fundamentals and let me lay out the bullish case for commodities specifically industrial metals steel copper aluminum rare earth metals Commodity Super cycle Commodities go through cycles of booms and bust following economic cycles of activity and inflation Growth and inflation make commodities go uppies and recessions or periods of slower economic growth coupled with deflationary pressures make commodities go tits up Specifically commodities tend to rise rapidly when the economy goes into overdrive mode so towards the second half of economic expansions This is because as the economy accelerates the supply for raw materials can t keep up with the demand leading to price escalations up to a point where demand has to correct abruptly causing a recession Then commodity prices free fall as the economy goes through deflation and investment typically shifts towards innovation and disruptive tech preparing for the new cycle Then the economy eventually recovers and starts to slowly pick up speed and the new cycle is in You can see that post 2000 coinciding more or less with the pop of the com bubble was the start of a rally in commodities Chart 1 Chart 1 US commodity price index

pretty long period of economic deflationary stability and then accelerated going into the 2000s As inflation started to pick up investment flew out of tech and into commodities given the demand for them was massive There was massive GDP growth coming from the BRICS the com tech creating more jobs and more income household and massive lending growth backed by the US housing market the economy was leveraged to the tits all this strong tangible this is crucial more on that later economic activity generated a lot of demand for raw materials as houses and factories were built cars were manufactured cities rose all around the world particularly in Asia and so commodity prices went uppies Of course the economy was overleveraged and like most FDs you hold for too long it went tits up real quick at the expiration date The recession post GFC sent commodities down and when there was economic recovery commodities stayed pretty low Why was that Deflationary pressures coming from a risk averse banking system and an increasingly efficient high tech driven economy could be a place to start But from a cycle perspective this was still the first half of the economic expansion following the recession and there was still too much deflation for commodities to pick up real momentum Of course when March 2020 hit and everything went tits up what little momentum commodities had was instantly lost as the entire world economy went through a massive deflationary bust Suddenly nothing moved and nothing was built and so there was barely any demand for commodities But now that we begin to recover from the pandemic are things any different than they were prior to it If before the dreadful 2020 commodities were cheap why would they begin to rally in 2021 I ll begin by analyzing what is going on right now with commodities from a technical perspective and then I ll give you what I think is the why behind it Sounds good Let s dive into it then What s the technical outlook Being guilty of serious crayon eating to the point of literally shitting colors every weekend I never build a thesis without some technical ANALysis so let s look at a few charts to see where we are in the cycle technically and then I ll make the fundamental argument for the industrial metals reversal Chart 1 showed that we are at exceptionally low price levels and it also shows that commodities don t tend to stay at those prices very long However is a reversal going on right now For this no need to go back to Napoleonic Wars let s just look at the last decade or so There is in fact a technical reversal in commodities going on and it would be confirmed if we get above 90 100 on the BCOM Chart 2 The Coom berg Commodity Index tracks commodity prices Chart 2 Coom berg Commodity Index BCOM https

tend to move in unison so it is expected from steel and in the case of an index companies working along the steel supply chain to have a similar price action to the BCOM Indeed you can see on Chart 3 that it s the same breakout of the multi year trend Chart 3 ARCA Steel Index STTL Processing img ub7trgae8ph61 What about copper Yeah the same thing but more extended than its industrial metal peers Chart 4 due to the fact there has been quite a few strikes going on causing a supply shock but I also believe people understood the vital role of copper in the EV industry and in de carbonization more on that later a few months before they realized most industrial metals were going to go along the same path Chart 4 US Copper Index Fund CPER Processing img 2bwl1t5i8ph61 As you would expect other industrial metals such as aluminum follow similar patterns While WSB was screeching GME except Steel Bros you guys nailed it industrial metals were rallying and are now at their inflection point or past it in the case of copper for example So why is any of this happening While we re still on a crayon eating binge let s have a look at the 5 yr forward inflation expectations chart Chart 5 Ok so consumers and businesses are expecting prices to increase at a higher rate 5 years from now and believe inflation will be over 2 in 2025 Do you see a similarity with the BCOM That s because commodities and inflation go hand in hand as I explained previously While inflation is not sitting over 2 right now it is expected to be in the future and commodity traders and hedge funds are already placing their bets so the market is adjusting ahead of time as it should Chart 5 5 yr Forward Inflation Expectation Rate https preview redd it pp39er5m8ph61 png width 1168 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 543768ae6d5f09e89eb809ba7c4985707db69ab1 But isn t inflation good for all equities If we were to rely solely on inflation expectations why would commodities be a better move than say tech My belief is that the huge rally that has been going on with Big Tech for years was fueled by deflation not inflation Our economy has only become more and more efficient given all of the technological innovation that has been going on think of automation leaving people out of work with less income and driving prices down This is good for tech but it is rather deflationary so when I hear inflation expectations are up significantly it makes me rather neutral to bearish on tech and much more bullish on commodities For now let s have a look at Chart 6 a ratio between the S amp P500 and the PPI the log of that actually The way to interpret this is the following when the ratio is going up stocks in general are beating commodities and when it is going down commodities are beating stocks Obviously this excludes stocks which revenues rely on commodities since those stocks would typically be up when commodities are up ex metal processing stocks mining stocks etc Periods of inflation are better for commodities than for stocks and vice versa for deflationary phases It doesn t necessarily mean stocks will go down when inflation runs higher but commodities will tend to outperform the market One extreme case of this was the com bubble pop which immediately made commodities more attractive than stocks and coincided with the start of an inflationary period that lasted until around the GFC Chart 6 S amp P 500 PPI log amp x200B https preview redd it me3zn6sq8ph61 jpg width 1372 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s f73bf6327287e80202491966eb1d8da994337d40 So by looking at this chart seeing that we have been in a prolonged period of relative deflation recognizing that equities are pretty overextended as of right now compared to commodities and noting that inflation expectations are up meaning a new wave of inflation might be forming ahead I would argue that solely based on this there exists an arbitrage opportunity short tech long commodities But shorting tech is rather wild and if you are a conflicted bull that knows the tech rally must be approaching its end but you won t go full u Variation Separate you might as well just long commodities while reducing your tech exposure or at least add some of that sweet sweet coom modity to your folio as a hedge This concludes our technical analysis for now Congrats if you ve made it this far and managed to keep your rectum intact you ve survived Now why is this taking place now In other words why are inflation expectations up now as opposed to a year or two from now Why is the BCOM breaking out of its multi year downtrend right now while we re still mostly on lockdown when it s been falling for years under a normal economy Calling a bottom is as hard as calling a top but while sometimes bubbles pop out of sheer exhaustion it is rarer for prices to rebound after years of downtrend without any catalyst So what s the catalyst then Is it just Grandpa Buyden and his big long and beautiful stimulus or is there something else What s the fundamental outlook Now comes the juicy part This is the sauce this is what you came looking for and this is what will hopefully give you the confirmation bias you need and deserve The question we must ask ourselves is the following are the conditions for a commodity rally more precisely in industrial metals met or be met in the near future In other words is there right now or will there be in the near future a supply and demand imbalance in industrial metals If we look at the charts it appears there is one given the rally we ve had in the past weeks but this could just be speculation right Or maybe there was one but now it s all priced in I ll try to give you reasons for the current imbalance as well as reasons for further imbalances in the future that will likely end up causing a multi year rally similar to ones before think 1970s 2000s The reasons are the following Buyden s Stimulus Plan Going Green China s Infrastructure Spending China s Accumulation of Metals India increasing CapEx spending Wealth Redistribution Policies and Years of Low CapEx in the Commodity Complex I ll split these into 2 groups the demand side and the supply side Demand Buyden s Stimulus Plan and Going Green Now I know bears will say this is blasphemy They will say fiscal policy won t spur inflation no matter how much spending the government has never had any success creating inflation and it won t this time either I hear you and I agree untargeted and irresponsible spending has never had any success in generating any kind of sustainable inflation But are we going to ignore the fact that this is 1 9 trillion another 2 trillion for infrastructure Are we going to ignore the fact that Yellen believes this can achieve FULL EMPLOYMENT by 2022 Full employment people in one year This would be an economy on fucking steroids and the price of going into full employment in such a short period of time is inflation I just can t see supply being able to adjust to such an increase in household income in such a short period of time that is if full employment is really to be achieved Now full employment could be a pipe dream it could be yet again another game Yellen is playing to get inflation expectations moving and banks lending but the sheer possibility of it is enough for the economy to move in that direction Full employment would be the overdrive mode I talked about previously and that would set the stage for a big rally in commodities Let me also add that some republicans who opposed Buyden s plan did so on grounds that it would cause runaway inflation and that such a risk outweighed all of its benefits It s all politics so it doesn t mean anything on its own but it can give some idea of the magnitude of how much spending is going on Regarding industrial metals like steel copper aluminum and even silver Buyden s infrastructure spending is of course bullish 52 of all steel produced ends up being used for infrastructure projects so the infrastructure plan aiming at re building a greener US is very bullish for steel New infrastructure new housing new buildings and facilities of all kinds is obviously very good for industrial metals The fact it is meant to be a green plan is particularly bullish for copper think of batteries wiring etc which has already strongly reacted to this This in itself is good but I think it has the potential to have much more growth because it might initiate a bigger modernization wave across all industries as they strive to go green Just like the US I can see governments around the world taking the same path not only because it is good politically as more and more people care about the planet but because it is a matter of remaining competitive in the future world economy The automobile industry is going through this change and ALREADY there is a supply problem Everybody speaks about the semiconductor shortage but I think this is just a symptom of a much larger supply issue that is looming ahead Think about all the factories semiconductor producers will have to build from the ground up to meet demand in the coming years Some won t be ready before 2025 What about the famous Elon s battery gigafactories Approximately 100 of them will be necessary to supply the entire world with clean energy according to his autist brain love you Papa and I assume it is only to meet the current world s energy demand wait until India and eventually Latin America finalize their industrialization How many other ambitious projects similar to these will come in the future given all the investment that has been pouring into tech for nearly a decade What I m getting at here is that going green will cause a structural change in demand quoting Goldman I typically inverse them but not this time lol for industrial metals as there will be A LOT of changes in manufacturing infrastructure and a good part of it will have to be built from scratch This isn t related to going green but what about all the innovation going on with 3D printing Eventually there will be large 3D printers that will print out houses and buildings but they will necessitate gigantic factories to build them so they can build other buildings You find that funny don t you It s going to fucking happen dude someday No but seriously all of the crazy innovation that has been going on during the last deflationary years all of the ARK shit all of that will eventually have to be built using unconventional and new manufacturing meaning you guessed it more manufacturing infrastructure will have to be built from scratch causing inflation in industrial metals since the demand will largely outpace the supply like it happens every fucking time And that s the super cycle It s the supply of material resources of one economic phase not being able to keep up with the innovation driven demand from the previous phase causing prices to escalate during the growth phase It happened in the 1970s it happened in the 2000s and it ll happen again sooner rather than later imo Gyna Doubling down on infrastructure spending and accumulating industrial metals Say what you will about the china men but they know what s up They understood before anyone that transitioning into a sustainable greener economy was not nearly as much a moral duty as it was the premise for economic competitiveness Only now is the US beginning to catch up to what China has been doing for years invest in infrastructure to enable the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy When the rest of the world was caught up in the GFC mess instead of having to prop up its financial system China invested even more in infrastructure and construction jobs Regarding metals accumulation it is perfectly understandable They must think they will need them in the future and that they will be much more valuable a few years from now otherwise they wouldn t be accumulating and producing them like crazy In the case of crude steel production China s production accounted for 53 3 of the world s production in 2019 versus 46 6 in 2009 They have been ramping up production probably in anticipation of a surge in demand and I don t want to bet against them because so far they seem to know what they re doing India to increase CapEx spending Did you forget about India the second largest country by population size New roads new power grids new rails new pipelines new housing and new healthcare infrastructure are part of the Indian government s plan to augment the country s infrastructure as part of the Union Budget for 2021 22 Most of the country is still rural and therefore lacks infrastructure a problem the government is attempting to fix by increasing capital expenditure spending Do you see what is going on World leaders are killing 2 birds with one stone here They are using infrastructure spending as a springboard to achieve post pandemic economic recovery thereby not only putting their economies back on their feet but also addressing an issue that had to be dealt with anyway a lack of new modern and greener infrastructure This is wildly bullish on industrial metals if you ask me because other countries are likely to follow the same path Wealth Redistribution Policies Give a wealthy man a mil and he ll invest it boomer dividend stocks like the rest of his 10 million dollars since he already has a dream house a dream car and unluckily for him he can t buy a dream wife on the open market so in the meantime he ll strive to get richer Give a wagie a mil and he ll spend it faster than it takes a WSB degen to YOLO his paycheck on some 0dte FDs The marginal propensity to consume of lower income households is much higher than that of higher income households so because wealth redistribution effectively shifts income from investment to consumption it is typically inflationary Wealth redistribution has been part of the Democrats agenda for a long time and is also a component of the Covid Relief bill Furthermore with the likes of AOC gaining more and more traction among younger generations AOC simps in particular I can see these types of policies gain much more momentum in the future given the current wealth gap is pretty abysmal and has the potential to cause social unrest if it is undealt with And what about rising wages I don t think the 15 national minimum wage is going to materialize itself anytime soon but there is nevertheless a push for wage raises undergoing again courtesy of the dems This is again mainly beneficial to lower income families and leads to a much more commodity intensive economy as a larger part of the population is able to afford housing home appliances automobiles etc than previously This is obviously inflationary as well Supply Low Capital Expenditure in the Commodity Complex This is a key component of the super cycle thesis What causes the rally in industrial metals is not only the sudden increase in demand but also the fact supply is unprepared We know the industry that has been suffering from underinvestment for years and will unlikely be able to adjust to demand quickly enough Since commodity prices started falling after the GFC there s been a dramatic decrease in capital expenditure for metal processing companies miners and industrials as you would expect during a recession add to that the manufacturing crisis Furthermore CapEx growth never came back to 2008 highs and has just been further dipping during the last decade and even went negative following the pandemic adverse demand shock in the case of steel for example Producers had to outright cut back on investment just to keep their operating activities afloat Although global capacity in industrial metals is still big enough to meet the demand today given the state of the industry after the pandemic blow I don t think there will be overcapacity again like there was prior to 2019 2020 since the industry was momentarily weakened in the past months This is precisely when prices tend to bottom and then only does investment starts returning back into the industry anticipating higher prices and eventually margins improve when prices and the industry do recover but with fewer players in it Chart 7 shows this cycle I believe we are currently at the Prices bottom phase and already we are seeing mining and metal processing stocks up Investors are already expecting higher metal prices and profit margins and investment is starting to flow back into the industry Chart 7 Metals investment cycle https preview redd it evjnfh7p9ph61 jpg width 600 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 0a43a4d8f65249601808992c4268d8899f2a2fa6 Bottom Line Listen here s the deal we are about to have a manufacturing boom There I said it Come at me bears except tech bears though The US China and India are betting on huge infrastructure projects and we re talking huge bets Trillions I believe the private sector is not gonna stand idle they will follow and will also make massive manufacturing investments to turn around their businesses so they can be competitive in this new high tech environmentally sustainable economy This is big As the demand for these types of massive investments goes up interest rates will start increasing this is not happening overnight we re talking in a while and then banks will be more than happy to lend at the right price right now they just won t do it they re not getting their risk s worth Lending growth As manufacturing starts rolling again there will be more jobs and GDP growth Full employment could very well happen but realistically it will take more than a year might still happen though Overdrive mode More employment means more income and with redistribution policies in place more of that income will be spent back into the economy driving prices up Inflation Meanwhile you have a metals industry that is lagging the economy as it did not receive the kinds of capital flows tech has enjoyed for a decade Lack of raw materials supply This generates a continued multi year upward pressure on industrial metals prices That s the super cycle trade investing where there is underinvestment in anticipation of the demand that s coming ahead And look at it as an asymmetric bet since you don t stand that much to lose with commodity prices this low How much lower can they really get And you know they ll rebound eventually so you can double down if they dip again and that s what makes the trade so interesting Ask yourself when the tech bubble pops where is that money going to go We ve gone over this amp x200B

metals tickers you are bullish on Steel Sector As I said before 52 of all steel demand comes from infrastructure projects so the fact governments around the world are investing like crazy in

commodity play I think it s not only a good commodity play but also a good industrial play As opposed to Gold which is purely an inflation hedge at best silver has actual industrial applications Anyway you know the tickers for silver there s been more than enough shilling on them Copper Sector Copper being an excellent electrical conductor will likely have the most intense rally amongst metals in the coming years The EV industry especially but all other industries that will strive to go fully electrical and clean will demand huge quantities of it Think of all the electrical wiring

paragraph At current price level 126 share P E of 12ish DGX is the closest thing you can find to guaranteed tendies Will it be a 10 bagger While possible probably not However it is a virtual lock for a double up play trading calls It isn t often you come across a stock with minimal potential headwinds i e risk ya autists a strong reputation over a billion of on hand and coming off of consecutive Qs of record revenue growth and margin expansion THAT IS TRADING AT ROUGHLY HALF THE P E of many competitors Also some 52 week price performance 1 QDEL 185 2 LH 27 1 3 DGX 13 4 Ok I don t know what P E ratio is jackass I joined WSB 3 weeks ago What else ya got Oh plenty Just starting with the very basic stuff I ll even avoid deeper analytics since I know you all would just breeze past em anyway Recent Earnings Call amp Guidance 2 4 21 Historically Q4 is a down Q for DGX because people aren t running to the doctors and undergoing procedures during the holiday season Granted I schedule all of my appointments during this time to avoid the in laws but apparently I m in the minority Anyway DGX actually beat lofty expectations in Q4 and drastically raised guidance for the first 6 months of 2021 Key items Beat estimated Revenue by 2 73 EPS 5 7 Quarter Revenue growth yoy over 55 Earnings over 120 Announced additional ONE BILLION with a B authorization in share repurchases This is in addition to 900m previously approved Quest is approved for nearly TWO BILLION in share repurchases for 2021 More importantly the c suite flat out stated they planned on being aggressive in repurchasing during the year after pulling back in 2020 during the call 1 In 2020 DGX only repurchased 325m https ycharts com companies DGX stock buyback https ycharts com companies DGX stock buyback 2 As previously mentioned they are sitting on a boatload of cash especially after more government AR converts 3 Their CEO is a dinosaur He will be using almost all of this TWO BILLION authorization Increased dividend by 10 Great continued improvements in serology area NOTE This company is notoriously CONSERVATIVE in their projections Sandbagging pricks THE ONE amp ONLY CONCERN The reason this stock constantly runs up into earnings and then ticks lower despite large beats is solely due to their base testing lagging behind typical performance due to COVID The market is acting as if the COVID faucet will just get shut off in the snap of a finger soon and then the base testing will take time to return Does this sound right to you This line of thinking is laughably absurd and na ve Reasons After a year of this shit there is a massive backlog of people procedures that will be completed after more of the pop is vaccinated We haven t even seen a DGX Q performance with strong base testing AND COVID yet Q1 of 2021 will be the first Book it COVID Testing Rampant testing isn t going anywhere anytime soon As of Jan 26th all international flights require a COVID test to return obviously DGX LH etc are facilitating much of this work Then rumors swirled this week that negative tests could potentially become required to fly even domestically Millions of students remain out of school reminder the current vaccines are mostly for age 16 So expect strict testing for students too during 2021 mandated by the crybaby teacher unions Sport leagues as well as I m sure not everyone will get the vaccine Political climate stimulus I m sure you all saw the CDC is now recommending double masking Hell I ve passed out four times writing this diatribe due to the 6 masks I m wearing Why does this matter For every bit a person feels the previous admin downplayed COVID the new admin is going 100 the opposite direction Considering the US is going to continue to pump trillions into the economy you can bet your ass all testing companies will benefit There will definitely be huge grants subsidies for enhanced serology procedures and research and of course in analyzing COVID further These testing companies have so much COVID data that will continue to be poured over as the pandemic lessens You can also bet there will be an increased focus on scanning checking for new viruses in the near future Do you think DGX is just going to light the enormous they ve made over the past 9 months and will continue to make for 2021 on fire Because that s what the current stock price growth reflects When in reality and in addition to the buybacks they will be targeting acquisitions in 2nd half 2021 and investing heavily in serology capabilities analysis VERY quick chart breakdown most of you prob don t chart a ton but doesn t take DFV to see the long sustained consolidation This is begging to jump upwards and it will by next earnings Even better outside of an overall market pullback there aren t any potential catalysts for a downward swing Worthless analyst commentary Most recently Citi upgraded PT to 158 on 1 29 POSITIONS Again I see VERY little risk in this move Worst Case PT

highway near you by the end of the year,TL DR buy Hyliion now before your wife s boyfriend becomes a millionaire AGAIN Skip to the bottom if you simply want to see the calculations on the journey to the moon not the reason Okay listen up you degenerates Yes you with the spaghetti hoops lined up in like an army on the prongs of your fork especially you I think it s about time you morons take some real information on board and use it to make your own damn decisions on the next hottest stock You can thank me in a years time when the tendies start coming out your arse Thanks to our friends at investorplace we have got all the info you need So here is a summary of their best bits on their article about Hyliion HYLN the company that wants to break through the Class 8 Truck industry with their disruptive technologies So HYLN had a pretty dramatic start to its life on Wall Street as a SPAC under Tortoise Acquisition It went from 15 to 50 in just 4 months and has since come crashing back down since the marketing team has been quiet while they have been creating what might be the ticket to the moon However the recent news is only the beginning of its climb back to 50 and and potentially even 200 in the next few years That s right a 15x is probably on the lower side from here Hyliion just announced a next generation battery module which broadly implies that its RNG technology is making progress Further it implies Hyliion s electric powertrains have significant advantages over legacy EV powertrains So Hyliion is a RNG Electric hybrid I ll make this quick On the upcoming Hypertruck ERX the on board battery is recharged by the usage of RNG as a fuel source RNG has many benefits and many reasons why it s better than all current available electric and or diesel vehicles Check em out RNG is carbon net negative uses methane Provides similar range to diesel trucks 729 RNG refuelling stations exist over North America already No expensive investments needed to get this puppy rolling unlike Nikola Hyliion trucks do more than just roll downhill Costs Current RNG prices hover around 1 per diesel gallon equivalent while hydrogen and electricity prices though steadily falling still sit staunchly north of 5 In an industry focused on minimising costs 80 cheaper sounds pretty damn alluring correct Thus by being a clean energy source with best range the lowest costs and an already established infrastructure RNG is the only immediately usable technology to decarbonize trucking fleets That s why Deloitte projects that by 2026 about 80 of all alternative drive systems in heavy duty trucks will be based on natural gas Sounds pretty fucking obvious what s going to happen doesn t it Well stay with me here you retard because it gets even more obvious It s like you re holding your wife s boyfriends hand while he gives you another unrelated son to look after Time to realise what s happening Just look at the numbers here Hyliion consistently outperforms rivals Nikola and Tesla The Hypertruck ERX sports the following Driving range of 1 300 miles 70 more than Nikola s hydrogen truck 750 miles and about 160 more than Tesla s semi truck 500 miles A payload capacity of 53 000 pounds 10 more than Nikola 48 000 pounds and 20 more than Tesla 43 000 pounds A full recharge time of just 10 minutes the same as Nikola s hydrogen truck and one third that of Tesla s semi truck 0 to 60 miles per hour pick up time of 20 seconds on par with Tesla s semitruck and 10 seconds shorter than Nikola s hydrogen truck The new battery that caused HYLN to be up 30 in a few hours on Thursday is something that Daddy Elon could only WISH he made himself this improved battery module is capable of up to 5X as much cycle life as a conventional EV battery can be recharged in under 8 minutes and allows for more than a 40 improvement in cooling compared to previous systems which allows for higher charge and longer sustained power output It s a powerful solution that could be the key to waking up investor interest in Hyliion stock Okay now for the share price forecast 1 7million heavy duty vehicles sold annually in the US Imagine 30 of these vehicles are powered by alternate fuels electric 500 000 a year Let s give HYLN a modest 20 of the market share this could EASILY be more considering it s the best option for costs and efficiency and that new Biden guy said the government is turning its fleet of vehicles green The company s internal financials imply average annual revenue per powertrain of over 60 000 while EBITDA margins at scale should rise toward 35 Under those assumptions Hyliion should clear 2 billion in EBITDA in 2030 High quality truck components suppliers can fetch a 15X EBITDA multiple That implies a potential future enterprise value for Hyliion of 30 plus billion versus a market cap of 3 billion today THIS IS A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE OF WHAT THIS COMPANY CAN BECOME Okay so while you all take out a second mortgage and ask your wife s boyfriend for some more money I ll summarise BUY HYLIION WHILE ITS CHEAP YOU MORONS Disclaimer this is not financial advice I am not a professional I am just sharing information about the company

that certain news can effect the whole market https www marketwatch com economy politics calendar Shiller P E is at 35 The Dollar is slipping People want only the riskiest shit and they are confident about it Be greedy but smart I m not saying the market is headed for a correction tomorrow but I can imagine a scenario where as soon as soon as the new blood sees a slight pull back they GUH the market to circuit breaker Most people lose money on the market so if you re thinking exactly like everyone else you re too late too slow and a sucker Contrarians and devils advocates feel mentally superior as they lose their money twice as fast they don t belong in the market Be adaptable and don t trade with emotion Think out your play think out your exit and remember that every day you decide to hold you are deciding to buy the same position don t get married to it CENTRAL BANK SHIT Since Jpow and Yellen have committed to bottoming out the interest rate at 0 there has been less attention surrounding the FOMC They have assured us that the rates are staying put and that they are willing to turn a blind eye to a bit of inflation On one hand Low rates and continued open market operations are EXPECTED and will assuredly help push up equity prices Any changes to this plan are supposed to be articulated well in advance so the fed will continue to add to its balance sheet and provide liquidity Since this is expected if it does happen expect negligible effects on the market On the other Inflation is hard to peg The support that the low rates have given to maximizing unemployment is weakening OMO s and the balance sheet can make the market happy but their effect is limited With the m2 money supply rapidly increasing another stimulus potentially just https www cnn com 2021 02 15 politics congress negotiations covid relief package index html 4 weeks away as well as prices in certain areas of the economy rapidly rising its POSSIBLE we see rapid inflation zoom right past 2 and measures introduced to curb it I am looking to see if the FOMC mins change their timeline for raising rates or their tune about inflation KIDS I ve see some kids on here looking for trading advice and what I d say to them is that their youth is their greatest asset And no I don t mean your money will have more time in the market if you have a brain you know that The younger you are the more receptive you are to new things so more new shit is pushed to you It s also done to make old people feel older https imgur com a KJOl9Uw Use your underdeveloped brain to detect the trends and things and ideas that the youngins are into because if it sticks to you guys then it slowly spreads If you re not the youth then you can only find that shit out when your little cousin laughs at you for not knowing about it CHEAP Looking for cheap plays in cheap stocks is the wrong way to go about it Instead look for the most solid play you can and then find a cheap way to play it Seeing the Russel 2000 and pennystocks take off makes me laugh and weep simultaneously Thinking that it s easier to 10X your portfolio off of the low cap stocks isn t necessarily true You re encumbering yourself with a lot of additional risk that is unknown compared to for example finding a less volatile play you re sure of and then getting leveraged to the tits Getting in early is how money is made though so if you re confident in your dollar menu play then you ll be eating IF I WASNT A BROKE NEET some plays I ve daydreamed lately include Nuclear you ve already heard don t have a ticker but when the magnetic field weakens and we need power this is the shit that will power us Old nuclear blows but the new shit is lit Just hope Salvatore Pais doesn t drop his ZPE SG 1 style cuz then anyone holding energy will get

get it but what goes up must come down and what goes down will eventually come screaming back up with the force of a thousand suns White girl Index Women make better traders then men and are also less

defends its call on metal trades after investor backlash html V Commodities Metals and Mines The March contraction reversed at breakneck pace to a bullish narrative as all indicators pivoted towards prolonged stronger economic activity Government policies have bolstered the consumer class with direct payments weakening the US dollar and driving inflation concerns as the world powers race towards renewable infrastructure to jump start their economies With service businesses suppressed with social restrictions consumer demand has shifted towards commodity heavier goods resulting in manufacturers with low inventory high backlogs and rising raw material costs Renewable infrastructure will remain a long term driver for capital expenditure as the US and China gear up for economic superiority while other major nations look to meet their own environmental pledges All these demand drivers are expected to be significantly accretive to metals and metals producers Metals prices are soaring and are expected to remain elevated for some time both on continued market demand as well as the devaluation of the US dollar under the government s upcoming spending agenda The markets on near zero interest rates are still unwinding the last two major stimulus bills from March and December and the Biden administration has an additional 1 9T and 2 0T planned with potentially more

mcs2021 copper pdf and nickel https pubs usgs gov periodicals mcs2021 mcs2021 nickel pdf all flat to lower versus last year Current miners can tap deeper into current capacity to produce at higher output however there will be no major development in new capacity at least for the near term until metals prices rise high enough to attract significant new investments into the sector Given high enough demand a supply bottleneck is a very real possibility VI Conclusion The pandemic induced recession was far worse than any previous downturn and it required a heavy handed government response to stabilize the economy The economic recovery is gaining momentum each day and the commodity landscape is primed for further growth as nations increasingly invest in infrastructure and the US dollar continues to weaken Both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs stated they see the beginnings of the next commodity supercycle and the US has yet to deploy nearly 4T in stimulus and infrastructure Renewable infrastructure has shown strong rate of returns and IRENA stated countries must double their annual infrastructure investment to remain on track to meet pledged targets Additionally the US China standoff has transitioned into an economic competition over EVs and renewable infrastructure Metals prices and miners are set to benefit immensely as major demand drivers act on constrained underinvested capacity due to a decade of bearish market activity These companies have pledged to funnel large portions of their newfound profits to shareholders through increased dividends and sizable buyback programs The most recent 900B stimulus in December has yet to fully unwind we have yet to see the impact of Biden s 1 9T stimulus and 2 0T infrastructure policy and concerns around inflation have never been higher All factors point towards heightened economic activity and heightened financial demand Inflation market demand and short supply all combined I see considerable upside for commodities metals and miners well into the future FCX 1 21c 32 MT 1 21c 25 VALE 1 21c 20 Tl dr Fed print metals go brrr https i redd it bxn2mf4bzoj41 jpg P S Mining Stocks https i imgur com

financial advice I am a moron You re a moron if you listen to me I ve been watching CETY for a couple weeks and think that something big could be about to take off Let s get right into it What is CETY CETY OTCQB is Clean Energy Technologies a company based in Cosa Mesta California that specializes in the recycling of waste heat into usable energy If you want a complete TLDR on CETY just skim through this presentation http cetyinc com wp content uploads 2021 02 CETY OTC Investor conference Presentation pdf from the investor meeting last week and make your own conclusions In September 2015 CETY purchased a handful of patents from GE The full details are on page 9 of the presentation but to summarize they are Fluid Flow in a Fluid Expansion Recovering Heat Energy Generating Energy from Fluid Expansion Waste Heat Recovery Systems Led by CEO Kambiz Mahdi CETY s goal is to be the leading company in designing building amp marketing clean energy products amp solutions focused on energy efficiency amp environmental sustainability These patents the current political climate being ripe for clean energy to take off and the projects CETY has coming up are brewing a perfect storm for CETY to rocket within the next 12 months CETY s headlining product is the Clean Cycle Magnetic Bearing Generator which they claim generates a gigawatt hour of electricity per year from wasted heat That s alot On top of that it runs at an industry topping 14 efficiency There are currently CETY installations in 101 locations across Europe 79 North Latin America 17 and the Pacific 4 These are mostly in the Biomass Landfill industry with some installations in Diesel Turbines and Industrial settings Let s talk about their main markets Asia Hainan Island China https www prnewswire com news releases cety completes setup of wholly owned subsidiary in hainan island china 301201425 html China has announced plans to transform Hainan into a tariff free hub for market expansion by 2050 and has given CETY a huge green light to work on it CETY has signed a deal with Shenzen Natural Gas to pilot heat recycling technologies Asia is by far the cleanest market for clean energy with massive growth expected in China and India over the next decade This is an incredible early sign and if this installation goes well could be a huge break for CETY North America 1540 Broadway New York City https www prnewswire com news releases 1540 broadway elects to go green with cety 300524879 html One of their first projects with the new technology back in 2017 this is one of their highest profile installations in the U S and could be a sign for greater success in the metropolitan green energy push In December 21 2020 Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act granting large tax credit to clean energy of which waste heat to power was specified This already good news is being followed by the Biden administration massive overhauls and funding to the U S s clean energy infrastructure Green energy is set for a huge takeoff over the next 4 years and CETY could greatly take advantage Europe An overwhelming majority of their installations are in biomass landfill applications across Europe and are set to continue growing that vast number of installations With Europe s 2030 climate change and greenhouse gas goals in place CETY is poised to remain successful in the European market All sounds great so far right Let s talk about some of the ugly CETY is kind of broke On their 2 11 21 SEC filing CETY reported that they had 7 406 cash in the bank You ve lost more on YOLO plays than CETY has in their account This is accompanied by 10mil in liabilities and debt and only 1 2mil in receivable accounts Overall CETY is running at a cash flow of net loss 2 5 mil annually Ouch These numbers aren t great and is why CETY is turning to investors This is why CETY is a risk it could explode globally with industry leading technology in the green revolution or go bankrupt Despite all this all the stars may be aligned for 2021 to be the year CETY takes off CETY s online presentation If you look up CETY across Reddit Stocktwits or Yahoo Finance you end up seeing a few familiar faces popping up It appears that a small group of people is very excited about this stock which can be trouble I have been observing this presence as I ve studied CETY and think that they are onto something legitimate and not just a pump n dump It is worth noting to always do your due diligence and yada yada There is currently a CETY investor s discord which houses many of these loudest voices across platforms Many of these guys claim to be long CETY since the patents have been purchased and are genuinely passionate about seeing the company succeed and stock price soar This does lead to a sense of digital advertising where you may see the same people commenting on eachother s post about CETY or the same people posting over and over again As an outside observer I think that CETY has enough going for it to be a true long play and not just a quick run up This is they type of company that could make you a millionaire if you re willing to hold for 5 years Or you ll lose everything and get conned by redditors That s life Summary CETY specializes in converting wasted heat into usable electricity and is poised to being a huge player in the green energy revolution of the next 10 years across Asia North America and Europe Their financials and history is a bit rocky but the stars are aligning for a massive turnaround Price target 1 by end of 2021

additional patents in the works as u Faraday27 said a myriad of new assays being formulated If they manage to toss in cancer screenings and more basic rapid diagnostics such that the machine is a one
