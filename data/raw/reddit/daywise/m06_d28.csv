The combination deals offered by the company for food and gaming credits give patrons a unique experience and all but ensure that revenue will continue to increase as store count reaches its targeted levels We re going to break down today s presentation into the following topics Introduction to Dave and Buster s PLAY Business model Current financial condition Growth Potential Catalyst for 2021 Dave and Buster s PLAY is a leading owner and operator of high volume venues in North America that combine dining and entertainment for both adults and families Founded in Dallas Texas in 1982 the core concept is to offer customers the opportunity to Eat Drink Play and Watch all in one location Eat and Drink are offered through a full menu of entrees and appetizers and a full selection of non alcoholic and alcoholic beverages Play and Watch offerings provide an extensive assortment of entertainment attractions centered around playing games and watching live sports After I lap you Tom I m

Buster s PLAY with a choice of four options to choose from this is the core business model that differentiates Dave amp Buster s from its competitors Patrons can dine in play amusement games in the midway have a seat at the bar or enjoy the big screen view of live sporting events Although the company acknowledges that it is in a competitive market it is also aware that there is no other competitor that can offer all the forms of entertainment that it provides in one single location My belief is that although customer experience from competition might be similar it is not of the same scale that Dave amp Buster s is able to deliver This is because of the company s direct import program Through this program Dave amp Buster s is able to acquire the latest amusement attractions games from foreign suppliers at discounted rates due to the company s size and buying power Since the company is a large buyer of amusement games they receive discounts that local competitors would not be eligible for This is essential to the business model and provides for a sizeable advantage over other venues attempting to offer similar services Because the company can acquire items for discounted prices it enjoys a whopping 89 3 gross margin in entertainment offerings This sector makes up 64 of the company s overall revenue Being that income from entertainment is the primary source of revenue for the company Dave amp Buster s is less reliant on its food offerings This means that during times of rising food costs the company is less exposed than it would otherwise be Live Feed from the Headquarters of Dave amp Buster s competitors https preview redd it 5z6le6jtnz771 png width 1200 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 8fbc5bc19d933946b6fd926c6a3879fbb68359fc Their Eat Drink Play and

There are also options available to diet conscious individuals such as vegetarian low calorie and gluten friendly delights Menu items are ever evolving reflecting the changing tastes of customers Drink Each location offers full bar service including a variety of beers hand crafted cocktails and premium spirits Play The company calls this area the midway It features a wide array of amusement and entertainment options of which some are exclusive to Dave and Buster s on a permanent basis This is the feature that the company feels most differentiates its brand from all others Watch All locations have multiple large screen televisions and high quality audio systems providing customers with a venue for watching live sports events and other immersive programming The company believes they have created an attractive and comfortable environment that includes a differentiated and interactive viewing experience for customers https preview redd it qc1opl15oz771 jpg width 952 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 78c7ab2885f1d17545e8c9cd57b22c20ceef82b0 Current financial condition Business for 2020 was significantly hampered by the economic conditions that resulted from the closures of public venues due to the Covid 19 pandemic Much reference is made in the company s annual report of the impact that the pandemic had on its business Based on Benjamin Graham s principles in his book The Intelligent Investor heavy emphasis should not be placed on a single year s earnings for a company If there were any year that this principle applied to most it would be fiscal 2020 due to the unusual circumstances resulting from the pandemic The real appeal for why I like the stock can be found when breaking down the numbers preceding fiscal 2020 There is a consistent pattern of growth year after year for as far back as financial statements have been released for the company When comparing the numbers from 2020 to 2013 there is a 222 increase in revenue from just that period of time alone This leads me to believe that Dave amp Buster s PLAY has a successful business model that is not only profitable but also expanding BRRRRRRRRR https preview redd it 9u15ank9oz771 png width 1752 amp format png amp auto webp amp s ae5d0e5dafc244695629871ba06222299bdec83c PLAY used proceeds from the issuance of senior secured notes along with its cash on hand to repay the principal balance of its term loan facility and borrowings under the revolving credit facility This point is of particular interest because it speaks to the credibility of a company when amid a pandemic it is able to pay down its existing debt and has not forsaken its responsibilities Another sign of enthusiasm for the financial outlook of the company is the opening of five new stores in the second half of 2020 We can rely on the numbers for prior years to conclude that an increase in the number of stores equals a proportionate increase in revenue and net income As of May 2 2021 business is getting back to usual for the company 138 out of 141 stores are operating in some capacity The company believes that through its financial restructuring initiatives of the past year it has sufficient liquidity to meet estimated cash flow needs and covenant compliance obligations for the future Growth Potential Internal studies and third party research suggest that the company has significant growth opportunities Dave amp Buster s expects to expand to over 230 stores in the future amp x200B https preview redd it dx047pufoz771 png width 1760 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3a4b7dbb4ea9c0a1f8dcfa704d7e81f1d28414f2 The company is well positioned to expand into new markets and expects that 2021 will be one of its best years The coming end of the covid 19 restrictions will bring about enthusiasm from the general public for the company s venues It will maintain a moderate pace of new store openings for the year and has its vision set for long term future growth A commitment to customer satisfaction weighs heavily on the company as it understands that positive experiences drive better return rates from customers Dave amp Buster s PLAY has consistently scored higher in customer satisfaction benchmarks year after year A part of the company s initiative to bring about additional store traffic is its loyalty rewards program Catalyst for 2021 Dave amp Buster s has invested time and resources in developing and implementing new technology platforms that will allow it to digitally engage customers Central to this effort is the company s investment in their mobile application platform The mobile application platform resolves to enhance existing customer satisfaction and attract new customers by providing exclusive offers and discounts Dave amp Buster s intends to launch a new loyalty program in 2021 which will be integrated into the mobile application to provide further functionality and accessibility to customers I believe this initiative will be huge for the company It will serve as a direct line for delivering offers amp coupons to individuals who download the mobile application Research has shown that customers are driven by discounts The likelihood of customers returning to stores increases significantly when coupons and offers give the customer an additional incentive to visit It is for these reasons that I believe Dave amp Buster s PLAY will thrive and continue to expand its presence in the years ahead TLDR PLAY is the one stop shop to eat play watch amp drink Its direct import program allows the company to cycle through the latest games and attractions for a fraction of the price given to its competitors PLAY is looking to expand into additional markets in the years ahead It provides its existing customers loyalty

TENDIES this week Strong contender for a 5 10 bagger Earnings ,GIS aka General Mills the company that has brought us classic pantry staples and beloved sugar laced comfort food since our childhoods such as Pillsbury Betty Crocker Cheerios Natures Valley Trix Lucky Charms Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Haagen Dazs ice cream has earnings this week Wednesday 6 30 BMO I ve been following this stock for some time and I believe there is a strong chance that it will rise sharply both in the run up to earnings and after GIS crushed it this past year charting record profits and they have also implemented a new restructuring program to invest in future growth At the time of this posting options are dirt cheap and IV is still low sitting around 20 So if this stock moves even a few percentage points you re looking at a strong multi bagger GIS has also been a staple in investors portfolios for decades due to their high dividend yield and continued growth so this is a great company to buy shares in as well Info on the stock and catalysts General Mills has been around since 1928 and went public in 1981 This company has been a beast for years in the food industry In 2019 alone the company had an annual revenue of 16 8 billion a 7 increase over the previous year In 2020 they increased yet again to 17 6 billion a further 4 5 increase They ve also branched out into the natural organic food market with their Cascadian Farms brand and in 2018 they acquired one of the best selling pet foods on the market Blue Buffalo which brought in over a billion dollars for them in 2020 alone Some bullish indicators on the stock Current average analyst target price for GIS is 64 with a high of 71 The price at the time of this posting is around 59 The dividend channel last week labeled GIS as oversold indicating strong upside Credit Suisse group recently set an outperform rating on the stock while 6 other analysts rated the stock a hold and 5 others rated it a buy Another interesting potential catalyst is the USDA acreage report that comes out on Wednesday which assesses corn and grain production Analysts are predicting that it will show that corn and grain yield are up big which should lead to a drop in commodities and a rise in GIS share price One of the main drivers which I think will be positive for this week s earnings is the news that came out last month that General Mills approved a new restructuring plan for the company A headline last month from food business news General Mills reshaping organization portfolio with an eye toward growth This is the shit that the market loves to hear Especially around earnings A lot of people are perplexed when a company s stock dips after earnings even when the report was great It s because a lot of what earnings is about is providing confidence in future growth through forward thinking initiatives Regarding the restructuring General Mills Inc is restructuring its business structure to capitalize on opportunities around digital data and technology and e commerce according to the company To be clear this is not simply a cost cutting exercise said Jeffrey L Harmening chairman and chief executive officer on May 20 during a virtual presentation at the BMO Capital Markets Farm to Markets Conference The goal of this initiative is to free up resources from parts of our organization and redeploy them into more growth facing areas such as digital and data and technology e commerce and strategic revenue management and other capabilities that are critical to our future success This is the type of talk that typically gives investors markets a massive hard on The restructuring plan will also include layoffs of around 1 000 employees For reference GIS has around 35 000 employees People who are new to the market might think that s bad news for the share price but in the cut throat capitalistic world of the USA it s actually the opposite When a profitable company like GIS announces layoffs as part of a restructuring initiative it s very bullish as the market will see it as the company cutting costs and freeing up money to invest in future growth Bottom line Playing earnings is always a risk Anyone who trades long enough will learn that the market is irrational and that is certainly exemplified during earnings calls A company will post a fantastic earnings report and the stock dips A company will post a shitty earnings report and the stock rockets However the run up to earnings itself can be highly profitable and if you want to minimize your risk you could consider closing your position before the report comes out However due to the reasons listed in this DD and GIS emphasis on future growth I think there s a strong chance this stock will shoot up both in the next couple days and also after earnings Cheerio let s fucking go Positions 7 16 62 5C 100 shares

and i can stay as an unemployed retard ,Paysafe PSFE poised to beat analysts estimates TLDR See summary at bottom With PSFE s daily short volume often in the 40 65 range many believe the share price is being tactically pinned down as 13F filings have steadily revealed more institutions taking large positions Joining noted fund managers David Tepper Aaron Cohen Dan Loeb and Leon Cooperman Wells Fargo s various funds have picked up 12 million shares and Blackstone has increased their holdings by an additional 37 million shares Some have calculated that share lockup rules have reduced the true available float to as little as 80 85 million shares causing the most recently reported short interest of 36 millions shares to have an outsized effect But shorts must be covered eventually A common theory given the regular 700K 2M block trades we ve seen is that aggressive shorting enables large funds to accumulate before Q2 ER which should beat estimates and before PSFE is added to the Russell 3000 Index next month Goldman Sachs also anticipates Paysafe s Russell 1000 inclusion which in light of their projected 100 billion in market share would likely be followed by other benchmark funds and ETFs carving out yet even more of the available float Along with now priced in fears of PE lockup expiration more on that below it s clear that PSFE s share price has also suffered from the Q1 report of YoY 5 quarterly revenue growth which no doubt disappointed the short term expectations of many impatient traders invited in by constant Cramer and Steve Grasso pumps It s understandable that over the last few months PSFE has reportedly experienced a large demographic shift away from younger shareholders indicating a transition to a steadier long term investor base But that 5 number may have been misleading to some who didn t bother to look under the hood Paysafe not only upgraded the low end of their 2021 revenue guidance to 1 53 billion they beat analysts average estimate and they also noted that revenue growth would have been mid to high teens were it not for their strategic market channel exit to improve overall risk reward profile This was not a surprise as they explained adjusting for the actions we have discussed in our Analyst Day and continued risk reward optimization in our business model our revenue growth would have been in the mid to high teens Based on valuation comps such a growth rate would easily support a share price double the current level Paysafe s quarterly revenue gross profit and EBITDA numbers all came in at the upper range of their guidance along with a 63 gain in eCash revenue and 29 gain in free cash flow to over 108 million for Q1 alone On the day of their earnings report initial headlines were favorable Paysafe beats on revenue Reaffirms 2021 outlook only to be suddenly overtaken by articles almost uniformly focused on the negative offering oddly biased summaries like Sees Q2 adjusted EBITDA of 110M 120M which means it could fall below the Q1 level of 113 2M Obviously given that range it could just as well if not more likely rise above that number Several outlets focused on an EPS miss of 0 02 despite the fact that Paysafe did not offer any EPS estimate to miss Even now many platforms continue to wildly misreport their financial data For example Yahoo Finance falsely reports a much more dramatic 0 37 miss something that would naturally deter potential investors at first glance Intentional or not analysts EPS estimates overlooked previously signaled temporary quarterly expenses associated with paying down 1 16 billion in debt and the transaction that took Paysafe public The company noted Results included interest expense of 58 5 million an increase of 53 compared to the prior year reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31 2021 Net loss also included share based compensation of 72 4 million compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction Take away these one time non recurring expenses which amount to roughly 90 million and rather than reporting a 49 million loss the company would have reported 41 million in quarterly earnings thereby significantly beating all analyst estimates Thanks to an improved credit rating the company announced a refinancing of roughly a billion in debt at a 1 25 lower interest rate In all their recent debt management measures will save them an estimated 92 million in annual operating costs Global Capital reports that their loan offers an additional 25bp margin step down if the firm hits 3 7 times net leverage something they told analysts they intend to activate quickly Taken together all of this will greatly enhance EBITDA and free cash flow already 362 million in 2020 enabling them to better pursue their active M amp A pipeline Unless the company chooses for strategic tax purposes to write off some discretionary impairment expense on intangibles they should soundly beat the current analysts average EPS estimate of 0 00 for Q2 and 0 02 for 2021 Those analysts have a median price target 17 67 so consistently beating their estimates over the next three quarters will likely lead to price target upgrades and new price catalysts along the way amp x200B Note on Private Equity lockup expiration Blackstone bought an additional 37 million shares of Paysafe beyond their original 123 million shares Redditor kiedennis noted that these additional shares would theoretically secure a 50 159 controlling interest for insiders which some think could be part of ensuring Paysafe s M amp A strategy going forward At the very least it protects the company from hostile takeover Notably such a large purchase on top of the initial merger deal should allay fears that they d want to sell when lockup expires in the coming weeks At this point it s evident that such fears are priced in but some are still concerned so here are some further notes on the subject Back in 2017 Reuters reported Blackstone CVC initially pursued Paysafe making five separate bids to take it private increasing their bid 32 before Paysafe finally agreed The Wall Street Journal later confirmed Blackstone CVC took Paysafe private for 3 9 Billion Around 4 2 Billion in today s dollars An inside source close to those negotiations said There is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services away from the cash and cheques of our parents age adding that the private equity firms have a decade long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now Blackstone s website says its typical investment term is upwards of 7 10 years which dovetails with the decade long thesis noted above From 2017 to 2019 under Blackstone CVC stewardship Paysafe grew revenue 65 from 864 million to 1 418 billion 28 CAGR 2020 saw revenue stagnate due to Covid related business closures and high risk channel exits but even so if you add 2020 s performance 2017 2020 still amounts to a respectable 18 CAGR roughly the same as PayPal s current projected growth Recently Paysafe has gone public through reverse merger paid down 1 2 billion in debt and Blackstone CVC received about 5 6 billion in cash and shares Adjusted for inflation that s only a 33 gain on a 4 year hold which tells me they d want to stay on and benefit from Foley s M amp A playbook which has steadily proven to generate 300 800 growth in as little as 5 years This falls nicely within Blackstone s remaining time horizon As part of the deal Paysafe s 20F filing confirms that Blackstone rolled 1 23 billion into Paysafe keeping 123 million shares Foley says this is part of what created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock More recently Blackstone s 13F shows they now own 160 million shares indicating that they acquired an additional 37 million shares outside of the deal structure That s 436 million more at the current share price As insiders on the Board of Directors they wouldn t take on that level of additional exposure if they didn t see serious value here Dan Loeb Third Point s 13F indicates they also picked up more shares beyond their original PIPE investment For the above reasons along with the depressed share price I highly doubt private equity would be seeking a near term exit amp x200B TLDR summary Paysafe has put itself in a great position to beat analyst EPS estimates for Q2 Q3 Q4 and 2021 overall leading to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts Q1 s one time 90 million in expenses showed Paysafe is already poised for significant profit growth Recent debt management saving around 92 million annually secures even higher profits going forward The picture gets brighter with the introduction of fast growing revenue streams from the US iGaming market especially in Q3 and 4 Fears of private equity lockup expiry fully priced in at this point but such fears are unwarranted at these low levels especially considering Blackstone s acquisition of another 37 million shares But here s a question Has anyone thought about cash conversion of PSFE s outstanding warrants bringing the company as much as 600 million The last SEC filing says there are as many as 53 9 million warrants that could bring the company 11 50 each upon redemption This would more than double their EBITDA and go a long way towards deleveraging and or funding their active M amp A pipeline Such a huge cash infusion gives them meaningful incentive to eventually promote the stock price to well above 18 a 60 gain from current levels There s a strategy here and Foley has repeatedly shown he knows exactly how to play his cards Like most good things it takes time

it has potential to 5x or maybe more long term or SHORT TERM teehee,Reviewing the Bear Case on Paysafe PSFE JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently noted that fintechs pose enormous competitive threats to banks and SF Federal Reserve board member Jackie Reses sees them taking over and revolutionizing banking with a wholesale transition of a 16 trillion market cap In this context fintech Paysafe PSFE is newly listed on the NYSE and introduced to the US market Already well known in Europe Paysafe reports a substantial 362 million in free cash flow projects 100 billion in transactional volume 1 5 billion in revenue healthy double digit growth and expanding 30 EBITDA margins but despite absolutely no negative news the stock has taken a pounding which in turn has brought the bears out in force with some dubious arguments Sorry for the long post but I thought I d address all of these arguments in one post amp x200B Common bear arguments 1 Old business 2 Complex regulatory landscape no moat 3 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult 4 No growth 5 Slow growth 6 Not profitable 7 Too I much debt they are going to dilute by borrowing more 8 Blackstone made 3X and will sell 9 Founder share and warrant dilution amp x200B 1 Old business Paysafe s extensive experience in risk management and its time tested regulatory expertise over many regions globally is one of its greatest strengths This is the reason that Paysafe is the 1 global leader in iGaming payment processing a rapidly moving space that is anticipated to grow 10X At Paysafe the iGaming market volume was estimated to be 3 4 billion in 2019 and is now projected to reach 47 billion in 2025 Much of Paysafe s business is in back end payment processing so most don t even know they are using it but Paysafe is considered to be at the forefront in its field Winner Best Omni Channel Payment Solution Payment Processor of the Year and Best Payment Method and they are rapidly expanding in the US with new partnerships just last 3 months Coinbase Microsoft Luckbox Amelco Pointsbet Virginia Lotto In Europe where Paysafe is more known and used Trustpilot 1 rates Paysafe as Excellent 4 7 5 stars with over 25 000 reviews and Skrill as great 4 2 5 stars with over 17 000 reviews while PayPal is rated bad 1 2 5 stars with over 17 000 reviews Paysafe has the No 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries They ve just integrated their digital wallet platforms Neteller and Skrill recently voted Best Digital Wallet for best consumer take up most innovative technology with greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems Aside from Coinbase Luckbox and Microsoft they are partnered with Roblox Draftkings Spotify Fortnight Amazon Twitch bet365 ApplePay Youtube Visa Betfair PayLease ESL Gaming BetMGM among many others They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash integration of payment methods cross border payments and expansion into global banking as a service In preparation for their plans Paysafe s newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International a legal and regulatory expert in the multi jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone two from CVC the CEO of Dun amp Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight and the Chairman of the Board of Fidelity As Chairman Bill Foley says It s going to be a land grab I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet It s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate This doesn t sound like an old company resting on its laurels amp x200B 2 Complex regulatory landscape no moat Bill Foley Chairman of Fidelity and now also Paysafe s Chairman of the Board calls Paysafe a fortress It s got a moat We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open And most importantly we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise Their regulatory acumen is the reason they currently dominate globally in sports betting iGaming and are integrating their global platforms to expand into banking as a service There are 1 7 billion unbanked because so many in the world who have mobile devices still don t have access to the essential ID metrics that most banks and credit cards require to open accounts Paysafe s risk management and cross boarder regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to go Leaning into this strength they ve brought on PayPal s former CRO and added a multi jurisdictional regulatory expert to their Board of Directors From SEC filed transcript 2 Paysafe CEO Philip McHugh To be a true global player in the iGaming space the level of payments regulation of gaming regulation and certification is very very complex When we talk about a deep and a wide moat this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it s hard to copy We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk compliance and analytics That is very very rare in the payments space It s a real strength of ours We ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry including the former CRO from PayPal and we ve upgraded the team we ve built some real data capabilities and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others To be a winner in this space you re catering to some incredibly demanding clients They want to be global they want multiple APMs but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries That s something that Paysafe has developed very very successfully in every market we ve entered amp x200B 3 Growth by acquisition is hard Synergistic inorganic growth through M amp A is a key pillar of Paysafe s forward growth strategy Bill Foley s proven track record in quickly generating this kind of growth speaks for itself Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3 3X 4 2B to 14B Dun amp Bradstreet 5 6X 2B to 11 3B and Black Knight 8 7X 1 6B to 14B He also grew FIS from 2 5 billion to over 91 billion 36 4X Foley says Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe 2 4 amp x200B 4 No growth It s true that Paysafe s revenue stagnated in 2020 resulting from business closures during Covid but prior to that they reported a strong 27 CAGR 4 5 which is on par with high profile competitors 2017 864 million rev 2018 1 14 billion rev 32 2019 1 418 billion rev 24 2020 1 426 billion 0 5 Unlike many fintechs Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick and mortar retail and live sporting events both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid During this market dislocation they pivoted exited low value referral channels and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e commmerce spaces positioning themselves better going forward Looking at other brick and mortar payment processors hard hit during the same period like Visa and Mastercard Paysafe performed very well by comparison Visa negative y o y revenue growth 8 7 and negative EBITDA growth 10 2 Mastercard negative y o y revenue growth 9 4 and negative EBITDA growth 14 20 Not claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but given their commensurate slow down during Covid it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at 46 which is very much in line with the valuation comps cited below amp x200B 5 Slow growth Going forward Paysafe conservatively projects 10 13 annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M amp A plans and expansion in iGaming which is expected to grow at 55 CAGR over the next several years iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe s revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion Analyst Michael Del Grosso who recently initiated coverage with a 19 price target 6 said we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state level legalization of iGaming In the short time since he wrote that here are some of the headlines signaling a price target upgrade 1 New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering 2 Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature 3 New Hampshire Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly Hogan likely to sign 4 Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting 5 Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting 6 Delaware igaming revenue up 74 3 year on year in March 7 Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162 7 in March The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering where revenue rocketed by 326 1 8 Caesars Entertainment Paysafe partner announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL 9 Michigan s online sports betting launch hailed a success Ohio could follow this year 10 Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling 11 Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting 12 Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear 13 NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools 14 Single sports betting in Canada wins House vote nears legalization 15 Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal 16 Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think amp x200B Looking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of 12 5 not far from Paysafe s minimum 10 6 projection here are valuations based on PayPal Square Nuvei Repay Shift4 Adyen Affirm bill GPN and Paysign among others amp x200B Paysafe s share price with average of sector peer multiples EV EBITDA ratio 122 09 EV Rev ratio 83 91 EV FCF ratio 87 86 Average 97 95 amp x200B After eliminating outliers with highest multiples EV EBITDA ratio 50 75 EV Rev ratio 44 64 EV FCF ratio 44 18 Average 46 52 amp x200B Notes 1 Unlike Paysafe around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow 2 Used low end of Paysafe s projections and factored in debt and high end of potential dilution 3 As noted Paysafe s 10 6 rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M amp A growth and projected 55 CAGR iGaming growth which constitutes a third of their revenue 4 The above comps were taken during a sector wide pull back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon s enormous competitive threats comment In a nutshell the basket of sector peers projects roughly 20 more growth than Paysafe yet trades at 350 750 higher multiples With Paysafe having better financials than most it is hard to argue that this is proportionate amp x200B 6 Not profitable Paysafe expects 900 million in gross profit with healthy 30 32 EBITDA margin As one recent article pointed out Paysafe has shown some intriguing projections in terms of its profitability The company s projected gross margin is 63 an impressive number compared to competitors like Square with a gross margin under 30 These fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe Repay 0 67 Affirm 2 18 Nuvei 1 08 Paysign 0 19 Bill 0 62 Shift4 0 43 Average EV EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe s SP at 69 If you read their transcripts and presentations you ll see that profit is being utilized to grow the business and integrate their global platforms into what they call Paysafe Unity They ve recently completed the integration of Skrill and Neteller digital wallets into a single code Foley has indicated further elimination of redundancies to create new efficiencies and increase margins to enhance M amp A activities From what I can tell Foley is all about the long game amp x200B 7 Too I much debt they are going to dilute by borrowing more Paysafe just paid down 1 1 billion in debt Why would they turn around and borrow again As Fidelity s Chairman of the Board Bill Foley says One of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe s leverage ratio to 3 6x Debt EBITDA Their 3 6X Debt EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers Investopedia Debt EBITDA measures a company s ability to pay off its incurred debt A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too heavy debt load Of the 11 fintech competitors I looked at all but three PYPL ADYEY NUVCF have worse Debt EBITDA ratios than Paysafe and many have negative EBITDA making debt service that much more difficult Square 77 8X Repay 8 7X Fiserv 21 2B 4 7B 4 5X GPN 10 27B 2 8B 3 67X Shift4 1 8B 8M negative EBITDA Affirm 1 67B 77 6M negative EBITDA Paysign 4 3M 5 79M negative EBITDA Bill 947M 43 85M negative EBITDA Depending on whether you include SQ and AFRM the combined multiples of the above competitors by EV EBITDA EV free cash flow or EV revenue puts Paysafe s share price in the 45 to 90 range Point being their debt position is better than most and hardly a red flag Further management has said they ll be able to fund M amp A plans with expanding 32 35 EBITDA margins 500 560 million 21 CAGR and 362 million in free cash flow amp x200B 8 Blackstone made 3X and will sell The common myth is that Blackstone CVC made 300 by paying 3 billion to take Paysafe private and receiving 9 billion in the recent deal to bring it public The reality as reported by the Wall Street Journal 8 is that Blackstone CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for 3 9 Billion and they received about 5 6 billion in cash and shares on the recent deal Adjusted for inflation they paid 4 2 billion so it s more like a 33 return on a 4 year hold Importantly this came AFTER they grew revenue 65 864B to 1 426B stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business and the deal included paying down over 1 1 billion in debt This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders It also explains why private equity has signaled that they ll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley s time tested M amp A playbook Blackstone itself says 9 The term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7 10 years With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3 4X valuation why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company In a recent interview Foley said private equity s plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest 2 billion They rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder They didn t take all their money off the table All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock This trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC s Board of Directors Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination Commitment of Paysafe s Owners The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward The PIPE investors are even less of a concern because they are title and life insurance companies known for long term investment strategies they are closely aligned with Foley and understand both his M amp A track record and his ability to create mutually beneficial synergistic deals through what Bloomberg called the The Foley Network perhaps for example Paysafe will handle Fidelity s massive transactional volume In a recent Bloomberg interview Bill Foley said The thing that was different about our transaction is that we brought capital to the table The companies that I m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset besides the fact that it s a great asset Besides just as large funds will often drive price down to accumulate large positions they also can drive price up to sell into strength and will do so via off market trades to avoid price slippage Therefore we probably wouldn t even notice profit taking until after quarterly filings Paysafe s fundamental value in context indicates such prospects present very little long term risk especially from current price levels Given Paysafe s 100B market share similar to Square s once audited numbers are available many large funds focused on this space will necessarily seek a more balanced exposure through Paysafe amp x200B 9 Founder share and warrant dilution According to the 20F recently filed roughly 53 million warrants pose potential dilution at a maximum of 7 5 movement we ve seen in a day but the cashless conversion option generally exchanging 3 warrants for a single share can reduce that dilution by 2 3 to around 2 5 It is very likely that many will use this option since most warrant holders do not have the extra cash to pay an additional 11 50 for each warrant conversion It will probably be somewhere in the middle of the two scenarios 5 but this is not a major concern in the scheme of things Importantly the 20F also shows that all founder shares are already included in the current outstanding share count so there is no risk of dilution there Total FTAC Founder shares 175 292 458 24 2 Blackstone Investors 123 734 571 17 1 CVC Investors 156 006 433 21 6 Other Pre Business Combination Paysafe Shareholders 53 701 074 7 4 Cannae excluding amounts included in Founder 50 000 000 6 9 PIPE Investors excluding Cannae 165 000 000 22 8 723 734 536 100 0 amp x200B Despite a lack of negative news short sellers and bashers have been able to exploit a perfect storm of doubt created by seemingly unrelated events ranging from forced selling pressure coming from widely reported changes in margin requirements 25 to 100 upon ticker change without any prior notice to simultaneous limits on buying resulting from excessive delays 7 trading days in the new PSFE ticker being available on many platforms to things in the media that this sub will not allow to be discussed In this context it is hard not to see a month s worth of fake sell walls and HFS short ladder attacks as anything other than opportunistic price manipulation but speculation can only get you so far I think Paysafe is currently undervalued and as the developments in legalized sports betting come to fruition it is very likely a 3X from here M amp A plans already in the works will bring additional catalysts Given Paysafe s healthy fundamentals large market share in a fintech space known for sticky customers and exposure to high growth verticals like iGaming it seems inevitable that large funds will seek to benefit from these low prices especially once the first audited quarterly numbers are available on May 11th amp x200B Note Per their analyst presentation here is Paysafe s minimum Q1 guidance to meet or beat 360 million revenue 220 million gross profit 105 million EBITDA amp x200B Disclosure I hold 600K in commons and warrants Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor All users should complete their

long time Not familiar with them Ever worked out to or heard of P90X 21 Day Fix Insanity or T25 All Beachbody How about these others The company has been around for 20 years pumping out some of the best workout content on the market and many of these are still used years after they launch amp x200B Top 15 Beachbody Workouts https preview redd it g7k95mcod0871 jpg width 3070 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 34d6088a5b9e49a252b50ffa4a261bd80dc9f75d BODY is a new ticker as of Monday June 28th and Beachbody rang the opening bell for the NYSE By way of a SPAC merger they re now publicly traded With this they also merge with Myx Fitness Myx is a small Peloton competitor that is more provides a more affordable price point With the extensive reach of Beachbody this piece of the business should accelerate rapidly and provides Beachbody with a boost in the connected fitness segment Beachbody has over 3 2 million PAID subscribers as of Q1 2021 They generate revenue not just from workouts digital subscriptions 450M 2021E Revenue but also from their nutrition products like Shakeology and Ladder 560M 2021E Revenue They have over 400 000 coaches that are actively promoting their product and are paid a commission when someone signs up for a subscription or buys a product In addition celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger Lebron James and Shaquille O Neal are investors and promoters Speaking of people involved let s look at some of the leadership Carl Daikeler Like bad ass CEOs He s one Like theater He has two Tony Awards producer Are you a boomer that worked out in the 90s to 8 minute abs on VHS That was Carl s video before starting Beachbody What about 7 minute abs https www youtube com watch v JB2di69FmhE https www youtube com watch v JB2di69FmhE This guy has built an empire steadily over the last 20 years He s loved by everyone by what I can tell and has had great instincts to pivot the business in the right direction when needed moving out of DVDs to digital on demand content He knows how to leverage their marketing network and has expanded the business at a manageable rate through organic growth and small acquisitions This is the next chapter in the company Carl has stated multiple times that he isn t selling a single share He knows this company is about to be bigger than ever Kevin Mayer If you read most of the bios online about Kevin you ll find he has an impressive Disney resume He s a former Disney Exec that was behind some huge acquisitions Pixar Marvel Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox Oh and he launched a little thing called Disney You may also find that he was the CEO of TikTok and COO of the parent company ByteDance What doesn t always show up is that he was also the CEO of Playboy com in 2000 Kevin understands content creation and marketing better than most He will be on the board of directors and it would be completely ridiculous if the people in the room didn t listen when he speaks If those two aren t enough you ve also got Tom Staggs another former Disney Exec who at one time was thought of as the heir apparent to Bob Iger as the Disney CEO And I don t mean to short change the rest of the team as they all are impressive in their own way but let s keep this rolling amp x200B BODY Today Tomorrow https preview redd it 50h37e5me0871 jpg width 3070 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 036b10d9421d7efdd97485f84c5f6f96df53a96a One of the other drivers to future successful growth will be international Today 99 of their revenue comes from North America They know the potential if they expand internationally but they ve also stated they don t want to just dub over their videos Dubbing doesn t resonate as well with the audience They re going to do it the right way COVID shifted many workouts into the home Some will return to a gym some will not Any growth chart for an in home fitness company whether it be Beachbody Peloton or something else we should probably try to normalize the growth over 2020 Having said that Beachbody was already well positioned for the shift to in home workouts and their growth was 43 year over year Smaller companies may be able to show greater growth in percentage but Beachbody was already a well established player in the market One thing I ve seen discussed elsewhere is how the company will be branding going forward Some of their workouts are recognized but some may not know it is a Beachbody workout They are looking to change that and make sure that the brand Beachbody is well known so that when a new workout comes out people know it is coming from Beachbody and want to try it because they liked a past Beachbody workout So that s the company in a nutshell So a couple other things I am not here to tell you there is a short squeeze coming That s not typically how I would evaluate my picks Yes there are some shorts out there If that s what you re interested in there s probably another DD from someone else about that potential I wish I could show you a great fancy chart with candles and lines drawn to the moon but that s not the case for this stock right now Just coming out of the SPAC it s too soon for that Could the stock double within the next 6 months Yeah it could Might it happen sooner Maybe Could it drop Possible Ultimately I see a stock that was beat up because it was a SPAC and then has flown under the radar The company the product and the people in this is what I m investing in because I believe in it them It s a billion dollar company valued at 3x revenue It could easily grow to a 2 billion dollar revenue company over the next 3 years and seems to be a steal at the current price point They have no debt They have a proven model that works they continue to scale and now have incredible personnel added to their leadership board that could take Beachbody to the moon I don t YOLO invest but I did drop in about 11 000 to this which was about 10 of my account 1 000 shares at 9 90 and 25 8 20 17 50c at 0 40 It s up since those price points but I believe it will continue to rise They shot up 10 the day the merger was approved that was Thursday then another 10 Friday and opened another 10 higher this morning I see this at 20 in the short term and a great long term stock as well that should continue to impress TO THE MOON

Has Not Priced In The Potential Catalysts And A Short Squeeze Making It An Easy 10 Bagger Even Dr Michael J Burry Is In ,TL DR Marinus Pharmaceuticals MRNS is a biopharmaceutical company focused on therapeutics to treat epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders in children and adults The stock has multiple potential catalysts that could send it to the moon on top of that it has a high short interest and could short squeeze the market has not priced this in making options cheap giving it the ability to be a 10 bagger Introduction Sup guys today I bring to you a stock that the market has completely overlooked and in doing so giving us the opportunity to fly this thing to the moon I am not the only person to recognize how undervalued this company Dr Michael J Burry yes the guy from the movie also holds a long position Marinus Pharmaceuticals MRNS is a biopharmaceutical company focused on therapeutics to treat epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders in both children and adults Marinus has many catalysts that could send it to the moon and since options are undervalued this makes this a very attractive play The company that is creating therapeutics for these life threatening conditions in children and adults is being heavily shorted allowing for the conditions that could allow for a short squeeze Company Summary Marinus Pharmaceuticals MRNS is a biopharmaceutical company focused on therapeutics to treat epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders in children and adults Company Overview Marinus is developing the drug ganaxolone to treat children and adults suffering from rare epilepsy disorders and other neuropsychiatric conditions These conditions can be completely debilitating and greatly reduce the quality of life of those with such conditions Despite status epilepticus being one of the most common neurologic emergencies treatment has remained stagnant over the past decade Ganaxolone is a drug designed to treat those with rare epilepsy conditions with few or no options for treatment available Thesis Ganaxolone was well tolerated in human trials with the most commonly reported side effects being somnolence dizziness and fatigue Only two drug related SAEs were reported severe sedation in 2 patients out of 17 enrolled in the Phase 2 trial Analysts believe the hurdle for safety is relatively lower due to the dire nature of seizure related disorders MRNS has received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from FDA for Ganaxolone for the Treatment of CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder I believe Marinus is currently heavily undervalued and has a relatively high short interest rate that I do not consider fair It will take shorts 18 days to cover at the current volume Marinus call options are severely mispriced and don t take into account the multiple catalysts throughout the year that could send the stock to the moon making it a potential 10 bagger Remember given how low implied volatility is the call can go up in value regardless of the stock price Due to how cheap call options are this is a highly asymmetrical play with gigantic upsides and limited downsides I believe the 35 strike price 2021 October 15 calls are the best value as they provide enough time to allow exposure to multiple trial results and cheap enough that they could easily provide massive gains Analysts consensus of 35 do not account for positive top line data coming out later this year and possible FDA approval Phase 2 trials of using ganaxolone for treatment with those of rare types of epilepsy disorders is completed on June 30th 2021 if these trials come back positive the price of the stock could rocket upwards amp x200B https preview redd it z2diwy0tj0871 png width 1173 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 87faae2bb536d4dd3756e58969033e4c55df7f4e Here is an

an idiot As mentioned earlier Dr Michael J Burry a medical doctor and that one guy Christian Bale played in that movie has shares in the company In the latest 13F filing from his firm Scion Asset Management it was revealed that Burry was holding a position of 297 272 shares of MRNS at a market value of 4 602 000 at the time The Play Taking into account all the possibilities for Marinus to go to the moon the ability for it to short squeeze and with big names like Dr Michael J Burry involved I am very confident in my thesis that this stock will rocket and so my price target is about 40 I have positions in Oct 35 00 Call options and plan on riding them out until this stock explodes Positions Oct 35 Call amp x200B https preview redd it hcsexhryj0871 png width 1289 amp format png amp

With this they also merge with Myx Fitness Myx is a small Peloton competitor that is more provides a more affordable price point With the extensive reach of Beachbody this piece of the business should accelerate rapidly and provides Beachbody with a boost in the connected fitness segment Beachbody has over 3 2 million PAID subscribers as of Q1 2021 They generate revenue not just from workouts digital subscriptions 450M 2021E Revenue but also from their nutrition products like Shakeology and Ladder 560M 2021E Revenue They have over 400 000 coaches that are actively promoting their product and are paid a commission when someone signs up for a subscription or buys a product In addition celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger Lebron James and Shaquille O Neal are investors and promoters Speaking of people involved let s look at some of the leadership Carl Daikeler Like bad ass CEOs He s one Like theater He has two Tony Awards producer Are you a boomer that worked out in the 90s to 8 minute abs on VHS That was Carl s video before starting Beachbody What about 7 minute abs https www youtube com watch v JB2di69FmhE https www youtube com watch v JB2di69FmhE This guy has built an empire steadily over the last 20 years He s loved by everyone by what I can tell and has had great instincts to pivot the business in the right direction when needed moving out of DVDs to digital on demand content He knows how to leverage their marketing network and has expanded the business at a manageable rate through organic growth and small acquisitions This is the next chapter in the company Carl has stated multiple times that he isn t selling a single share He knows this company is about to be bigger than ever Kevin Mayer If you read most of the bios online about Kevin you ll find he has an impressive Disney resume He s a former Disney Exec that was behind some huge acquisitions Pixar Marvel Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox Oh and he launched a little thing called Disney You may also find that he was the CEO of TikTok and COO of the parent company ByteDance What doesn t always show up is that he was also the CEO of Playboy com in 2000 Kevin understands content creation and marketing better than most He will be on the board of directors and it would be completely ridiculous if the people in the room didn t listen when he speaks If those two aren t enough you ve also got Tom Staggs another former Disney Exec who at one time was thought of as the heir apparent to Bob Iger as the Disney CEO And I don t mean to short change the rest of the team as they all are impressive

expand internationally but they ve also stated they don t want to just dub over their videos Dubbing doesn t resonate as well with the audience They re going to do it the right way COVID shifted many workouts into the home Some will return to a gym some will not Any growth chart for an in home fitness company whether it be Beachbody Peloton or something else we should probably try to normalize the growth over 2020 Having said that Beachbody was already well positioned for the shift to in home workouts and their growth was 43 year over year Smaller companies may be able to show greater growth in percentage but Beachbody was already a well established player in the market One thing I ve seen discussed elsewhere is how the company will be branding going forward Some of their workouts are recognized but some may not know it is a Beachbody workout They are looking to change that and make sure that the brand Beachbody is well known so that when a new workout comes out people know it is coming from Beachbody and want to try it because they liked a past Beachbody workout So that s the company in a nutshell So a couple other things I am not here to tell you there is a short squeeze coming That s not typically how I would evaluate my picks Yes there are some shorts out there If that s what you re interested in there s probably another DD from someone else about that potential I wish I could show you a great fancy chart with candles and lines drawn to the moon but that s not the case for this stock right now Just coming out of the SPAC it s too soon for that Could the stock double within the next 6 months Yeah it could Might it happen sooner Maybe Could it drop Possible Ultimately I see a stock that was beat up because it was a SPAC and then has flown under the radar The company the product and the people in this is what I m investing in because I believe in it them It s a billion dollar company valued at 3x revenue It could easily grow to a 2 billion dollar revenue company over the next 3 years and seems to be a steal at the current price point They have no debt They have a proven model that works they continue to scale and now have incredible personnel added to their leadership board that could take Beachbody to the moon I don t YOLO invest but I did drop in about 11 000 to this which was about 10 of my account 1 000 shares at 9 90 and 25 8 20 17 50c at 0 40

you useless morons I have identified what appears to be a phenomenal opportunity SRNG the SPAC taking Ginkgo BioWorks public This is not investment advice only one gamblers reckless musings to a group of ungrateful retards you I will explain why Ginkgo is the AWS of Biotech amp could be a 10X in the next decade but most of all I want to draw your attention to a very strange situation regarding the SRNG option pricing The 7 16 10 Calls which as of SRNG s Friday s close of 9 97 are about 30bps out of the money are ONLY 05 cents The IV on them is about 3 For the same duration 7 16 call and OTM strike on VZ Verizon which is a boring Boomer stock that never moves and guys like Warren Buffet get hard ons for it is about 25 IV and 6X the price U can literally buy Calls on SRNG that are two weeks out for about a nickle which I am sure is less than or equal to what most of your girlfriends would trade you for Why are these Calls so cheap might u retards ask Many reasons but my theory is because sneaky Hedgefund a holes like Citadel and Millenium engage in a very simple arbitrage scheme anytime SPACs shares dip below the treasure chest of the fund SRNG has 1 725B in cash and the shares are issued at 10 to the NAV they buy the shares at say 9 95 and sell the 10 calls locking in a gain Then right before the merger closes the hedge funds tender the shares at 10 and receive a nominal amount of interest plus the nickle they sold you So they are basically banking on the SPAC not going above 10 and collecting a free 20 30 per annum return But why can t SRNG blast through 10 Many other SPACs traded well above the NAV prior to the merger The SRNG Ginkgo merger is scheduled to occur in Q3 2021 I believe Buying 1000 worth of 10 strike 7 16 Calls gets you 200 contracts IF SRNG trades up 20 to 12 that 1000 is worth like 40 000 IF SRNG takes fire this could be one of the singe best returns the morons on this forum achieve Or they could lose all their money but at least its only nickles for the contracts Here is the Ginkgo Bioworks investor presentation https www ginkgobioworks com wp content uploads 2021 05 Ginkgo Bioworks Investor Presentation May 2021 pdf https www ginkgobioworks com wp content uploads 2021 05 Ginkgo Bioworks Investor Presentation May 2021 pdf The SPAC SRNG has 1 725B in cash which is being supplemented with 775M in a PIPE for a total merger acquisition cash injection into Ginkgo of 2 5B valuing the company at 15B Heavyweight price insensitive institutional buyers like Baillie Gifford and Cathy Wood have been loading up What do these guys do Basically Ginkgos technology program cells and DNA with the same ease computer code is written and is building a horizontal platform for cell programming across literally all industries This means they can genetically engineer better food create drugs create building blocks and ingredients to drugs and rapidly analyze pretty much any type of DNA and code and culture and tinker with experimental changes These are the guys how could make Jurassic Park the real thing Why has SRNG not caught fire given that it is probably one of the most useful and promising of all the various SPACS Largely because no one seems to find agriculture medicine and pharmaceutical bioengineers all that exciting and also because institutions may think Ginkgo is expensive It traded at about a 2 5B valuation in the private markets in 2018 and is now clocking in at 15B But the total addressable market is in the hundreds of billions and the technology is truly unique Also all you retards seem obsessed with

Conditions The Market Has Not Priced In The Potential Catalysts And A Short Squeeze Making It An Easy 10 Bagger Even Dr Michael J Burry Is In , TL DR Marinus Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company focused on therapeutics to treat epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders in children and adults The stock has multiple potential catalysts that could send it to the moon on top of that it has a high short interest and could short squeeze the market has not priced this in making options cheap giving it the ability to be a 10 bagger Introduction Sup guys today I bring to you a company that the market has completely overlooked and in doing so has giving us the opportunity to fly this thing to the moon I am not the only person to recognize how undervalued this company Dr Michael J Burry yes the guy from the movie holds a long position Marinus Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company focused on therapeutics to treat epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders in both children and adults Marinus has many catalysts that could send it to the moon and since options are undervalued this makes for a very attractive play The company that is creating therapeutics for these life threatening conditions in children and adults is being heavily shorted allowing for the conditions that could allow for a short squeeze Company Overview Marinus is developing the drug ganaxolone to treat children and adults suffering from rare epilepsy disorders and other neuropsychiatric conditions These conditions can be completely debilitating and greatly reduce the quality of life of those with such conditions Despite status epilepticus being one of the most common neurologic emergencies treatment has remained stagnant over the past decade Ganaxolone is a drug designed to treat those with rare epilepsy conditions with few or no options for treatment available Thesis Ganaxolone was well tolerated in human trials with the most commonly reported side effects being somnolence dizziness and fatigue Only two drug related SAEs were reported severe sedation in 2 patients out of 17 enrolled in the Phase 2 trial Analysts believe the hurdle for safety is relatively lower due to the dire nature of seizure related disorders Marinus has received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from FDA for Ganaxolone for the Treatment of CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder I believe Marinus is currently heavily undervalued and has a relatively high short interest rate that I do not consider fair It will take shorts 18 days to cover at the current volume Marinus call options are severely mispriced and don t take into account the multiple catalysts throughout the year that could send the stock to the moon making it a potential 10 bagger Remember given how low implied volatility is the call can go up in value regardless of the stock price Due to how cheap call options are this is a highly asymmetrical play with gigantic upsides and limited downsides I believe the 35 strike price 2021 October 15 calls are the best value as they provide enough time to allow exposure to multiple trial results and cheap enough that they could easily provide massive gains Analysts consensus of 35 do not account for positive top line data coming out later this year and possible FDA approval Phase 2 trials of using ganaxolone for treatment with those of rare types of epilepsy disorders is completed on June 30th 2021 if these trials come back positive the price of the stock could rocket upwards amp x200B https preview redd it ubcpszwro0871 png width 1173 amp format png amp auto webp amp

79a7de4b24833bf97cec927a82a349e24dc2f07c From a technical perspective my opinion is that the stock is running and is not showing any signs of slowing down in the long term I believe if the price hits

Still don t believe me though and think I m an idiot As mentioned earlier Dr Michael J Burry a medical doctor and that one guy Christian Bale played in that movie has shares in the company In the latest 13F filing from his firm Scion Asset Management it was revealed that Dr Burry was holding a position of 297 272 shares of Marinus at a market value of 4 602 000 at the time The Play Taking into account all the possibilities for Marinus to go to the moon the ability for it to short squeeze and with big names like Dr Michael J Burry involved I am very confident in my thesis that this stock will rocket and so my price target is 40 I have positions in Oct 35 00 Call options and plan on riding them out until this stock explodes Positions Oct 35 Call amp x200B https preview redd it

you useless morons I have identified what appears to be a phenomenal opportunity SRNG the SPAC taking Ginkgo BioWorks public This is not investment advice only one gamblers reckless musings to a group of ungrateful retards you I will explain why Ginkgo is the AWS of Biotech amp could be a 10X in the next decade but most of all I want to draw your attention to a very strange situation regarding the SRNG option pricing The 7 16 10 Calls which as of SRNG s Friday s close of 9 97 are about 30bps out of the money are ONLY 05 cents The IV on them is about 3 For the same duration 7 16 call and OTM strike on VZ Verizon which is a boring Boomer stock that never moves and guys like Warren Buffet get hard ons for it is about 25 IV and 6X the price U can literally buy Calls on SRNG that are two weeks out for about a nickle which I am sure is less than or equal to what most of your girlfriends would trade you for Why are these Calls so cheap might u retards ask Many reasons but my theory is because sneaky Hedgefund a holes like Citadel and Millenium engage in a very simple arbitrage scheme anytime SPACs shares dip below the treasure chest of the fund SRNG has 1 725B in cash and the shares are issued at 10 to the NAV they buy the shares at say 9 95 and sell the 10 calls locking in a gain Then right before the merger closes the hedge funds tender the shares at 10 and receive a nominal amount of interest plus the nickle they sold you So they are basically banking on the SPAC not going above 10 and collecting a free 20 30 per annum return But why can t SRNG blast through 10 Many other SPACs traded well above the NAV prior to the merger The SRNG Ginkgo merger is scheduled to occur in Q3 2021 I believe Buying 1000 worth of 10 strike 7 16 Calls gets you 200 contracts IF SRNG trades up 20 to 12 that 1000 is worth like 40 000 IF SRNG takes fire this could be one of the singe best returns the morons on this forum achieve Or they could lose all their money but at least its only nickles for the contracts Here is the Ginkgo Bioworks investor presentation https www ginkgobioworks com wp content uploads 2021 05 Ginkgo Bioworks Investor Presentation May 2021 pdf https www ginkgobioworks com wp content uploads 2021 05 Ginkgo Bioworks Investor Presentation May 2021 pdf The SPAC SRNG has 1 725B in cash which is being supplemented with 775M in a PIPE for a total merger acquisition cash injection into Ginkgo of 2 5B valuing the company at 15B Heavyweight price insensitive institutional buyers like Baillie Gifford and Cathy Wood have been loading up What do these guys do Basically Ginkgos technology program cells and DNA with the same ease computer code is written and is building a horizontal platform for cell programming across literally all industries This means they can genetically engineer better food create drugs create building blocks and ingredients to drugs and rapidly analyze pretty much any type of DNA and code and culture and tinker with experimental changes These are the guys how could make Jurassic Park the real thing Why has SRNG not caught fire given that it is probably one of the most useful and promising of all the various SPACS Largely because no one seems to find agriculture medicine and pharmaceutical bioengineers all that exciting and also because institutions may think Ginkgo is expensive It traded at about a 2 5B valuation in the private markets in 2018 and is now clocking in at 15B But the total addressable market is in the hundreds of billions and the technology is truly unique Also all you retards seem obsessed with electric cars like they might finally get you a girlfriend newsflash they won t Ginkgo has received numerous grants from DARPA for various research projects even the militaries hyper secret advanced

shortseller to an irrational low level what has nothing to do with jinkos world leadership in solar technology and its position in world market It s all geopolitical If it s US company it would be 15B instead of current 1 5B This is just another short attack with low volume 5 billion in revenues last year and trading below book value More than likely revenues will double over the next 5 years or sooner Low market cap This stock will eventually explode higher again This may pause around 40 for a couple of days but after that it is headed back to 60 Its cheap utliities are converting to green all over the world at least reducing their dependence on fossil and in the process becoming cleaner and JKS is the world leader When top US utility like Duke Energy chose JKS then I say these guys are the top contender This could be the next GME or AMC High short interest but the much better company Even a high triple digit PPS for JKS would be cheap and justified as this is the much better Co than

m content on my asteroid for the longterm Still I think you might be interested in this A Little Background I like every OG BFT holder had been pretty confused by the price action on this stock Sure the idea that a stock that you believe in and which seems like an obvious buy can be pummeled and overlooked by the market for a long time isn t at all unheard of We all know that feeling It was entirely possible that I had just paid too much early and would be in it for the long haul which was the plan anyway However I couldn t deny the maddening nature of some of the price action on this stock over the past few months especially post earnings I had never seen such a seemingly inoffensive value stock with growth potential so strategically targeted by shorts any time a bullish reversal signal would appear We knew it was shorts because a the sheer capital it would take to bid hunt and throw up cent for cent sell walls by the thousand at any pivot point on a stock with a relatively large float disqualified retail traders and b we could see it in the ever increasing short interest being reported What made it more interesting were the signals that we had a highly professional short that knew the exact price points that would lead to a reversal confirmation and yet would always seem to go right back on the defensive as soon as the price was pinned again They never seemed to want to all out tank us This seemed counterintuitive and led to a whole lot of conspiratorial thinking by folks myself included Remember I was the guy who posted about the buyout theory a while back based on this short activity and on the valuable discovery of Blackstone s securing of a controlling stake with their additional share purchase In any case I kept trying to wrap my head around it while continuously hearing the word accumulation tossed around I could accept that in a passive way until last Wed and Thu 6 23 and 6 24 Watching our volume shoot up inflow drastically outpace outflow and yet trading within a few cent range textbook signs of accumulation That s when I knew I needed to dig deeper and it also when I stumbled upon the Wyckoff schematic This changed everything about

various facets of this method the three laws P amp F charting the composite man etc and its history It s fascinating Suffice it to say though this method was created by Richard Wyckoff in the 1930 s as a way of conceptualizing market trends in terms of periods of accumulation followed by a mark up and distribution followed by markdown Accumulation occurs when a price is consolidating typically following a downtrend and big fish are gradually purchasing shares within the channel in a way that is inconspicuous and allows for some level of cost control If they were to just buy it all outright the stock price would go up likely attracting attention and forcing them to load at higher prices Accumulation is the same in reverse Simple enough Again most of this is built on the basic laws of supply and demand cause and effect and effort vs result It s worth digging deeper on you re own The Point What makes it far more amazing though is that Wyckoff actually developed a specific schematic

with what s called a selling climax the full court press that drives the price down at a rapid rate clenching bull asses everywhere Once that selling pressure dissipates in comes the Automatic Rally AR which is bulls taking full control and giving us a V shaped recovery back up The bottom has now been established by sellers and the churning begins Now look again at PSFE s chart on Earning s Day Phase B Following the AR we ve now established the rough channel within which whales intend to load up and hope all the while that all those clenched retail bulls will bail and sell their shares for cheap This is the game Hallmarks of the Wyckoff schematic include notoriously untrustworthy bullish patterns false breakouts and FUD Sound familiar They want you to sell your shares and think your stock is dead money That way they can load up in peace without a bunch of pesky bulls or dare I say apes getting all FOMO YOLO happy and disrupting their feeding frenzy Phase B typically includes a wave or two of sheer psychological torture which may or may not include false breakouts above or below the bounds of that accumulation channel Remember they re loading up at the bottom of those waves with all the tear soaked shares of broken retail holders Look again at Paysafe s charts on 6 23 and 6 24 huge volume on the buy side no price movement If you had watched level 2 data you would have seen how coincidentally the bid blocks mirrored the ask blocks with the buy side just being slightly larger each time Phase B has the potential to be the longest phase and is mostly dependent on how long institutions need to load up but then comes phase C Phase C Okay the institutions have now loaded up their lion s share of the rocket so what do they do Well Phase C tends to be the least consistent as far the schematic goes In Wyckoff s model the institutions are especially sadistic and decide to go for one last bid raid driving the price way down once again shredding every last paper hand and setting up the real launchpad The spring This is the real reversal and the truest test of diamond hands That being said the spring doesn t always happen Sometimes C can look a bit more like a small subset of D maybe with a test somewhere in the middle of the channel Sometimes not The point is things are turning around and tutes are ready for their tendies or should I say YOUR tendies if you sold Phase D And herein lies the final test Phase D carries us out of the accumulation channel and leaves bulls with one final test the Sign of Strength Here we begin to see bullish signals like flags pennants etc and basically what s happening is the top of the channel begins to be tested for support If bulls succeed and there isn t more opportunity for whales to go down and keep right on loading so begins the markup phase Phase E Now the game has changed and it s time to ride the rocket up until whales decide they either want to take their sweet stolen profits distribution or we pause for another fuel up They will do whatever they can to get every last one of us on board and touch the farthest reaches of the galaxy Here s the interesting point that inspired me to write this up today Take a good hard look at the timing on PSFE s chart Notice anything interesting about the price action on Friday into today Coming out of the base of an accumulation channel after a B wave we suddenly have PSFE popping up all over WSB Look I ve been in this thing for months I m holding long because I believe in it and would love for it to get all the attention it can However even the apes on WSB were commenting on how out of nowhere the pump came from many of the posts from new accounts It was bizarre Exciting but bizarre and that s coming from someone who wants for this to pump and not dump Now look at the price action today in regards to the Wyckoff structure Sure looks an awful lot like an SOS right in the correct position and a big fat bull flag to boot https preview redd it qbibc4gcp1871 png width 2376 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 4e7dac872642240cef9d487e901d61d1cfd2b760 Initially I would have said that we are premature on this SOS We were most likely due for another B wave and maybe we are However I can t help but ignore that timing within the structure and the fundamental psychology behind the markup PUMP Again this is just one possible read within the schematic and I d be interested to hear other reads on it too I m no expert Therefore I guess the point I m trying to make here is we have been operating within an age old structure for accumulation which has certainly given me some solace on this stock We already knew whales were loading up and now we have technical evidence to prove it However somebody is ready for this thing to move whether that s apes the tutes that had been loading or somebody who wants to spoil it for them Hold tough bulls The rocket has been fueling up for awhile They just hoped you were going to bail before take off TL DR Institutions were hoping you weren t going to catch them buying up all the seats on the PSFE rocket these last few months They ve been buying them up dirt cheap You want them to take her back down and buy the rest or do you think Planet Paysafe rich in bountiful tendies has room for us too According to Richard Wyckoff the choice could be made right now

Wyckoff s model the institutions are especially sadistic and decide to go for one last bid raid driving the price way down once again shredding every last paper hand and setting up the real launchpad The spring This is the real reversal and the truest test of diamond hands That being said the spring doesn t always happen Sometimes C can look a bit more like a small subset of D maybe with a test somewhere in the middle of the channel Sometimes not The point is things are turning around and tutes are ready for their tendies or should I say YOUR tendies if you sold Phase D And herein lies the final test Phase D carries us out of the accumulation channel and leaves bulls with one final test the Sign of Strength Here we begin to see bullish signals like flags pennants etc and basically what s happening is the top of the channel begins to be tested for support If bulls succeed and there isn t more opportunity for whales to go down and keep right on loading so begins the markup phase Phase E Now the game has changed and it s time to ride the rocket up until whales decide they either want to take their sweet stolen profits distribution or we pause for another fuel up They will do whatever they can to get every last one of us on board and touch the farthest reaches of the galaxy Here s the interesting point that inspired me to write this up today Take a good hard look at the timing on PSFE s chart Notice anything interesting about the price action on Friday into today Coming out of the base of an accumulation channel after a B wave we suddenly have PSFE popping up all over WSB Look I ve been in this thing for months I m holding long because I believe in it and would love for it to get all the attention it can However even the apes on WSB were commenting on how out of nowhere the pump came from many of the posts from new accounts It was bizarre Exciting but bizarre and that s coming from someone who wants for this to pump and not dump Now look at the price action today in regards to the Wyckoff structure Sure looks an awful lot like a sign of strength right in the correct position and a big fat bull flag to boot EDIT the abbreviation on the sign is getting autobanned so that s why I keep typing it out lol https preview redd it 15mmq5trq1871 png width 2376 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3d1ac0c2f50fc8fb7b8907d9fd4a81e4d3861f9a Initially I would have said that we are premature on this sign of strength We were most likely due for another B wave and maybe we are However I can t help but ignore that timing within the structure and the fundamental psychology behind the markup PUMP Again this is just one possible read within the schematic and I d be interested to hear other reads on it too I m no expert Therefore I guess the point I m trying to make here is we have been operating within an age old structure for accumulation which has certainly given me some solace on this stock We already knew whales were loading up and now we have technical evidence to prove it However somebody is ready for this thing to move whether that s apes the tutes that had been loading or somebody who wants to spoil it for them Hold tough bulls The rocket has been fueling up for awhile They just hoped you were going to bail before take off TL DR Institutions were hoping you weren t going to catch them buying up all the seats on the PSFE rocket these last few months They ve been buying them up dirt cheap You want them to take her back down and buy the rest or do you think Planet Paysafe rich in bountiful tendies has room for us too According to Richard Wyckoff the choice could be made right now

all the points on why LZB will continue its trend upwards as home sales continue to grow As you may know La Z Boy Residential is the world s leading manufacturer of reclining chairs and one of the nation s largest producers of upholstered sofas loveseats chairs and ottomans marketed both through a large proprietary distribution network and through independent retail stores Using high quality materials and top of the line design their furniture and recliners are known to be a lifetime purchase meant to satisfy all your comfort needs Why LZB amp x200B The massive nut you ll get just from sitting in a LaZBoy recliner https preview redd it 5g6h3w7qw1871 png width 613 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 56c36cd6cb254216e0d460e1b9c14b38d06b09a1 There are several reasons why LZB is a good buy right now Similar to GME and AMC in January LZB has a relatively smaller market cap of around 1 75B Over this past week it was up 6 until it dropped 3 at market close to end the day about 1 25 in the red Every time this stock has dropped a few percent this year it rebounded between 10 20 Nasdaq has also listed it as having a fair value of 53 by Nasdaq based on the average rating by several analysts This would be a 43 estimated increase just to reach fair value This past week after earnings LZB dropped by nearly 12 indicating that a new rebound and ATH is nearby with some potential swings In a Nasdank article LZB was rated a strong buy at 42 yet it is near 37 now and being dumped well below it s fair value This is near a long term 6 month support of 36 and shows how undervalued LZB truly is The June 15th earnings call also showed why LZB has potential to grow a lot They beat the estimated earnings by 12 cents aka 16 of what was expected Additionally the trailing 12 month P E ratio is 14 31 relative to the average 17 P E ratio for most furniture companies and competitors In the earnings call it was mentioned that due to extremely high material costs currently and shortages of these items the company is not able to make as much short term profit But this is being offset by increasing prices of their furniture This means that new homeowners who need to have furniture are paying whatever price LZB sets ensuring high profits and clearance of backlogged orders through the year Also JPOW spoke on the same day of their earnings causing them to sell off really fast for no reason amp x200B I bet this is you right now you fat fuck Make money of your lazyness https preview redd it 624026ixw1871 png width 388 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 01826673909ab46b464b4745c08d83d20023419a Price Action Like I mentioned before LZB has some crazy price action amp x200B https preview redd it dfgufqm1x1871 png width 561 amp format png amp auto webp amp s eada9626f290d948842b5c0a5e1d240d9e35f0a2 As of now despite beating earnings providing guidance for long term profitability and expanding on its balance sheet As can be seen here after each drop since early January LZB recovers and reaches a new ATH Therefore this recent drop makes no sense compare to what many articles and the CEOs guidance has stated Lazy News So if you re hellah lazy and don t trust this DD here are some quotes and references directly from the news and the Laziest CEO of all time The King of Lazy CEO noted the following in the earnings call For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter record sales led to all time record profits driven by increased production capacity excellent performance by our company owned La Z Boy Furniture Galleries stores and continued growth and profitability at Joybird Fiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead Forbes also mentions the following If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer all you have to do is ask La Z Boy By one measurement that the company uses written same store sales for the entire Galleries network doubled increasing 100 for the quarter For the year those sales were up 31 Other Financials La Z Boy last announced its earnings data on June 14th 2021 The reported 0 87 EPS for the quarter topping analysts consensus estimates of 0 74 by 0 13 or about 16 The firm had revenue of 519 50 million for the quarter compared to analysts expectations of 498 53 million Its quarterly revenue was up 41 4 on a year over year basis La Z Boy has generated 2 62 earnings per share over the last year and currently has a price to

up after breakout earnings It has a low P E ratio good estimated earnings and a strong following given its reputation of having the comfiest furniture on the market I will be monitoring the price

presumably due to NDAs non disclosure agreements between the parties The USPS s unreasonable actions directly harm Plaintiff Had the USPS conducted the procurement in accordance with applicable law the Solicitation requirements and fundamental fairness Workhorse would have been awarded the contract The USPS evidently decided early in the NGDV Program that Workhorse would not be the awardee but it chose not to inform Workhorse of this fact instead allowing and even encouraging Workhorse to continue to pursue the contract In the meantime the USPS put its thumb on the scale against Workhorse It falsely blamed Workhorse s prototype vehicle for a safety incident that was clearly the result of the USPS driver s error It engaged in discussions with Workhorse that improperly failed to meaningfully notify Workhorse of perceived deficiencies in its proposal and that misled Workhorse as to the areas Workhorse needed to address in its updated proposal And it unfairly evaluated the merits of Workhorse s proposal treating Workhorse far more harshly and holding it to far stricter standards than it did the other offerors As was the USPS s design all along these improper actions left Workhorse with a technical score that ensured it had no fair chance of a contract award None of this was known to Workhorse And the coup de gras Workhorse respectfully requests this Court to enter judgment in Plaintiff s favor and to provide the following relief 1 Entry of judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against the United States 2 Entry of a declaratory judgment that the award to Oshkosh was unlawful and improper and an injunction directing that the award be terminated 3 Entry of an injunction directing the USPS to reevaluate the offerors proposals in accordance with the terms of the Solicitation applicable laws and regulations 4 Entry of an injunction directing the USPS to conduct a new best value determination and 5 Such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper

transmission for electric counterparts as the contract stated See below The fact that our favorite hedgies are back at it again See their WKHS short position below is once again short against a

you can see that more than 1 65 of shares outstanding sit at the 18 strike Also 1 47 shares outstanding are short at the 30 strike Not to mention Open Interest Updates the following trading day so this means that WKHS was short to these percentages as of Friday s trading day close So let us take a closer look at the volume At the 18 Strike there is currently over 37k volume and 20k volume at

1715,o9u3dv,t2_a0114b1c,1624916436,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9u3dv/gme_update/,1,GME UPDATE,Good morning my monkey gang Not much happened last week I can imagine that the rebalancing of the Russel 1000 led to losses In the Russell 2000 GME was a big player and well represented in the ETFs in the Russel 1000 Gamestop is probably not represented in the upper third in the ETFs but we will get answers today But now to the good news GME has sent a letter to the SEC that is tough In it they write among other things that Gamestop is not to blame for a MOASS and that they could give out dividends Should these dividends not be covered they would simply make new shares that would have to be exchanged 1 1 Here too all shorts would have to be covered immediately The possibility of a GME coin is also mentioned and that the DTCC has to sort it out somehow In short if the shit doesn t end soon Ryan Cohen hits the big red button and drops the bomb For all of you who have wondered why Gamestop is not doing anything itself the opposite is the case They got the 4 best lawyers you can have for something like that So Gamestop is serious We know that the NFT platform will go online on July 14th Perhaps a kind of coin dividend will be announced or before that And if you create a new market with a GME coin nobody can mess around Even if I definitely did not understand it in detail this is definitely a brilliant move that should clearly show who is in charge And if everything were to be correct they would have written instructions for every other company that is to be broken up on how to get out of their lack To them too it seems to be not just about GME but that the whole fuckery comes to an end Chapeau Mr Cohen You have to keep in mind what that means Just because WE saved Gamestop from the HFs 55 000 jobs were saved 55 000 lives which the HFs would have happily driven against the wall for a few dollars With all the companies that are currently being shorted there are hundreds of thousands But of course we are the bad ones if we prevent something like that We invest in a company we believe in Because we see the price being illegally suppressed Because we see that the company is run by the brightest minds because we understand what will move this company in the future We shop there to support the company in which we invest our money Others don t care which stock it is day trading for quick profits is really great Or break the whole thing without considering people to earn a few dollars Of course that is also much better than what we do At least that s what the financial experts want to tell Everyone has to decide for themselves which type of investing is sensible and which is harmful Another very good news the older monkeys and gorillas among us may still know that an SI of 226 appeared in January which was then dismissed as a glitch Now the RobinHood Class Action SI Report came out and lo and behold the SI was actually at 226 Mid January Since we also know that the shorts were never covered you can imagine how high the real SI is And if you are still wondering why the SI is officially so low shorts can be hidden as deep itm calls That makes it look like the shorts have been covered instead you just drag everything out An incredible number of these calls were also sold at the Babysqueeze If you take the number at that time as a basis and calculate the SI using the float you get 190 hidden SI in mid January Add to that the 30 that were officially and we are back at 220 How you turn it around obviously the SI was already 200 in mid January and if you consider where it is now that s what you call MOASS Oh yeah and it s called a crime You can report a maximum of 140 SI as anything above that would be a crime So it is written If the truth comes out Shitadel will be on trial for that alone As always I m not a financial advisor just a stupid old gorilla who loves the stick and his gang of monkeys

highlight of the marijuana industry this year The deal closed on May 3 and the new Tilray was formed and in the process became the world s largest cannabis company by revenue The legacy Aphria has always been a strong contender in the cannabis space because of its smart growth strategies Legacy Tilray on the other hand was a rather small company which had a market cap of 1 1 billion before the merger was announced but now holds a market cap of 7 7 billion This brought the newly combined company closer to the two leaders in the cannabis space U S cannabis company Curaleaf Holdings with a market cap of 9 5 billion and Ontario Canada based Canopy Growth with a market cap of 9 0 billion Since this was a reverse merger the legacy Aphria s management holds the decision making powers In fact Aphria s shareholders now own 62 of the new company with Irwin Simon Aphria s CEO and chairman leading the combined entity Here are all the ways Tilray can benefit from this merger and why this business is a smart buy for the long term A cannabis leaf lying on American dollar bills IMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGES What s in this merger deal for Tilray Mergers and acquisitions are not uncommon in the marijuana industry Before this merger Aphria acquired American craft beer maker SweetWater Brewing in November 2020 to make an entry into the U S cannabis beverage market Beverages are part of cannabis derivatives vapes edibles concentrates and more additional recreational products that Canada legalized in October 2019 Tilray had already made an entry into this category in October with a new line of cannabis infused edibles through its wholly owned subsidiary High Park Holdings By pooling its resources and capital the combined company can launch even more derivatives competing with peers like Canopy that are rapidly expanding in this segment In its recent fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results the legacy Tilray recorded a 20 5 year over year jump in revenue to 57 million For the full year the company reported a 26 increase in revenue to 210 million from 2019 Tilray also saw a positive adjusted EBITDA earnings before income tax depreciation and amortization of 2 2 million compared to a loss of 35 3 million in the year ago period This was Tilray s first quarter of positive EBITDA before merging with Aphria and it is a good start Aphria has been generating positive adjusted EBITDA over the past seven quarters Now Aphria s strong balance sheet and its management driving the bus can make the new Tilray a profitable cannabis company EBITDA measures a company s operational performance whereas true profitability is the total earnings after all deductions are made By merging with Aphria Tilray has equipped itself to both expand and grow A steady hand on the wheel A bigger company has some benefits access to a lot of resources manpower and capital But bigger is not always better A bigger company can also be difficult to manage It could face complications with cost synergies hidden inefficiencies merger costs and personnel That s why Irwin s leadership is so important we can expect the company to smoothly handle any challenges As CEO Irwin successfully founded and led consumer goods company Hain Celestial Group to success before doing the same for Aphria Aphria survived and thrived amid a global crisis because of Simon and his leadership team s smart growth strategies of focusing on their core operations and strengthening their brands and balance sheet rather than spending cash haphazardly on acquisitions It appears Simon plans to follow the same strategy for new Tilray building its existing brands and focusing on its roots in Canada On June 8 Tilray launched a new medical cannabis brand Symbios and a high potency medical cannabis topical under the Aphria brand for the Canadian market A smart buy for the long term The European cannabis market could grow at a compound annual growth rate of 29 6 to be worth 37 billion by 2027 This could be a lucrative opportunity for Tilray Simon expects to use Tilray s Portugal facility to help in expanding into the European market The company holds a cultivation license from the government of Portugal to produce medical marijuana products and export them throughout the continent Aphria already has a strong market presence in the medical cannabis business not only in Canada and Europe but also in Africa South America and Oceania It generates close to 97 of its distribution revenue from its Germany based subsidiary CC Pharma With prospects of federal legalization in the U S also strengthening the new Tilray could be a strong contender in the U S cannabis market five years down the line In the meantime the European international and Canadian markets can be its revenue growth driver for now We will know more about the new Tilray s performance and its long term growth strategies when it reports its next quarterly results Management expects the merger s operational efficiencies to generate 81 million in annual pre tax cost saving synergies within 18 months If you have faith in the growth of the marijuana industry Tilray is a smart buy for the long term Two strong companies with an expanded international presence strong balance sheet growing revenues moving closer to profitability and a good leadership team are all set to become a cannabis powerhouse That said do not expect any short term gains as a merger integration takes time So if you can bear the short term risks to enjoy fruitful gains in the future this cannabis stock is for you SEC Share
