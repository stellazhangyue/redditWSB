Positive economic outlook that is likely to expand PEs better earnings outlook and or 2 Cash on the sidelines liquidity and or 3 Low interest rates allowing leveraged long positioning What causes bear market 1 Negative economic outlook that is likely to shrink PEs bad earnings outlook and or 2 No cash on the sideline illiquidity everyone is all in and or 4 Rising interest rates forcing de leveraging of long positions What causes a correction in a bull market A mix of both 1 Economic outlook remains strong or neutral but not negative 2 PE runs up too high too fast in anticipation of an economic boom 3 Rising growth expectations pushes bond yields higher and threatens earnings growth Thus challenging already high flying PEs across the market 4 Illiquidity Important My case is that of a correction in a bull market What caused the bull run of Apr 2020 Apr May 2021 1 Fed has pumped a lot of money in the system and done a lot of QE over the last one year keeping short term rates near zero forcefully pushing cash into risk assets to earn yields and return no incentive to keep it deposited in a bank earning nothing This cash became capital and debt for businesses to stay afloat and keep employees employed liquidity for markets If Fed didn t do this economy would have been in a deflationary spiral and faced severe recession consequences 2 Helicopter money as fiscal stimulus showered over the economy to keep deflationary forces away trying to keep businesses in a sustainable run A good chunk of this money entered the market as well liquidity for markets 3 PEs were low in Apr 2020 because of the crash and then went super high in anticipation of the reopening The expectation was earnings growth after the economy has reopened will make the PE go down and reasonable again And earnings have been great so market has still been in a bull run in Q1 and Apr 2021 4 Bonds yields remained severely low April to Aug 2020 and then began to pick up Caused a shake out in expensive stocks in Feb 2021 and since then have remained relatively calm between 1 5 to 1 7 Stock market ran on FAANMG through till late August 2020 lowest bond yield and then it ran primarily on value stocks August till now Bonds yields going up too high too fast would have been bad news for equities all in all But that has not happened yet even with big inflation prints So markets can still continue to run on this premise Where do we stand right now The economic outlook still remains good and positive Bond yields have remained calmed contrary to popular belief that it will go higher with bad inflation prints We have had bad inflation prints the last two months greater than expected but the bond market grossly already had it priced in Earnings beat have been huge for most tickers in the SP500 and that has allowed them to run even higher falling PE allowing them to grow But something happened in Feb Apr 2021 The market has been more and more selective about allocating capital Rather than frenzied buying of all things it became careful about selecting only those stocks that makes sense PE wise growth expectation wise earnings expectations wise and etc The Fed ended the relaxation of SLR requirements for big banks in March 2021 Relaxed SLR requirements put in place as an emergency during the pandemic allowed banks more room in their balance sheets for a Fed QE cash reserves b Cash deposits c treasuries Tightened SLR requirements meant banks needed to re adjust So they might have been the ones behind massive treasury sell offs that we saw going into March 2021 and April 2021 However the new bunch of stimulus put more stress on their balance sheets Now they need to have more cash deposits so as a result the cash reserves needs to stop or taken out Stopping QE would solve this problem since it would mean Fed won t put new cash reserves with the banks anymore Meanwhile around Mar and Apr 2021 the inflation concern has already began to pick up as the economy began to reopen Commodity prices were skyrocketing around this time So what can the Fed do Should they stop asset purchases and end QE If they do this long term bond yields would go high and this will make borrowing costly for the government Can t let it happen will have severe long term impact So the best they can do is start purchases towards the long end of the treasury yield curve in other words YCC This to make sure the long term rates are artificially low with their purchases keeping borrowing still cheap However this doesn t solve the cash reserve problem of the banks In order to solve this the Fed started doing reverse repo exchanges actively beginning Apr 2021 Do you get the picture Their is no additional cash reserve being deposited plus the Fed is sucking out the cash reserve sitting with banks Outcome 1 Fed induced liquidity of 120bn per month is already stopping Tapering has began 2 Short term interest are very very marginally going up from negative to zero rates 3 Dollar is beginning to go down because of distorted long term bond real yields Gold is going up as it it is inversely related to real yields 4 Capped liquidity is beginning to show up in many speculative commodity futures the prices of which has recently experienced a pullback Lumber down about 30 from its ATHs Capped liquidity also made internet c0rn stop and other c0rns stop going vertical and then they came crashing down Capped liquidity have also made equity markets go sideways until recently If the stock market is a p0nzee scheme it can stay afloat if there is a wall of money going into it regularly Liquidity drying up just means we are nearing a peak and a good pullback would adjust the market to its right place price in a few weeks or a couple of months The government is already set to spend big on top of what they have already spent These additional funds will be money in the future when they are released potentially pushing the market higher We remain in a bull market medium to long term in my personal opinion However these enormous fiscal deficits can fuel the inflation narrative again and regarding the sourcing these funds can either be funded via taxes or additional debt treasury issuance Biden would want these spending plans to go through smoothly strengthening his re election chances He would also not want any obstacle such as runaway inflation that can hamper his reign Janet Yellen would want treasuries to be auctioned smoothly with greater demand for US debt and rates low reasonable That can only happen if inflation fears are not present among the auction participants and the bond market feels they are getting a bargain with low yielding treasuries If auctions become tough Fed can step in buy bonds but this will kill the dollar Which probably might not be something Biden JPOW Yellen wants Biggest obstacle in these big plans remains inflation And only Fed has the tools to control it or rather they are mandated to do so Higher the inflation higher the borrowing cost greater the chance of dollar devaluation Moderate inflation moderate cost of borrowing coupled with tax hikes ideal news for all parties involved Inflation prints have been bad and it might not be entirely a supply side issue Fed probably recognizes this and hence the measures to suck out the cash reserves I think so SLR tightening was the first step to control the liquidity Then it became Reverse Repo activity coupled with YCC now the next step would most likely be tapering At the rate the Reverse Repo exchanges are being conducted recently there is good chance JPOW might come out and announce in the summer about thinking about tapering some months later The next FOMC event is on 15 16 June and then they meet in July Tapering will calm the inflation fears It might cause bond yields to spike short term but then it should come down with time in the medium to long term The last time the tapering impacted bond market more severely than the stock market This time as well I don t think we will see a major correction Most likely a 10 drawdown and then it will be back up again in a few weeks The stock market probably already expects a Fed announcement soon and is beginning to try to price it in Additional note freeing of cash reserves should mean banks will finally have precious precious balance sheet space free d up This free d up space in the immediate short run might allow for money managers and hedge funds to increase their leverage Perhaps that s why we are seeing as the broader market remains sideways the heavily shorted meme stocks are experiencing a boom all of a sudden The newly found leverage is probably working its way through the system and can easily have a spill over effect in the broader equity markets But that I mean a short term abnormal bull run Timeline I have in mind TLDR possible abnormal bull run maybe next week SP500 and Nasdaq can easily go above and beyond ATHs by a couple of percentage points 10 June CPI print causes a jitter and the market sells off moderately More red days follow And then on 15 16 June 2021 the FOMC meeting confirms the beginning of a correction lasting a couple of months Note the stock market correction would technically be driven by bond market sell off driving yields higher I might not have been able to put my thoughts very clearly in this post Just because there is so much to cover and some of it very complicated to explain I have gathered the above understanding from extensively reading various blog posts going through fed data observing the timeline of events I would be more than happy if

my perspective TLDR Shorts think after the economy opens up people will probably stop investing as much and that the retail investors will disappear The shorts have been shorting specific stocks with commonalities GME AMC BBBY KOSS etc have been targeted for being Brick amp Mortar not adapting to the digital age declining revenue and so forth and targeted these companies at their weakest point during COVID 19 Stocks like UWMC RKT were targeted because of the real estate boom bubble SPAC UWMC before going public Inflation thinking the world will collapse and another mortgage crisis will ensure like back in 2008 2009 Actually real quick I want to talk about that to explain that Back in 2008 2009 the American Banks were creating what are called CDO s or mortgage back securities and trading them These mortgage back securities were essentially mortgage loans bundled up and borrowed against and traded as a security There s levels of quality of CDO s such as AAA AA A BBB BB B CCC CC C etc They re called tranches What these banks were doing was instead of having tranches of AAA loans in the AAA security they would mix match them and rebrand them as a higher quality then they really were Example mix a bunch of B s C s D s with the A s and sell them at overvaluation Additionally the nation was at all time highs for home purchases and lenders banks were approving and giving out loans like peanuts because there was very little regulations at that time in comparison to now So there was a multitude of people who had very poor credit scores bankruptcies defaults etc that we re being approved Essentially a lot of people who shouldn t have qualified and had very little consistency for making payments were approved This came into the grading of the CDO s The crooked banks were pushing these CDO s and were buying a bunch of them Little to what they knew is the ones who created the CDO s that they were being sold were absolute shit Securities sold as A or B quality but were filled with C and D dogshit Michael Burry among others noticed that these CDO s were starting to default and when they looked into it further they found out what I just mentioned Once the defaults started occurring one after the other all the major banks holding these CDO s where trying to off ramp them and smaller banks investors who bought them were out of the loop Didn t take long for big banks to realize and do the inverse and actually short their own product CDO s to not only profit from it but to get out of they re fuck up which crashed the economy CDO s shouldn t exist but when CDO s were first created I forgot the guys name they were actually a good thing when used correctly These banks started leveraging these CDO s and CDO concept creating new CDO s out of other CDO s which would than be termed synthetic CDO s etc and selling them for more profit You d be surprised CDO s still exist after 2008 2009 but both CDO s and mortgage lending is now highly regulated with strict guidelines to ensure what happened in 2008 2009 wouldn t occur again This is the biggest reason why the 2008 2009 mortgage crisis and crash occurred Also UWMC for example is a mortgage originator lender They don t lend the funds the banks do They process the applications and make money from the mortgage servicing rights Anyways what the shorts didn t expect is the retail investors rising from out of left field and seeing value in all these stocks Include the acknowledgment of ridiculous short interests and with the full intent on capitalizing on COVID 19 to drive companies to bankrupt themselves and profit heavily from it The shorts thought us average Joe s or Johanne s were retarded but they didn t factor in how retarded we actually were They thought Harambe died in 2016 but his spirit lives for ever within us and we went ape shit and the shorts had no idea on what to do Mass manipulation media FUD everything was being thrown but it never worked They stayed in their positions kept accruing losses and continued playing and underestimating the average investor I believe these fuck nuts are staying in their positions because they anticipate inflation from when the economy opens up after COVID 19 I think they believe that once that occurs people will no longer be at home as much and will lose interest in investing in stocks But here s the kicker just as many companies have grown and adapted to the new age of technology especially with COVID 19 being a catalyst and pretty much forcing them too the same occured with us everyday humans A lot more people have been educated in investing and FD s Everything is now at our finger tips on our phones No one is leaving So while they keep adding to their positions and believing in their convictions they haven t lost yet don t forget that They might be at these massive losses but their mostly unrealized losses They have big money in their pockets to back them These aren t just one time squeezes they know think that they can just wait it out until the economy reopens What they don t realize is the extreme retardation of our communities and fellow apes The game has really only begun so they can fuck off This is a fucking casino sir they want to treat it as such so will we Sincerely I see you re bullshit

morning to all of you here on r wallstreetbets I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and is ready for the new trading week ahead Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 31st 2021 A big jobs report looms in the week ahead as markets enter the often weak month of June Source https www cnbc com 2021 05 28 jobs report looms in the week ahead as markets enter the often weak month of june html gt May s employment report is the big event in the week ahead as stocks enter the often weak month of June Stocks are finishing May with a mixed performance Big cap indexes like the S amp P 500 and Dow notched gains The S amp P rose a half percent and the Dow rose 1 9 The small cap Russell 2000 was flat up 0 1 and the tech heavy Nasdaq declined 1 5 gt June is not historically a strong month for stocks Bespoke Investment Group points out that over the past 50 years the Dow has gained just 0 12 in June and has been positive 52 of the time gt But over the past 20 years June was far weaker gaining only 40 of the time June s performance is tied with September as the worst month of the year with an average Dow decline of 0 7 according to Bespoke gt The economy is front and center in the coming week with the important ISM readings on manufacturing and services sector activity but the most important measure will be Friday s jobs report According to Dow Jones economists expect Friday s employment report to show the creation of about 674 000 jobs in May after the disappointing 266 000 jobs added in April That was about a quarter of what economists had expected gt You know if we have two months in a row of not delivering on the jobs expectations the market is going to get nervous said George Goncalves head of U S macro strategy at MUFG Hopefully we beat it and then that creates a positive buzz and we go into the Fed meeting and then we re Hey the economy is still on track gt Big June event gt The Fed meets June 15 16 and already market pros are anticipating it will be the most important event of the month Fed officials have emphasized that they will keep policy easy as they watch to see signs that the economy is really healing They also contend that higher inflation readings are temporary since the data is being compared with a weak period last year gt Key for the markets is whether the Fed begins to believe that inflation is higher than it expected or that the economy is strengthening enough to progress without so much monetary support Fed officials have said they would consider discussing tapering back on their quantitative easing bond purchase program if they see signs of improvement and that would be a first step toward interest rate hikes not expected until at least 2023 gt If inflation runs too hot the Fed s main weapon to combat it is to raise interest rates gt The prospect of higher interest rates makes the stock market nervous since it would mean higher costs for companies and less liquidity In theory higher interest rates also means that investors could potentially choose higher yielding bond investments over stocks gt The next big read for the economy is Friday s jobs report and it looms large as recent inflation readings have come in much hotter than expected The latest was the personal consumption expenditures price index Friday It showed core inflation running at 3 1 year over year the strongest reading for that measure since 1992 gt The Fed s beige book on the economy is expected Wednesday ISM manufacturing data is expected Tuesday and ISM services is released Thursday Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on central banks and climate change at Green Swan 2021 global virtual conference Friday gt Inflation flare up gt The Fed has said it would tolerate an average range of inflation around its 2 target until it sees inflation sticking at a higher level Inflation has been running mostly below 2 prior to the latest numbers gt With the PCE number coming in like every other inflation number over the last six weeks hotter than expected the market is inching closer to calling the Fed out on its view that inflation is transitory said Julian Emanuel head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG gt Emanuel said the speculative activity around meme stocks this week is a sign of froth and shows a large amount of liquidity in the hands of investors One of those stocks AMC closed off 1 5 on Friday after rallying 116 in the past week giving it a 2021 gain of 1 200 gt The net net on the index level is basically it s a stock market that s moving sideways Emanuel said Our view continues to be that when you look at it longer term the big picture is this is a bull market that started in March of last year that has further to run When you look at it in the medium term the market has every right to be concerned and we do believe they will amp up their concern that the Fed s paying insufficient attention to price stability gt Emanuel said he studied what happened to stocks when core PCE was above the Fed s 2 target The average monthly return for months where the core PCE has been over 2 going back to 1989 is a decline of 1 6 with a decided bias toward more defensive sectors like health care outperforming and a very pronounced bias for technology of all kinds to underperform he said gt Technology stocks as measured by the S amp P information technology sector gained 1 6 in the past month and are up 5 9 year to date The sector is lagging the S amp P 500 s 12 gain gt The top performing sectors have been cyclical year to date with energy up 36 2 financials up 28 5 materials up 20 1 and industrials up 18 3 Communications services which contains some internet growth names gained 16 since the start of the year Health care has been outperforming information technology up 8 6 year to date gt In the past week the S amp P 500 gained 1 2 to 4 204 and is within 1 of its all time high The Dow rose 0 9 to 34 529 and the Nasdaq was up 2 at 13 748 gt Red flag On the edges of the financial markets market pros are paying attention to signs of a huge surge of liquidity in the financial system In the past week institutions have been placing unprecedented amounts of cash with the Fed nearly a half trillion dollars Thursday gt There s way too much liquidity in the system and it s happening as a result of the Fed s ongoing QE but also disbursements from the fiscal stimulus said Goncalves gt He said the funds from trillions in stimulus including to state and local governments have not yet been spent but have found their way into the banking system At the same time institutions and individuals continue to move funds into money market funds now holding about 4 6 trillion gt Those funds also put pressure on the system since they put funds in Treasury bills Goncalves expects the Fed to raise rates on excess reserves if the situation gets worse gt There s no precedent for this because it is totally a function of there being just too much money in the system he said gt Institutions are redepositing cash at the Fed because they don t have enough bills or short term commercial paper There s not enough fixed income assets to go around said Goncalves He said banks also do not want to hold the excess cash since it counts against their leverage ratio and they would prefer to find other higher yielding investments gt What it has done is sparked some speculation that the Fed would taper its QE program sooner than expected he said This past week saw the following moves in the S amp P

Checking the Gauges Economic Surprise Indexes gt In terms of whether economic data is either beating or missing economists forecasts it appears conditions may now be a bit better overseas Driven by some improving COVID 19 trends the economic backdrop has improved overseas while high economic expectations have proved to be a more formidable hurdle here in the U S This improvement has helped to steady the foundation in many non U S equity markets and has caused us to improve our outlook for developed non U S stocks We believe the improving COVID 19 trends in Europe could be particularly sticky as vaccine distribution becomes more widespread gt For several years now being underweight European equities relative to the U S has been a winning trade A sea change in that thinking could be approaching as value heavy European indices have gotten some attention with the improvement from value but a firm constructive view of European equities may still be some ways off gt The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index or CESI tracks how the economic data fare compared with expectations The index rises when economic data exceeds Bloomberg consensus estimates and falls when data is below forecasts As shown in the LPL Chart of the day economically global conditions remain rather strong as evidenced by these indices which remain above the zero line This reflects economic data coming in better than expected in several geographic regions The repair of global trade activity as supply lines are reconnected has been notably key in non U S data outcomes gt CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART https i2 wp com lplresearch com wp content uploads 2021 05 blog chart 5 27 21 png ssl 1 gt Looking ahead we expect now elevated economic expectations particularly in the U S may prove a tougher target As a result economic surprises both in the U S and abroad may fade as we move through the year However the overall global growth trajectory is expected to continue to be robust through 2021 Global real GDP contracted 3 3 in 2020 and it is expected to rise to 6 0 in 2021 according to Bloomberg s consensus estimate before ticking down to 3 4 in 2022 gt Although high U S economic expectations could be tough to beat for the remainder of 2021 we still believe U S stocks should make up a material portion of equity portfolios And even though economic expectations are being more readily exceeded overseas it is tough to overlook U S companies innovation and profitability advantages explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki gt More and More Investors Are Looking For A Correction gt The S amp P 500 has been hovering around 0 5 below its record highs this week but without a true test of those highs sentiment has not moved very far The American Association of Individual Investors weekly reading on bullish sentiment fell from 37 last week down to 36 4 While that is the second week in a row with an absolute move less than a full percentage point in size the marginally

percentage point drop to 51 5 the lowest level since March 10th Meanwhile bearish sentiment moderated from 17 2 to 16 8 That was the same level as the start of the month gt The percentage of respondents looking for a correction was more notable Rather than simply asking whether or not respondents foresee a correction in the technical sense on the horizon a 10 decline from a high Investors Intelligence defines a newsletter writer as looking for a correction when they are bullish on a list of stocks but at a lower price point Coming in at 31 7 the reading is a few percentage points above the historical average of 27 6 and is in the top quartile of the historical range In other words it is an elevated reading albeit far from without precedence What is more significant is that it has

number of units This is easy I ll go ahead and sell the Switch now for 200 and then buy it for 180 with the coupon Easiest 20 I ll ever make He goes and tells all his parents friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids He collects 200 each from 150 parents He now has 30K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for 27K He ll have earned 3K in just a few hours His parents will be so proud There s another kid watching Melvin this entire time Let s call him Keith Keith doesn t like Melvin Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot Later in the day Melvin goes to Gamestop with his 20 off coupon and says I ll take 150 Nintendo Switches please Gamestop guy looks at him and says Sorry we re all sold out Melvin goes to the next Gamestop Same story All sold out He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can t find a single Switch He won t be able to fulfill the orders Meanwhile Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought no matter how much he offers you Nobody likes Melvin so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch Melvin is in trouble His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch Melvins parents are angry but they don t want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club They have to help Melvin gets 150 Nintendo Switches Now remember there are only 100 Switches in the city but Melvin has created the expectation among the parents that there are 150 This is how you get a short percentage over 100 Melvin has promised more than actually exist The price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends but they had to pay really inflated prices for them first 1 000 then 2 000 now 3 000 It s nearing Christmas and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids They can t trust that Melvin will be able to get them one They all start bidding against each other for Switches Everybody in town is in on the action now Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for 10 000 Meanwhile Keith and his friends are just hanging out and playing Animal Crossing Edit 1 Thanks for all the love and awards I m really grateful I ll try to answer as many question as I can on the thread and in the DM s Edit 2 A few astute monkeys have pointed out some flaws in my story The example above is an oversimplification and I left a few important elements So here s an expanded version and I ve had to adjust some of the numbers above to make room for new wrinkles In a more accurate version Melvin went to his brother Steve s high school and borrowed 150 Nintendo Switches from the high schoolers He tells them all that if he doesn t give them back within 24 hours he will give them each 5 per day The high schoolers know that it s not likely that Melvin will give it back in 24 hours so they will be perfectly happy to collect 5 per day He sells the 150 Switches to the Country Club parents for 200 each but now he owes 150 Switches to the high schoolers This is a naked short He sold Switches that were borrowed but didn t own Let s assume the Country Club parents wrapped the Switches and they are now under the tree and out of circulation Although there are 250 Switches in the city there are now only 100 Switches in circulation Keith s friends So you have a situation where Melvin owes 150 Switches to high schoolers and there are only 100 available 150 short position of float Melvin is overconfident and thinks he will get 150 Switches same day or at the very worse case the day after and maybe have to pay 150 Switches x 5 penalty 450 He ll still have made 3 000 450 2 550 The 5 penalty due to the high schoolers is interest or Melvin s carrying costs so the longer Melvin cannot get the Switches the more expensive it s going to be for him After 4 days he s at break even and will lose 450 for each day he cannot get a Switch It gets very expensive for Melvin and his parents very quickly This is what s happening for the past week or so for GME The hedge funds are bleeding money every day they cannot fulfill the IOU For those who are asking why Melvin doesn t just pay off the high schoolers with money let s say that the new Zelda game is coming out and they all want to play They also know that the price of Switches is rising Even if Melvin offered 800 or 1 000 to cancel the IOU they know that they can no longer get a Switch on the open market In addition the high schoolers are probably aware of the rising trend in Switch prices They may think that it s better to wait for a Switch that will be worth 15 000 in a few days than to get paid off by Steve now for 1 000 So while it s possible that Melvin could buy his way out of it it s very difficult

position of float Melvin is overconfident and thinks he will get 150 Switches same day or at the very worse case the day after and maybe have to pay 150 Switches x 5 penalty 450 He ll still have made 3 000 450 2 550 The 5 penalty due to the high schoolers is interest or Melvin s carrying costs so the longer Melvin cannot get the Switches the more expensive it s going to be for him After 4 days he s at break even and will lose 450 for each day he cannot get a Switch It gets very expensive for Melvin and his parents very quickly This is what s happening for the past week or so for GME The hedge funds are bleeding money every day they cannot fulfill the IOU For those who are asking why Melvin doesn t just pay off the high schoolers with money let s say that the new Zelda game is coming out and they all want to play They also know that the price of Switches is rising Even if Melvin offered 800 or 1 000 to cancel the IOU they know that they can no longer get a Switch on the open market In addition the high schoolers are probably aware of the rising trend in Switch prices They may think that it s better to wait for a Switch that will be worth 15 000 in a few days than to get paid off by Steve now for 1 000 So while it s possible that Melvin could buy his way out of it it s very difficult

SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERVALUED WITH MODERATE IMMEDIATE UPSIDE 1 2 weeks 26 gt 31 AND 2 3x POTENTIAL BY END OF YEAR BEING ONE OF THE COMPANIES BEST POSITIONED TO PROFIT OFF THE PRESENT AND NAVIGATE THE FUTURE OF THE OIL INDUSTRY We live in oily times This has been the case since the dawn of the petroleum industry it is the lifeblood of the world almost quite literally and our first fears of oil were that we would drain the planet dry Now consensus is shifting towards the real issue with reliance upon fossil fuels if we keep up as we have been we will end all life on the planet in quite a different way Climate change is real and the mainstream narrative has finally caught up with covid slowly fading away and an era of relative peace apart from the middle east exploding as usual and china slowly buying the world it is going to become the hottest topic on our plates and people are going to be feeling very angry about the prime culprits big oil This has already started last week with the first strikes hitting Shell and Exxon and I have absolutely no doubt that similar incidents will continue to sweep across the industry especially once we hit full reopening and the media needs its next big fix of drama For those invested or who are considering investing in the oil industry we live in uncertain times but again we live in oily times I truly believe that the energy oil sector will fully recover from COVID and begin to absolutely take off over the next few years but not without a significant degree of turbulence regarding oil companies This will not be based around fundamentals but fear For this reason I feel that Occidental Petroleum is the best positioned company to weather the potential media circus profit off the rising prices of oil and make absolute bank as they begin to shift into carbon capture which is what I believe to be the future of oil companies in an attempt to remain carbon neutral without massive restructuring and countless stranded assets Much of what I m saying will apply to many small midcap petroleum companies but I like OXY the most and I love the technical setup which I can t say for other strong candidates like Devon Energy DVN SUPPLY AND DEMAND Oil players cutting production without a meaningful reduction in demand is massively bullish for oil The lower the supply the higher the demand and thus the higher the price of any given commodity If the oil industry is forced to restrict oil extraction the first companies on the block for being strong armed into lowering production are going to be the supermajors OXY is not a supermajor and has already lowered production plans to keep production lowered this year and leaned out significantly as they are now profitable at around 30bbl if I read correctly Therefore reduced production from the supermajors in a sector that is already likely to hit a supply crunch sometime this year is bullish for all small midcap oil producers and although they have seen good quarterly results many of them are yet to recover to pre covid levels TECHNICALS I m still too poor to afford crayons but the long and short of it is this On March 5th 2021 oil closed at 66 27bbl OXY was valued at 31 23 per share On May 28th 2021 oil closed at 66 66bbl Aside from this being very bullish for Satan the price of OXY at close was 25 96 This to me makes no sense at all given that OXY could be considered as a highly levered company regarding oil prices The price of oil did not spike as rapidly as it did in March but right now it feels to be in a very clear uptrend and has demonstrated a level of stability that March did not Moreso OXY posted strong earnings and an EPS beat but they have been unable to recover recent highs and pre covid highs still seem to be a distant dream though entirely realistic within my eyes To me this lack of positive price action is purely because of FUD people aren t sure what to make of oil right now because they re smooth brained retards The bottom line is the bottom line OXY and friends are making big bucks and the more restrictions the industry as a whole finds itself slapped with the higher the cost of oil which leads to greater benefit for small medium players Or potentially bankruptcy but I think OXY s investment in carbon capture is their silver bullet which will give them safe haven and even greater appeal in the face of future uncertainty CARBON CAPTURE OXY has significant interest in carbon capture This is sort of beyond the scope of this DD but essentially carbon capture is used to sequester carbon and in this case this captured carbon is used to pump more oil out of the ground I personally believe it s going to be an incredibly helpful and possibly even necessary technology and I think if restrictions do pass in regards to oil drilling it s going to come also in the form of regulations mandating an amount of carbon capture per output I m aware that there s quite a lot of debate regarding the actual usefulness of carbon capture but it has clear and undeniable benefit in oil drilling and regardless governments throw money at nonsense all the time and even if it is ultimately an ineffective method I believe that carbon capture is likely to see significant interest and investment It is entirely possible that OXY becomes an industry leader in this respect and it would mark a ridiculously lucrative pivot when combined with their current position in oil This could easily see them reaching the ranks of the supermajors if these companies are unable to keep up with the current state of change and can find no appropriate pivot themselves THE SHORT TERM PLAY The price of oil has been inching towards testing 5 year highs over the past week having pushed past 52w highs on the Friday but closing lower on the day I believe this is for a single reason one which will have resolved by the 1st of June We re currently in a long weekend with an OPEC meeting on Tuesday and the Iranian oil sanction FUD is still weighing heavily on the market Thus it would have been foolish to buy into a stock position over the last few days when next week will give much greater clarity hence why a number of oil equities have remained somewhat flat compared to similar price action in March since it is not entirely clear in which direction oil prices will go right now and a lot can change over a long weekend into an OPEC meeting Personally I believe that oil prices will go right the fuck up OPEC is unlikely to deviate from their plan and will very likely talk on how they would handle the potential reintroduction of Iranian oil to the market This coming off of the memorial day weekend being a psychological marker that things are back to normal with the weeks following being historically bullish for the market in general the current concerns on inflation the stories on oil majors cutting back production and the ongoing tensions in the middle east makes me think we see oil cross 68bbl by next week and without a significant pullback 70bbl by mid June Therefore the play is simple Check oil price movement immediately following the OPEC meeting on Tuesday and if it s stable or moving up buy July 9th OXY calls at a 28 strike my price target being 33 So long as oil doesn t crash back below 65 I have no doubt that OXY will retrace to at least 30 by July 9th which is a comfortable 100 profit at current prices I also expect an IV bump following OPEC as there should be some large buys as funds rush to reposition themselves in oil stocks once the FUD clears A few of the stocks in this sector OXY and RIG in particular are quite prone to posting 10 to 15 green days out of nowhere and OXY is well overdue for one Overall these stocks have been lagging in confidence compared to March even with more stable price action and higher highs I expect a correction to the upside very soon THE LONG TERM PLAY In the unlikely even that oil tanks after the OPEC meeting we move to long term buy OXY calls or shares at whatever price they ve dipped to the next time oil is around 58 60bb l because that feels like a historically strong level of support and should hold even stronger given the current monetary environment As long as oil is above 55bbl OXY is sitting in a pretty profitable space so a significant drop in price if oil drops to around the 60bbl mark would indicate the stock being oversold compared to fundamentals and it s likely to pop back up around the Q2 Q3 earnings Buy and hold for 5 10 years and I see a relatively safe 3 5x Boomer shit and I bet they ll even up their dividend by then but I think 2023 calls are a bit unpredictable 2022 are likely to print I like 40s but things might get choppy past then Still even with their level of debt I don t see OXY as among the companies that may go under during the coming massive shifts in the oil industry and I believe that they will be debt free within a few years and successfully pivot to carbon capture and make a new name for themselves there Potentially literally given that Total is now TotalEnergies and Petroleum is going to go the way of the gamer word amp x200B BEAR CASE There s really not much here to be bearish about it depends on the price movement of oil and investor sentiment about large debtors Personally I believe that OXY will have a significantly cleaner balance sheet by end of year and given some stability in the price of oil above 60bbl I think most investors will come around to that fact too but given the general uncertainty in the market strangely absent this week as it was overall bullish OXY is not the safest investment and the smart money required to move the needle on an established and problem large cap significantly might be absent for a few years yet until some definite stability and repayment of debt is found Also OXY did some potentially really stupid shit hedging oil prices and their profits are capped at oil being 75bbl Personally I think this is fine as I see oil capping out at around 75bbl for the year but expect OXY stock price to hit a ceiling around there if crude does breach 75 this year At which point I would advise either DVN or RIG as they have much more room to run in a significant oil bull market amp x200B amp x200B Thanks for reading if you have Good luck to all this is one of the ideas I have been more confident on this year and since I have made a fair bit of money off of various DDs shared here and I fucking hate what this place has become by the way but shout out to steel gang I have wanted to give back in some way

UNDERVALUED WITH MODERATE IMMEDIATE UPSIDE 1 2 weeks 26 gt 31 AND 2 3x POTENTIAL BY END OF YEAR BEING ONE OF THE COMPANIES BEST POSITIONED TO PROFIT OFF THE PRESENT AND NAVIGATE THE FUTURE OF THE OIL INDUSTRY We live in oily times This has been the case since the dawn of the petroleum industry it is the lifeblood of the world almost quite literally and our first fears of oil were that we would drain the planet dry Now consensus is shifting towards the real issue with reliance upon fossil fuels if we keep up as we have been we will end all life on the planet in quite a different way Climate change is real and the mainstream narrative has finally caught up with covid slowly fading away and an era of relative peace apart from the middle east exploding as usual and china slowly buying the world it is going to become the hottest topic on our plates and people are going to be feeling very angry about the prime culprits big oil This has already started last week with the first strikes hitting Shell and Exxon and I have absolutely no doubt that similar incidents will continue to sweep across the industry especially once we hit full reopening and the media needs its next big fix of drama For those invested or who are considering investing in the oil industry we live in uncertain times but again we live in oily times I truly believe that the energy oil sector will fully recover from COVID and begin to absolutely take off over the next few years but not without a significant degree of turbulence regarding oil companies This will not be based around fundamentals but fear For this reason I feel that Occidental Petroleum is the best positioned company to weather the potential media circus profit off the rising prices of oil and make absolute bank as they begin to shift into carbon capture which is what I believe to be the future of oil companies in an attempt to remain carbon neutral without massive restructuring and countless stranded assets Much of what I m saying will apply to many small midcap petroleum companies but I like OXY the most and I love the technical setup which I can t say for other strong candidates like Devon Energy DVN SUPPLY AND DEMAND Oil players cutting production without a meaningful reduction in demand is massively bullish for oil The lower the supply the higher the demand and thus the higher the price of any given commodity If the oil industry is forced to restrict oil extraction the first companies on the block for being strong armed into lowering production are going to be the supermajors OXY is not a supermajor and has already

business models Here s my full case , 1 Amazon wants to open up physical stores to sell over stocked computer equipment from their warehouses Gamestop has suitable locations for them all across the country to do so Amazon has been looking into this idea even before the pandemic and delayed its plans because of the pandemic Essentially Amazon has a bunch of excess stock of computer equipment in its warehouses that they really just want to get rid of since it costs money to store Instead of throwing it out they would prefer to sell it even at a big discount This is likely stuff like older graphics cards monitors computers etc This solves a key issue with Gamestop s business model Gamestop s margin s suck Selling computer equipment that would have just been thrown out anyway means that every dollar sold is a dollar saved amp x200B Here s the original news report for anyone who wants more information https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 04 01 amazon explored opening home goods electronics discount store https www bloomberg com news articles 2021 04 01 amazon explored opening home goods electronics discount store And if you re paywalled out here s a couple others that should do the trick https www businessinsider com amazon discussed discount electronics home goods stores report 2021 4 https www businessinsider com amazon discussed discount electronics home goods stores report 2021 4 https www bnnbloomberg ca amazon explored opening home goods electronics discount store 1 1585362 https www bnnbloomberg ca amazon explored opening home goods electronics discount store 1 1585362 amp x200B 2 A number of ex Amazon executives already work at Gamestop in the C Suite Due to this the cultures of the companies are likely to become very similar and people at Amazon and Gamestop are likely to have worked together in the past This makes any type of business combination much easier amp x200B Here s a couple I m sure you guys can add more to this list Chief Growth Officer CGO Elliott Wilke Chief Operating Officer COO Jenna Owens Chief Technology Officer CTO Matt Francis amp x200B https www businessinsider com gamestop announces third hire from amazon for executive team 2021 3 https www businessinsider com gamestop announces third hire from amazon for executive team 2021 3 amp x200B 3 A clean exit from a short selling debacle Many people have floated around theories of naked short selling imaginary shares etc No matter if you believe these are correct or not lets make an assumption here that there is something fishy going on If there is something fishy going on there s nothing the SEC would like more than to neatly sweep it under the rug Lets say this fishy thing makes it so that closing all short positions in GameStop would cause the stock price to skyrocket due to a share shortage and pose a serious threat to the entire financial system Obviously this isn t a great outcome if the financial system fails How does Amazon solve this An all stock deal Short sellers go from being short Gamestop to being short Amazon The number of liquid shares of Amazon is far greater in dollar value than the liquid shares of Gamestop This means that short sellers would be able to close out of their position without pushing up Amazon s stock price to some ridiculous number amp x200B 4 Amazon has the cash to bankroll and supercharge Gamestop s innovation Between developing NFTs and reinventing their business Gamestop has some challenges ahead of it To execute on their strategies they will need cash to do so An Amazon Gamestop merger is more valuable than Gamestop alone and Amazon alone Furthermore Amazon could benefit from this Gamestop s NFT technology think digital rights management solution for all of Amazon s content and expand its market share in collectables and gaming amp x200B 5 Amazon could use a distraction from news focusing on thwarted worker unionization attempts Being able to shift the news narrative from Amazon kills unionization attempts to Amazon saves 50 000 jobs at struggling retailer Gamestop seems like an obvious perk of doing this deal amp x200B Just a couple recent articles about Amazon Frontpage news was made fairly recently as Amazon defeated a unionization attempt https www aljazeera com economy 2021 5 19 amazon plans for new alabama warehouse after us union defeat https www aljazeera com economy 2021 5 19 amazon plans for new alabama warehouse after us union defeat amp x200B A NYT article titled How Amazon Crushes Unions https www nytimes com 2021 03 16 technology amazon unions virginia html https www nytimes com 2021 03 16 technology amazon unions virginia html amp x200B 6 Jeff Bezos is looking for a new project Being the biggest champion of GameStop would cement his legacy Now that Jeff Bezos is stepping down as CEO of Amazon he has time to work on new projects Gamestop sounds like a fun fixer upper for a billionaire with some extra time on his hands Furthermore the rivalry between Elon Musk and Bezos has never been greater their competing space projects blue origin and spacex have gone head to head in recent years Elon has a key advantage that Bezos doesn t though a die hard fanbase Arguably these fans have really powered SpaceX and Tesla s success as Elon s celebrity status draws in talent and sells product Bezos while popular doesn t quite have the same type of energized fans Buying Gamestop would also buy him an army of WSB apes and close the gap Elon amp Jeff have been rivals for years https www businessinsider com jeff bezos elon musk rivalry history timeline 2020 7 https www businessinsider com jeff bezos elon musk rivalry history timeline 2020 7 Plus now that he is single he has time to play videogames amp x200B 7 Bootstrapping Amazon s P E Ratio Buying GameStop would make Amazon look cheaper in terms of P E ratio As of 5 28 yahoo finance is showing forward next 12 months PE ratios of 54 for Amazon and 37 for Gamestop price around 220 as of 5 28 Having a P E ratio of 54 and buying a company with a PE ratio of 37 makes the combined company have a P E ratio somewhere between the two Amazon P E ratio going from 54 to less than 54 makes the stock look like a better deal to investors

permission to translate post can share chat with Mod if required or check directly with him and fuck his wife ok didn t ask for permission after and he agreed to all most of this wholeheartedly like a true Autist I am trying to catch the message so don t expect a word by word translation as you can never catch the greatness of the text in it s entirety and I got to translate it in a way that even a US degenerate can follow it As usual no financial advice I more or less just copied the text because I liked the text and I like the share In general I have likely lost more than I won and the stock market is a mystery in itself to me So make your own due dilligence and don t trust financial advice of others the argument for that you can read to a certain extent below Autists Degenerates Idiocracy of the World let me get this straight In the coming days I don t wanna see all this whining and bitching on this sub and espescially in the daily GME threads anymore On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt you read messages the likes of this is over we missed the squeeze I am going to loose it all entered at 320 I am doomed What the fuck is wrong with you retards did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right 1 You come to a sub called r wallstreetbets and yolo your hard earned money in GME You realize what you are doing here you true fuck dont you This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet B E T S and follow DD posted by people with names like SHOW ME YOUR ANAL TITS You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry One Wish comes true show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn t exist in this world This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading and we even don t trade stocks normally This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in Yes we have some maybe a lot DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments this is about get rich or die trying This is not r investing 2 Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up hihihi If this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train and even you might get this image from all this Saudi Arabia calling China calling Africa calling posts but please they invest into BABA Aramco or I don t know what s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now could be though the next big thing got to see if I can find a DD on this So why is this not happening Because it is a fucking BET the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red while we always go for the magical zero It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls or boys on the beach The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize you are potentially fucking with the system itself by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn t do if you like the system 3 Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen So there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME It s a fucking global movement now or not could be also the same 50 000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place and according to the DD we just need to have and the shorts a bleeding their panties their balls feel squozen and not in a good way and they are completely in defensive mode What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi billion HF are going to do How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church no offense if so What is wrong with you Seriously Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say Oh boy we got defeated and going to realize a multi fucking billion to the moon loss OF COURSE FUCKING NOT THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA TANK ROCKET or INTER STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END Influence the market participants speculation Short Laddar attacks I to this very day haven t understand the concept or how this works speculation demotivational tactics speculation and to whomever picks it up desinformation well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small size investors shall we do a collective effort to think about it Ah fuck it It is to fucking obvious you would dry this out through time divide their interests and drive away their attention Because let s be fucking honest most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself no whining just sayin Gotcha Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter Nobody I even don t remember shit about this very forum before GME ok I remember u variation separate but that is another story And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us my fear 4 That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads and it is not happening already its going to be and fucking ruin the party Deal with it we just got to wait how this thing plays out That s it If we are right this will play out positively in one or another way

get this straight In the coming days I don t wanna see all this whining and bitching on this sub and espescially in the daily GME threads anymore On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt you read messages the likes of this is over we missed the squeeze I am going to loose it all entered at 320 I am doomed What the fuck is wrong with you retards did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right 1 You come to a sub called r wallstreetbets and yolo your hard earned money in GME You realize what you are doing here you true fuck dont you This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet B E T S and follow DD posted by people with names like SHOW ME YOUR ANAL TITS You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry One Wish comes true show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn t exist in this world This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading and we even don t trade stocks normally This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in Yes we have some maybe a lot DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments this is about get rich or die trying This is not r investing 2 Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up hihihi If this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train and even you might get this image from all this Saudi Arabia calling China calling Africa calling posts but please they invest into BABA Aramco or I don t know what s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now could be though the next big thing got to see if I can find a DD on this So why is this not happening Because it is a fucking BET the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red while we always go for the magical zero It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls or boys on the beach The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize you are potentially fucking with the system itself by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn t do if you like the system 3 Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen So there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME It s a fucking global movement now or not could be also the same 50 000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place and according to the DD we just need to have and the shorts a bleeding their panties their balls feel squozen and not in a good way and they are completely in defensive mode What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi billion HF are going to do How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church no offense if so What is wrong with you Seriously Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say Oh boy we got defeated and going to realize a multi fucking billion to the moon loss OF COURSE FUCKING NOT THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA TANK ROCKET or INTER STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END Influence the market participants speculation Short Laddar attacks I to this very day haven t understand the concept or how this works speculation demotivational tactics speculation and to whomever picks it up desinformation well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small size investors shall we do a collective effort to think about it Ah fuck it It is to fucking obvious you would dry this out through time divide their interests and drive away their attention Because let s be fucking honest most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself no whining just sayin Gotcha Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter Nobody I even don t remember shit about this very forum before GME ok I remember u variation separate but that is another story And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us my fear 4 That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads and it is not happening already its going to be and fucking ruin the party Deal with it we just got to wait how this thing plays out That s it If we are right this will play out positively in one or another way huge tendies or SEC investigating Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever If you believe you want to buy more stock do your DD and do it When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought hmmmm makes sense I am going

people This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems possibly bankrupting some of them Life will go on and I m confident

am book smart but I still eat crayons like the rest of you Obligatory rocket amp x200B EDIT 0 Looks like I truly belong on this sub On the first version of this post I didn t read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution My numbers were wrong but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers EDIT 1 You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ

report https www sec gov comments s7 08 09 s70809 407a pdf Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME EDIT 3 A lot of people were hung up on the 3 shares per wsb subscriber thing I know many accounts are bots I was intentionally underestimating that number I have adjusted to 10 shares per legit subscriber to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns EDIT 4 What I m seeing on Twitter makes me think I m being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system We re not going to go back to mud huts people This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems possibly bankrupting some of them Life will go on and I m confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again EDIT 5 Backup

Here is an FAQ 1 How do I learn investing I am not an authority on this but my personal opinion is to first learn how to read a company s financial documents and value businesses and only then start thinking about putting your money into specific stocks Read the intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham for this Then learn how to think about picking stocks I like Peter Lynch s books for this 2 What is going to happen this week I have no idea and I wouldn t dare to guess 3 Are you going to be killed I don t know where people are getting this idea I have no special knowledge or insider contacts and I am in no way shape or form an expert on the market or the system behind it Please treat my tinfoil hat conspiracy theories as just that There is nothing to gain from harming me and I have no doubts about my safety These are just personal opinions and I don t have any schemes to take down the shorts or anything like that I do not advocate for you to buy hold or sell I m just postulating on how we might have found ourselves in this place

815,nnriwg,t2_6nk6x9nz,1622307302,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nnriwg/amc_volume_price_analysis/,1,AMC Volume Price Analysis, Hey fellow traders Today l ll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji I love this emoji by the way or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock Here is my analysis based on volume price action and a powerful pattern named the flag high and tight amp x200B Weekly chart https preview redd it 5bruexp383271 png width 570 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f679d9584a983071eaf036df2e4c5be14069eaae Firstly on the weekly chart we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at 1 91 1 to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of 20 36 2 In 17 trading days the stock soared 1065 96 It s an understatement that this price action caught my attention The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag high and tight on falling volume Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and it s one of his favorites HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90 aim for double in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume I think we easily meet these criteria The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market 1 being the best with an average rise of 69 and throwbacks happening 54 of the time Price meets target 90 of the time The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade In his work Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50 past the breakout point With the measure rule using the breakout point at 12 we would have a theoretical price target of 63 96 1065 96 100 2 12 Now to the analysis based on volume and price On the weekly chart we have the breakout on 3 with rising and above average volume This confirms the breakout is not fake but supported by the professionals After the minor pullback we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past 20 on very high volume Like we will see on the daily chart the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart I attribute this to two things First the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent Two the stock hit the ATH of around 35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits While it is true the SI rose in this period I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table This being said I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day Like a big cargo ship it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure On top of that the most conservative assessment would bring us to 63 96 in less than 30 days around June 10th following the breakout and we have a 90 chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski If these are not good odds I don t know what is I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime amp x200B Daily chart https preview redd it wslu122983271 png width 570 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0a1d2f718d41538d8bfad7ffad44ade99c796356 On the daily chart we can see the flag high and tight develop from January 27th on 2 to the breakout at 3 on May 13th Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoff s law of cause and effect The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect On May 14th breakout day 4 we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend Then the test of supply on the pullback at 5 we see falling volume until the stock reaches 12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals On the second to last candle we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick On 6 we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior day s close I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle Bulkowski s work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51 of the time in a bull market which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss If the next day s close is below this candle Bulkowski tells us there is a 70 chance the candle acts as a reversal So this is to be looked at closely for next week The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals We must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line Volatility is cyclical and all this is normal price action Even in the event that Friday s price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase Wyckoff s work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue Ladies and gents I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship You get in strap on and enjoy the ride Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a fool s errand Looking back at the daily chart on AMC 1 hanging man and 3 dark cloud cover shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines weak bearish candle by the way would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed amp x200B 30 minutes chart https preview redd it erdc846b83271 png width 570 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 5ec91557abfecf685c4af681eaf68f0da6a1fd9b Lastly on the 30 minutes chart friday we see at 1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at 25 50 2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price I do believe we have strong support at this level No one has a crystal ball and this could go either way but the odds are that we reach 63 96 by the end of June with a 90 probability according to Bulkowski I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock amp x200B https preview redd it

like we saw with GME before the great run up Thus I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off Any close above 35 will be extremely bullish I ve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past 63 96 AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts Ultimately volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions Cheers 20 07 16C AMC 30 07 16C AMC

869,nnsnmx,t2_fdp9y,1622310714,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nnsnmx/tsp_the_best_way_to_play_selfdriving_today/,1, TSP The best way to play self driving today,TL DR Trucking will be the first viable business for autonomous vehicles TuSimple TSP currently has the best autonomous truck tech and is the closest to commercialization amp x200B Why not Robotaxis Robotaxis are sexier and thus get all the media attention But commercialization of robotaxis currently poses several technical operational and business challenges amp x200B Why not Robotaxis Technical Robotaxis are most profitable in downtown environments But those environments also pose the greatest challenges for an autonomous vehicle due to the large number of hard to predict agents No company has been able to solve those yet amp x200B Pick up and drop offs are also technically very challenging because frankly most Uber Lyft pick up and drop offs in downtown environments are in illegal locations Human drivers can get away with that But a computer system cannot be programmed to perform illegal actions without the company being held responsible amp x200B Why not Robotaxis Operational With Uber or Lyft the drivers do much more than just drive They purchase store clean fuel charge and maintain their vehicles With robotaxis all of this operational load falls to the robotaxi company Where are they going to store thousands of vehicles in downtown environments How are they going to charge them and perform all of the other operational tasks Even if this problem could be solved it means that robotaxis will scale much more slowly than Uber or Lyft did amp x200B Why not Robotaxis Business The cost of robotaxis is currently extremely high due to the compute and sensor requirements Even if they perform perfectly it will take a long time before they are more profitable than vehicles with human drivers amp x200B Further recent regulation in the US has shown that the public support is behind the drivers not the silicon valley companies Driving for Uber and Lyft has been a lifeline to people who lost their jobs during the pandemic So robotaxis are going to be viewed with hostility and likely backlash from the public and thus from governments amp x200B Why Trucking Why Trucking Technical Highway driving though higher speed is much more structured than downtown environments In most ways it is much easier as evidenced by current level 2 driver assistance systems that easily handle most highway driving It does however require much longer range perception We will return to that below amp x200B Why Trucking Operational Trucks already have all of the operational infrastructure They are stored at depots They have dedicated staff for their cleaning maintenance fueling etc Making trucks autonomous can simply leverage all of this infrastructure amp x200B Why Trucking Business There is currently a shortage of truck drivers Freight shippers want to ship faster and not need to wait for drivers to sleep Truck driving is not a fun or healthy job It keeps people away from their families And trucking is a 4T industry globally 1T in the US amp x200B Given the long lifespan of trucks and their ability to run for millions of miles the cost of the autonomous compute and sensor system can be amortized much better than for robotaxis amp x200B In short the stars are all aligned for autonomous trucks today amp x200B Why TuSimple The players who started with robotaxis have built their entire tech stack around detailed but short range perception Trying to convert that tech stack to trucking poses more challenges than one might expect But since TuSimple has focused on trucking from the beginning 2015 they have built their stack to have 1000 meter perception more than 4x other companies amp x200B TuSimple also has been building up partnerships with the rest of the international freight ecosystem since the beginning They have key partnerships with OEMs Tier 1s shipping companies and part manufacturers in the US Europe and Asia None of the other autonomous companies have that amp x200B TuSimple is also building their Autonomous Freight Network across the US in multiple phases Initially only corridors with favorable weather will be autonomous But as the technology improves to be able to handle heavy rain and snow additional corridors can be easily flipped from manual to autonomous mode amp x200B But but aren t they Chinese They definitely have ties to China Their first investors were Chinese So what amp x200B This actually gives them an advantage vs pure US players they have easy access to the entire trucking market in China amp x200B Conclusion Given all of the above TuSimple is undervalued with its current valuation of about 8B Some other self driving companies are around 30B or more despite facing all of the challenges mentioned amp x200B In other words TSP to the moon apes amp x200B amp x200B Sources https sec report Document 0001193125 21 091150 https sec

1989 and IPO d on October 15 2020 and currently has a market cap of 2B Array makes money by selling mounting tracking systems for big solar production plants that increase efficiency by tracking the sun allowing the panels to absorb more energy This video from Array shows their systems well https m youtube com watch v nhDWaT5MjVA GROWTH Yearly Revenue 2018 290M 2019 648M 123 YoY 2020 873M 35 YoY Net income 2018 61M 2019 40M 2020 59M 48 YoY Quarterly Revenue Q3 2020 139M Q4 2020 180M 29 QoQ Q1 2021 245M 36 QoQ Net Income Q3 2020 7M Q4 2020 2M Q1 2021 3M Good growth numbers on everything except the latest QoQ net income will get to later Now on to the growth of solar as a sector specifically on utility production not residential personal because Array s consumers are only in the utility sector Array has 12 market share of the solar tracking systems The growth of the solar utility sector directly influences the growth of Array Solar been quickly rising over the last decade as cost of solar technology decreased significantly over that time period Solar energy is now cheaper to produce than coal natural gas and nuclear as of 2020 Energy production and utility companies will follow the money and continue to build solar plants to capitalize on this opportunity US Solar Production from Utility GWh 2011 1 800 2012 4 300 138 2013 9 200 114 2014 18 300 99 2015 26 500 45 2016 36 700 38 2017 53 000 44 2018 66 600 26 2019 72 200 9 2020 90 900 26 Source United States Department of Energy Solar accounted for 2 3 of total energy production in 2020 Obviously plenty of room to grow Coal Natural gas and Nuclear combined for 80 of total US electricity production in 2020 Now that solar is the cheapest energy source I expect it to take a large portion of that pie maybe 25 or more in the next 10 15 years would be my guess The only thing holding solar back is that the power grids in the US are build only to directly transport electricity from the source to its destination So there is no element of the grid designed to store electricity This has not been an issue in the past bc coal nuclear natural gas and even hydro produce energy 24 7 Obviously Solar can only produce in the day The solution to this issue is large utility scale electric storage The exact kind provided by Tesla These storage systems will provide necessary liquidity and versatility to the grid with solar production The Lithium Ion batteries in these storage systems are rapidly decreasing in price Prices of Li Ion batteries have dropped 90 in the last decade As it becomes more appealing for Tesla and other companies to construct these storage systems and start providing more utility scale electricity storage more utility companies will invest in solar rigs It will be more profitable to produce and won t be held back by the limitations of old grid infrastructure Good video by CNBC on the Grid Storage systems and the growth of solar utility production https m youtube com watch v x3aqWJO4Rso UNDERVALUED In the first few months after IPO Array s price held around the low 40 s hitting a high of 53 99 In late January until now the stock has sold off significantly There are 3 main reasons for this and why the concerns are irrelevant in the long term 1 Broader market tech growth sell off due to inflation FUD I m not going to try to predict if inflation will stay shoot up or go back down to relatively normal levels but there is one think I know for sure Tech growth is cheaper now Barring hyperinflation and or a depression this dip gives long term investors a good buying opportunity 2 Tax credit changes hurt YoY revenue ITC is a federal tax credit that allows people or businesses to right off x of the cost they spent on solar and directly related related systems expenses on their income tax This was 30 up to the end of 2019 Then it is lowered to 26 from 2020 2022 then to 22 in 2023 then 2024 to 0 for residential and 10 for commercial utility and scale The fact that there is still a 10 tax creditor the foreseeable future is great And it doesn t matter that residential dropped to 0 because Array doesn t operate in that market So why would this Tax Credit be bad Well going back to the top of the post under Quarterly net income I said I would get to later Q1 2020 was a great Q for array and their revenue Revenue or that quarter was 438M compared to the total yearly revenue in 2019 of 650M Sense that great quarter Revenue has dropped significantly And now because YoY of the last Q report is compared to that breakout Q it makes this Q and YoY growth look really bad I believe that Q1 2020 revenue was drastically and temporary inflated because of an element of the ITC tax credit There is a way that constructing solar systems can grab on and hold on to the higher 30 credit from 2019 even if they don t finish construction before 2020 It is called safe haven Basically if construction is started and there is a continuous effort made to complete construction and as long as that construction is finished within 4 years the business will receive the 30 tax credit In this quarters earnings report when referring to the 44 decrease in YoY revenue Array s CEO said Results were lower to last year because of the unseasonably high high volume of shipments we had in the first Q 2020 to consumers that were safe harboring tracker systems in connection with the ITC step down So it seems clear that Array was flooded with orders late 2019 to take advantage of the safe harbor and those revenues showed up on Q1 2020 financials So even though the YoY revenue from last earnings was bad I believe that the order flow Array is getting was inflated in Q1 2020 and is now deflated because of all the businesses that would be buying trackers now but bought them earlier because they wanted the better tax credits I can see this cycle of inflated and deflated order flow revenue relative to the decreases in ITC tax credits continue until 2024 when the credit stabilizes at 10 I believe bad YoY data is just a distraction from great long term growth and creates a great buying opportunity 3 Supply chain FUD and one time stock based compensation hurt profits Rapid increase in the price of raw materials goods and even cost of transporting those goods going up Supply chain FUD has stacked on top of inflation FUD sense late February until last earnings and has caused a substantial sell off in Array stock This Supply chain FUD was realized in last quarters earnings Q1 2021 when profitably margins sank because cost of goods shot through the roof This industry solar tracking is contending with increase in steel and shipping costs that are unprecedented in both magnitude and the rate of change Jim Fusaro Array CEO in Q1 2021 report YoY the cost of steel has more than doubled Steel represents the almost half of Array s cost of goods sold so it s extreme increase in price has an large impact on the bottom line Shipping costs have also shot up significantly and have the same effect on the bottom line Even though revenue in Q1 2020 was 438M and revenue Q1 2021 was 246M operating costs were higher in this Q large due to one time expense that come with becoming a public company This includes increase in equity based compensation and costs related to common stock This is simply a short term expense that negatively impacted this Q earnings and will have no further impact on profits margins Array is taking action to secure long term contracts with freight providers and fixing commodity prices with suppliers This action from array combined with the fact that ridiculous prices of shipping and materials will drop in the next year or two as supply meets demand thanks to capitalism This Supply chain FUD and bad profitability margin data from last quarter I believe will also have no impact on future growth long term and only creates a good buying opportunity All aboard the rocket ship apes
