reducing the time for data entry and the likelihood of manual errors The platform offers automated field entries bill approval and payment Then it is synced with the accounting software such as

which ended in March 2021 49 of total revenues were recurring based on per user pricing for use of the platform as a fixed monthly or annual payment Another 49 was transaction revenue which represents usage based fees collected for each transaction processed through the platform The remaining 2 are float revenue which is interest earned from customer funds while payment transactions are clearing While 49 recurring revenue is very low compared to other SaaS businesses it is fair to say that the other 49 transaction revenue are for the most part recurring in nature A customer who only has access to the platform but does not have any transactions let s say a payment of accounts payables will not pay transaction fees But customers have a certain number of transactions each month for which they will pay The number of these may fluctuate to some degree but for the most part they can be seen as recurring Market Size In 2018 there were approximately 30 million SMBs in the US While 24 million of these SMBs are sole proprietors the company focuses on serving the over 6 million employer firms because SMBs large enough to have employees tend to have a greater need for more advanced accounts payable and accounts receivable processes in their back offices By multiplying the average revenue per customer of 1 500 by the 6 million domestic employer firms and 20 million sufficiently

expand its market reach However the accounting software vendors could quickly turn from partners into competitors if they decide to provide similar services Also there is nothing stopping the partnered banks from collaborating with competitors in the future On the contrary it would be in the bank s and accounting firms interests to work with several providers besides Bill com To summarize the company s partnerships and integrations are valuable assets in its go to market approach However they are not a competitive moat Competition A range of other companies are offering good competing solutions Differentiation can come from the breadth of the product offering or integrations with complementary systems like accounting banking or ERP software With a user friendly and mature product the company was well positioned to benefit from the move to digital that accelerated in 2020 and H1 2021 due to the pandemic But while the company has an early mover network advantage with various leading financial accounting software providers financial institutions and accounting firms competitive pressures are certain to increase in the future as various challenger companies are emerging and players from adjacent markets enter the competition to get a piece of the cake For example payables automation solution provider Tipalti who is valued at 2 billion The company has stronger focus on enterprise customers and already counts player like Twitter Twitch Roblox Roku National Geographic Business Insider and many other names to its customer base Additionally cloud based business spending management platform Coupa COUP has a TEV of 20 billion and is expected to generate ca 540 million in revenue this year Coupa provides companies control and visibility into how they spend money but also offers invoice automation and billing services similar to Bill com s Divvy M amp A In early June Bill com announced that it is going to acquired Divvy a corporate spend management startup The total purchase price of around 2 5 billion is substantially above the company s roughly 1 6 billion post money valuation that Divvy set in its January 2021 financing round 625 million will be paid in

revenue gt 100 revenue growth YoY 4 billion annualized total payment volume TPV So Divvy sold for around 25x its current revenue run rate and the growth rate tells us that the company did not sell due to performance weakness Strategic rationale for the acquisition Bill com extends its platform with Divvy s complementary spend management capabilities and therefore expands its overall market opportunity by serving a larger share of the customer s spend Additionally buying a company with an attractive financial profile and high growth will drive Bill com s own growth Divvy seems to be a suitable acquisition target that will strengthen Bill com strategically and financially The company will be able to provide a more wholistic offering to its customers and capture a larger share of their wallet As the company expands its market competition will increase from incumbents like Brex Ramp Airbase Coupa Expensify and Spendesk Financials In the last available quarter https s24 q4cdn

compare that with the average cloud software company in the SaaS index https preview redd it fnqk1b4zo6971 png width 847 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3749022f6924fa4d21c14ffeb3952ebd59b47772 Growth Bill com is growing quite a bit faster than the average This is important because growth is what investors pay the highest price for Gross margin Pretty much on par with the market FCF margin The free cash flow is notably lower than that of most other SaaS companies as Bill com is still burning cash to drive growth Rule of 40 As a result of the negative profitability its rule of 40 value is below average Nevertheless 34 is a decent value Net retention With 121 the company is a little above average and shows a healthy ability of retaining and growing existing customers CAC Payback period The relatively low value of 10 months is good for the company and is likely a bi product from the market moving from manual to digital which means that the company is winning customers even without massively increasing sales and marketing spending Cash As of March 2021 Bill com has almost 800 million in net cash on the balance sheet 625 million of that will be used to pay for the acquisition of Divvy leaving 175 million in net cash In summary financials are very good driven by a strong tailwind from the market bringing customers to its doorstep At the moment the company seems to focus on keeping growth as high as possible at the expense of profitability This is the smart thing to do in order to capture market share in a time when every SMB is looking for an automated bookkeeping solution With 175 million in available net cash and a quarterly cash burn of 6 2 million Bill com has sufficient runway left Nevertheless the company will soon need to show investors the ability to turn profitable while maintaining a high growth rate Valuation As of Friday s close Bill com has a total enterprise value of 16 4 billion Based on estimated NTM revenues of 279 million including the quarter that ended this week this represents an astronomic TEV NTM revenue multiple of 59x The charts below show an index of cloud software companies mapping their performance metrics e

a strong outlier on each of these charts What does that tell us Growth The market generally pays higher valuations for companies with higher growth However there are several companies growing as fast as Bill com or even faster which trade at lower valuations Net retention The market generally pays higher valuations for companies with higher net retention rates However there are several companies with net retention rates as good or even better than that of Bill com but which trade at lower valuations You get the idea The company s performance metrics are strong there s no question about that But there are numerous examples of companies with similar or better performance metrics which trade at cheaper prices In summary based on Bill com s KPIs and the valuations that investors pay for such performance the company should trade at a lower price Conclusion Bill com s bookkeeping automation software provides convenience improved efficiency and cost effectiveness to a broad customers base The market it operates in has a significant size and is in the middle of a momentum from manual to digital amp automated With top tier channel partners and a range of accounting and banking integrations the company is well positioned to capture and capitalize on the increasing demand The acquisition of Divvy will add complementary features to its current product offering and strengthen stickiness with customers Yet the possibilities for differentiation through technology are limited and competition will increase significantly in the medium term through both new challengers and adjacent incumbents Soft factors and hard factors look positive and per se I am bullish about the company and the direction in which it is going Nevertheless Bill com s valuation is too high Companies with similar profiles are trading at 20x 25x NTM revenue This means that Bill com has a more than 100 premium valuation to the market standard Is this justified by a superior product offering exclusive partnership agreements or a brand name It doesn t seem this way How to play this Long What needs to happen for the price to go up further The company must continue to execute and grow as expected by the market The macro environment interest rates etc must keep stable The valuation multiple must stay at a premium of 100 over comps Short What could happen for the price to go down Commoditization of bookkeeping automation software which leads to price competition lower revenue per customer and decreasing growth Rising inflation causes earlier interest rate increases which usually hits high growth software companies the hardest Contraction of Bill com s valuation multiple towards market standards Major post merger integration difficulties It seems most likely that the company will continue to perform well but that its valuation multiple will contract to a more market standard level leading to a decline in share price However we cannot say exactly when this will happen and it is of course possible that the share price will continue to increase over the next few weeks The target share price based on fundamentals is 100 representing a 54 downside which is realistically achievable over the next 6 12 months From a portfolio management perspective adding a short position in an overvalued company can decrease the overall risk of the portfolio In volatile times gains in your short positions can partially offset losses in your long positions

type of company Additive Manufacturing is a major part of Industry 4 0 that will entirely flip manufacturing on its head Before I dive into Desktop Metal and why we all need to be bullish on this particular company let s briefly go back in time and take a quick history detour on how manufacturing got to where it is today and why additive manufacturing is the next giant leap forward This information is paramount to understanding where Desktop Metal is and where they re going relative to the industry backdrop I will scatter some colorful and fun photos to help digest the information

to the industrial revolution subtractive manufacturing was the primary way products were produced Subtractive manufacturing is the process where parts of a block of material are removed until the desired outcome is created Imagine you re manufacturing something like a high end violin You would start with a block of wood from a spruce tree from the corner of the Italian Alps in the Fiemme valley and start carving away at it until you end up with violin shaped parts There s a lot of waste and it takes a lot of time to carve out Today this process has been fully automated and produces highly refined products that can withstand long term and high stress usage However there s still a lot of waste and the process takes a set amount of time per unit of output Forming This is one of the most common processes for mass manufacturing today A mold is created of the final product that is looking to be produced and that mold is filled by injection with the material which then cools hardens and takes on the form of the mold design This process is used for everything from metal products plastics glass as well as a variety of other materials The major advantage of this process is the ability to produce thousands of identical parts at a low cost per unit However the downside is that injection molding is costly in terms of the time and money it takes to develop the mold Once completed making any changes requires an entirely new mold Additive Additive manufacturing means the products are created by adding layer after layer There are 7 main types of additive manufacturing and Desktop Metal specializes in carbon fiber and metal manufacturing The main benefits of additive manufacturing are Speed Companies can now build prototypes and innovate faster than ever Rather than using traditional means of manufacturing with 3D printing companies they are able to test their ideas in real time and make changes faster than ever By doing this companies can rapidly increase the speed at which they bring new ideas to market and quickly validate invalidate ideas Cost Compared with traditional means of manufacturing the cost of printing objects is significantly cheaper and more efficient Layer in the saved labor costs and the cost of innovating and scaling products can now be cheaper than ever Quality During the manufacturing process errors can easily be introduced that get amplified and can lead to catastrophic consequences With 3D printing you remove all of the manor labor and introduce new efficiencies that make products not only higher quality but safer too Sustainability Similar to the above traditional manufacturing creates significant waste which can be improved via 3D printing With also fewer parts and more efficient designs less energy is used too creating a more sustainable healthier and cheaper product Focusing on Additive Manufacturing The technology for additive manufacturing started in the 1980 s and was primarily used for prototyping As it evolved 3D printing transitioned into creating molds and tools for traditional manufacturing In the last few decades additive manufacturing has gone more mainstream to produce end use parts 3D printing is an innovative technology that lets you create a physical object from a digital model All you need to do is make a design transfer the file to a 3D printer then bring your object to life Let s print a LAMBO Once printed the 3D printer produces layers of material one on top of the other This forms the finished object So for example instead of manufacturing traditional hardware 3D printers can recreate the same finished products by designing it on a computer and just clicking print Think of it similar to a traditional printer but instead of 2 dimensional it is 3 dimensional and can use other materials not just ink it can use metal graphite etc The industry is expected to grow 11x over the next decade from 12 billion in 2020 to 146 billion in 2030 amp x200B https preview redd

decade ago in Boston Their initial product was to develop a metal printing 3D printer that could be small enough to operate within an office environment Today they have four products in its portfolio Fiber Studio System Shop System and Production system The Studio Shop and Production products support both the printing of both metals as well as fiber composites such as Carbon Fiber DM s flagship product is their Production system built from the ground up to be the fastest 3D production printer in the industry at 100x the speed of laser based systems while keeping a consistent quality They ve pioneered a precise and rapid process to accomplish this speed through the following DM s Production system has developed a more efficient process for the powder processing unit The unit s job is to deliver consistent metal powder across the printer and other systems do this by starting with a pile of material and then spreading it out across the print bed DM meters out a constant rate of spread that s dispensed and then compacted to produce the final print layer amp x200B https preview redd it 8obzt2v968971 png width 2794 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b668e1271234befa5865503ca5daf8d13852de1f Once the powder is placed on the print bed an anti ballistic system to control powder as a binder is sprayed on top to prevent the powder from dirtying the print heads This is where the geometry of each layer is created and it s repeated layer by layer amp x200B amp x200B https preview redd it gximh7cc68971 png width 731 amp format png amp auto webp amp s aa767476d04db3c2be2d91a1608ab5da9c1a1c59 This process is made more efficient by developing an entire box full of parts at the same time and it s capable of supporting multiple stacks of parts The next step is called cross linking The build box is put into an oven to activate the binder and creates the parts At this stage the parts are still in powdered metal form but are strong enough to handle and move to the next stage called depowdering and centering This is where the parts are put into an industrial oven and the powdered metal is heated until it forms a solid piece of metal in the shape of the final product itself amp x200B https preview redd it lglm3mve68971 png width 2792 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 18cc0c6bf92c2f2c836134cc7782c068cf592c6a Speed is only half the battle consistency is the other half DM s prints with the most advanced industrial print heads available on the market at 1200 DPI and has a proprietary camera system that images every layer of every bed with two different angles of light to detect defects If any problems are encountered it s automatically flagged and the operator is notified Another major advantage of DM that was incorporated from the ground up is that it uses an open powder system What that means is a customer can use their own powders from traditional supply chains directly with DM s production system This open powder system means customer s can develop a process that works for their business and the Production system can be adapted to fit To make implementation even easier DM produced a smaller R amp D machine that uses the exact same software and steps to help businesses design a process develop their product and be able to quickly transition from R amp D to full production The production system allows customers to do things that just wasn t feasible previously From a time and money perspective it s able to be highly competitive with traditional manufacturing methods a feat that has previously not been possible in the additive manufacturing industry for metals and carbon fiber This means that all of the benefits of additive manufacturing the designs that are possible as well as rapid iterations on the production are all now possible with DM s Production system A major advantage for businesses is additive manufacturing s capability to combine the number of parts needed to develop a single component An example of this is back in 2016 Airbus was able to produce it s fuel nozzles for it s engines using additive manufacturing and reduce the number of parts from 20 to 1 This reduced the components weight by 25 incredibly important for the airline industry and reduced the assembly time amp x200B https preview redd it hiyv22vt68971 png width 1243 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

relative to where they are today 2025 expected EBITDA is 260M representing net margins of 27 THIS IS UNHEARD OF FOR TRADITIONAL MANUFACTURING Looking across their competition we all can see margins in the single digits and YoY growth in the single digits too What this tells me is that DM is in a unique position to take significant market share from legacy players When we see dynamic shifts like this unfolding this becomes massive opportunities for us to partake in While there are obvious risks new entrants anti competitive practices new laws etc I am going long and hard with Desktop Metal

is clearly visible that current ratios are above 200 which is very conservative and stable Also debt to equity is very low for all of the mentioned companies Debt and liquidity would not be a concern on neither picks Also a great risk factor comes from the fact that many of these companies operate mines in politically unstable locations Therefore great margins low p b can be a trap if the political risk is not considered Therefore the major factors for further studying would be net margins ROIC and P B No matter how good a company is if it is overvalued we cannot expect adequate returns therefore I am going to cross off FNV BTG NEM from the list I would also not consider companies that are below sector peer margins therefore GOLD is off the list CGAU Centerra Gold I would stop my research at the fact that one of the company s mine got SEIZED by the government where it operates Kyrgyzstan in full control of Kumtor gold mine as Centerra takes legal action This is posing futher implications risks and questions therefore I would cross it off the list Althought I must say if someone has an edge on this situation and knows that this government seizure is not going to last and will not occur it can be a great value play just from the numbers we can see without reading deeper inti it s annual and quarterly reports We have one company left KGC Kinross Gold Corporation It has better than sector margins and ROIC The P B is decent not looking into hidden assets which these companies usually do not carry on their books or their gold reserves are reflected

no debt to repay They planned 2 4million oz production in 2021 BUT they had a mine burned in June 15th dropping their target to 2 1m with total reserves of 30million with CAPEX plans of 900millions This should not be understated the mine is already back on running if you check the stock chart the stock lost 10 15 due to this news but it has been up and running since 24th of June giving a great opportunity to buy on a short term bad event They are expecting 20 production growth from 2021 to 2023 which is nice but I like actual numbers not future stories althought the reason I mention this is that they hav a 9 year track record of actually accomplishing their guidances Cash flow growth is expected to grow 10 15 versus peers 5 8 Their mines are placed 1 58 Americas both the US and Brazil Chile 2 20 Russia far east Russia 3 22 West Africa Tasiast where the fire occured They are very liquid 1 billion of cash amp cash equivalents and 1 6 billion credit available Very strong cash flows coming in repaid 500 million senior notes ahead of maturity great deleveraging an already low debt company So let us try to put a price on the thing As of today it is 6 44 P B 1 25 PE 5 98 Last time gold was running it was trading above 20 EPS 1 07 for 2020 on 1770 oz average price for the company sales EPS was 0 10 for 2020 Q1 it was 0 12 2021 Q1 During 2021 Q1 average price was 1787 oz if gold price stay around this level we can expect the following Oil prices are on long term contracts for 2021 47 272022 42 142023 39 58 Rising oil prices clearly will not be an issue which could inflate costs 2 1 million prodcution 1800 oz and 1025 oz cost that is 975 oz profit on 2 1 million oz Around 2 billion pre tax profit compared to 1 9 billion in 2020 Net income can be 1 4billion in profits For 2020 they had 1268 shares outstanding today it is 1261 a slight decline 0 6 2020 EPS was 1 07 hitting highs in August of 2020 around 9 so 7 9 PE can be expected conservatively since historically they had PEs well above 10 15 in 2007 9 moved around 20 share on 0 59 EPS in 2007 so above 30 PE Given their growth targets global trend towards higher inflation gold purchases in Russia Europe I would say 7 9 PE is very reasonable and conservative 2021 EPS could be 1 13 Using our conservative 7 9 PE this could go easily at 8 10 per share And if history is any guide in a worse inflationary environment could go up to 30 PE making it 30 per share Also Kinross operates in more stable economies than many of its competitors Kinross is a Canadian company therefore a potential USD crisis can benefit the company not by just increasing gold prices but beneficial exchange rates Inflation according their CPI numbers which do not represent the whole truth 1 USD 5 2020 May annualized 2 CAD 2 2 Canada is also exporting 50 of the oil the U S consumes making a potentially lower future energy risk to Canadian companies Summary I believe gold can be a major player in the coming years decade Therefore allocating some of our portfolios into gold can be essential It has practical uses not just sitting in bank reservers or as jewelry Advancement in space exploration new infrastructure require gold as an essential component It has been historically a proven way to preserve wealth and in our modern history In the 1970s when the US got off the gold standard 1971 and oil prices soard with inflation gold was massively outperfoming other assets 33 annualized gains in the decade Another noteworthy example is the post WW1 German mark which got off the gold standard and Germany printed money to finance it s reparations to the winning nations approx 270 billion USD worth in today dollars but they were not allowed to pay in their currency they had to exchange it which they did with printed money Germany s money printer went on in 1921 but the inflation truly kicked in later in late 1922 and 1923 The U S cannot drastically raise interest rates like in the 70s because the government is more deeply in debt and the population is in debt A major part of U S savings are in stocks and real estate which are both in a bubble The large government spending is not financed by higher taxes lower spending elsewhere military healthcare but by deficit spending aka printing aka inflation taxation If the government wants to raise taxes on the rich the rich will simple try to avoid or spend less on investments which will reduce further job opportunities The FED plans to raise rates in late 2022 or in 2023 from 0 25 to 0 75 Until that it is just going brrrr How will inflation look like with this outlook Any other gold play suggestions

homeless box spreads no money at risk https preview redd it 21yvujixo9971 png width 635 amp format png amp auto webp amp s a990f594a9a435a6d80e230bb87550ca2a6fe917 Discovered an ancient spell of it literally can t go tits up trading strategy called The Box Spread a multi legged options strategy involving both buying selling calls and puts at the same time Through his wiseness he came to the conclusion that Box Spreads if sold at the right time can get him credit with zero risk because his blood magic told him so Out of all tickers he chose UVXY because why the fuck not It s not like Volmageddon ever happened He was confident that he set up a play that would net him a guaranteed total of 38k of riskless profit in 2 years Sold hundreds of Box Spreads on Robinhood using margin and gets paid a credit for each box spread His account goes from 5k of his own money to about 200k worth of risk https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments aeqcvt i dont know when to stop Proceeded to withdraw 10k in cash because who woudn t If a Box Spread gets held till expiry it s risk free but that s not how option selling works because there is always assignment risk and 1r0nyman completely forgot about that To make it worse Robinhood didn t pick up on the risk level of his box spread trade and actually echoed back to him that there wasn t a big amount of risk on the trade Much like other elders here 1R0NYMAN found a glitch cheatcode in Robinhood which ultimately added even more fuel to the fire Got assigned short shares 58k loss account closed out Robinhood banned box spreads after the fiasco and emailed its entire client base about its policy change as a direct result of what happened with 1R0NYMAN u analfarmer2 the paragon of financial degeneration analfarmer2 the 19 year old somehow got access to a 100 000 trading account he described as online biz and margin His first FD was a 110k bet on ALGN with 2DTE calls The company announced a share buyback and shares rocketed the next day gaining him 180k His account went to 343k A couple of days later our guy dropped 170k on1DTE SPY puts and again got insanely lucky as the market tanked after a Trump tweet about the Chinese trade embargo His trading account was up another 277k up to 646k https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments cksrsf spy puts 277k profit in 1 minute He took another massive bet the following day buying 600k worth of SPY calls 1DTE analfarmer2 sold out of his position at a 500k loss He made a few more unknown trades and found himself down to 41k 3 days later https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments co31pq my final yolo 40k into cgc calls expiring next he bought 40k worth of CGC calls in anticipation of earnings the following week This was a more responsible trade he had an entire week until expiration just imagine the possibilities Earnings were shit the stock tanked and his FDs were now worthless u ControlTheNarrative the wizard of GUH ControlTheNarrative was so wise that he managed to discover the infinite money cheat code deeply embedeed into Robinhood s matrix and as a result redifined what some consider to be beyond their Personal Risk Tolerance He so genius and so retarded at the same time that through his Robinhood Gold he took his leverage level to 25x From an inital deposit of 2k minimum balance to access RH Gold he bought 100 shares of AMD for 3 800 or so with margin He then sold an AMD Call Contracts with a 2 strike to get almost all his money back He then used that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember margin doubles the buying power then he sold 2 Call Contracts witht he same 2 strike price to get almost all his money back which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood s Margin Robinhood let him buy AMD stock on margin that is collateralized by AMD stock he s already sold The AMD loop he went through made his buying power go up only because RH was absolutely retardedly even more so than he was still counting the AMD stock for his covered calls as part of his margin collateral to buy the options He rinsed and repeated this process until sufficiently leveraged to his Personal Risk Tolerance 25x leverage Finally he used his increased buying power to maximiz gains by loading up on AAPL put FDs to bet against Tim Apple Unfortunately AAPL destroyed earnings and blew his account To make matters worse he recorded the market open and the instant nuking of his account https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments dpnzup i recorded todays marketopen and the instant u MoonYachts the leverageborn Credit Debt Equity Leverage Long ago the four nations lived together in harmony Then everything changed when u MoonYachts attacked MoonYachts was a disciple of u ControlTheNarrative Through his master s teachings MoonYachts also understood that when selling covered calls on Robinhood and if he bought the shares the stock wasn t subtracted from the buying power The cash balance from the covered call got added to his cash balance increasing the buying power by the premium he took in Only the Fed Chair master of all four elements could beat him but when the world needed him most he vanished And although his QE skills were great at the time he had a lot to learn before he was ready to save anyone So it happened that MoonYachts Personal Risk Tolerance was from the netherrealm and not even the Fed Chair could match him at the time By using the infinite money spell he managed to take his Personal Risk Tolerance to 250x leverage a 1M leveraged position on 4k of initial equity https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments drqaro robinhood free money cheat works pretty well 1 on F stock To this day nobody knows the ending of his adventures but legend has it that banks still hate him for showing us the spell of infinite leverage

summary and analysis ,Hey guys been doing a lot of reading recently and figured I should share some of the cooler stuff with the community I whipped this up quickly but can do a more in depth dive for this and other papers if there turns out to be interest The paper is called A Half Century of Macro Momentum https www aqr com media AQR Documents Insights White Papers A Half Century of Macro Momentum pdf by Jordan Brooks of AQR Capital They re a quant fund that runs a number of successful strategies Nothing I say here is investment advice by the way and I do recommend checking out the paper if interested Executive Summary given in paper I outline a systematic and diversified approach to global macro investing grounded in economic theory and detail its performance over the last half century The analysis shows that the strategy has the potential to deliver strong positive returns low correlation to traditional asset classes across various macroeconomic environments and to provide diversification in bear equity markets and rising real yield environments This systematic global macro strategy appears to be a complement to other alternative risk premia such as trend following and long short value momentum and carry strategies and does not appear to be fully exploited by existing global macro managers My Summary in layman s terms Global macro is a type of investing that involves looking at macroeconomic factors well globally These factors include stuff like unemployment business cycles interest rates international trade and monetary policy actions of the Fed and central banks around the world Global macro investors make predictions based on studying these factors to figure out their outlook for the economy and invest accordingly This means their investment universe is much larger than just stocks They look at long term government bonds currencies and interest rate affected assets like short term bonds Momentum trading is a strategy that typically involves looking at trends in stock prices and assuming that those trends will keep on going for a short period For example if there is upward momentum on a stock momentum traders want to get in now while it s still going up Clearly this is usually a short term trading strategy In a nutshell macro momentum is a macro investing strategy that pulls from momentum strategies Instead of looking at price trends it looks at macroeconomic trends It goes long buys assets that have positive macroeconomic indicators explained below and short sells if vice versa The four asset types this strategy looks at are stocks currencies long term government bonds and short term bonds the paper calls this global interest rates The four macroeconomic indicators this strategy looks at are business cycles generally how is the economy doing monetary policy what is the Fed doing is it conservative or aggressive international trade and risk sentiment are stocks going up or down Exhibit 1 Summary of Macro Momentum Indicators https i imgur com x1nJJcF png Let s talk through how I think about this starting with the column Increasing Growth If the economy is doing well people have money so they invest their money into stocks making the outlook good for stocks Stocks usually give more of a return than bonds so their demand goes down as does their price making the outlook worse for longer term and shorter term bonds I m aware this isn t the full picture but it s how I think about it bond folks please chip in if you d like to add anything here Growth is good for currencies as it is accompanied by more business and foreign investment meaning more demand for the currency the paper talks about the Balassa Samuelson hypothesis here which pretty much says countries with high productivity and therefore prices for tradable goods have higher prices for services too developed countries vs developing countries Moving to int l trade this is captured by looking at whether the currency is depreciating getting weaker purchasing power decreasing on a 1 year basis Depreciating currency is good for stocks because our currency is weaker compared to int l currencies our goods are relatively cheaper and there s more demand for them and the companies that sell them bad for currencies similar idea to momentum if currencies have been depreciating we expect them to continue and bad for bonds and interest rates For this last bit here s how I think about it if my currency is depreciating and getting weaker than other currencies global investors don t want to be holding it effectively its price is decreasing Something that makes a currency attractive is a high interest rate so parking your money in that currency earns you interest so a weakening currency s central bank has less incentive to decrease rates The price of bonds and other interest rate products increases as rates decrease meaning this environment scenario is overall negative for bonds Monetary policy captured by looking at 1 year changes in the yield curve this is where the x axis is the term of the bond and the y axis is the interest rate paid it s usually upward sloping in a good economy and downward in a bad one If the Fed gets tighter money printer out of ink this is bad for stocks and bonds because there s not as much money to go into these and it s good for currencies because it decreases the money supply and increases interest rates more int l investment into our currency Finally the risk sentiment is captured by looking at 1 year stock market returns Increasing risk sentiment is when the stock market has strong returns This is good for stocks momentum and currencies int l investment into our stocks and bad for bonds who wants to invest in bonds when stocks are doing so well Creating a Macro Momentum Portfolio With this in mind we now want to create our macro momentum portfolio This will consist of a long short portfolio LS and a directional portfolio D for each combo of indicators and assets So there s four indicators times four asset types times two types of portfolios meaning we ll have 32 sub portfolios total that we ll then combine into the final macro momentum portfolio LS these are market neutral This portfolio takes a long position in assets with favorable trends above the average and short for the assets with unfavorable trends below the average Because we re doing all this with the average in mind there s a theoretical neutral exposure to the market meaning this should perform despite market movements D these take long positions in assets with favorable trends and shorts in assets with unfavorable trends meaning there s no computation of an average and the portfolio can be long or short exposed So we have a LS portfolio for stocks using the economic growth business cycle indicator a D portfolio for the same an LS for stocks using int l trade as an indicator a D portfolio for the same etc Once we have the 32 total he aggregate macro momentum portfolio is created by taking an equal weight across all 32 asset indicator portfolios It s easy to get lost in the specifics here so I ll repeat what we re doing from a bird s eye view again We re looking at 4 macroeconomic indicators from generally the past year applying those indicators to 4 asset classes to make a table like the above and then pretty much using those indicators to predict how the asset classes will perform over the next year Rebalanced annually Performance This portfolio was tested from Jan 1970 to Dec 2016 That means it s seen the bear markets of 1987 2000 and 2008 but not 2020 It s also seen recessions wars stagflation and disinflation Here are the results in a table Exhibit 3 Macro Momentum Strategy Performance since 1970 https i imgur com bbeBBzU png Let s unpack this Looks like a consistently market beating strategy that is un correlated with the stock and bond markets One question you might have is if this is so good why doesn t AQR just invest fully in it The best answer here is probably liquidity as a fund with 150B in assets it s impossible to employ your capital all in one strategy without affecting prices enough that you d no longer be beating markets Also AQR s only been around since 1998 and although I m sure they had this research in some way or another before the paper was published it did just come out in 2017 The table shows a CAGR for the strat without accounting for inflation of 13 compared to 8 41 for the S amp P http www moneychimp com features market cagr htm It beats its composite assets returns in rising yield and falling yield markets in bull runs and bear markets on average and has a higher Sharpe Ratio than the S amp P for the period 1 2 vs around 1 0 It s non correlated with bonds and has something of a negative correlation with stocks Does the latter number mean it goes down when stocks go up meaning it s gone down for the majority of the period No The paper calls the returns of the strategy a smile compared to stock returns Here s a graph Exhibit 2 Quarterly Returns 1970 2016 https i imgur com ZQO1o8p png When stocks are up this portfolio is up a bit too that s called a slightly positive beta When stocks are down this portfolio is up a whole lot a very negative beta On average the portfolio has a slightly negative beta compared to stocks as mentioned earlier Thanks for reading As I said earlier I wanted to do a quick and dirty write up since idk if this is something people want to read If there s interest I ll do more will probably revisit this first make the summary about 2x longer Either way seems pretty cool I m making an automated algorithm to track this strategy right now Can t go tits up
