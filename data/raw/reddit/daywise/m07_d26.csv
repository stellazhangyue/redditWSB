of major information So with that being said let s get started 0 Where do we begin It s hard to pick a point to begin at because the circumstances that are in place to make what s happening even possible can go as far back as to the 2008 financial crisis However I think it s best to start with the stories of two men These two men being Ryan Cohen co founder of Chewy as well as a GameStop investor and current chairman Keith Gill know as u deepfuckingvalue here on Reddit he was one of the very first people to truly see the potential in GameStop and would be the main protagonist in the beginning of GameStop s story Now starting with those two men let s start from the beginning of their stories 1 September 8th 2019 As early as 2019 u deepfuckingvalue also know as DFV for short was posting GameStop YOLO position updates on the subreddit r WallStreetBets These early post were not received well as most comments were outright calling him stupid for taking such a bullish position in what most saw as a dying brick and mortar Despite receiving mostly negative feedback DFV continued to post updates to his GME position Starting with 50k and gradually adding more over time 1 2020 Like so many other companies GameStop was hit hard by the Coronavirus It was forced to shut down many of it locations some of which did not recover This was widely believed by most on wall street to be the death blow to GameStop something from which the company would never recover from and it showed in the stock price Losing a third of its value in January of 2020 alone However DFV continued to update his GameStop YOLO position In September of 2020 Ryan Cohen who had just sold his company Chewy for 3 billion dollars the previous month took a stake of roughly 10 in GameStop for an average price per share of around 6 GameStop aka GME would only rally from here 1 The beginning of January 2021 The first big day of January would come on the 13th GameStop would soar from 20 42 to 31 40 at close for a 57 39 gain on the day This run was contributed by reignited hope in Ryan Cohen s plans to transform the company and a new catalyst called the short squeeze Let s break this down A short is when an investor borrows a share of a company then don t own to sell on the open market They hope after selling this borrowed share the stock price falls so they can repurchase the share to return to the lender and pocket the difference However if these short sellers as they are called were to borrow shares sell them on the market and then the stock price rose they would have to buy the stock at a higher price and pay the difference out of their own pocket and since there s theoretically no limit how high a stock can go there s theoretically no limit on how much money they can loss Now that we know what a short is a short squeeze is when many shares are taken to short a stock then said stock soars and those short sellers are then forced to buy back the stock at a higher price triggering more shorts to have to buy back the stock at a higher price creating a loop that pushes the stock higher and higher and higher 1 January 22nd 2021 January 22nd 2021 would mark the beginning of a short squeeze of such importance nothing like it had been seen since 2008 GameStop opened the day at 42 59 and closed at 65 01 for a gain of 51 08 on the day This would be due to a double frenzy of shorts trying to buy shares back to cover their positions and retail investors average citizens who buy stocks jumping on the stock looking to make a quick profit off the soaring stock price Another reason the stock was soaring so much so fast was due to the fact that GameStop had an astonishing 138 of its float sold short Let s break some of those terms down to be more easily explained a float refers to regular amount of shares a company has issued to the public that are available for investors to trade So the fact that over 100 of the float was sold short means that some of these shorts were naked Naked shorts are shares that are sold to short that don t exist To help explain he s an example of naked shorting Lets say I believe that Company X is going out of business I am so confident that Company X will go bankrupt in fact that I sell 138 million shares of Company X on the open market despite the fact that I don t actually own any shares and there are only 100 million shares of Company X in existence In that example if Company X stock soars I m responsible for buying every single share in existence back and then an additional 38 million shares that don t exist to cover my original short position Now all of this is very illegal as short selling was outlawed after the 2008 financial crisis However that still hasn t stopped it from being a major problem in the modern market 1 January 25th 2021 The week of insanity On the first day of the week of insanity GameStop would close lower then it started the day Going from 96 73 at opening to 76 79 at close But not before hitting an intraday high of 159 18 The day would also be noted by many financial firms lowering there price targets for GameStop and denouncing the current price action as nothing more then high flying emotions 1 January 26th 2021 This would mark the biggest single day rise GameStop had seen up until this point Opening the day at 88 56 and closing at 147 98 for an amazing gain of 92 71 on the day Short sellers were reported to have lost over 5 billion dollars in the month of January alone What would come following this is the biggest and fastest run GameStop has ever seen Shortly after closing bell Tesla CEO Elon Musk would tweet Gamestonk and link to r wallstreetbets which was considered to be the main hub of the retail investors at the time GameStop would soar well over a 60 gain in after hours trading signaling that the next day would bring on something never seen before 1 January 27th 2021 The day of insanity January 27th 2021 would mark arguably the most insane trading day for GameStop we have seen up till today Opening at a breathtaking 354 83 per share and ending the day at 347 51 still closing for the largest single day gain to date of 134 84 The magnitude of this skyrocket would only be out preformed by a fellow retail favorite rising on the prospect of a short squeeze as well AMC Which would over quadruple closing at 19 9 from a previous close of 4 96 representing a total gain of 301 21 on the day However the headlines took a very noticeable shift in attitude on this day Going from praising and fully acknowledging GameStop current achievements to downgrading it as second class news at best and outright lashing out at the stock at worst An example of this would be CNBC which went from praising GameStop on the 26th to posting an article on the 27th titled You will lose your money very very quickly What investors need to know about GameStop s stock surge Needless to say the mainstream media had soured its opinion of GameStop seemingly overnight and from this point forward there would be little if any positive articles released by mainstream news sources 1 January 28th 2021 The great betrayal On January 28th 2021 Popular retail brokerage Roobinhood would seemingly betray the retail investors who had given it so much influence by freezing the buying of GameStop and various other retail stocks only allowing users to sell their position while completely stopping all forms of buying for these stocks While GameStop would hit its ATH all time high of 483 on this day it would close the day at 193 6 for a loss of 44 29 Mainstream outlets would report this as the end of GameStop and this plunge was a natural result of its previous skyrocketing and not due to the illegal halting done by Roobinhood 1 January 29th 2021 through the first half of February The fake death Following the hard hit on the 28th GameStop would experience one more big green on the 29th closing at 325 for a gain of 67 87 then would fall hard in the following weeks to come Mainstream media would paint this as the end of the GameStop story making a narrative of the short squeeze being over and the stock being wildly overvalued GameStop would close February 17th at 45 94 a share representing less then a 1 10th of its highest value a month prior 1 February 18th 2021 The Congressional hearing Despite all this insanity and throughout it all DFV continued to post consistent updates of his GME YOLO position on wallstreetbets On February 18th 2021 a House Financial Services Committee hearing was held regarding the GameStop story till that point While many people would appear on the zoom chat the two main people of interest were DFV himself and Vlad Tenev CEO of Roobinhood Mainstream news outlets very blatantly crafted a narrative of DFV being a market manipulator who was responsible for the high volatility trading in GameStop While Vlad was portrayed as the misunderstood hero who illegally halted trading to meet increased regulatory requirements GameStop would fall another 11 43 closing at 40 69 1 February 19th 2021 The Double down The following day after the hearing DFV posted an update to his GME YOLO position What shocked everyone however was the fact that he doubled his shares from 50 000 to 100 000 from the previous day This proving what he said in the hearing saying he saw this price as a point were he could and then did buy more 1 February 24th 2021 The resurrection of GameStop Late in the afternoon of February 24th 2021 GameStop soared from its opening price of 44 70 to a closing high of 91 71 representing a gain of 103 94 on the day This was completely out of nowhere Everyone looked in awe as GameStop seemingly rose from the dead after falling from its January high Along with this revival a new name for these retail investors buying GameStop and AMC was created The name Ape refers to an individual investor who buys GameStop or AMC who will never sell their shares until MOASS Mother of all short squeezes MOASS will occur when all shorts cover their position in GameStop and AMC and there stock prices soar to highs never before seen in the market 1 April 16th 2021 The final update Throughout March GME would have huge swings ranging from 100 to 340 dollars as the more people looked into the whole situation the more questions seemed to arise Nevertheless there was one date everyone was looking forward to April 16th the day DVF s calls would expire DFV had been sitting on 500 April 16th 2021 12 call contacts which would give him the right to purchase 50 000 additional shares of GameStop at 12 per share Many wondered if he would actual exercise these calls or simply sell them for the cash On the day April 16th DFV posted his last update titled GME YOLO update Apr 16 2021 final update It showed he not only exercised all 500 contracts buying 50 000 shares for 12 each he also purchased an additional 50 000 shares at current market value making his total GameStop holdings 200 000 shares strong To this date this is the last post DFV has made on Reddit 1 June 2nd 2021 AMC soars Just as GameStop before it AMC soared from an opening of 37 52 to a close of 62 55 representing a gain of 95 22 The reason for such growth was due to the fact that many of the issues and manipulation seen in GameStop was also prevalent in AMC One of which being an unusually high short interest 1 July 26th 2021 current day As of writing this AMC currently sits in premarket up 2 floating around 38 dollars while GME sits slightly positive in premarket around 180 I wrote this for all the new apes I meet on here along as in my day to day life This journey isn t even 2 years old and already has enough content for an entire museum I have no doubt this isn t the end of the story nor have we even seen the biggest swings yet to come I imagine once this is all said and done and this book is finally closed everyone here will remember this event as one of the most exciting enjoyable emotional and memorable adventures we could have ever been apart of As we take our place in the history books as participants in the greatest wealth transfer in human history

Speculating Market Correction Crash and AMC GME price increase Timeframe July 26 2021 September 20 2021 Based off a tremendous wealth of knowledge and data gathered over the last 6 months I believe there is a pending market correction or even a market crash within the next 2 6 weeks There are many different variables that have all combined to create a massive clusterfuck that has yet to be un fucked yet All the following trades are very speculative in nature and could very well lead to losses If the speculation turns out to be right these investments could bring returns in excess of 500 or even much higher in certain scenarios I am going to state exactly how I would use 5 000 in these current market conditions Going long on GME GameStop and AMC Movie Theater Stock o Test water for a few days watch for strength or weakness o GME Key Buy Levels 152 139 and 115 o AMC Key Buy Levels 30 and 24 o If showing strength and has above average trade volume will start position at current market price o Predicting another move up in both soon o 1000 will be invested in both GME and AMC for a total of 2 000 in long stock Trading options in SPY S amp P 500 ETF IWM Russell 2000 ETF and possibly IJR Small Cap ETF o Option Types Call Assuming the underlying asset will achieve a higher price by a specific date Put Assuming the underlying asset will fall to a lower price by a specific date Trading options are very risky but with great risk comes great reward if correct o SPY is currently trading at an overvalued all time high I am speculating that a market correction will occur anywhere between August 20th and early to mid September Catalysts that could trigger correction Covid 19 Delta Variant MSM spreading mass hysteria Unemployment stimulus benefits ending less consumer spending Commercial Individual Real Estate market collapse reminiscent of 2008 Online Currency Bubble The Fed intervening to help slow inflation by slowing down the money machine Hedge Funds that got caught illegal short selling stocks like GME and AMC will no longer be able to sustain retail buying pressure Short Hedge Funds will be margin called and forced to buy back shares thus being forced to liquidate other positions to free up cash I would spread out a series of SPY Put Options for dates from Aug 20th going into September These long puts would not exceed 500 but may be bought sold over time If market correction happens before these dates it would substantially increase my profitability on the put options Vice versa if the market does not correct and continues bull run past September all put options would expire worthless o IWM is currently trading about 15 points under all time high IWM contains 8 84 million shares of AMC IWM contains 1 34 million shares of GME I would buy IWM Call Options dating Aug 20th going into September These long calls would not exceed 500 but may be bought sold over time o IJR is currently trading about 8 points under all time high IJR contains 3 65 million shares of GME Would watch price action for potential swing trade on high volume No more than 500 would be used o I use these three ETFs to get the most bang for my buck If market corrects crashes and AMC and GME begin to see massive price increases I would stand to greatly benefit from owning options in them before it all starts Use the remaining balance to utilize quick day swing trades o Assuming the plan starts to fall into place I would have already invested a maximum 3 500 2 000 in AMC and GME stock 1 500 in various ETF call put options o The remaining 1 500 would be kept as cash on hand for quick trades During times of volatile market conditions many good day trades can present themselves It is good to have cash on hand to be able to seize any opportunities if they present themselves Potential profits vs losses o If market correction occurs after my projected date of August 20th September 20th all SPY Put Options would expire worthless 500 o If market continues current bull run and AMC GME stay stagnant IWM and IJR Calls would likely break even or see minor gains losses 1 000 250 750 1 250 o If market continues current bull run and AMC GME price sees a dramatic increase IWM and IJR Calls could see profits of 500 5 000 based how soon it happens 2 500 25 000 o If market corrects or crashes sooner than August 20th the SPY Put Options could see profits up to roughly 100 20 000 based on timing of the initial downturn 1 000 100 000 o Worst Case Scenario Market stays stagnant as whole No real movement in overall price through August and into September AMC and GME crash down to new lows during that same time frame This would likely cause all call put options to expire near worthless 1 000 1 500 AMC and GME positions would have depreciated heavily as well Call it a 75 decrease overall leaving the value of long positions at 500 representing a loss of 1 500 1 500 used for day trades proves unsuccessful and creates net loss of 75 This leaves 375 left representing a loss of 1 125 Overall loss would end at 4 125 by Mid September o Best Case Scenario Market crashes sooner than anticipated all while hedge funds are margin called causing AMC and GME to see big surges in volume causing massive price increases This would likely lead to all ETF call put options to see the high end of possible percent gains Call it 1 000 overall on the low end representing a gain of 15 000 Much higher percent gains are possible based on timing and how bad the crash is AMC and GME positions could be sold for profit AMC sold at 100 share GME sold at 1 000 share Total amount gained would remain to be seen on what it was initially bought at but this would roughly equate to a 200 300 gain on both at their current market price 1 500 used for day trades were executed successfully throughout the allotted time frame and creates net gain of 500 This would total 5 000 on the original 1 500 netting you 7 500 total Overall profit would end around 25 000 with even more upside potential depending on how hard the market crashes and how much AMC and GME go up

of their life Instead why not make our Leona back with another healthcare company ALHC Skip to end for summary Clover Health one of the more successful pumps on WSB However for all the apes that got caught at the top we have now been forced to become bag holders waiting for it to moon once again to settle our positions I ve got one thing to say it s not gonna happen CLOV is a piece of shit take it from someone who works for an FMO Field Marketing Organization specified for helping seniors choose the right health plans CLOV offered our CEO 100 000 shares if they got 75 000 seniors to sign up with their health plan in 4 years After searching through the infrastructure of the company our CEO decided not to take the offer because of faulty infrastructure lying executives and in general putting seniors with that health plan would just be cruel and unfair ltimately the conclusi n was the marketing was amazing but the companies outline is terrible and poised to fail If you re interested in specifics look here if not just skip it Specifics 1 One of the items the report criticized was the company s web application used by physicians Clover Assistant claiming that it contains old and potentially irrelevant diagnoses Irrelevant diagnoses can lead to seniors getting treated improperly and in some cases even die 2 This line comes from the motley fool And unless you re a physician who uses Clover Health s software it will be difficult to know for sure whether it is as helpful and promising as the company says it is or as big a waste of money as the short seller report suggests This is one of the BIGGEST complaints we got the software is TRASH I swear ask any physician who works with CLOV they ll give the same answer 3 Also you want to look at financials Net medical claims expenses divided by the earned premiums You know what that number came out to be Over 100 ITS BEEN SPENDING MORE THAN THE REVENUE IT BEEN BRINGING IN Not to mention even after everything is reopening it STILL remains high 4 The companies net loss of 48 million was 72 higher than the 28 million dollars loss it took jsut 1 year ago 5 The administrador expenses have tripled from 21 mill n to 66 million in just one year SUMMARY FOR WHY ITS TRASH I feel like I don t need to explain but here It needs to bring down its MCR low enough to absorb the heightened level of overhead and administrative costs which will likely continue to rise as Clover Health grows its business However considering this won t happen it s gonna crash and burn If the company were to maintain its run rate and generate 800 million in annual revenue that would put it at a price to sales multiple of 5 That s way higher that the average of 1 9 times that the Health Care select sector SPDR fund commands Throw in a lack of profitability and will most probably never become so poor infrastructure questions left unanswered to the company and overall ignorance and greed this stock is fucking trash NOW before you downvote me all the way back to wife s boyfriends basement I come with a solution and a way to hopefully make back some if not all of your money Alignment Healthcare ALHC This health insurance company s business is well suited to people who prefer to stay at home as it offers a 24 7 on demand access concierge service that can help seniors on Medicare with health questions scheduling appointments and even arranging transportation It s a lot like what CLOV was also offering except it works and isn t a piece of shit that made me lose 3 months worth of paychecks Some technicals on the company RSI 14 30 26 30 44 64 77 52 69 SMA 10 21 50 30 23 68 50 23 47 by price Linear line of regression slope of 970 it has been going down around under 1 percent every day for the past 28 days Avg volume 394 95k Increase in volume It has been volatile lately but the volume has been decreasing since mid June Basic fundamentals Q2 2020 Revenue 242 44M Net income 6 49 mil Profit margin 2 68 Q3 2020 Revenue 249 34M Net Income 12 32M Profit Margin 4 94 Q4 2020 Revenue 243 31M Net income 31 17M Profit Margin 12 81 Q1 2021 Revenue 267 08M Net income 56 87M Profit Margin 21 29 Now ok what sets it apart from other health care stocks and why is it poised to grow 1 I d like to combine the words of two great investors Of course DD Cathy Woods and Boomer Warren Buffet I believe mixing the new with the old is the perfect concoction to make great gains Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful we can measure that fear through the RSI ALHC hit 26 7 on the 7 day RSI and 30 27 on the 14 For reference anything above 70 is considered overbought and under 30 oversold So be greedy buy in This fear could spike from profits turning negative in December 2020 when the entire healthcare market turned bloody red Currently ALHC stands at 21 29 in profit while in mid 2020 it had an outstanding profit margin of 4 94 Keep in mind the average profit margin for healthcare companies are 2 3 as 85 of funds are directed back into the programs for the clients by law This means if there were no administrative expenses salaries and other payments the most a healthcare company could make in profit is 15 So 4 94 is impressive Especially for a relatively new company to this market Cathy woods says new companies reporting negative profit but high return on equity high asset growth and high client sales growth have a lot of room to run since it proves financially they can last and our focusing on high growth These are all sectors in which ALHC does amazing Clover wouldn t fall under this same category because it s been spending more than the revenue it s bringing in While client growth had grown by 37 in 2019 2020 from 39 400 to 54 400 the disenrollment rate is even higher meaning the seniors don t stay with the plan for longer than a year avg is 8 years ALHC has everything CLOV has but better with low short interest WHICH ISN T BAD LET ME EXPLAIN 2 ALHC s avg price target is 31 2 which offers an increase of 52 8 from the current price of 20 10 It s high price target is 38 which is an 85 2 increase from today So these price targets alone are great but how can you make a shit ton On top of that is only 2 dollars above IPO price and just had major sell off s 3 WSB loves options and because the volume and historical volatility is so low the implied volatility is low giving a low delta and high leverage To calculate leverage all you do is take the delta divide it by option price and multiply by share price and then boom you get leverage If you were to buy contracts at a strike price of 25 dollars meaning you re betting it ll reach to 25 you stand to gain 449 in less than one month Delta 2908 option price 1 30 Share price 20 10 2908 1 30 22369231 22369231 x 20 10 4 49 449 leverage Basically if this stock goes up 25 by August 20th you can get a 449 gain though calls Since the volume is so low it can rally really easy with high price targets a shit ton of money to be made though options and over strong well developed company I see no reason why it can t go up Summary Why Clover sucks and won t go up I feel like I don t need to explain but here It needs to bring down its MCR low enough to absorb the heightened level of overhead and administrative costs which will likely continue to rise as Clover Health grows its business However considering this won t happen it s gonna crash and burn If the company were to maintain its run rate and generate 800 million in annual revenue that would put it at a price to sales multiple of 5 That s way higher that the average of 1 9 times that the Health Care select sector SPDR fund commands Throw in a lack of profitability and will most probably never become so poor infrastructure questions left unanswered to the company and overall ignorance and greed this stock is fucking trash Copy and pasted from above since I summarized it but for people skipping I thought I should add it again Summary for why to ALHC Dipped below 50 day SMA Bouncing off of support line at 20 Price targets offer 52 average upside Though options buying calls at a strike price of 25 expiring August 20th gives a 449 gain from the stock rallying jsut 25 Strong fundamentals and poised to grow contains the same things CLOV has but it s actually good Low volume means large buy orders send the stock shooting up easily So yeah I m buying up those contracts and I ll see you in a month with my 449 gain

few potential catalysts most important of them all is the BlueWalker 3 satellite launch which will be taking place sometime in Q4 2021 This will be a bigger satellite than any previous ones created but it still is not the biggest they plan to make However a successful launch and connection to BW3 would definitively prove that the tech works at larger scales Other smaller but still significant catalysts include Government approvals for servicing in each country The launch date for BW3 Acquisition of a portion of the federal 5g fund Additional bank coverage Risks Every play ranging from 0dte to year long investments come with some amount of risk and this is no exception While some may simply be setbacks they are still worth knowing Delays Satellite construction and launch delays Execution

of letting up From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments In fact probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry Today about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine including medications that treat heart disease hypertension cancer AIDS arthritis pneumonia depression diabetes allergies meningitis glaucoma osteoporosis and ulcers Acetaminophen the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals is made with chlorine Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life threatening infections Providing patients with safe water and nourishing food is essential to speedy recoveries Once again chlorine plays a vital role by ensuring that hospitals have safe water for drinking bathing and other patient needs Hospital kitchens and cafeterias rely on chlorine s disinfectant powers to kill dangerous food borne bacteria such as Salmonella E coli and Campylobacter on food preparation surfaces Chlorine From medicines to blood bags X ray films to surgical sutures disinfectants to
