1,ofxx5s,t2_c7d9x5rd,1625711209,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofxx5s/phm_pultegroup_dd/,1, PHM PulteGroup DD, Company Summary PulteGroup is a residential home builder based in Atlanta and formed in 1956 They are the fourth largest homebuilder in the US after DHI LEN and NVR They have a number of different brands and are vertically integrated in the homebuilding process from purchasing undeveloped land to selling completed homes They develop communities with single family detached homes townhouses duplexes and condos Their target market is middle class Americans and they also develop residential communities focused on senior living in 23 different states 45 of their customers are moving up 31 are first time home buyers and 24 are purchasing senior living options When purchasing land they claim they use well developed data models to predict socioeconomic trends for housing markets in cities and isolated communities The auditor seemed very optimistic about their computer models as compared to MDC a similar homebuilder They sell homes in two ways Speculative homes homes that have already been built PHM expects that these homes will be purchased based on their own analysis of the region Pre ordered homes homes that are customized by a committed buyer The buyer puts down some principal capital that is usually non refundable and has to prove that they are adequately covered to purchase or finance the home They run a mortgage issuance segment that mostly issues mortgages to their homebuyers and then sells the mortgage to some other institution in order to reduce the risk on their own balance sheet They control 180 352 lots in total 5000 in the NW 15000 in the SE 21000 in Florida 9700 in the midwest 16000 in texas and 25000 in the west 30 of lots are developed 91 363 of these lots are owned and 88 989 are optioned 43 of owned lots are developed and 16 of optioned lots are developed See Note 2 At the bottom of the report for more info on the regions Management overview I ve heard the grandson of the founder speak and all I can say is it was a good decision keeping him out of the CEO position People have a good opinion of the company from what is on glassdoor There are a few comments about management being bureaucratic and putting unnecessary pressure on employees but these only account for a small percentage of comments CEO Ryan Marshall https www linkedin com in ryanmarshallprofile He has an accounting and business degree but it looks like he has only ever worked for PHM He has over 20 years at PHM and his compensation was over 13 million dollars This seems way too high for a CEO of a company this size He has very good reviews on glassdoor 94 approval CFO Bob O Shaughnessy https www linkedin com in robert o shaughnessy 3617276b Has an accounting degree He has a much more diverse work experience than the CEO but it isn t in housing He spent 10 years at Ernst and Young 14 years at Penske as the CFO and then 10 years at PGH as CFO He has past CFO experience so I wouldn t be worried about him making irrational decisions Addressable Market This section is speculative they do not provide a breakdown of their target markets so I had to do some reverse engineering to get to this conclusion Their main business is single family homes which account for 85 of their revenue They talk vaguely about who they target but it is quite clear to me after looking at the homes they sell that their target market is the middle class with a bit more in savings than most Their homes are good quality and their senior living arrangements are standalone homes with a lot of customization and community amenities available From my analysis I think it is fair to state that their average buyer is in the upper middle class and the retirees who buy homes have an average amount of savings although there is serious interest from wealthier seniors Risk PHM is directly exposed to the volatility of the housing industry They are a middleman in real estate ownership and try to keep their inventory turnover below 36 months The way they purchase land is akin to dollar cost averaging They purchase land more frequently than 36 months and their long term assets are constantly changing This brings us to the possibility of significant reduction in real estate value Sure they might lose paper value on their balance sheet but there is still a fixed selling price that they will generate significant operating cash flows from Thankfully there is a very prominent event that is an example of the worst case scenario for homebuilders check this out https www americanprogress org issues economy reports 2017 04 13 430424 2008 housing crisis if you don t know what I am talking about They took a big hit because of the dropoff of demand It took 6 years or four housing cycles to build back to pre 2008 levels and they had three years of negative earnings They managed to decrease debt and took the unfavorable but appropriate approach of selling 150 million shares an increase of 60 percent Since then they have bought back those 150 million shares but who s to say there isn t another housing crisis on the horizon I have looked closely at common and uncommon indicators and all I see is a lack of supply but there is obviously much more that I am completely blind to The mortgages they keep on their balance sheet are slightly worrisome but when I think about it if the homeowner defaults the home will just be repossessed by PHM So not much of a concern They are vulnerable to commodity price inflation but the distribution and acquisition of these works the same way as their land purchases do Non land inventory is purchased regardless of the price and home prices tend to slightly outperform the general CPI so this doesn t really concern me as it balances out the same way as land purchases One unconventional risk they face is the lack of skilled laborers The average age of construction workers has increased by two years in the past seven years https sgchorizon com construction industry workforce getting older There are more and more people going to post secondary school trying to make more money and do less work each year This really does pose a significant risk to PHM in the long run Less human capital supply means higher wages means lower margins means less operational cash generation means more debts and less cash means ultimately a more unstable and unhealthy business No matter what happens otherwise in the economy I think this could be their biggest long term risk Their in your face optimism in their annual report isn t captivating me They also say that they think past stock price performance compared to the DOW home constructors index represents a meaningful analysis for investors Page 19 https www sec gov ix doc Archives edgar data 822416 000082241621000007 phm 20201231 htm above the stock performance chart Again this is really immature for the auditor to say this They have competitive financials and a good company so there is no reason for the auditor to go so overboard when they prepare reports This stuff always makes me suspicious Revenue Breakdown Company segments 96 or revenue is from all homebuilding operations This figure is 10 7 Billion 45 of their customers are not making their first purchase This section excludes seniors 31 are first time home buyers 24 are purchasing senior living options The remainder is from their financial services This figure is 0 362 Billion Their average annual output of homes was 24600 last year It has been growing slowly in the past three years at about 2 YoY Industry position Some of their competitors are DHI LEN NVR TOL LGIH and KBH to list a few PHM has the lowest P E and PEG and their P S AND P B are average out of their competitors Their D E and margins are competitive but they are lagging with their ROE ROA ROI Free cash flow is currently at about 30 of the market cap but this is not usually the case They have an estimated 6 1 market share in American residential construction Base stats Market Cap 14 33 B Total Debt 3 2 B Cash amp Liquid assets 1 6 B Goodwill 163 M Total Assets 12 2 B Equity 6 6 B Revenue 11 5 B Earnings 1 5 B Operating Cash Flow 1 7 B Financing cash flow 1 9B Enterprise Value 15 B Shares Outstanding 263 M EV Sales 1 05x ROE 24 7 Overview Growth and Developments Growth Revenue took a turn for the worse in the late 2000s but since then it has almost returned to pre 2008 levels The growth has been very steady Margins Margins seem to hover between 8 13 and there hasn t been much change over the years The values are the same before 2007 Net reinvestment They have a BBB Credit rating A lot of capital expenditures go towards land that is either held and sold or developed Not much R amp D that would benefit them Share buybacks Share buybacks have been good since 2008 They have shown that they are capable of taking action to add shareholder value Their massive issuance in 2008 also shows that they are willing to raise capital and diminish shareholder value if it is needed for the business The implications are mixed here If I am looking from a shareholders perspective then I would be skeptical of their excessive issuance in the past but if I was looking at it as a long term business owner it shows responsibility and willingness to sacrifice their reputation if it can keep their business strong They have bought back almost all of the shares they issued in 2008 Costs They are consistently putting more money into paying off debts than they are taking out debt One thing to consider in their operational costs is they are forced to pay market prices for commodities They don t keep a lot of inventory so these costs may become harder to manage unless they raise home prices along with the CPI They have a 24 36 month lag behind the CPI in pricing their marketable assets because of the nature of the building contracts with their buyers They had their second most successful year in 2020 and instead of massive bonuses they decided to Repay all 700M drawn on their revolving credit facility Repurchase 75M in shares Increase dividends by 17 Why so much Invest back into the business or buy more shares Committed to an early completion of notes due 2026 7 Done Mar 21 Debts They have 411M in financial services debt and 2 752B in Notes payable The notes payable is adequately spread over 15 years The highest interest is 7 9 due 2032 and the average interest rate is 5 5 As long as their operations are at least half as strong their debt won t be a problem Interest expenses and retirement on these on average will cost them 180M year Financial services debt is of no concern with an average interest rate of 3 Assets Assets have grown since 2011 They have just under 13 B in assets They currently have less assets then they did in 2005 06 Most of their assets are in PPE but they still keep 3 2 B in current assets WACC 8 5 Long term growth rate They will grow with the housing market but also shrink with it 3 5 3 8 organic growth per year is reasonable Legal Nothing Recent expected developments They have 13657 homes in production currently with 10421 of those already sold No expected developments Industry advantages Suppose this data driven model they talk about really can predict socioeconomic trends in neighborhoods or to be neighborhoods This would offer huge profitability advantages for them but unfortunately so far their margins and growth are pretty in par with the industry They do have an advantage as a publicly traded company of their size Lots of access to capital and large capital reserves make it easy for them to have many operations simultaneously in different parts of the country They have a healthier history internally compared to competitors Their finances have stayed intact even in the worst case scenario and they have shown a better than average ability to rebound after hardship This is because of the financial maturity and responsibility management has taken over the years and hopefully this is a culture that continues in the business Sell side VS Buy side I am more bullish on this one but here are two arguments for two different opinions I will limit them to five points each Sell They did not hesitate to reduce shareholder value in 2008 instead of alternate debt financing This shows that they are willing to do it again Prevailing sentiment is split there is a possibility of a massive real estate crash in the near future Economic conditions are favorable right not but it is expected that they will not be as favorable in the future Some of their corporate paper is sold at quite a high yield which may be grounds for default if they do not sell shares or more debt in the event of financial difficulties The demand for skilled workers is and will be rising making it more difficult for PHM to acquire valuable human capital without raising wages Buy They have steady organic growth Management has shown more than once that they are responsible In bad times they are capable of sacrificing shareholder value for more shareholder value in the future In good times they make good on future obligations early and don t get too euphoric with expansions and bonuses Their asset and debt structures are very attractive with adequate coverage of debts and not a lot of outstanding obligations They have great ability to generate lots of capital in good times and store that capital away The economic conditions indicate a shortage of residential housing so even if there is an economic catastrophe in the near future PHM and other homebuilders will still be needed to fill a 5 5 million house void in the country This figure is only going to grow too without federal intervention which either way is advantageous for PHM Valuation Assuming a dividend growth of 1 a 3 8 expected growth from the company and an 8 rate of return the Gordon model https www investopedia com terms g gordongrowthmodel asp gives them a 10 7 valuation per share Their intrinsic value calculated from the DCF model is between 70 100 giving an average margin of 35 Of course the DCF model makes the assumption that OCF and investments will be stable and follow my predicted growth rates so this is a subjective valuation no matter how accurate I think it may be Valuation Market Comparison The average intrinsic values I have found for the industry show that the industry is overvalued by about 15 giving PHM a potential relative valuation of 50 undervalued Opinion I would give PHM a buy rating They have a strong cash generating business model There is more risk associated with owning them than a comparable consumer staples business but there is also much more potential reward and in my opinion the reward is more likely to be realized than the risk This is something I would be comfortable holding in my portfolio https www reddit com r ValueInvesting comments oeedlq

housing market,So I made this post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments oe9ruu how to play the upcoming market crash and a lot of you have been asking both in the comments and messages about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash There s a bunch of reasons I ll get to shortly but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000 2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts In 2000 California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices power companies were failing and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week but not this week and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it stop using so much power people were too greedy with AC etc etc Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy Except here s the kicker Crazy conspiracy guy was 100 right Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money When the blackouts and price spikes were happening Cali had 45GW of installed power and demand was running at 28GW Fuckery was afoot So whenever I see something that doesn t make sense in any kind of market I always wonder is there a reason for this Or is it Fuckery Let s talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery All data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can t do that kind of fancy math In 2004 roughly the peak of US homeownership rates the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69 In 2021 it s at 65 In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US In 2021 it s 141 million US population in 2004 was 292 million In 2021 it s 331 million Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get A 13 increase in population a 4 decrease in homeownership rate and a 15 increase in housing supply Yes that s right the housing supply has increased faster than the population and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from Are people making more money Nope Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79 in 2004 to 77 in 2021 So in real terms wages are down Is it immigrants Nope immigration has been falling for years Is it young people starting families Nope family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40 are 20 poorer than boomers were at their age Is it inflation Nope bond yields are currently signaling deflation but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows So basically you ve got more supply relative to population construction of new units is slowing down 1 8 million starts in Jan to 1 7 million starts in March down to 1 6 million starts in May prices are rising and sales are slowing Jan 6 5 million existing home sales 993 000 new home sales May 5 8 million existing home sales 769 000 new home sales So to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows Prices Up Wages Down Supply relative to population Up Demand Down Sales Down Construction Down Yeah it s a fucking bubble And clearly Fuckery is Afoot Who is doing the fuckery and why I don t know Maybe it s Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP s control maybe it s AirBnB maybe it s Blackrock and REIT ETF s maybe it s something else entirely but it s definitely a bubble and it s definitely Fuckery TLDR Fuckery is Afoot It s a bubble Don t buy a house until the market crashes And remember millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again Positions same as the last post puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it s going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market One last nugget about housing RFI was declining before the COVID crash we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash My date range remains unchanged sometime between June and November of this year If you want some specific dates to watch check July 12th July 19th August 23rd September 20th and October 25th I probably like August 23rd the most of those but I buy retard positions on WSB so you definitely shouldn t listen to me

added to S amp P500 over the past 3 decades Here are the results , Preamble There is a lot of publicity generated when a company is added to the S amp P 500 or Russell Indices The company usually gets a bump in stock price following the announcement and there is a significant increase in retail interest for the stock The underlying principle for this is that institutional investors which track these indices would have to buy into the stock and that this would cause a considerable bump in the stock price At the same time there are some contradictory opinions regarding this expected jump in price Some people believe that there would be profit booking following the index inclusion which would actually tank the stock price What I wanted to analyze was Whether the stock price rise following index inclusion or would the profit booking cause to stock price to fall This in turn would allow us to create the best strategy for trading using index inclusion news Data The data for index inclusion time was surprisingly difficult to obtain This https en wikipedia org wiki List of S 26P 500 companies list from Wikipedia was the only source where I could find when each stock was added to S amp P 500 Data from official sources are split by years and only the latest years data is provided on the website All the data and my analysis are shared as a Google sheet at the end Analysis One of the major limitations of S amp P500 index inclusions is that there is no set time delay between the date of announcement of inclusion and the actual inclusion 1 As detailed in this post https www thestreet com tesla articles when will tesla be added to the s p 500 it can vary from 1 day to 10 days with the average being 6 days To incorporate this complexity also into the analysis we will calculate the returns of the stock keeping the date of inclusion as the benchmark a 1 week leading up to the index inclusion b 1 week following the index inclusion c 1 month following the index inclusion Results https preview redd it qsax10i4nz971 png width 947 amp format png amp auto webp amp s a02ec75a31b64e02711ccb13c0033146687a5fdd As expected on average the stocks made positive returns only during the week leading up to the index inclusion Out of the 313 stocks analyzed more than 60 had positive returns with an average return of 1 7 After the stock had been added to the index the returns on average were negative There is a consistent drop in the stock price in the following weeks after the index addition On average the stocks lost 0 7 in the week after the index inclusion One probable reason for this would be profit booking where investors pull out after the run up leading to the index addition We can further deep dive into the mechanics of index addition to understand the best possible plays For this we will take case studies of some popular stocks that were added to the index Domino s Pizza DPZ https preview redd it yyg21nh6nz971 png width 876 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 1a5534e2ac5180ace000bd41e88ec373caeed776 The inclusion of Dominos into S amp P500 was announced on 6th May 2020 and the date of inclusion was on 12th May 2020 As we can observe from the graph all the indices which track S amp P 500 had to buy Domino s stock before the market open on 12th May due to which there is almost an 11x jump in traded volume and a 2 gain in stock price In this case the stock continued its upward trend for one more day before dipping Tesla Inc TSLA https preview redd it sq0l4ak7nz971 png width 873 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0662bd22d1acb150c14e9cc578100432a255a930 Tesla was the largest company to be added to S amp P 500 at more than 500 Billion valuation The inclusion of Tesla into S amp P500 was announced on 16th Nov 2020 and the date of inclusion was on 21st Dec 2020 As we can see from the graph there was a nice bump in traded volume as well as stock price following the announcement Since the company was added into the index in one step before the 21st Dec open all the funds had to buy the stock on 18th Dec 19 amp 20 were weekends There was a 6 jump in stock price and almost 4x normal traded volume on that day We can also see the profit booking following the index addition where the stock briefly dipped before continuing on its rally Conclusion The analysis does prove that stock prices positively react to index inclusion But this is only applicable till the stock is added to the index As we saw earlier stocks rise 1 week leading to the inclusion and then fall due to profit booking So the best strategy to trade based on index addition is to buy the stock as soon as the news breaks and hold it till the day of inclusion Google Sheet containing the data and my analysis here https docs google com spreadsheets d 1mK9q5950NdW VD3Tkz0UYWxKjwxl0ULhhP9ltMssONA edit usp sharing Footnotes 1 If you are a diligent investor you can analyze the quarterly earnings report and understand whether the company is now in a position to be added to the index But then again the final decision of whether a stock will be added to the index will be based on the index committee https www spglobal com spdji

you own checks Created but not based in Argentina Globant was created in Argentina but legally it s based in Luxembourg There is nothing in Luxembourg as far as I know needs to be verified Just the legal address The idea being hedging as much as possible from the never ending Argentinian economic boom and busts And of course lowering the huge Argentinian tax pressure HUGE and even Kind of secret clients Globant has some HUGE clients like Google American Express BBVA Boehringer Ingelheim Cabify Chicago Tribune Coca Cola EA Games games for the PlayStation FOX Interbank LATAM Airlines LinkedIn MercadoLibre National Geographic Nissan Petrobras PUMA Royal Caribbean Santander Southwest Airlines UBISOFT Unilever Walmart Argentina YPF etc etc etc But The MAIN client is not listed there There are some huge clients like the bigger one that they can not talk about or they can not use it as marketing because of an NDA they can only talk about that client in official SEC filings as far as I remember amp x200B Click here to see the spoilers gt The company is Theme Parks related And it s not the one that has the rights for Harry Potter Globant is working for this company implementing most of the important websites apps this company has Even the most critical flows lots of money lt gt You can see that this company is not listed in the current clients list which actually it is but the CEO talks about it in https youtu be HFVGxOK6o5Q t 347 just half second after the video plays Spanish pronunciation lt NO DEBT AT ALL The most important PRO for Globant in my opinion Please Take your time to read it again GLOBANT IS A DEBT FREE COMPANY Try to name at least 2 other companies in the world in this situation besides the public offer debt You are not going to find them easily Why is this so important In a crisis situation like 2020 where customers disappeared consumption dropped Globant has no debt or interest payment obligations and that s why in 2020 instead of having financial problems Globant was buying companies WITH CASH no debt creation while other companies were filing bankruptcy May 12 2021 HABITANT acquisition https investors globant com 2021 05 12 Globant Acquires

that provides the revenue in Globant The only thing that provides the revenue to Globant is People No huge plants that are deprecated after you change your product model or Oil Sea Plants that get on

Even considering that they were buying companies in 2020 EPS are positive 1 6 USD in March 30 2021 Globant cares about investors Globant is not used to paying dividends it re invest all its earnings but considering that 2020 was a hard year this time it did Just a small dividend yield but they did Globant paid dividends in the middle of the chaos while companies like Shell BT and all the big ones cut dividends for the first time since WWII Even considering they were acquiring companies with CASH Price Who cares But Here you have Log chart https preview redd it o2w2g1wgnz971 png width 2138 amp

in Dollars Outcome in Argentinian Pesos Now the 2nd more important PRO in GLOB Here I want to give some details that are totally related that combined result in something huge for GLOB Apologies for the long explanation but it is worth the time Let me first give you the items and then I ll combine them all in an example Globant sells their Developers QA Project Managers etc in dollars Globant pays to their employees or most of them in their local currency which could be between some of these Argentina India Colombia paying in dollars is illegal of course Globant has a huge training program to train young developers coming right out of the university or even some of them before they finish their studies Now imagine this scenario Living in Argentina is hard Finding a job is extremely hard even if you have years of experience But Globant is hiring people that are 20 years old that was my experience with no experience at all and they are paying 3 or 4 times the average salary in Argentina Usually in Argentina if you are between 18 and 30 years old you are going to find only undeclared work I m not sure how to translate it I mean you are not going to get your retirement payment nor health insurance etc etc But you can get it in Globant People love to work in Globant because with no experience at all you join a paid training program and 1 year after you are getting more money per month than you parents and you are only 20 years old that was my personal experience and the experience of most of my friends there But still the amount of money you get is not that much for Globant because they are getting dollars as income and the outcome is in pesos An average rent in Argentina for 1 young guy with 1 room no studio in the middle of the center in Buenos Aires capital is about 120 dollars Living in Argentina is super cheap So here the employee gets the benefit and also Globant With a 500 dollars per month salary with few experience you are living a comfortable life in Argentina But Globant is clearly getting more than 500 dollars per month for your hours of course that s the whole business of Globant Staff Augmentation Globant today has 17k employees You do the math Average of 3k new employees per year 70 of the income comes from United States 70 of the income is USD 8 of the income is EUROs Why is this important Check the Income in dollars outcome in pesos topic above Other companies in LATAM have a strong dependency on the local currency https preview redd it mcu4oodsnz971 png width 1762 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

Even considering they had those parks totally closed There you can see that Globant is already a huge dependency for those companies You can find more details about this information in the SEC filling

believer in STEELGBTQ steel goes big this quarter then now s not a bad time to load up Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter but it s debatable how the market will react My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in and a flight to value has to start some time IIa Bananas Imagine it s 1990 Nirvana is rocking the charts and you grow and sell bananas Business is good and you re able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely You pay your workers well and you re not too mean to the environment However a new banana grower hits the scene across the world They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers This makes their bananas cheaper to make They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap and rake in money In the span of 30 years they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you and more than half of the whole world As the price of bananas plummet banana growers across the world suffer They can t afford to expand and they don t They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world The amount of bananas the world wants has grown but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire For better or worse the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in This continues for years Until rather quickly those cheap bananas stop flooding in Yet the appetite for bananas remains the same What happens now The price of bananas shoots up In fact it s even more extreme than this not only has the supply of bananas vanished and demand stayed the same no the demand for bananas has skyrocketed You see just a year ago everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile Sure less bananas were being eaten but stockpiles of bananas still fell Then the world got better and people s appetites for bananas exploded All that time with no bananas now they want to feast on bananas They ve even decided to build bridges buildings cars and appliances out of bananas Whoa so it s pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now Maybe it s time to expand your banana farms Well you see that takes a lot of time and a lot of money It can t happen overnight Furthermore the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire so maybe this time you ll be more careful That s where we are at right now Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time and supply that s not coming back for a long time IIb Steel China and the rest of the world This is the wrinkle version of the above section Skip if you want Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing and changing rapidly On top of that we are seeing immense economic growth On top of that we are coming out of COVID which saw lower levels of production and caused demand to pent up There is a lot of intersectionality going on but it s the perfect storm for steel Before China sets the price of steel China enjoys steel privileges and they oppress the rest of the world s steelmakers Look at just how much steel they manufacture

produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the 2 steel producer India and 6x all of Europe combined They also consume a fuck ton of steel But in the end they re left with plenty of steel to export which they ve happily been doing So much so that for years they ve driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US They export about 15 20 of all the

eb6a70cb82031df27c24b385d01cb426be15e77e While they may not export much directly to the US the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel and prices all over the world drop as a result Now China doesn t want to make so much steel Part of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world s standards they cut corners The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2 5 and I haven t looked into it but I m sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill If you don t know what PM2 5 is it s particulate matter dust grains etc of size 2 5 microns or less For reference your hair is about 50 70 microns thick PM2 5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your

pollution to local people said Huang Minister of Ecology and Environment Yeah steel causes 15 of China s emissions and probably a much higher percent of their poor air quality This is because not only

yourself you need it all for that 6 growth 2 Stop exporting so you can cut down production 3 Switch to cleaner ways of making steel China s walking the walk It s not just talk China is actually doing this First a decree of production cutbacks Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit Next removing export rebate in May StopAsianRebate This makes it less profitable to export Next fucking with domestic commodities prices so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer In May they increased margin requirements for commodities traders causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices temporarily Meanwhile they re building out EAFs They want to make less steel they want to keep it for themselves they want it cleaner III EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action By now you see why steel is expensive and that there s a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably So let s explore how that is done Hint scrap metal How steel is made Steel has two

img cahtn087b1a71 EAFs are the future of steelmaking And EAFs love scrap Cultural Appropriation It s not just conjecture that China is moving towards EAFs it s a fact https www spglobal com platts en market insights latest news coal 032521 chinas eaf capacity growth to slow down after reaching 196 mil mtyear in 2021 gt China s electric arc furnace or EAF steelmaking capacity will increase by 14 3 million mt year in 2021 to about 196 million mt year accounting for 15 of China s total crude steel capacity according to S amp P Global Platts Analytics The net increase of China s EAF steelmaking capacity will be just 6 1 million mt year in total over 2022 2023 according to Platts That s another 14 3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year and another 6 1 million mt in 2022 For reference 20 4 million mt is about 30 of the US s entire steelmaking capacity this is what China is adding in a span of just two years Curious why they aren t building more even though they could It s because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future gt However the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022 2023 as tight scrap supply and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel s profitability In other words the amount of scrap available is the bottleneck Thankfully here in the US we have a shit ton of scrap and SCHN knows how to get it and how to sell it

though Unilever was one of the few large cap consumer staple companies that did not engage in share buybacks in 2019 and 2020 Thus if we assume that dividend per share will grow at 6 per year for the

thinking we hit 55 by July and 60 by August which would be multi baggers Lastly steelmakers earnings are coming up If you re a believer in STEELGBTQ steel goes big this quarter then now s not a bad time to load up Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter but it s debatable how the market will react My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in and a flight to value has to start some time IIa Bananas Imagine it s 1990 Nirvana is rocking the charts and you grow and sell bananas Business is good and you re able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely You pay your workers well and you re not too mean to the environment However a new banana grower hits the scene across the world They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers This makes their bananas cheaper to make They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap and rake in money In the span of 30 years they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you and more than half of the whole world As the price of bananas plummet banana growers across the world suffer They can t afford to expand and they don t They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world The amount of bananas the world wants has grown but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire For better or worse the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in This continues for years Until rather quickly those cheap bananas stop flooding in Yet the appetite for bananas remains the same What happens now The price of bananas shoots up In fact it s even more extreme than this not only has the supply of bananas vanished and demand stayed the same no the demand for bananas has skyrocketed You see just a year ago everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile Sure less bananas were being eaten but stockpiles of bananas still fell Then the world got better and people s appetites for bananas exploded All that time with no bananas now they want to feast on bananas They ve even decided to build bridges buildings cars and appliances out of bananas Whoa so it s pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now Maybe it s time to expand your banana farms Well you see that takes a lot of time and a lot of money It can t happen overnight Furthermore the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire so maybe this time you ll be more careful That s where we are at right now Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time and supply that s not coming back for a long time IIb Steel China and the rest of the world This is the wrinkle version of the above section Skip if you want Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing and changing rapidly On top of that we are seeing immense economic growth On top of that we are coming out of COVID which saw lower levels of production and caused demand to pent up There is a lot of intersectionality going on but it s the perfect storm for steel Before China sets the price of steel China enjoys steel privileges and they oppress the rest of the world s steelmakers Look at just how much steel they manufacture amp x200B Processing img 0y4yzy2hk1a71 Yeah it s that crazy China produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the 2 steel producer India and 6x all of Europe combined They also consume a fuck ton of steel But in the end they re left with plenty of steel to export which they ve happily been doing So much so that for years they ve driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US They export about 15 20 of

829226b71f6879cbea70d3feb5168014076c0603 While they may not export much directly to the US the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel and prices all over the world drop as a result Now China doesn t want to make so much steel Part of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world s standards they cut corners The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2 5 and I haven t looked into it but I m sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill If you don t know what PM2 5 is it s particulate matter dust grains etc of size 2 5 microns or less For reference your hair is about 50 70 microns thick PM2 5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your

pollution to local people said Huang Minister of Ecology and Environment Yeah steel causes 15 of China s emissions and probably a much higher percent of their poor air quality This is because not only

a macro scale It s also causing them geopolitical headache as all eyes are on them to literally clean up their act Thus China is working to make their environment a safe space 1 Use the steel for yourself you need it all for that 6 growth 2 Stop exporting so you can cut down production 3 Switch to cleaner ways of making steel China s walking the walk It s not just talk China is actually doing this First a decree of production cutbacks Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit Next removing export rebate in May StopAsianRebate This makes it less profitable to export Next fucking with domestic commodities prices so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer In May they increased margin requirements for commodities traders causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices temporarily Meanwhile they re building out EAFs They want to make less steel they want to keep it for themselves they want it cleaner III EAFs and Scrapfirmative

year in total over 2022 2023 according to Platts That s another 14 3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year and another 6 1 million mt in 2022 For reference 20 4 million mt is about 30 of the US s entire steelmaking capacity this is what China is adding in a span of just two years Curious why they aren t building more even though they could It s because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future gt However the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022 2023 as tight scrap supply and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel s profitability In
