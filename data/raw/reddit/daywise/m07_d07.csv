Im also an idiot I literally almost flunked out cuz i was too dumb I ended up in construction because i couldnt do anything else engineering related Take this opinion at your own risk because I might be talking out of my ass I m in construction specifically on the municipality side yea im that city worker so I m the one administering the federal infrastructure funds at the ground level To date I ve administered millions in federal funds on infrastructure Infrastructure is by definition the least sexiest thing Everyone shits but we d all prefer to not deal with it that s infrastructure Here are a bunch of very common sense reasons why this isnt going to cash in I see a lot of posts about steel concrete and other raw materials Clearly these are from people who know fuck all about infrastructure I d argue that if you re looking to invest into Biden s infrastructure plan you should be looking at the other end of this supply chain Who do you think is more profitable the no name company that supplies the raw material for 1 component of an iphone or Apple If youre looking to jump onto the infrastructure bandwagon I d be looking at construction companies or engineering firms But companies are also not a great bet contractors and trades are specialized The company that paves the street is not the same one that does traffic signal upgrades An electrician is not going to do laborers work Large companies will need either by choice or requirement to subcontract out certain specialized portions thus diluting overall tendies not to mention that profits are capped markup is often literally defined Oh no Mr Contractor you have a problem fuck you sucks to be you this is one of my favorite parts of the job Not to mention that projects are parsed to all the states and from there into certain sizes in order to further dilute the tendies State and local governments may have additional requirements that even further dilute the tendies The government is trying boost an industry and the economy at large not a few companies The literal idea of the plan is to trickle money across the country If you look at this fountain that slowly trickles down if you place your cup in any one spot you re just gonna get a few drops Infrastructure means nothing because it means everything It could be streetlight poles in which case steel is very very relevant or it could be a fucking sidewalk in which case steel is not important at all If you just open your eyes when you go outside huge ask i know you will see that infrastructure is extremely varied Many of us with ties to the industry are feeling delays and back orders but this is logistics related These issues were around before the infra plan and will remain after I think the idea behind these DDs on raw materials is because they think this infrastructure plan will increase demand on an already limited supply thus driving prices and profits up Nevermind the contracting aspect of this money a lot of it is fixed for a certain amount of time Supply and demand still rules but solving the global supply chain logistics will also increase supply The supply chain logistical issues are a larger and more importantly independent factor Also surprise surprise Biden s infrastructure plan while maybe bigger isnt special Trump had infrastructure plans and so did Obama Infrastructure is ALWAYS happening As i said everyone shits and it doesnt stop Infrastructure never stops you can try to clench your sphincter closed and it ll work for a lil while but eventually you shit Its the same thing with infrastructure spending Biden s plan is not the big demand surge people think it is I think a lot of people underestimate the timescale of infrastructure it takes time to build shit and it takes even more time to renovate shit cuz you cant just blow it up and start over Most people cannot shit on command and those that can dont do it instantly This aint China We re not gonna build a covid hospital in 48 hours mostly cuz our work isnt made out of garbage tofu strength concrete but that is another topic This shit is going to take YEARS I will see Biden infrastructure money at my level 1 2 years from now and will start spending it 3 5 years from now Think about this after the money is secured someone gotta design the damn thing someone gotta the draw the picture so my dumbass who cant read can knows what is supposed to be built Those assholes always fuck up too and they are the smart ones This isnt even mentioning how raw material suppliers product suppliers construction companies design firms are only a part of this timescale One dude can only use 1 shovel at at time can operate one piece of equipment at a time The pipe maker can only make pipes so fast and those pipes can only be installed so fast There is no exponential factor in infrastructure like there is in tech An app can be downloaded millions of times in a single night You only shit one poop at a time Tl dr Infrastructure is like pooping Everyone does it it is always happening Trying to cash in on infrastructure is trying to cash in on pooping You can only poop so fast and so much the supply demand is capped You only shit one poop at a time Sure you get diarrhea sometimes but even then it has its limits You cant cash in on analogous dry heaves Infrastructure is regular so in the long term investing in this industry is probably a smart move As long as humans are alive they are going to shit and if there are more humans tomorrow than there are today then there will be more shit but if that is your tendie making strategy why are you even here

digital assets as well as incremental increases of mining efficiency as well as procurement of new miners or expansions Risks for Greenidge include the price of digital assets due to increased volatility from various influences such as government crackdowns and environmental concerns The current plant located on Seneca Lake has been generating negative headlines over recent months due to environmental concerns With the plant currently running at only 13 the total carbon emissions were estimated to be 243 tons in comparison to 119 tons in 2018 and 39 tons in 2019 Additionally the air permit for Greenidge is due to be renewed in September 2021 The Department of Environment Conservation DEC has been asked to review closely before granting renewal of permits Management The management

f46ffb0c606d26e31a77582c9a93629c8fa09582 Formed in 2014 by a Private Equity firm Atlas Holdings They purchased a power plant in Dresden New York and converted it from coal to natural gas in 2017 In 2020 they completed construction of their data center and began the first phase of their digital asset mining campaign On July 2nd 2021 they announced plans to develop a South Carolina mining facility which is currently a printing plant as part of their planned expansion with an estimated completion of 2021 or early 2022 Competitive Advantage What sets them apart from their competitors is that they are slated to be the only vertically integrated publicly listed digital asset mining operation This is because they own and operate their own power plant which means they have no reliance on third

they have the lowest cost of power in their peer group One of the primary measurements of success for digital asset mining is the hashrate Hashrate is defined as The number of hashes a miner can perform in each second typically expressed in EH S or TH S and used as a measure of computational power or mining capacity used to mine and process transactions on a blockchain Greenidge mining currently has a hashrate of 1 1 which implies a potential for mining 378K per day This is equivalent to RIOT which also has a hashrate of 1 1 MARA another competitor has a hashrate of 1 4 which implies a potential for mining 481K per day amp x200B https preview redd it qqs2x8q8kr971 png width 554 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 6bfce4bbda96f197355411bb8b6b3d2bba843b26 Valuation As part of

Catalysts and Risks Catalysts for Greenidge include an increase price of digital assets as well as incremental increases of mining efficiency as well as procurement of new miners or expansions Risks for Greenidge include the price of digital assets due to increased volatility from various influences such as government crackdowns and environmental concerns The current plant located on Seneca Lake has been generating negative headlines over recent months due to environmental concerns With the plant currently running at only 13 the total carbon emissions were estimated to be 243 tons in comparison to 119 tons in 2018 and 39 tons in 2019 Additionally the air permit for Greenidge is due to be renewed in September 2021 The Department of Environment Conservation DEC has been asked to review closely before granting renewal of permits Management The management team for Greenidge Atlas Holdings appears to be well diversified as well as contain knowledge regarding digital assets Ted Rogers Vice Chairman is an active member of the digital asset community and has been for nearly a decade I believe that having a robust digital asset mining community one that moves quickly toward

DO NOT use this strategy UNLESS you have read this AND done your own DD amp x200B What are they Synthetics mimic the movement of a different position using a combination of options i e how can you mimic the movement of 100 shares of long stock or 100 shares of short stock Long Synthetic Bullish Mimic 100 shares of LONG Stock UNAFFECTED by Greeks Buy ATM can also be ITM or OTM but it changes several factors best to stick with ATM for now Call option SELL the corresponding Put option of the same strike AND expiration E g Buy the SLV 24 Strike Call Jan 2023 Expiration 4 18 Debit Sell the SLV 24 Strike Put Jan 2023 Expiration 4 03 Credit Net cost Strike Price Plus Debit Paid Image includes commission and others so the net figure is different amp x200B https preview redd it

Strike Price Minus Credit Received or plus debit paid if the case may be amp x200B Processing img 5riryjje4s971 Now the obvious risk with a Short Synthetic is the sold call leg thus the P L chart showing infinite potential loss The easiest way to mitigate this is by buying a LOWER Delta Call to cover yourself in the case of a surge higher The expiration does not need to be the same as the Synthetic I would instead buy the expiration that is far out enough that I am comfortable with in this case Sep 17th 2021 amp x200B Processing img 8yg74v3g4s971 So Why Use Them Some of the biggest strength of stock vs options is the lack of theta decay AND the fixed delta positioning the other big advantage is the fact that a Synthetic grants exposure to 100 shares of stock WITHOUT the upfront costs you are still subject to the same P L as if you HAD bought the shares so keep this in mind in a margin account this can result in opening more Synthetics than you have cash to cover leading to a margin call be warned in a margin account therefore this can make the strategy a good way to make efficient use of capital In effect you are opening a 100 share position for next to nothing in opening costs you will still be subject to the price fluctuations of the underlying THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE NO RISK THIS MERELY MEANS THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FRONT THE CASH FOR THE STOCK amp x200B Synthetic Covered Calls Remember that a Synthetic mimics 100 Shares of Stock hence the 100 Delta This also allows one to sell CCs AGAINST their Synthetic stock position whilst still retaining the protective put lower delta than the synthetic this gives a P L chart like the one below This is a Synthetic Collar amp x200B https preview redd it vy1d204j4s971 png width 652 amp format png amp auto

webp amp s abc00d2e298c13a460d7253c804b9ea8f6a6e7e2 As you can see the position is as close to theta neutral as possible it will obviously vary depending on the underlying amp x200B Hedging a Stock Position With Synthetics Assume for moment you sell a CSP against a stock Assume that the price falls through and you are now bagholding You now own 100 shares below your cost basis you cannot really sell CCs yes you can but most people on here will tend not to You can enter a Short Synthetic 100 Deltas this offsets your 100 Deltas AKA the 100 shares of stock This makes you delta neutral WITHOUT the theta drag of puts keep in mind this will likely brokerages vary prevent you from selling CCs whilst the Synthetic is in place In effect you freeze your position and prevent further loses This also makes it much easier to pivot to a net negative delta position any puts you buy WILL make you net short that many deltas There are MANY different Synthetic strategies out there like the ones discussed above or even just selling an ITM put to replicate a CC Hope some of you found this helpful if you did let me know if it didn t also let me know P S I forgot to mention you will want to set up your Long Synthetic far out in time similar to a LEAP assuming you are using it purely as a long exposure tool because a risk with Synthetics or any strategy that involves STO options is the risk of early assignment By being further out in time this reduces the likelihood that you will be subject to early assignment the person exercising the option would forfeit all the time value their paid for the option P P S I will also encourage anyone who is wanting to implement these strategies to start in a paper account particularly if you are using Short Synthetics to hedge a position this will allow you to get a clear plan of when you should Freeze your positions and when you should Thaw them As with all hedging strategies you WILL have missed opportunities the real key is that you consistently apply your plan so that you will should never be caught with your pants down

I ve been working with data on WSB discussion for the past couple years Someone recently did an interesting piece of analysis with the data that I ve been collecting and I wanted to share it on here Credit for the following goes to Romain Cece at Alquant WallStreetBets WSB is a famous subreddit where participants focus on trading stocks and options It became particularly notorious in late January 2021 for being the originator of the GameStop short squeeze now also known as the Mother Of All Short Squeezes MOASS This epic battle between retail investors and hedge funds was widely and wildly covered by the media as it was a true David and Goliath analogy In the end WSB was declared the winner of the battle although many individual investors probably also experienced heavy losses Additionally with the recent WSB driven rise of the AMC stock it appears that the GameStop short squeeze was not a one time event and that the WSB community may also have a real influence on the stock market in the future This leads to a series of questions that we wanted to answer quantitatively amp x200B Does this atypical population of investors have a particular ability to predict or as some prefer manipulate the markets If so is it possible to create relatively simple investment strategies that outperform the stock market For this analysis we used data provided by Quiver Quantitative which aggregated the number of mentions and the overall sentiment of the WSB community for each stock on a daily basis through NLP The stock universe considered is the Russell 3000 Index A sample of this dataset is displayed below amp x200B WSB discussion data daily aggregation https preview redd it msf009hlts971 png width 766 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 4a2e6c4a8dd285429d1b0bb57c41f9236c35071c For this first article we chose to focus on the number of mentions Indeed a high number of mentions could reflect an enthusiasm that could improve the performance of a title First a brief qualitative analysis of the data allows us to keep a global view on this new type of time series without getting lost in the details In the graph of the evolution of the total number of daily mentions see below we can easily distinguish two periods with different regimes with a transition from one to the other around March 2020 Indeed the average daily mentions between August 2018 and February 2020 is about 360 and is multiplied by 10 in the following period We can therefore assume that the influence of these mentions will be amplified in this second period Total mentions https preview redd it 4qcpro6xts971 png width 2428 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 8321d81ecb5e6b1d8a75393f1d221603b5c86335 What to do with these observations Let s try to focus on timing We can assume that for a given stock the number of mentions is predictive of its future performance Let s do the test with a sample of stocks Since the objective is not to develop a rigorous strategy for the moment we will focus on general statistical observations We independently selected 1000 stocks from the Quiver dataset and applied a simple strategy if the number of mentions on this stock is higher than its 50th expanding quantile it means that the stock is particularly mentioned and we buy it If not we keep our capital in cash The result is clear the returns offered by this strategy are higher than those of the stock in only 19 4 of cases As for the Sharpe ratio it is higher than the stock in only 35 2 of the cases We came to the conclusion that the number of mentions of a stock taken as an indicator has no obvious explicit timing quality for that stock An example of such a strategy applied to a stock DIS can be seen below Disney strategy https preview redd it

would be interesting to select the stocks that appear the most in the subreddit These stocks are the ones that are most likely to be influenced by these investors as they centralize more attention Following this belief we have backtested a stock selection portfolio rebalanced every month Each month we select 10 stocks from the Russell 3000 Index that had the most mentions in the previous month We combine them into an equally weighted long portfolio until the following month The backtest period runs from September 2018 to June 2021 To evaluate the performance of this strategy we computed a simulation of 1000 portfolios selecting monthly 10 random stocks from the same universe and computed the 95th percentile of statistical metrics to compare to our tested strategy Strategy performance

1400 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 0afcc356277a83662335c8ab51f47aec23786b47 Interestingly this portfolio not only outperforms the SPY with quite impressive returns but also has a Sharpe ratio in the top 5 of our random simulations The main advantage of this WSB portfolio remains the absolute returns which are much higher than those of our best random portfolios We also observe that in the second half of the backtest characterized by a higher number of mentions the outperformance becomes more significant and striking Let s evaluate this sentiment with a graph of the relative performance of our strategy versus the performance of the SPY Relative performance https preview redd it i0suvzmous971 png width 2428 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 01141ac7979a1dc9054c6a9455b3a476e097a2ec This graph supports the first hypothesis made from the graph showing the evolution of the total number of mentions It helps reinforce the impression that stocks with a high number of mentions are more likely to peak in the short to medium term We ll explore other approaches to investment strategies in future articles and see if the WSB sentiment also contains valuable information Stay tuned Endnote The same backtest was calculated with a voluntary exclusion of AMC and GME stocks to assess how the strategy s performance depended on these two very specific stocks The chart below shows that even with reduced returns the strategy still significantly outperforms SPY GME AMC exclusion https preview redd it 8q463pruus971 png width 2428 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

CLOV rant,TL DR This breaks down any FUD linked to my original post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments of0hls let me clear the air here regarding gme amc clov h4cwf8d context 3 Sorry for the long write up but this should clarify everything this will be my last post regarding this Mods If you can let this post stay up it would mean a lot as I think I clarify a lot of gaps or misunderstandings from my original post for some people Thanks Holy fuck this post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments of0hls let me clear the air here regarding gme amc clov h4cwf8d context 3 blew up I want to say thanks for all the awards comments and engagement I can t believe I had to make this post to explain this but since this blew up and there s a bunch of FUD going around now regarding my post I really need to clear somethings up GME When I stated 15 20 of the short sellers are from the beginning I wasn t referring to short interest or the naked shorts I was referring to the firms that have shorted the stock since the beginning that are still shorting and haven t closed out their positions The media states that they have billions in losses but these are unrealized losses until they close out their positions This is the reason why in my post I labeled GME as a very serious play as the MOASS or whatever you want to refer it to has not occurred until they close out their positions GME did have some minor short squeezes and gamma squeezes since its inception Think of when it hit 438 or months later when it hit 330 These were in fact a short squeeze and or gamma squeeze to some degree or both combined when this occurred but it wasn t the squeeze people are referring to which won t be until the shorts close out their positions They haven t closed their positions AMC I stand by what I said about the company prior to being heavily invested in Regarding that they had talks of bankruptcy pre WSB and that they ve diluted shares in the past Again the stock hasn t squeezed until the short sellers close out their positions CLOV I ve been on WSB since early December of 2020 We ll before this subreddit hit 500k redditors etc I created my reddit account on January 28th because I wanted to start contributing to WSB I was never big on reddit having an account but always used it just without an account Ex I would read peoples posts and comments to gain knowledge or whatever I only created an account once I found a subreddit WSB and others around that time like investing forums day trading forums etc that I liked and felt like I wanted to contribute too CLOV was a stock that I was paying close attention to since the beginning with the other 2 stocks mentioned above The impression was that people hated Chamath because he openly voiced his opinion on stock manipulation and for his support for WSB and stocks like GME and AMC and that may have contributed to higher short interest on CLOV I don t care about Chamath I m indifferent about him I just look at CLOV as the company it is it s fundamentals SI Future potential growth etc The purpose of my original post was to call out people constantly shilling others for discussing other stocks that weren t GME or AMC and the constant downvotes and have cult like attitude and behavior that followed Reason GME AMC and CLOV where the Hot topic of my post was because it was the daily tickers popular stocks thread and the comparison conversations and cult like behavior was ridiculous and was the reason I wrote my post Ex everyone was shitting on redditors for talking about CLOV A lot of people here clearly understood my intention of my original post but some haven t and with this catching media attention for some bizarre reason there s extra bullshit being spread about the way I wrote my post or saying I m a bot HF or a shill etc Just to be clear I support all 3 stocks I think all 3 have a great plays for themselves I m not advocating any stocks or what stocks you should buy if you read my post you would understand that This is reddit I was speaking off the top of my head I m not a financial advisor or professional money manager or what have you I m legit just a retard trying to make money and bring WSB back to being what it is a casino I m a male in my 20 s I work a normal fucking job and I m a Canadian I m not going to provide more details as I like my anonymity and privacy Take the FUD backlash or misunderstandings that people are stating about my original post as an example of the type of bullshit I m talking about The principle of my original post was to explain that these 3 popular stocks are not the same and to stop comparing them or competing against each other regarding someone else s investment decision The second most important part of my post was explaining that WSB is not a cult not a team and not a place for coordinated pump and dumps collusion etc but a place to which is a casino and we place bets in favor of a positive outcomes hopefully and if we have loss or gain porn we post it and a place where people create wonderful memes Sorry for the second long ass rant but this was really important to clarify to everyone to ensure everyone was aligned with my intent and purpose of my original post If people can t understand after this post I really don t know what else I can say Thanks

Summary Currently there is a great opportunity in the Interactive Real time 3D space that has potential applications ranging from game development to architecture design to engineering and much more o There are a couple companies that have a very good opportunity to capitalize on this trend forecast however I believe that unity can best take advantage of this trend However my valuation techniques indicate that Unity is slightly overvalued given current market conditions But there still is a way to capitalize on this My final valuation indicates that Unity s fair value is 102 103 share which implies a share price decrease of over 3 o Overall I am bullish on Unity however I will wait until prices are at below these levels before I would consider accumulating more Unity as a Company U Unity Software Inc https utradea com stocks U is the leading platform for creating and operating real time 3 D content for developers architects artists designers filmmakers and many others Unity provides their customers with a set of software solutions so that they can create run and monetize their content for mobile PC console and VR users Unity has over 2 7B monthly active users that make content which is accessible to other Unity users and potentially beyond Unity allows their users to make 2D and 3D creations for a variety of uses and allows their users to edit content simultaneously if they are given the permission to do so making the process easier and more efficient With compute processers becoming faster improvements in bandwidth and the ability to use cloud computing creators on Unity can now develop more complex and immersive experiences for their community of gamers Unity has a large customer base a great reputation in the industry and a wide variety of compatible platforms All of these factors have helped Unity to expand their platform software so that 71 of the top 1000 mobile games being developed on Unity s software Furthermore Unity provides solutions that allows their creators to monetize their content through in app purchases and through in app advertising This helps Unity to generate more revenue business and it allows their community of developers to make money which is truly a win win However unity is not just for videogames and there are many Fortune 500 companies that use Unity s software for design architecture engineering construction transportation and other industries that could benefit from Unity s 2D and 3D creation software One example of this could be safety training videos in 3D VR or AR The potential use cases of Unity s software is constantly expanding which is good for the future of Unity Unity has 2 main sets of solutions that they offer These are their Create and Operate solutions and these will be discussed later in this analysis U Unity Software Investment Information Initial Public Offering IPO On September 22nd 2020 Unity completed their IPO Part of this IPO required Unity to list more of their common shares among other forms of dilution These factors played a big role in Unity s overall dilution for the year ending 2020 however this will be discussed later on in this analysis Interactive Real Time 3D Outlook Unity believes that they are in the midst of an interactive real time 3D content explosion especially in the gaming industry Unity has quickly moved from the static 2D space into the interactive 3D space to take advantage of this In just the past 20 years the gaming industry has grown from 15B to an 159B industry which represents a historical CAGR in this industry of 11 97 This is not expected to slow down any time soon as analysts have predicted that it will continue to grow at a CAGR of 10 5 for the next 5 years However the 3D videogame software industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15 5 over the next 5 years and is expected to lead the ongoing surge in the videogame industry This is fantastic news for unity as they dominate this space and can capitalize on the trends like no other However there are also many uses for this software outside of gaming 3 of the biggest potential markets for this software is in the architecture automotive and film industries This is also a favourable trend for Unity as their software is used by many Fortune 500 companies which implies that their software is reputable reliable and most likely the first choice for other businesses looking for this type of software This should help Unity to capitalize on the expected 24 5 CAGR of the Visualization and 3D rendering software industry Sources Gaming Market Growth Trends

operations their loss from operations increased by 82 very bad as it affects their net loss and their net loss increased by 73 Overall 2020 was not a good year financially for Unity Issuance of Common Stock In 2020 Unity issued 4 545 455 common shares to the public The issuance of these shares caused a dilutionary effect of 3 69 Issuance of Common Stock due to IPO related activities Unity underwent an Initial Public Offering IPO in September of 2020 Due to this IPO and the associated underwriting and commissions Unity offered an additional 28 750 000 common shares The issuance of these shares diluted the value of the pre existing shares by 23 32 which is a sizeable amount Issuance of Common Stock charity purposes Furthermore in 2020 Unity offered 750 000 common shares as a charitable donation This shows that Unity is Socially Responsible which may lead to good press and increased investments as there is a growth in Socially Responsible investing Additionally this offering also provided Unity with a tax benefit which doesn t hurt This issuance diluted the existing shares by 0 61 Stock Options In 2020 Unity had an influx of options that were exercised The exercise of these options resulted in 6 758 226 common shares being released into the markets These new shares had a dilutionary effect on Unity s shares of 5 48 Issuance of Common Stock Acquisition related Unity offered more shares in 2020 however this time they were offered as a result of an acquisition In total there were 1 103 190 shares offered to the public as a result of this acquisition which diluted shares by 0 90 Share Repurchases In 2020 Unity repurchased some shares it was not all dilution Unity ended up repurchasing 5000 shares through the retirement of treasury shares This share repurchases had an inflationary effect on existing shares of 0 004 which is essentially nothing even without the mass dilution they experienced However the fact that they did this is worth mentioning due to the possibility of future buybacks Convertible Preferred Shares Upon IPO Lastly in 2020 Unity experienced a mass conversion of their convertible preferred shares as a result of their IPO This mass conversion led to the release of 102 717 396 common shares into the market This conversion had a dilutionary effect of 83 33 which is massive Total Dilution In 2020 Unity experienced a total share dilution of 121 92 Share Dilution as a result of IPO As you should have already noticed the biggest forms of dilution in 2020 were all attributed to their IPO However what would Unity s share dilution look like if the dilutionary effects caused by their IPO were disregarded If we were to disregard the factors of dilution that Unity experienced as a result of their IPO it would help us to get a better sense of the share dilution we can expect in the future By disregarding these factors of dilution we arrive at a share dilution of Unity in 2020 of 10 27 which is much more realistic If I were to look at this type of dilution in Unity I would not be surprised given that they are a rapidly growing software company This figure is also much more common and may even be inflated a tiny bit due to the smaller effects of the IPO that cannot be directly attributed to a form of dilution Valuation Information WACC I found Unity s WACC to be 7 44 through a site called Gurufocus Additionally there were other sites that I found Unity s WACC to be between 7 8 so this result is most likely accurate CAGR I found Unity s CAGR to be 41 55 I found this by taking the average growth in their gross profit which is the field in which I applied this CAGR to over the past 2 years I arrived at an end result of 41 55 year Operating Expense Growth Rate I found this growth rate by taking Unity s average yearly growth rate of their operating expense over the past 3 years This resulted in a growth rate of 32 48 Interest Expense Growth Rate Once again I found this rate by taking Unity s average yearly growth in their interest expense and by doing this I arrived at a figure of 32 30 Depreciation and Amortization Growth Rate I found Unity s depreciation and amortization growth rate by taking its average yearly increase over the past 3 years which cam out to be 29 92 Tax Rate Negative Income According to their SEC 10 K filing https d18rn0p25nwr6d cloudfront net CIK 0001810806 9803cc98 1a24 4233 bd00 079754b49145 pdf Unity s effective tax rate in 2020 was 17 which means that they actually received money through tax benefits I used this negative tax rate to calculate the tax benefit when there is forecasted to be negative earnings Tax Rate Positive Income I used a standard tax rate of 20 to estimate Unity s effective tax rate when they manage to report positive earnings which in my model will not be until 2024 Competition For my comparable analyses I needed to compare Unity s financial ratios and multiples to some of their competitors These competitors need to be publicly listed how similar business models and operations operate in similar geographies and be of similar market cap I chose 4 companies that fit this profile that I could use to compare to Unity these companies include RBLX Roblox Corp https utradea com stocks RBLX Roblox offers their customers applications that allow them to create in 3D worlds These customers can develop using Roblox s suite of tools to build publish and operate their games content SKLZ Skillz Inc https utradea com stocks SKLZ Skillz connects their community of freelance developers to their equally enthusiastic community of gamers These developers can create publish and monetize their content games that will be consumed by Skillz community of gamers TTWO Take Two Interactive Software https utradea com stocks TTWO Take Two develops publishes and markets interactive entertainment solutions under Rockstar games 2K Private Divisions Social Point and Playdots Some of their most successful games are NBA 2k PGA TOUR 2K GTA and Red Dead Redemption EA Electronic Arts Inc https utradea com stocks EA EA develops market publishes and distributes video games content Some of EA s best performing games are FIFA UFC NHL NFL and Star Wars Valuing Unity s Stock In order to value Unity s stock I underwent a DCF model and 3 comparable analyses DCF Using the information figures found above in the valuation information section I was able to undergo a DCF model This DCF model estimates that the fair value per share of Unity is 22 which would imply a potential downside to this investment of 79 However this is very unlikely so I decided to undergo some comparable analyses to get a better idea of a valuation Comparable Analyses EV Assets By comparing Unity s EV Assets multiple to their public competitors listed above in the competitors section of this report I found Unity s fair value to be 86 share which implies a downside risk of 19 EV Revenue By comparing Unity s EV Revenue multiple to that of their competitors I found Unity s fair value to be 68 share which implies a downside of 36 This is relatively consistent with the EV Assets multiple based on the fact that they both find Unity to be undervalued P B By comparing Unity s P B ratio to that of their competitors I found that Unity should have a fair value of 180 share which implies an upside potential of 70 However this result contradicts the results achieved in the other 2 comparable and as a result of this I decided to take the average comparable result to get one final estimate Average Comparable By taking the average result of the 3 comparable analyses that I underwent I found Unity to have one all encompassing comparable fair value of 111 share which implies an upside of 5 Weighted Average Valuation Due to the fact that there is so much of a difference in the result achieved through the DCF and through the result as achieved in the average comparable I decided to take a weighted average of the two results Due to the DCF being so low and the software industry typically being overvalued I decided to weigh the average comparable as 90 and the DCF result as 10 By taking this weighted average I arrived at one final valuation of 102 share which implies a downside of 3 My U Unity Software Inc Investment Plan I believe that entering into a position in Unity above the 102 share level increases your risk as an investor and I personally would wait until the price drops to this level before entering into a position This will help limit the downside risk by ensuring that you entered in at fair value Risks to investing in Unity Financial Performance In 2020 Unity did not have the best financial performance with most of their key metrics net loss operating loss etc all increasing significantly This is not good to see as a potential Unity investor and may scare people away out of their positions If this kind of financial performance was to continue it would have negative effects on their share price Share Dilution In 2020 Unity experienced rampant share dilution however this share dilution was largely a result of their IPO process Even without the dilution from the IPO Unity cannot continue to dilute their shares by over 20 and virtually buy back no shares If this trend continues over the long run I would be very concerned about investing into Unity U Unity Software Inc Stock Catalysts Financial Performance Despite an overall poor financial performance in 2020 there was some good to come out of it especially their revenue and solution revenue growths In the future we are hoping to see better financial performances and if these performances come soon it could help the stock greatly Share Repurchases Unity has repurchased very little shares in 2020 However the fact that they purchased shares back may mean that they will continue to do this on a larger scale in the future However if they do not increase the size of their buybacks it will be unfavourable for the stock and its investors If you

after the GME squeeze Outliers usually are the most volatile stocks GME AMC ftd data was screaming look at me before the actual pop in shortly after NEGG is screaming the same thing right now Let s consider Ortex data and its relation to FTDs Ortex doesn t have a API and if it did I don t have time to look at it so I m doing a spot check So let s pick a random stock say SENS amp x200B https

the date on Nov 25th the FTD graph shows this as well Ok last one let s check UWMC amp x200B https preview redd it tz0fdz07xt971 png width 1600 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 4d70b7f62001c34ec2596821624fcba85252ac7e UWMC had a peak of avg loan age on Jun 10th subtract 41days from that day and you get April 29th lining up pretty well with UWMC largest FTD spike Ok so I m basically saying that for stocks without data on ortex you can get a sense of where the shorts have opened positions by looking at the peaks of ftds I only checked stocks with relatively large peaks as a percentage of float idk about others So basically for NEGG there has been a considerable amount of short positions opened May 15 Jun 15 these guys are underwater Next notice that GME FTD spike wasn t the day that the tendie god turned on the money printer that magical January it was actually in November Every stock that has reach GME level of FTD of Float moons later the spike never really lines up with the dildo to heaven It could happen a week later months later days later but it seems that for the outliers its going to happen NEGG is in the middle of a squeeze and its FTD spike rival stocks that have gone 200 to 400 during the moonshot The smaller the float and the higher the spike the more the pop I haven t quantified this If you checked interactive brokers during the day you would have noticed that NEGG had 0 shares available to short and the borrow rate is gt 50 At peak squeeze borrow rate usually spikes gt 100 Lastly in the last two days the short volume ratio has gone up by a factors amp volume has gone up as well amp x200B https preview redd it xcmal388xt971 png width 1600 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 8fda4d4c7954cd0f7aa23ba1df165425bf70acfc One thing I failed to mention is that the stock is already expensive to buy 20 ensuring that doubling down on shorting requires substantial capital Looking at iborrowdesk com we see that nice juicy slow creep up of borrow rate and reduction of shares available to borrow while the price slow bleeds up So negg is expensive to double down on and it expensive to borrow Now look at your fave stock that has squeezed borrow rate gt 100 rn negg borrow is a moderate 50 Need check So basically what I m saying is that NEGG is in the beginning to mid part of a squeeze Not a squeeze perpetuated by a hardened group of loyalist and propelled by whales A squeeze caused by a lt 3 5m shares float while all the exchanges having the wrong information the realization is happening that there were barely any shares to begin with This will be like a bank run and I don t have a logical price target It could go up to 70 Lastly for squeezes price instability is needed aka liquidity is drying up If you ve been watching the intraday movements at all with wide bid ask spreads and limited orderbook This plus increases in historic volatility indicated price instability liquidity drying up Liquidity price instability is one of the main characteristics in which you can identify a squeeze in general it indicate future volatility either a big move up or down too many buyers smashing the ask button or too many sellers smashing the bid button but we have enough information to identify the direction See this wrinklebrain comments for more info about liquidity https www reddit com r maxjustrisk comments

let s take a look at technicals Yesterday and the day before NEGG had a huge run up Literally having doubled its price at one point Ran from 10 to 21 before coming back down In that time it showed strong support at 13 I thought we might see 13 again today Besides that it showed support yesterday at it s first dip at 15 bounced from there up to 19 5 before getting rejected After it s rejection it showed support at 16 75 for AH PM at 15 75 for the intraday low AND THEN IT BOUNCED BACK TO 17 75 If we break down under 15 We might see 13 again Right now it s gearing up to retest 21 A rejection from that will likely put us back in this 17 75 range If we break that 21 resistance Then we might get a test of 22 We might see another gamma squeeze as brokers start hedging for the 22 5 Calls btw

implemented a couple months ago See this thread https www reddit com user jn ku comments m4fnfg gamestop moass no tinfoil hat required to see it s significance for all the meme s we know and love So I

as a percentage of float idk about others So basically for NEGG there has been a considerable amount of short positions opened May 15 Jun 15 these guys are underwater Next notice that GME FTD spike wasn t the day that the tendie god turned on the money printer that magical January it was actually in November Every stock that has reach GME level of FTD of Float moons later the spike never really lines up with the dildo to heaven It could happen a week later months later days later but it seems that for the outliers its going to happen NEGG is in the middle of a squeeze and its FTD spike rival stocks that have gone 200 to 400 during the moonshot The smaller the float and the higher the spike the more the pop I haven t quantified this If you checked interactive brokers during the day you would have noticed that NEGG had 0 shares available to short and the borrow rate is gt 50 At peak squeeze borrow rate usually spikes gt 100 Lastly in the last two days the short volume ratio has gone up by a factors amp volume has gone up as well amp x200B https preview redd it k32u8odrzt971 png width 1600 amp format png amp auto webp amp s a8700f42420fd701af7899bffd6551844984163d One thing I failed to mention is that the stock is already expensive to buy 20 ensuring that doubling down on shorting requires substantial capital Looking at iborrowdesk com we see that nice juicy slow creep up of borrow rate and reduction of shares available to borrow while the price slow bleeds up So negg is expensive to double down on and it expensive to borrow Now look at your fave stock that has squeezed borrow rate gt 100 rn negg borrow is a moderate 50 Need check So basically what I m saying is that NEGG is in the beginning to mid part of a squeeze Not a squeeze perpetuated by a hardened group of loyalist and propelled by whales A squeeze caused by a lt 3 5m shares float while all the exchanges having the wrong information the realization is happening that there were barely any shares to begin with This will be like a bank run and I don t have a logical price target It could go up to 70 Lastly for squeezes price instability is needed aka liquidity is drying up If you ve been watching the intraday movements at all with wide bid ask spreads and limited orderbook This plus increases in historic volatility indicated price instability liquidity drying up Liquidity price instability is one of the main characteristics in which you can identify a squeeze in general it indicate future volatility either a big move up or down too many buyers smashing the ask button or too many sellers smashing the bid button but we have enough information to identify the direction See this wrinklebrain comments for more info about liquidity https www reddit com r maxjustrisk comments

you excited we go to their financials In 2016 they made a measly 13M 2017 came around and they made an abysmal 1M 2018 though 2 15B Mind you they went from making 1Million dollars to 2 1 BBillion 2019

let s take a look at technicals Yesterday and the day before NEGG had a huge run up Literally having doubled its price at one point Ran from 10 to 21 before coming back down In that time it showed strong support at 13 I thought we might see 13 again today Besides that it showed support yesterday at it s first dip at 15 bounced from there up to 19 5 before getting rejected After it s rejection it showed support at 16 75 for AH PM at 15 75 for the intraday low AND THEN IT BOUNCED BACK TO 17 75 If we break down under 15 We might see 13 again Right now it s gearing up to retest 21 A rejection from that will likely put us back in this 17 75 range If we break that 21 resistance Then we might get a test of 22 We might see another gamma squeeze as brokers start hedging for the 22 5 Calls btw

s also positioned to be one of the best performing companies over the next several years With an incredible first mover advantage 16mm driven 10 years production and a massive lead on the market 50 US market share there is nothing stopping this stock from absolutely exploding The company is currently undervalued by 100 18 on fundamentals alone and that s on the fair end When people realize what is actually happening here and what this is about to become I think the hype and excitement has the potential to drive these prices much higher I see a TSLA situation brewing No not because it s just another EV company because it s an established well connected constantly growing commercial EV company How to Play Shares and a couple Aug and Dec calls Options are cheap and have low IVs TL DR This

should be noted that TD appears to be the most favorable from these preliminary figures The next three values to be analyzed relate to earnings and sales Here we start to see some differences between the banks with TD managing to grow earnings significantly more than the other banks in the past 5 years Fig 3 Bank P S EPS growth last 5y Sales growth past 5y Scotiabank 3 36 1 30 7 9 RBC 5 22 3 1 8 9 BMO 4 46 2 8 12 1 CIBC 3 43 1 5 8 8 TD 4 58 8 8 7 5 Average 4 21 2 38 9 04 amp x200B TD is a clear winner in this section It would be ideal to bring the P S down but because the P FCF is so high for all of the banks it is not a worry TD is the only bank managing to become more efficient as they scale which potentially shows an effective management team or increasingly more profitable businesses or both It is possible that the earnings increase may be a result of a lack of attention to other obligations or competitive endeavors which could possibly hurt them in the future CIBC and Scotiabank have managed to decrease earnings as they have increased sales possibly hinting at ineffective management or defective operations It is also possible that the lower earnings are a result of restructuring which could be positive in the future All of these values will have to be analyzed much closer The analyst does suggest that a new measure be conceived to gauge growth sustainability The value would be determined by dividing EPS growth over a period x over Sales growth over that same period x The measure could be called the income growth sustainability measure and is formatted as follows IGSM EPS growth in the past x Sales growth in the past x years Where at least one value must be positive for the calculation to be effective The value produced is unitless The ideal value is 1 and deviations outside the range of 0 5 and1 5 are to be considered unsustainable This value is only rough estimate and would have to be refactored t in order to be used commercially because it produces inaccurate values the further you stray from 1 a value of 2 is clearly unsustainably as well as a value of 1 with positive earnings Using the newly constructed equation the figure below can be constructed Fig 4 amp x200B Bank IGSM TD 1 17 RBC 0 34 Scotiabank 0 16 CIBC 0 17 BMO 0 23 Again TD clearly has the most sustainable growth An average is not computed here because of the nature of this value and it will not be used to determine any conclusions A better evaluation of sustainable growth must be formulated No securities analysis is complete without analyzing the balance sheet All of the companies have a P Cash ratio between 0 23 0 25 so those values do not need to be discussed on a relative basis Current ratios D E measures and P B are considered in the following figure Some of this information has to be sourced from SEDAR http www sedar com Just press ctrl f and type in annual to get to the reports Other data is from Macrotrends https www macrotrends net probably the best source of long term information on the internet Fig 5 Bank Current ratio Debt to equity Price to book TD 0 93 0 13 1 68 RBC 0 90 0 11 2 02 Scotiabank 1 05 0 41 1 49 CIBC 1 03 0 12 1 46 BMO 0 98 0 14 1 42 Average 0 98 0 182 1 614 All of the values except for RBCs P B and Scotiabanks debt to equity fall within range of their peers Objectively these values are ridiculously strong but nonetheless we are looking for a winner among winners The last rudimentary fundamentals to be considered are some alternative financial ratios that work best when relatively compared This is the largest section We will be looking at all of the ROx s as well as PM and OM Fig 6 Bank ROE ROI ROA Operating Margin Profit margin TD 13 50 5 20 0 70 56 90 36 30 RBC 14 30 4 00 0 70 60 00 36 10 Scotiabank 10 40 17 30 0 60 51 20 23 50 CIBC 10 90 16 00 0 50 54 30 25 40 BMO 10 30 5 40 0 50 59 10 24 20 Average 11 88 9 58 0 6 56 3 29 10 For the returns Scotiabank and CIBC slightly ahead of the other three because of their exceptionally high ROI For operating margins RBC and BMO are slightly above average where Scotiabank is lagging behind TD and RBC have exceptionally higher profit margins Culminating the rudimentary analysis is a large comparison of Figures 2 6 excluding 4 For each figure a winner can be determined and a loser can be determined Here are the overall rankings for each figure For figure 2 TD is the most attractive in both fields CIBC is the second most attractive for both fields The first two fall below the average P E but because of the limited deviation between banks this is not a huge accomplishment The next two rankings are subjective BMO and RBC are tied for third Their percent difference between PEs and P FCFs are quite similar for both of them and each value carries similar importance Scotiabank is fourth In figure three TD is again the winner Their sustainable growth is extremely attractive despite having a higher P S than the average BMO is second for the same reasons and RBC is third because of their high P S Scotiabank and CIBC are tied for fourth because they both have similar P S ratios and their Sales growth to eps growth are similar For figure 5 CIBC is the slight winner Most values are very similar but CIBC is in the top two for all categories Second is BMO lagging slightly behind CIBC with their CR and D E but winning the P B category Third is TD Fourth is RBC because of their higher than average P B Last is scotiabank with the highest D E ratio despite having stronger values in other fields Scotiabank is in last because this value is almost four times the next highest D E whereas the highest P B is only 25 greater than the best P B ratio In judging figure 6 a higher priority is placed on profit margin Giving equal weighting to ROE ROI and ROA TD is the winner of figure 6 RBC is very close behind CIBC is third and Scotiabank is fourth BMO is last Fig 7 The results of the preliminary relative analysis Bank Figure 2 ranking Fig 3 ranking Fig 5 ranking Fig 6 ranking Overall TD 1 1 3 1 1 RBC 3 3 4 2 3 Scotiabank 4 4 5 4 5 CIBC 2 4 1 3 2 BMO 3 2 2 5 4 Clearly TD was the most attractive followed by CIBC Market analysis Data is mostly from stockhouse https stockhouse com This section will analyze more sensitive factors of each company such as short position large and insider transactions volatility and other factors related to the current situation of the company It will be split into individual sections for each bank as well as a composite section comparing some factors Lets begin with TD TD has a market cap of 150 billion which is quite large for even american companies Their beta is 0 9 which will hopefully draw speculation away They have a dividend yield of 3 825 Not a lot of insider information is available but most insiders have historically bought below 60 and sold at 70 The current price is 65 but is extremely attractive Bank Market cap Beta Yield Short interest Sales Assets TD 150 24b 0 9 3 825 0 33 43b 1 7t BMO has a market cap of 74 billion just about half that of TD They have a beta of 1 17 which is higher than desired They have a yield of 3 71 and a short interest of 0 59 Their yield is slightly lower than TD despite having the higher beta Recent insider purchases have been below 90 and a number of sales have happened above 100 Bank Market cap Beta Yield Short interest Sales Assets BMO 74b 1 17 3 71 0 59 25b 0 95t CIBC has a market cap of 59 billion Their beta is 1 and their yield is 3 34 Short interest is 0 98 There have been a number of insider sales above 100 and insider purchases below this number Bank Market cap Beta Yield Short interest Sales Assets CIBC 59b 1 3 34 0 98 18b 0 73t RBC has a market cap of 134 billion Their beta is 0 79 which makes them quite attractive if considering their dividend Their yield is 3 34 Short interest is 0 34 The buy sell line is at around 80 for insiders Bank Market cap Beta Yield Short interest Sales Assets RBC 134b 0 79 3 64 0 34 47b 1 62t Overall Bank Market cap Beta Yield Short interest Sales Assets Overall TD 150 24b 0 9 3 825 0 33 43b 1 7t 3 BMO 74b 1 17 3 71 0 59 25b 0 95t 5 Scotiabank 74b 0 85 4 64 0 34 31b 1

attractive if considering their dividend Their yield is 3 34 Short interest is 0 34 Scotiabanks buy sell line is around 75 with a lot of deviation amp x200B amp x200B All five institutions have some attractive things and some ugly things in this table relatively speaking Scotiabank s yield is offset by the low ranking it got in the previous relative analysis TD has the most attractive yield other than that and the low short interest is reassuring RBCs low beta is very attractive as well as their large sales and massive asset pool They are the second most attractive entry in the table after Scotiabank TD is third at a relatively neutral position CIBC is fourth and BMO is fifth because of BMOs large beta Legal regulatory and other news releases various sources TD Making acquisitions No recent regulatory information No recent legal news BMO Recently sold asset management business No regulatory No legal RBC No recent news No recent legal No recent regulatory Scotiabank Recently

insider expert Not so much on the business side of GDRX but I am on the front lines of medicine I m a physician and I see thousands of patients each year This gives me a solid understanding of what patients want as well as the inner mechanics of the healthcare system Far better experience IMO than any analyst behind a desk somewhere With that said let me explain why I think GoodRx is a solid investment choice First off what is GoodRx GoodRx is a drug discount service They help patients save money on their medications and patients can literally save thousands of dollars per year using the GoodRx card It s much cheaper than paying cash and even though it may be hard to believe the FREE GoodRx card can offer you medication at a lower cost than your insurance plan can I love the cards as do most of my patients GoodRx was founded by Doug Hirsch Trevor Bezdek and Scott Marlette Doug and Scott were early Facebook employees GoodRx cards are free and are accepted at more than 70 000 pharmacies in the United States GoodRx takes a percentage of the cost that the pharmacies charge and in turn the pharmacies gain customers GoodRx has saved consumers over 30 billion i https www reddit com r wallstreetbets submit sdendnote1sym On their app and website you just type in your zip code and you can see how much each pharmacy is charging for each drug Try it for yourself at GoodRx com It s simple and transparent This transparency is the complete opposite of pretty much everything else in medicine Most patients and doctors have no idea what things cost They have no idea what a copay coinsurance or deductible is Do any of you know Most people have no idea what things cost until after they receive a bill Sometimes going to CVS as opposed to Walgreens can save a patient hundreds of dollars or vice versa Patients really have no way of knowing without diving deeper into things and 70 of patients are not aware of this Again the complete opposite of GoodRx In addition to the discounted drug costs GoodRx has now expanded its platform to include an EHR electronic health record and telehealth services seeing patients via a computer monitor EHRs are the standard of care now and are pretty much mandated by government legislation as you can be penalized for using paper charts Telehealth came to the forefront during COVID but is now here to stay I love it as do most of my patients It s convenient efficient and easy GoodRx telehealth visits are offered on a cash basis across all 50 states and can be as low as 19 a visit GoodRx also has the Telehealth Marketplace an online marketplace for individuals to access third party providers of telehealth and lab tests Fees are earned for directing traffic to these third parties from the marketplace GoodRx also announced a partnership with Sanofi to deliver insulin discounts directly to customers As of December 31 2020 GoodRx held 9 registered trademarks in the United States including trademarks for their brand GoodRx and for the use of the color yellow In my opinion bright yellow is the color to use to grab the most attention I use the same color in marketing my medical practice In both 2019 and 2020 the Los Angeles Business Journal rated GoodRx as one of the Best Places to Work In 2020 GoodRx was also named as the Best Company Culture Best Companies for Women Best Companies for Diversity and Best CEOs by Comparably a workplace culture data and ratings service How about the fundamentals amp x200B The market opportunity for GoodRx is estimated to be approximately 800 billion This includes a 524 billion prescription opportunity a 30 billion pharmaceutical manufacturer solutions opportunity and a 250 billion telehealth opportunity GoodRx has been growing revenue and generating cash uninterrupted since long before it went public last year Growth has trended sharply higher Monthly active consumers have consistently increased year over year from 700 000 in 2016 to 5 700 000 in 2020 Revenue has

the largest shareholders of GoodRx just purchased over 450 000 shares in the low 30 range in late May 2021 Conventional wisdom says that insiders really only buy shares if they believe the stock price will rise This can be an encouraging signal What are the negatives GoodRx has a short interest of about 25 That s one reason why the stock is about 50 off of its 52 week high Some traders especially on here like this SI One main concern is that Amazon has entered the pharmacy realm and is trying to grow its pharmacy delivery business The problem for Amazon is that mail order prescriptions only make up about 5 of the fill count in the U S Even through COVID mail has remained a small piece of overall volume and is now actually starting to decrease as COVID eases Third party data indicates that Amazon Pharmacy is not gaining momentum and that its volume remains incredibly small GoodRx is cheaper at mail about 90 of the time and offers a lower price at retail almost 100 of the time Mail order pharmacy is difficult and has failed in the past The company is facing a lawsuit for not disclosing that Amazon is a competitor This was recently announced and what is temporarily pressuring the stock down To me this has created an optimal buying time and is small change in the long run What are the analysts saying amp x200B Credit Suisse has GoodRx rated as Maintain Outperform and expects growth for the company to accelerate in the second half of 2021 Barclays and Raymond James maintained a hold rating on the stock TipRanks has 11 ranked security analysts included in the consensus and

with data on WSB discussion for the past couple years which some of you may be familiar with through the bar chart races I would occasionally post Someone recently did an interesting piece of analysis with the data that I ve been collecting and I wanted to share that on here as well Credit for the write up goes to Romain Cece at Alquant although slight alterations were made on my part when transcribing it to Reddit Note that my intention in sharing this strategy is not to recommend it as a viable strategy going forward but simply to provide a look at how you might have performed over the last couple years if you had only traded based off what s being talked about on here Introduction WallStreetBets WSB is a famous subreddit where participants focus on trading stocks and options It became particularly notorious in late January 2021 for being the originator of the GameStop short squeeze now also known as the Mother Of All Short Squeezes MOASS In the end WSB was declared the winner of the battle and it appears that the WSB community will continue to have a real influence on the stock market in the future This leads to a series of questions that we wanted to answer quantitatively Does this atypical population of investors have a particular ability to predict the markets If so is it possible to create relatively simple investment strategies that outperform the stock market Execution For this analysis we used data provided by Quiver Quantitative which aggregated the number of mentions and the overall sentiment of the WSB community for each stock on a daily basis through NLP The stock universe considered is the Russell 3000 Index A sample of this dataset is displayed below amp x200B Ticker mentions aggregated by week https preview redd it 0gyl4549rv971 png width 766 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 788655bf6bc18c9b27db2115c325e02748d760d7 For this first article we chose to focus on the number of mentions Indeed a high number of mentions could reflect an enthusiasm that could improve the performance of a title First a brief qualitative analysis of the data allows us to keep a global view on this new type of time series without getting lost in the details In the graph of the evolution of the total number of daily mentions see below we can easily distinguish two periods with different regimes with a transition from one to the other around March 2020 Indeed the average daily mentions between August 2018 and February 2020 is about 360 and is multiplied by 10 in the following period We can therefore assume that the influence of these mentions will be amplified in this second period Mention counts https preview redd it dx7zn09brv971 png width 2428 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 87b966754d2c8c70413e6e5dfb50d0e749097fa4 What to do with these observations Let s try to focus on timing We can assume that for a given stock the number of mentions is predictive of its future performance Let s do the test with a sample of stocks Since the objective is not to develop a rigorous strategy for the moment we will focus on general statistical observations We independently selected 1000 stocks from the Quiver dataset and applied a simple strategy if the number of mentions on this stock is higher than its 50th expanding quantile it means that the stock is particularly mentioned and we buy it If not we keep our capital in cash The result is clear the returns offered by this strategy are higher than those of the stock in only 19 4 of cases As for the Sharpe ratio it is higher than the stock in only 35 2 of the cases We came to the conclusion that the number of mentions of a stock taken as an indicator has no obvious explicit timing quality for that stock An example of such a strategy applied to a stock DIS can be seen below Disney strategy https preview redd it bqetqgzcrv971 png width 2428 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 2f5ae80fa7c4404091f54c45b70eaa295d29a49b However another angle of approach remains intact It is the selection of stocks Intuitively it would be interesting to select the stocks that appear the most in the subreddit These stocks are the ones that are most likely to be influenced by these investors as they centralize more attention Following this belief we have backtested a stock selection portfolio rebalanced every month Each month we select 10 stocks from the Russell 3000 Index that had the most mentions in the previous month We combine them into an equally weighted long portfolio until the following month The backtest period runs from September 2018 to June 2021 To evaluate the performance of this strategy we computed a simulation of 1000 portfolios selecting monthly 10 random stocks from the same universe and computed the 95th percentile of statistical metrics to compare to our tested strategy Strategy performance https preview redd it 72kddznfrv971 png width 2428 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e718c352ebdc6d670c4c8ec6c50af8b9c0dbb49a Performance stats https preview

but also has a Sharpe ratio in the top 5 of our random simulations The main advantage of this WSB portfolio remains the absolute returns which are much higher than those of our best random portfolios We also observe that in the second half of the backtest characterized by a higher number of mentions the outperformance becomes more significant and striking Let s evaluate this sentiment with a graph of the relative performance of our strategy versus the performance of the SPY This graph supports the first hypothesis made from the graph showing the evolution of the total number of mentions It helps reinforce the impression that stocks with a high number of mentions are more likely to peak in the short to medium term We ll explore other approaches to investment strategies in future articles and see if the WSB sentiment also contains valuable information Stay tuned Endnote The same backtest was calculated with a voluntary exclusion of AMC and GME stocks to assess how the strategy s performance depended on these two very specific stocks The chart below shows that even with reduced returns the strategy still significantly outperforms SPY GME AMC exclusion https preview redd it
