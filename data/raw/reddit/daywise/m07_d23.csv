have all read that it is not COVID s effect on people it is how businesses and governments react with restrictions that effects stocks Bored of this heard it too many times Not scared any more Well the virus and variants didn t get bored Reviewing the top five economies and their case trends Source Worldometers info USA new cases curving upward especially in FL China they lie about their numbers Japan new cases increasing at a roughly linear rate Germany new cases growing again though off of a low base France new cases surging and strong in the numbers curving up UK new cases surged though showing signs of starting to drop Keeping your elder family members safe from your infecting them is still a cultural truth One political party in a given country wants to make another fail One party will weaponize the virus and threaten the other to take action This is what leads to restrictions Before it was the Democrats shutting down businesses to make the economy worse for Republicans Now it is the same but Repub states will shut down and Dem states will want to keep businesses open In another country similar games will play out So all the potential economic shut downs are still there What is different is that all the technology that was bought to have the kids educate from home such as tablets and web cams and online meeting subscriptions don t need to be bought a second time so soon So the 2nd set of restrictions on the population comes without a sector that gets an economic boost The exception is grocery stores and online shopping The extra unemployment benefits end on Sept 6th in numerous states but investors know that and would sell effected stocks sooner The moratorium on evictions ends this fall and so tenants will stop the games and scramble to pay their landlords taking away their spending money If they don t they will get an eviction on their credit record Now to valuations https www multpl com shiller pe https www multpl com shiller pe shows that the Schiller PE ratio of stocks is 38 3 The com bubble was the highest it ever got higher than this level for 2 5 years and getting to the mid 40 s Other then that at no time in history was this valuation ratio this high Note also that in 1982 at the peak of interest rates 13 to 14 the average stock had a PE of 7 to 9 A book by O Shoughnessy What Works on Wall Street studied 40 years of stock market data Its results shows that a price to sales ratio is the king of value factors since sales can t be manipulated like earnings can https www multpl com s p 500 price to sales https www multpl com s p 500 price to sales shows that this valuation is higher now than at any time charted The book suggests that a price to sales of 1 5 is considered a good deal We are over twice that level on average The market breadth has eroded under the mega techs Not the Russel 2000 declined recently Here are the price to sales of the mega techs using data at Reuters This can be hard to find in navigation but a direct link will help for example https www reuters com companies MSFT N https www reuters com companies MSFT N use N and O at the end of the symbol for NYSE and NASDAQ price to sales MSFT 13 3 FB 10 4 AAPL 7 5 AMZN 4 3 GOOG 8 76 NVDA 25 2 AMD 9 5 These clearly can fall and still be overvalued Some have sighted the growth in the money supply such as M2 as part of what has pushed the market higher However it is important to note that M2 was recategorized in 2020 So even though you can go to the Mises Institute s site and see articles of big increases in the M2 money supply much of that is due to the recategorization and strangely the articles omit this but for a footnote Inflation A large part of what we pretend to understand about inflation is the CPI and PCE We think that we know that the last CPI reading was 5 4 That is above the target of 2 of course when action by the recipe is needed This coupled with Powell not wanting to raise rates and desiring to de prioritize inflation is bad enough from a stock perspective Jim Cramer described Powell as having a heart in wanting to prioritize helping people back to work Recall that interest rates have to be jacked up in response to inflation eventually Acting to late makes it worse From business school texts higher interest rates put downward pressure on the value of future earnings Thus the forward looking value of stocks drops But I challenge all of you to take the CPI by its percentage components and REBUILD it yourself with online research I did While the published number was 1 6 year over year at the time I found no component less than 2 and most were a good deal higher It is easy to find information showing education expenses rising at a 5 annual rate for many years Medical costs I found web sites saying 4 annually consistantly over many years At the time only oil was lower than 2 price growth Today with oil back up above 70 a barrel that is not to be taken lightly Recently the Fed has emphasized the PCE the Personal Consumption Expendatures index Do you find as I do it strange that they publish the this month vs last month number making it look like small 0 1 to 0 3 rise and not the more useful year over year number which would show a larger increase The National Debt takes no small part in the desire to have inflation be low and keep interest rates low But that combination is impossible over time I have been at individual stock investing since 1996 and I have sold most of my stock holdings I lived through the com crash which I took on the chin with small dollars since I was young and I learned from it such that I was 66 in cash for the crash of 2008 If you have not been in the habit of thinking about economic impacts valuations and questioning what real inflation is it is certainly time to start The great bull market of the 1980 s in the USA was spurred by the acceleration of women entering the work force and the personal computer The great bull market of the 1990 s was spurred by implementation of the internet immigration and foreign economies developing What is the story now 5G networking is just a faster version of the same thing but only over shorter distances Artificial intelligence is intended to replace humans Electric vehicles only reduce pollution after 100k miles according to an article in the WSJ I think to move on to much higher valuations we need a big economic story that just isn t there right now

input here poke holes and share your thoughts Company I will keep it short and sweet we all know Under Armour UAA is in the top 3 list of athletic brands in the world In late 2020 actually surpassing Adidas and becoming the second largest athletic brand in the world after Nike Baltimore based Under Armour had U S apparel and footwear sales of 1 2 billion through the end of August edging ahead of Adidas with 1 1 billion total U S sales according to a Sterne Agee report Friday citing sales figures from SportScanInfo Under Armour sales have jumped 20 percent this year while Adidas combined sales have plummeted 23 percent Under Armour s original business model was a quality over quantity approach selling large amounts of inventory to discounted retailers cutting their margins short UAA was not doing too well in the 2017 2019 span gross margins lowered down to the 45 to 46 range Under Armour used 2020 to their advantage and began the reconstruction of the company the company devised a multi pronged approach that includes broadening its appeal in popular categories like running relaunching an improved North American digital channel implementing supply constraints to better align distribution with demand and a 550 million restructuring program Although sales growth did not see much change during the 2020 Covid pandemic for obvious reasons gross margins returned to 49 which was a sign that the comeback plan was working Now fast forward to their previous earnings on May 4 2021 it was now extremely obvious that the Under Armour turnaround was finally moving With an EPS of 0 16 and revenue of 1 26 billion compared to the 0 04 and 1 12 billion expectations On May 4 2021 Under Armour saw an increase in their North America sales by 32 their ecommerce channel also excelled generating Nike like growth of 69 and to top it all off margins increased to 50 On a two year stack that is skipping over 2020 we re running a better higher quality and more profitable business CEO Patrik Frisk said during the Q1 earnings call in May The retailer now expects full year sales to rise by a high teen percentage rate compared with a previous outlook of a high single digit increase CNBC Consensus BUY AND HOLD Bullish UAA analyst ratings 14 HOLD 12 BUY 1 STRONG BUT 1 SELL PT 24 44 Upside 20 83 Worries Some worries regarding the UAA business model was the lack of presence in China But Under Armour has become a very well positioned company by making huge moves for themselves by reconstructing operations to be more China centric and have a higher expected growth rate in the region UAA continues to build stores in China and management expresses their excitement about the digital process there UAA currently has 10 of revenue from China and it is expected to grow significantly throughout the years Another worry behind Under Armour was the overhang in stock due to poor inventory management Under Armour has begun the solution to this problem by implementing a system that seeks to limit inventory by matching orders with sales Another huge move that will greatly impact their inventory issue is the separation between Under Armour items and discounted retailers This has allowed the average sell price of UAA shoes to outperform and beat Nike shoes according to an article by Market Watch We will see large margin expansion as UAA sees the effects of their exit from 2 000 3 000 discounted retail stores in 2021 and 10 000 stores by 2022 Competitors in the sector Nike Q4 2021 Earnings Expected 0 51 Actual 0 93 Skechers Q2 2021 Earnings Expected 0 49 Actual 0 88 Crocs Q2 2021 earnings Expected 1 52 Actual 2 23 Adidas TBA Retail sector is obviously doing fantastic with some hitting record breaking revenue One of those being Skechers reporting record breaking numbers of expected 0 50 and actual 0 88 and sales of 1 66 billion With these types of numbers UAA is expected to follow suit with record breaking revenue beginning the turn around of the stock price as it s been in a long consolidation period since Feb 2021 Back to school shopping is also projected to hit ATH s in 2021 as kids are finally able to go back to school UAA is a company that will greatly profit from this My expectations In my eyes and according to the price action and market cap Under Armour is extremely vastly undervalued Market cap at less than 10 billion while its biggest competitor Nike has a market cap valued at 258 Billion As mentioned UAA is the second largest athletic brand in the world and it is currently being valued at 1 25 of Nike either Nike is extremely overvalued or Under Armour is extremely undervalued A fair valuation should be anywhere between a 14 billion and 25 billion dollar market cap for UAA With this type of market value it is obvious that we are still early and there s a lot of upside to look forward to Under Armour has lots going for it and not to mention that they became the first athletic company in history to create spacesuits and for them to actually be used in space via their partnership with Virgin Galactic SPCE I see UAA capitalizing off this opportunity in the space sector and perhaps creating more partnerships strengthening their balance sheet even more I expect Under Armour to provide record breaking earnings on Aug 3 2021 With great guidance as well

against the Coming Market Crash ,So as I ve noted in some of my earlier posts on the wave of warning signs in the market there s some weird stuff going on with the options chain for the HYG ETF HYG is an ETF of Junk Bonds bonds rated BB or lower But until I really dug into it I didn t realize just how weird this activity is Between 7 23 2021 and 1 21 2022 there are 3 790 802 puts in open interest on HYG To really put how big this number is in perspective this is more than the total volume of Puts AND Calls open interest on SPY the single most option traded ETF in the market What makes this even more odd is that HYG doesn t really move It s so stable it makes AT amp T look volatile During the COVID crash it dropped all the way from 88 40 to a low of 69 90 Today it closed at 87 78 In addition to the current 3 8 million put options open on HYG another 2 million just expired in the last few weeks Again there is NOTHING like this anywhere else on the market on anything Inverse ETF s both leveraged and unleveraged have at most a couple hundred thousand options open over the next couple of months So again what is are these MILLIONS of put options which cost BILLIONS of dollars to open doing on an index that doesn t move Now you could argue these are puts against the end of the Fed s Junk Bond buying program except that s largely ended now and yet more put options are still being opened So here s what I think is happening and I ve narrowed it down to two options 1 Fuckery is afoot and this is tied to some kind of bullshit undisclosed swaps in an epic pile of risked out dipshittery that s impressive even for Wall Street 2 It s a hedge against an expected market crash caused by inflation and rates going up way way sooner than anyone expects If it s number 1 well we won t know about the details until someone gets a little to close to the edge on a coke binge and decides to do a tell all come to Jesus and repent their sins bit So lets talk about number 2 cause that s way more interesting HYG is made up of junk debt It pays a high yield because it s shit and it s likely to go bust So anyone chasing bond yields this is the place to go And for awhile now it s been way way safer than it actually should be because rates are so low that even the idiots who ran their companies into the ground to the point where they re issuing junk rated debt can still borrow enough to keep the lights on and pay themselves more bonuses This type of bond market is further secured by the Fed deciding to buy it up like a priest on an altar boy shopping spree in an orphanage And lets be clear because there has been so so so much bad cheap debt floating around for so long there are a TON of really bad companies that should have gone bust YEARS ago just stumbling along as zombies financed and kept afloat much more by cheap and easy credit and inertia than anything else Well inflation is starting to be felt and no matter what JPow says it s not fucking transitory We just had a year that exposed just how much of America is actually complete bullshit and folks are really goddamn unhappy about going back to the status quo of things sucking way more than they need to So there s a labor shortage now and people are getting raises That increases costs and prices are going up to offset that Wage increases are sticky as fuck and so are price increases I know I m not taking less at work tomorrow and I m guessing most of you degenerates aren t either And your boss damn sure isn t going to cut prices after he raised them if his costs drop In economic terms we call these types of increases Sticky because once they happen they tend to stick around They re running out of ways to game the inflation rate as is housing school and medical costs are already out I expect cars to get the boot next but after that they re just looking at food and water So far this year every month has had a higher inflation number than the one before August will probably be over 6 and remember that s just the official number the prices everyone is seeing out in the wild have gone up even more than that So if interest rates get even a small nudge upwards all of a sudden all that junk debt starts to get a lot harder to roll over and starts costing a lot more to a bunch of companies that can t afford to pay it When that happens all of a sudden all that junk debt becomes worthless and HYG crashes hard into the ground And again you really need to look at the incredibly large scale of the put volume on HYG This isn t one or even a dozen funds buying up millions of options It s the entire goddamn street I still like next month August for things to finally fall apart for a lot of reasons It looks like they re really going to let the eviction moratorium end next Saturday and there are a lot of landlords with the papers lined up and ready to go That won t be something that can be fixed once folks are out of the houses and apartments I m assuming the annual debt ceiling dance gets a good solid can kicking so everyone can get the fuck out of DC but both parties are so senile corrupt and incompetent that I suppose anything is possible Congress and basically all of DC goes on vacation in August which means any kind of crisis gets to run a fair bit longer before they can even think about doing anything about it I m assuming the annual debt ceiling dance gets a good solid can kicking so everyone can get the fuck out of DC but both parties are so senile corrupt and incompetent that I suppose anything is possible Volume has basically disappeared on the meme stocks they re coiled up and waiting for a catalyst to explode like a lifted leaf spring through the bed of an old pickup Finally we have what happened this Monday as an example of just how quickly the market can run out of collateral That s what Monday was about a liquidity fueled run on collateral It s why the 10 year T bill rate went so low and has continued to drop It s why gold continues to be so fucky No one knows just how much bad debt is out there but people know it s a fucking lot and puts on HYG appear to be the way the entire Street is hedging against both it and a rise in rates from inflation Again 3 8 million puts One fund might have a couple thousand Millions That s friggin everybody Finally market crashes even when they re screaming obvious that one is coming always take longer to materialize than anyone expects for the simple reason that they re horrifying and involve untold amounts of pain and suffering Literally nobody except the bears betting on it actually wants to see one happen so there s way more incentive to keep the party going even when it s clearly over and sad and you can see the sun coming up because realizing you have to get up and go to work in 2 hours is just an awful thing to contemplate TL DR The entire street is spending billions of dollars betting the junk bond market dies and lots of companies go boom boom in the bad way Positions Hell I don t know go along with the crowd and buy some puts on HYG I guess or go ask your wife s boyfriend or the guy in the helmet that sits next to you on the shortbus Personally I m long meme stocks and inverse ETFs Burry Buffett and Goldman have all pulled back significantly from the market in the last quarter or are betting on it to drop in various ways I think it happens in August I like the 23rd personally the chances I m actually calling it perfectly are infinitesimal but like I noted before it might happen later Or tomorrow Make up your own minds But when it hits its going to be more 29 than 08 or 00 Finally if you re going to invest like a bear in a cave waiting for a market crash you need to understand how that works You hold a lot of cash and take your positions then you sit there and wait slowly losing money every day and holding while everyone tells you you re an idiot until you get real rich real fast all at once Good luck out there

just say that Robinhood has seen better days A vast majority of us absolutely hate Robinhood right now I feel that it s justified given the blatant disregard they had for retail investors during the GME saga Adding to this most of their revenue is driven by the extremely controversial Payment for Order Flow PFOF which is currently in the focus of SEC But rational investors do not reject a company completely based on how they feel about the company s business practices In an ideal world capital allocation happens based on alignment with the mission statement and practices of the company but there s more than one way to make a profit in the market There are plenty of examples of companies doing extremely well even though they have been in the continuous focus of public ire and legal issues Think Nestle with their dubious practices BAC after the Occupy Wall Street movement EA with their micro transactions and Amazon with worker abuse And for all the hate Robinhood gets and posts about moving out of Robinhood just sort the gain loss yolo posts for the last month in any investing subreddit and you can still see a significant chunk of trades being made through Robinhood You can choose to not use their product but it s not financially prudent to reject an investment opportunity without due diligence All the DDs that I have seen exclusively focus on the negative aspects and then reject the IPO and I think that s unfair Especially given that over the past 20 years 69 of IPO s have gained value on listing day with an average increase of 12 https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments ny6wpp i analyzed 3600 ipos over the past two decades to That s a 12 average gain in just one day Basically what I wanted to know was this Is Robinhood IPO a good investment

approximately doubling the funded user base every year The current retail frenzy only pushed up this growth rate Adding to this 80 of the users who joined them in 2020 were through word of mouth and Robinhood Referral which enabled them to grow organically We don t have enough data to tell how this has changed following the GME scandal but the one thing we can be sure of is that people are

profitable in 2020 before having a 1 4B net loss in Q1 21 due in part to a 1 5B fair value adjustment to convertible notes and warrant liability Product It s undeniable that they have a very well designed product suite It makes it very easy for first time investors to invest in stocks this is also reflected in their user base with more than 50 of them being first time investors The Robinhood gold monthly subscription program currently has more than 1 4 MM customers Adding to this their rypto cash management and educational solution combine to create a well suited ecosystem for first time

52e1b83a70ececce4283513e39f5521d764dbd14 The Bad Revenue Stability Robinhood s income is highly dependent on retail investors getting into the riskiest investments Options ryptos and Margin This would be extremely dependent on a highly volatile market that we saw over the past year Once if this settles down the revenue stream is bound to reduce This in itself would generate a conflict of interest with Robinhood actively encouraging this risk taking in the user interface through dark patterns and gamifying the experience https www nytimes com 2020 07 08 technology robinhood risky trading html Competition Almost all the major competitors who used to charge a per transaction trading fee have now cut down their commission to zero https money usnews com investing portfolio management articles brokers that offer commission free trading While this might not be the only USP of Robinhood for a new investor coming into the trading ecosystem Robinhood is not a compelling choice given the controversies surrounding them The only thing they have going for them with regards to competition is an exceptional user interface which again is subjective to the user Valuation According to the updated prospectus https www sec gov Archives edgar data 0001783879 000162828021013986 robinhoods 1a1 htm Robinhood is aiming for an initial price target of 38 42 a share which would value the firm at 27 35 Billion The company expects to raise around 2 2 Billion from this IPO While a high valuation is not unlikely for a tech company HOOD is potentially valued now at 37x historical FY 2020 Price to Sales or P S This when compared to Charles Schwab 10 8x and Tiger brokers 20 1x is on the higher side Most probably the justification for such a high valuation is their current trajectory of customer growth and the average age of the customer younger customers tend to be more valuable over the long run The Ugly Payment For Order Flow PFOF and Regulatory Risks 2 Ahh finally we come to the most controversial part of Robinhood The irony here is that PFOF was invented by Bernie Madoff If you want a detailed understanding of PFOF you can read it here https www investopedia com terms p

the major players except Fidelity have some amount of revenue coming in from PFOF and this is not necessarily a bad thing From my understanding this actually benefits the retail investor by moving the cost of the transaction from the user to the market maker But the main concern for Robinhood here is the amount of revenue they are generating from PFOF https preview redd it se7aogbpiwc71 png width

for TD Ameritrade https dashboards trefis com data companies AMTD no login required 0P4oc9vg TD Ameritrade Revenues How Does Ameritrade Make Money and Charles Schwab Adding to the high risk of having more than 80 of revenue from one source Robinhood has been repeatedly fined for not having the customer s best interest in mind FINRA fined HOOD 1 25M in 2019 for not getting customers the best prices FINRA announced that Robinhood would pay a record 70M in fines and restitution over the outages and Robinhood agreed to the settlement They are facing more than 90 lawsuits after the GameStop trading halt https www cnbc com 2021 02 17 robinhood faces lawsuits after gamestop trading halt html Finally SEC chairman Gary Gensler has said that not every country allows PFOF and they are going to take a closer look into PFOF Conclusion Robinhood started off with an extremely promising idea and then dropped the ball at its most important moment Undoubtedly they are going to report a blowout Q2 earnings report shortly following the listing and the stock is going to pump They would have made a killing with the Dog coin rally in April and May and other meme stock rallies such as AMC CLOV in Q2 21 Another interesting insight that we could make from their Q2 report when it s announced is if they had any net user attrition following the scandal The age old saying of any publicity is good publicity would be put to test If they still maintained their growth story with AUM and active user base increasing consistently that would be impressive and we would know that the investor sentiment that we are seeing now is not actually translating to lost business We might need to re evaluate this analysis once the IPO is over and they have announced their Q2 report and the market has settled

and helpful as possible Many of you may consider me a shill because I do not share all your opinions and or urge you to hold AMC until the stock reaches some non sensical price target That is fine But I am definitely not a shill per the actual definition of the word in that I am not an accomplice to anyone I invest money for a living and have run my own investment fund for over a decade It s not a huge hedge fund like Citadel but I have outside investors I also have a lot of my own money in my investment fund I have no special agenda other than making money for myself and my investors I also do

to make money and have recently invested based on this diligence Specifically I am long AMC puts The AMC Short Squeeze is Over I joined Reddit during the GME short squeeze To be sure it was a great way to make money GME had over 100 short interest when Ryan Cohen joined the Board so it appeared to many that the short squeeze was going to happen Good for everyone that saw it early The GME short squeeze really did happen GameStop traded to over 450 per share Then the squeeze abruptly came to an end when GME s short interest declined to less than 10 of shares outstanding Stock borrow rates collapsed in tandem The stock dropped to 40 per share and the short squeeze was over As many of you put it the squeeze was squoze That part of the trade had concluded AMC also experienced a squeeze or more accurately the perception that a squeeze could happen Rapid and sustained buying caused share volumes to explode and the stock price to appreciate quickly we think this may have been ignited by unusually large call option buying Hedge funds who were short needed to post 5 10x the collateral previously required to hold a short AMC position Buyers including and maybe especially retail traders continued to overwhelm sellers As that occurred at the end of May and early June AMC shares ran up to 72 per share Wave after wave of retail buyer piled in hoping to make life changing money Some did The problem is the squeeze or more accurately the perception of the squeeze ended and now the stock is drifting lower every day The amount of AMC shares short relative to its market cap and trading volume has never been that high and is currently declining https preview redd it m6iu3e0upzc71 png width 458 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 21959f61f637d45a78f21b00118432b537bf3a14 Borrow rates are consequently diminishing as well shorting doesn t cost that much anymore less than 2 per year and there is plenty of borrow available If you need to cover your short you can do so pretty easily For example if you re short 1 million shares you can cover that before breakfast with recent trading volumes and it wouldn t move the stock at all Remember covering a short is simply buying shares in the market at the prevailing price AMC trades over 50 million shares a day People keep yelling they have to cover Or we own the float Both of those things are true But when someone wants to cover they don t need to ask for everyone s permission They just need to buy stock in the market at the current price much like people in this community buy stock every single day from people that are selling it

small size relative to the size of their funds In other words most are assuming over 200 price appreciation in their downside scenarios and have plenty of collateral in reserve to place against the short position they are maintaining if the short goes against them For all intents and purposes they can hold these short positions forever This is not a recipe for a short squeeze AMC is not GameStop After the GME squeeze ended GameStop continued transforming itself GameStop raised a ton of cash 500 million in April paid down all its debt and then raised even more cash 1 billion in June In the midst of cleaning up its capital structure Ryan Cohen hired an experienced team of top notch managers GameStop current market cap 14 5 billion now has a real shot at becoming a successful niche online retailer of gaming accessories and related products that competes effectively against Amazon Investors are now betting that Ryan Cohen can make GameStop as successful as his last company Chewy current market cap 35 billion Chewy captured market share from Amazon and others in the pet food and accessories market on its way to becoming a very large and thriving business Investors hope GameStop will do the same against Amazon Best Buy and others The value reflected in GameStop s current market cap is driven mostly by an optimistic bet on this transformation The gamble on the short squeeze is over GME is trading fairly rationally right now maybe a little expensive considering the road to 35 billion is going to be really bumpy GameStop s valuation is not completely detached from reality in that GameStop has a good chance at succeeding AMC on the other hand has traded from the realm of the improbable into the universe of the impossible AMC is stuck with its old management team and is pursuing the same tired strategy of trying to get people to fill theaters even though every content provider including video game producers are pushing consumers to enjoy and participate in content at home AMC does not have Ryan Cohen It has Adam Aaron who is struggling to steer AMC through 5 billion in debt and growing rent obligations With this debt burden and with zero history of being an entrepreneurial visionary like Ryan Cohen Adam Aaron will not be able to attract the kind of talent Ryan Cohen can recruit Consequently AMC doesn t have a shot at competing against Disney Netflix Amazon and every other streamer AA s only hope is to cynically appeal to apes so that you keep buying his stock My bet is that he s going to have to deliver a lot more than free popcorn to keep people buying But

collapsed in tandem The stock dropped to 40 per share and the short squeeze was over As many of you put it the squeeze was squoze That part of the trade had concluded AMC also experienced a squeeze or more accurately the perception that a squeeze could happen Rapid and sustained buying caused share volumes to explode and the stock price to appreciate quickly we think this may have been ignited by unusually large call option buying Hedge funds who were short needed to post 5 10x the collateral previously required to hold a short AMC position Buyers including and maybe especially retail traders continued to overwhelm sellers As that occurred at the end of May and early June AMC shares ran up to 72 per share Wave after wave of retail buyer piled in hoping to make life changing money Some did The problem is the squeeze or more accurately the perception of the squeeze ended and now the stock is drifting lower every day The amount of AMC shares short relative to its market cap and trading volume has never been that high and is currently declining amp x200B https preview redd it mg1zhbe1rzc71 png width 458 amp format png amp auto webp amp s a1f99ece6701af0578549be06ce95328c12f3165 Borrow rates are consequently diminishing as well shorting doesn t cost that much anymore less than 2 per year and there is plenty of borrow available If you need to cover your short you can do so pretty easily For example if you re short 1 million shares you can cover that before breakfast with recent trading volumes and it wouldn t move the stock at all Remember covering a short is simply buying shares in the market at the prevailing price AMC trades over 50 million shares a day People keep yelling they have to cover Or we own the float Both of those things are true But when someone wants to cover they don t need to ask for everyone s permission They just need to buy stock in the market at the current price much like people in this community buy stock every single day from people that are selling it That s how it works amp x200B https preview redd it 1to80t22rzc71 png width 458 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 3846906621dce8263b3f8a2c0ddb0b461069a5df Finally hedge funds that are short AMC are doing so in small size relative to the size of their funds In other words most are assuming over 200 price appreciation in their downside scenarios and have plenty of collateral in reserve to place against the short position they are maintaining if the short goes against them For all intents and purposes they can hold these short positions forever This is not a recipe for a short squeeze AMC is not GameStop After the GME squeeze ended GameStop continued transforming itself GameStop raised a ton of cash 500 million in April paid down all its debt and then raised even more cash 1 billion in June In the midst of cleaning up its capital structure Ryan Cohen hired an experienced team of top notch managers GameStop current market cap 14 5 billion now has a real shot at becoming a successful niche online retailer of gaming accessories and related products that competes effectively against Amazon Investors are now betting that Ryan Cohen can make GameStop as successful as his last company Chewy current market cap 35 billion Chewy captured market share from Amazon and others in the pet food and accessories market on its way to becoming a very large and thriving business Investors hope GameStop will do the same against Amazon Best Buy and others The value reflected in GameStop s current market cap is driven mostly by an optimistic bet on this transformation The gamble on the short squeeze is over GME is trading fairly rationally right now maybe a little expensive considering the road to 35 billion is going to be really bumpy GameStop s valuation is not completely detached from reality in that GameStop has a good chance at succeeding AMC on the other hand has traded from the realm of the improbable into the universe of the impossible AMC is stuck with its old management team and is pursuing the same tired strategy of trying to get people to fill theaters even though every content provider including video game producers are pushing consumers to enjoy and participate in content at home AMC does not have Ryan Cohen It has Adam Aaron who is struggling to steer AMC through 5 billion in debt and growing rent obligations With this debt burden and with zero history of being an entrepreneurial visionary like Ryan Cohen Adam Aaron will not be able to attract the kind of talent Ryan Cohen can recruit Consequently AMC doesn t have a shot at competing against Disney Netflix Amazon and every other streamer AA s only hope is to cynically appeal to apes so that you keep buying his stock My bet is that he s going to have to deliver a lot more than free popcorn to keep people buying But enough of my opinions Here are the facts amp x200B https preview redd it fv4sfkx2rzc71 png width 507 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

retard to a low functioning Autist Here s a breakdown of my port to give you a starting point from someone who used to be just like you ,Disclaimer This is not financial advice and you shouldn t assume that I have any idea what I m actually talking about amp x200B About Me I am a former GME ape who managed to turn 5k into 30k back in January without having any idea what I was actually doing Over the next 5 month s I had varying levels of success with other Yolo plays At 3 different points I hit 60k 65K and 55k but those highs were separated by lows of 28K 32K 42K By the middle of May I had enough of this roller coaster and developed a trading strat that I felt leveraged my desire for big gains with my desire to protect my fucking money Note that these numbers are max potential values You don t need to have all your cash in the market at once amp x200B 1 The Boring Shit ETFS 60 I get it when you had 5000 the concept of putting half of that in an ETF and letting it grow slowly over time had absolutely zero appeal Turning 2500 into 2650 over a three month period does absolutely nothing for you That s money that could go into a play that could have exponentially more upside You re chasing the dream It can be hard to get out of that mindset later it s only after you have gained and lost something substantial that you start to understand the appeal of safe investments like ETFs amp x200B How I distribute that capital amongst ETFs is as follows SPY 20 SPY is the market benchmark When we are in a seemingly never ending bull market it just makes sense to have some of your portfolio move along with it I set a trailing stop loss at 2 My logic for that number is as follows at 1 you could cash out on a small dip and could miss out on the potential upside when it goes back up A 2 drop is much more likely to be a part of a much more significant correction In that case there is a much higher chance that I can simply buy back in further down the dip Alternatively a 3 trailing stop loss would reduce the risk of me cashing out on a smaller correction and missing the desired entry point back in but would limit my ability to capitalize on the dip in price QQQ 60 I heavily concentrate into QQQ because it better represents the Tech Growth market than the SPY When I realized nearly every company I was very bullish on fell under this umbrella I decided it was better to invest a chunk of my capital into QQQ rather than opening long positions on like 5 different tech companies Trailing Stop loss 2 for the same reasons listed above amp x200B The other 30 I distribute between ETFs in other market sectors that I believe are poised to do well For Example I am invested in BETZ because I am bullish on the gambling sector COMB because I am bullish on Commodities and IPO so I stand to gain from IPOs without having to speculate on companies that haven t yet entered the market When applicable I wheel these shares with CCs at fairly conservative strikes for a slow drip of premiums while I hold If options aren t available it s 2 TSL amp x200B LEAPS 20 I use leaps to maximize potential returns on my long positions more efficiently than shares but less risky than shorter term calls I cap these plays at 10 20 of my total capital When searching for a company to go long on I have a few parameters I always follow 1 Only one company per market sector These plays are inherently plays that are trying to beat the market I pick a market sector I am bullish on and do basic fundamental and technical analysis on a variety of stocks I try to identify a potential growth play as well as a potential value play 2 Only open positions at entry points based on technical analysis Now I m not going to try and fool anyone and say that my TA is always perfect but being consistent with how I choose how to enter at least gives me a consistent data set to build off of If the conditions are never met for entry I simply continue to wait or don t open the position There s no rush to throw all your money in right away there s nothing worse than finding a great potential play but having your capital locked up in a shitty meme play you opened 3 Always keep an 80 20 ratio between value and growth plays Value plays have inherently less risk than growth plays long term as such keeping this segment of my port heavily skewed towards value lowers my overall risk level to some degree Value plays are usually slower more consistent winners making selling calls on top of the LEAPS a viable strategy with significantly less risk of unrealized gains than trying to PMCC a growth play Another benefit to this is that it makes me be significantly pickier with whatever growth plays I choose to invest in 4 Never over leverage on a Long Position I never put more than 6 of my capital into any one play This seemed counter intuitive to me at first especially since my first 4 months of investing I was 60 GME at any given time but it allows me the mental freedom to keep an eye on my entire port rather than staring at one chart because I need it to go up amp x200B Theta Plays 15 These plays can consist of a variety of different options strategies that I have learned over the past half a year What plays I choose to enter vary month to month based on the current market conditions Theta plays are nice in that there are many different scenarios in that they can be utilized amp x200B During earnings season I typically sell CSPs one or two weeks out always making sure that I close the position before the earnings date If a meme stock just exploded and IV is through the roof I might open a diagonal call spread in order to leverage the significant difference in theta between weekly and monthly calls with significantly less delta exposure than a typical debit or credit spread Call credit spreads are used on stocks I am bearish on the short term I don t take time to search out bearish plays but if a company I am long on presents a short term bear pattern it makes sense to open a play on that This also helps keep me grounded it becomes easy to want to disregard potential red flags on a stock you are bullish on but if those red flags start looking like dollar signs you will become much more honest in your analysis If a stock I am following has been trading sideways for a long period of time I might open an Iron Condor in order to profit on the fact that that shit don t move The last theta strat I use is 0DTE SPY Put Credit Spreads These can be done three times a week are pretty safe plays as far as day trades go If the SPY has a stable bullish trend line going for the day open the spread right underneath that and close it before 3pm amp x200B SPY Calls 5 Once a retard always a retard There are days like today where you look at the SPY chart and can t help but buy some FDs Obviously this shit is a rare occasion if I did this every week I d eventually run out of money But making sure that I have capital set aside just in case means that I don t have to scramble closing positions in the event a big play presents itself
