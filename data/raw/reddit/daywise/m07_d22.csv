for a few reasons One is that i ve been a SOFI member for several years now Two is that i ve worked in consumer digital banking and investing for about 10 years now In fact i m currently working on taking a digital bank division to market for on of the largest banks in the country Three because I co founded a company that created stock market analytical software for individual investors Four is that i m YOLO and Sofi and could really use some returns that also screws short sellers at the same time so sweet it is Given that quartet of unimpressive credentials I do feel like I have a point of view worth listening to when it comes to SOFI amp x200B I m Yolo on SOFI for the following reasons 1 Rare investment opportunity i ve been investing for a dozen years now and i ll say it is very RARE to find newly public companies that 1 will turn a profit within a few years of going public 2 has incredible growth in revenue and customer base 3 has superstar backers like Chamath and Noto 4 are industry disruptors 5 is part of a very hot industry FinTech 6 has amazing products and features 7 genuinely cares about the well being of their customer base SOFI HAS ALL OF THAT I view SOFI as a near guarantee that if i m patient and wait for 5 years I will 5X my investment at minimum that might happen sooner if you other degenerates get ahold of it The sky is the limit for SOFI They are just getting started and focused on the consumer banking space They can keep expanding and dominating in that space then expand into other areas just like Square They could become more of a lifestyle company rather than a digital bank They could also expand into new markets like Europe and South America This is a bit of speculation but they have the backers leadership brand and success to do this and I think they will They already started to do it with the Galileo acquisition 2 Speed to Market They have an unheard of ability to take digital banking products and features to market QUICKLY Banking products and features are incredibly complex Behind the scenes banks have to adhere to hundreds or regulations and laws and the number of systems and technical capacity you need to take a product to market is massive It takes close coordination between technology operations marketing products governance as well as numerous vendors to get it done right As a bank continue to grow it becomes increasingly more complex because you then have to fit new products into the existing banking ecosystems which means dozens of integrations into other systems and data repositories SOFI takes products to market one after the other after the other It seems like every few months they have a new great product of feature released This speed is insane I m working for one of the largest banks in the country and it has literally taken us over 1 5 years to just take a digital checking account to market and that s the minimum viable product Within a relatively short amount of time SOFI has created a full consumer banking product offering They have personal loans which are a very hot and growing market right now a money management account investment options student loans Home equity loans credit cards and insurance Whether they have built it themselves which is that case for most of their products or partnered with another company to offer it to their customers it is available and the product offering is high quality 3 Differentiation Features Almost every day at work I reference SOFI as the premier example of digital banking features They are just getting started and there s still so much room for opportunity One of the biggest under the radar features that I think is going to pay of in a massive way for SOFI is their rewards program Travel companies have mastered the rewards program game for many years now and other industries are starting to catch on Big banking is far behind with the exception of SOFI and a few others Sure you can go to Chase and get a bonus for creating a checking account but you cant earn points and participate in a rewards PROGRAM and continues to engage you over time It s never before seen in banking and members can get points for various activities like reading articles or just logging in It s brilliant and the program is relatively new so I think it will grow into the best banking rewards program ever Another great feature is Relay which basically tracks net worth and spending This is pretty standard across the industry but it s not easy to do and SOFI has done it well Another is robo investing and self directed investing options I have the robo invested Roth IRA with SOFI and my performance significantly has outperformed the market and i m really happy with the user experience These are just a few examples of dozens of great features that would normally take other banks quarters if not years to take to market SOFI ability to create stickiness among their customer base is top notch and it creates an environment where it would be a rarity for someone to close their relationship and move to another bank 4 Free member benefits and social activities I love this about SOFI They actually CARE about their members financial well being They offer free services like life coaching financial planning and career coaching to their members and host free social events for people to network and have a a great time The social play is going to pay off huge It creates stickiness like I mentioned earlier betters the lives of their members and changes the banking game because no one else does this that I know of I ve taken advantage of these services and i ve been really impressed with the quality and the fact that they are completely free to me 5 Galileo SOFI acquired Galileo outright which is a platform that DOMINATES the banking as a service ecosystem 90 of all digital banks in country use Galileo as well as 70 of the top 100 Fintechs Galileo has major expansion plans into new markets and it is currently experience around 100 growth Think for just a second on if Galileo went public individually Imagine the valuation that it would have given how how the Fintech market is right now I m not going to pretend to be an expert on their offering but the market share domination is impressive BLEND who just announced they have achieved a 4 billion dollar evaluation has nowhere near the market share that Galileo has I can tell with with 1000 confidence that 90 of all digital banks use Blend Comment below how much you think Galileo would be valued at if it went public on it s own Keep in mind SOFI s current valuation is only 13b 6 Catch all for the other reasons other reasons i m bullish on SOFI is the fact that their core product was the student loan offering so the majority of their customer base was acquired in college or right out of college which means SOFI can retain these members for their entire life span and be closely intertwined into their financial journey SOFI is also in the process of obtaining their own banking charter which significantly decreases the cost of doing business Another is their referral program Members are rewarded for referring other members for their entire product offering I alone have referred over 5 people to join SOFI and I literally preach the good word on SOFI on a weekly basis to my network and friends amp x200B To finalize my thoughts I am so damn jazzed about this investment opportunity and I wanted to give you all some insight into my impression of SOFi from working in digital banking and being a SOFI member I hope you all do your own due diligence and if you feel confident about SOFI then I strongly encourage you to trust your gut and play the long game with this one because it will pay off Much love and luck to you all

1 Catalyst New price increase from BofA Securities 26 price target current price as of making this is 17 55 thats over a 50 increase from its current price REAl has an average of 29 15 from 13 banks

don t know the smaller the float the more the stock fluctuates Meaning 20 50 even 100 moves r possible in the matter of days In comparison this is AMC s FYI the float info is from yahoo finance You can check all the info out for yourself in the links below if you re skeptical Almost 6x as big https preview redd it nfkqbdnreoc71 png width 834 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

According to yahoo finance as of June 29th the short percent of float is 22 a huge number considering the size of the float This would equate to nearly 100 short interest on amc if u consider the float of both stocks Ever since these numbers were found the stock has fell over 20 meaning the short interest is probably even higher now I can post ortex numbers if anyone would like but that shit

substantial value creation upside from earnings growth and significant synergies which are under appreciated at current valuation of USD 6bn pro forma enterprise value combined with Mobile Mini In this article we will examine firstly how WillScot is more likely to deliver topline growth and margin expansion much more ahead than market expectations of stagnant growth and secondly how much value of synergies from Mobile Mini merger is overlooked There is estimated over 100 upside from today s valuation over a period of 3 years driven by earnings compounding and synergies First area of value creation comes from good visibility of EBITDA growth compared to no growth scenario currently priced in WllScot with 50 market share in modular space rental combined with Mobile Mini with 40 market share in portable storage services will create unmatched North America leader in both modular space rental and storage market representing close to 50 revenue market share and over 60 of profit share By breaking down its earnings drivers rental rate and average utilization rate are the key variables driving EBITDA growth Rate improvement as well as utilization rate increase would escalate operational leverage impact on the company s profitability outlook For the past 10 quarters WillScot s average monthly rental rate has seen steady increase currently at 10 1 percentage point increase in rental rate would translate into USD 10m increase in EBITDA Rental rate in low teens had been already achieved during previous up cycle of infrastructure spend WillScot is in a good position to continue benefiting from increasing infrastructure CAPEX boosted by low rates and infrastructure bills As for utilization rate WillScot is running at 70s stable utilization rate way under its historical peak at high 80 1 percentage point increase in utilization rate would translate into another USD 10m increase in EBITDA Mobile Mini merger is bringing in cross sell potentials to add new clients resulting in increased utilization rate Given similar size of clientele with limited overlap between WillScot and Mobile Mini utilization rate is more likely to increase overtime In base case assuming 20 rental rate and 85 utilization rate in 3 years WillScot is expected to achieve pro forma EBITDA of USD 900m in FY23E compared to Wall Street estimates of USD 680m in FY23E USD 650m in FY20E Low expectations of mild EBITDA growth priced in for the stock provides attractive risk reward for upside scenario in delivering over 30 organic EBITDA growth Second area of value creation comes from synergies post merger Management of WillScot has estimated USD 50 100m OPEX and CAPEX savings Applying sector standard 9x EV EBITDA below WSC historical 10 12x synergies valuation stands within USD 450 900m range for which current market valuation of the pro forma combined entity has erased during near term market crash due to lockdown At current distressed level market is assuming structural hit to WillScot and Mobile Mini businesses and discounting the fact that the two would generate targeted synergies However reality is showing steady recovery of machinery construction and oil field drilling data which are highly correlated to both WillScot and Mobile Mini and reopening on a fuller scale is more likely to benefit WillScot and Mobile Mini to recover to normalcy Contrary to WSC s ModSpace playbook management expects a lesser degree of synergy opportunity from footprint rationalization with a majority of the near term opportunities coming from IT and back office optimization Similar to ModSpace management sees incremental cost opportunities beyond the announced 50m as the combined company looks to further optimize sourcing procurement and incremental logistics optimization Management also sees a more compelling long term opportunity from cross selling as the combined company looks to go to market with a more holistic portable storage and modular space portfolio Combining the above two key drivers for value creation we can see a favorable roadmap for WillScot to achieve EBITDA over USD 1bn in 3 years Valued at 9x below 10 12x WSC historical EV EBITDA the company could be worth USD 9bn in 3 years deducting USD 2bn target net debt under debt reduction plan supported by USD 500m annual FCF theoretical equity value of the company amounts to USD 7bn compared to today s pro forma USD 3 3bn 118 upside within 3 years

Long Term Bet myth Daily resetting ETFs are often called a poor long term investment https www investopedia com articles financial advisors 082515 why leveraged etfs are not longterm bet asp This is mainly because of volatility decay also called beta decay The most common example I see is that whenever the underlying index drops 10 then gains 10 the next day a leveraged portfolio would lose a lot more value compared to the underlying Underlying 100 gt 90 gt 99 1 loss 3x Leverage 100 gt 70 gt 91 9 loss A 9 loss is not a 3x of 1 loss A plot showing what it means in practice Volatility decay https raw githubusercontent com EivindAamodt Stock Market Leverage Backtests main volatility decay png What is often forgotten is that the daily resetting also helps and serves as protection in some cases Let s take an example where the underlying drops 10 four days in a row Underlying 100 gt 90 gt 81 gt 73 gt 65 35 loss 3x Leverage 100 gt 70 gt 49 gt 35 gt 24 76 loss A 76 loss is a lot less than 3x of 35 loss If it did not reset daily the leveraged portfolio would be wiped out as 35 3 105 loss The same is also true when the underlying increases multiple days in a row Underlying 100 gt 110 gt 121 gt 133 gt 146 46 gain 3x Leverage 100 gt 130 gt 169 gt 220 gt 286 186 gain A 186 gain is a lot better than the expected 46 3 138 gain Backtests from 6months up to 40 years 250 trading days 1 year

squeeze is over Short interest 15 of shares outstanding and borrow rates less than 2 per year have been rapidly declining Most hedge funds that are short AMC are short in small sizes allowing them the ability to hold their short positions indefinitely AMC is not GameStop GameStop is led by a visionary CEO and actually has a viable path towards transforming itself AMC on the other hand is stuck with its old CEO and management team and faces significant revenue cannibalization from home streaming services which has been exacerbated by the pandemic Introductory Disclosure Even though I reference GameStop GME I do not advocate buying shares in GME I also do not hate AMC or think anyone who bought AMC is foolish I have been invested in both stocks With this post I am trying to be as objective and helpful as possible Many of you may consider me a shill because I do not share all your opinions and or urge you to hold AMC until the stock reaches some non sensical price target That is fine But I am definitely not a shill per the actual definition of the word in that I am not an accomplice to anyone I invest money for a living and have run my own investment fund for over a decade It s not a huge hedge fund like Citadel but I have outside investors I also have a lot of my own money in my investment fund I have no special agenda other than making money for myself and my investors I also do not have special access to regulators AMC or other large investment funds including hedge funds short oriented or otherwise I hardly ever speak with other portfolio managers I can t manipulate stocks I wish I could legally of course If you imagine the equity market as every casino in the world maybe Citadel is MGM Resorts and I m just a card shark counting cards at the blackjack table We do a lot of research on our positions I am here to share some of that research for no other reason than I find this community fascinating I like underdogs I often root for them But to be clear I m just trying to make money and have recently invested based on this diligence Specifically I am long AMC puts The AMC Short Squeeze is Over I joined Reddit during the GME short squeeze To be sure it was a great way to make money GME had over 100 short interest when Ryan Cohen joined the Board so it appeared to many that the short squeeze was going to happen Good for everyone that saw it early The GME short squeeze really did happen GameStop traded to over 450 per share Then the squeeze abruptly came to an end when GME s short interest declined to less than 10 of shares outstanding Stock borrow rates collapsed in tandem The stock dropped to 40 per share and the short squeeze was over As many of you put it the squeeze was squoze That part of the trade had concluded AMC also experienced a squeeze or more accurately the perception that a squeeze could happen Rapid and sustained buying caused share volumes to explode and the stock price to appreciate quickly we think this may have been ignited by unusually large call option buying Hedge funds who were short needed to post 5 10x the collateral previously required to hold a short AMC position Buyers including and maybe especially retail traders continued to overwhelm sellers As that occurred at the end of May and early June AMC shares ran up to 72 per share Wave after wave of retail buyer piled in hoping to make life changing money Some did The problem is the squeeze or more accurately the perception of the squeeze ended and now the stock is drifting lower every day The amount of AMC shares short relative to its market cap and trading volume has never been that high and is currently declining https preview redd it v5gj853egsc71 png width 458 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 814f18dbfaea779aa694bbaed28025182f355c9a Borrow rates are consequently diminishing as well shorting doesn t cost that much anymore less than 2 per year and there is plenty of borrow available If you need to cover your short you can do so pretty easily For example if you re short 1 million shares you can cover that before breakfast with recent trading volumes and it wouldn t move the stock at all Remember covering a short is simply buying shares in the market at the prevailing price AMC trades over 50 million shares a day People keep yelling they have to cover Or we own the float Both of those things are true But when someone wants to cover they don t need to ask for everyone s permission They just need to buy stock in the market at the current price much like people in this community buy stock every single day from people that are selling it That s how it works https preview redd it y8h2hvgfgsc71 png width 458 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 67b3adf161229010162f970bcde184ae78c7e4c5 Finally hedge funds that are short AMC are doing so in small size relative to the size of their funds In other words most are assuming over 200 price appreciation in their downside scenarios and have plenty of collateral in reserve to place against the short position they are maintaining if the short goes against them For all intents and purposes they can hold these short positions forever This is not a recipe for a short squeeze AMC is not GameStop After the GME squeeze ended GameStop continued transforming itself GameStop raised a ton of cash 500 million in April paid down all its debt and then raised even more cash 1 billion in June In the midst of cleaning up its capital structure Ryan Cohen hired an experienced team of top notch managers GameStop current market cap 14 5 billion now has a real shot at becoming a successful niche online retailer of gaming accessories and related products that competes effectively against Amazon Investors are now betting that Ryan Cohen can make GameStop as successful as his last company Chewy current market cap 35 billion Chewy captured market share from Amazon and others in the pet food and accessories market on its way to becoming a very large and thriving business Investors hope GameStop will do the same against Amazon Best Buy and others The value reflected in GameStop s current market cap is driven mostly by an optimistic bet on this transformation The gamble on the short squeeze is over GME is trading fairly rationally right now maybe a little expensive considering the road to 35 billion is going to be really bumpy GameStop s valuation is not completely detached from reality in that GameStop has a good chance at succeeding AMC on the other hand has traded from the realm of the improbable into the universe of the impossible AMC is stuck with its old management team and is pursuing the same tired strategy of trying to get people to fill theaters even though every content provider including video game producers are pushing consumers to enjoy and participate in content at home AMC does not have Ryan Cohen It has Adam Aaron who is struggling to steer AMC through 5 billion in debt and growing rent obligations With this debt burden and with zero history of being an entrepreneurial visionary like Ryan Cohen Adam Aaron will not be able to attract the kind of talent Ryan Cohen can recruit Consequently AMC doesn t have a shot at competing against Disney Netflix Amazon and every other streamer AA s only hope is to cynically appeal to apes so that you keep buying his stock My bet is that he s going to have to deliver a lot more than free popcorn to keep people buying But

always collect a ton of data most often stored in texts such as spreadsheets or databases which requires programming knowledge to navigate through A common issue large companies have is simply having too much data Palantir creates software that consolidates a company s data and displays it in a comprehensible easily digestible user interface for the company to use This allows Palantir to work with companies organizations like the CDC for medicine the military for national security etc With Palantir a normal non technical operator can click their computer to pull up an order or an issue that Palanrie detected make any changes and or notify whoever needs the attention Let s take the CDC for example When the vaccine rolled out Palantir had a huge hand in this Palantir gives a visual display of where the vaccine is going how many and any issues that have risen if any allowing for fast response time For example Palantir could display a map with the various routes to different deployment sites with pictures of a little truck representing the shipments being routed to their destination An operator could click one of these shipments routes and pull up any data of that specific point With data being displayed and organized in this way it makes it easy to analyze data where things are going and what kind of picture the data represents rather than staring at a spreadsheet of numbers This is just one example Palantir is customizable enough where it can represent any business organization s structure Palantir s revenue streams consist of their two main software Gotham https www palantir com palantir gotham which was designed primarily for the defence and intelligence sector and Foundry https www palantir com palantir foundry for the commercial sector However the platforms are not exclusive to either sector For example Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem Currently revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sectors Gotham s main tools include Gaia lets users plan execute and report on operations via a shared live map Live maps track real time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia Dossier is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living interactive and up to date document Video an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data Users can review video footage in the platform as well as enhance raw footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources amp x200B https preview redd it

join and visualize datasets to answer analytical questions and publish the results as a report or new dataset that will automatically update with the underlying datasets Object Explorer allows users to interact with data represented as objects like customers equipment or plants rather than rows in a table As we know Palantir started in the defence and intelligence space This required Palantir to have elite level security from the start Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced This was no easy feat however Palantir managed to achieve this which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies This is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data Furthermore Palantir currently has IL 5 clearance with the Department of Defense which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance alongside Oracle Salesforce and SAP Google and Snowflake have IL 2 clearance It has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL 6 clearance which has never been done before as it is the storage processing of classified information This level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir s technology is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with

repeating a similar debacle that it did in 2011 when it decided to split their streaming and DVD by mail services on top of raising prices Shareholders and subscribers alike dumped Netflix Within 3 months of the official announcement the stock lost 75 of its value Netflix s retardedly risky gaming pivot weak subscriber count in the face of ever growing competition and price action over the last year all suggest that this stock has peaked and is primed for a reversal The Golden Years For those too young to remember Netflix had its golden years sometime between 2009 2012 They basically had a monopoly on streaming and DVD delivery put Blockbuster out of business and the price was phenomenal The streaming library and UI was tits Nothing came close to it Just a huge collection of movies and series at a time where most producers had no choice but to deal with Netflix It made piracy way less appealing since Netflix s streaming was so vast and seamless And if they didn t have the video on stream they almost certainly had it on DVD This was the period before their heavy reliance on original series production And the stock reflected the value and success of their platform and service NFLX was on an unstoppable bull run from 50 to 305 between Jan 2010 to July 2011 pre split Then the CEO Reed Hastings said to himself How can I fuck up all this unstoppable success The answer was Qwikster The Brilliant Fuck Up Qwikster was the botched abortion of a plan to split up their DVD delivery service and streaming service Under the new plan Netflix users who used to pay 9 99 for unlimited instant movies and a single at home DVD will now pay a total of 15 98 or 7 99 for a Watch Instantly subscription and another 7 99 for the one at a time DVD only plan https heresthethingblog

other shareholders quickly introduced a piece of shareholder policy called a poison pill to make it very expensive and undesirable to even attempt a hostile takeover Ichan did this to Blockbuster and

what is this move to go into the gaming industry Do they really think they are going to compete with the content or brand recognition of Sony Playstation Microsoft Xbox Nintendo and Valve Steam Even if they are going to make some shitty mobile games this is going to be extremely costly and risky to even have a chance of being successful This is no different from downloading games off the app

Interview on the Challenges posed by this Pivot https www msn com en us money other former hulu executive alex kruglov on netflixs jump into gaming vi AAMp3WF 8 This seems like a desperate Hail Mary by Netflix because they know they are losing subscriber growth If they happen to lose any significant number of subscribers in the face of the pervasive and cut throat competition then this stock is going to take a dive Summary Qwikster was the retarded brainchild of CEO Reed Hastings in an attempt ramp up expansion and force the market into streaming i e the future during Netflix s ever growing success The plan backfired and was eventually aborted but not before completely tanking the stock There is now so much competition in streaming and Netflix s Original Series are unlikely to maintain loyalty especially with many exclusive rights deals ending for some of the best most popular shows For those who argue that Netflix serves as a good babysitter wouldn t it make sense for people to switch to Disney to be a better babysitter Q2 has shown subscriber growth has significantly shrunk Subscriber loss is a Kiss of Death Despite their high subscription levels growth is what really counts Do you really think new subscribers are going to flock to Netflix to with its bloated 10 1 ratio of garbage to gold original series Piracy makes more sense than a subscription for the good shows The move for Netflix to pivot toward gaming an extremely costly and competitive industry in order remain competitive in the streaming business is YOLO life saving into a memestock level retarded Qwikster was a fix something that isn t broken move in order to ramp up growth Moving into gaming is a desperate attempt to hold onto growth with with seemingly no other ideas to be seen in the face

54,opn0ek,t2_70k8pb6d,1626987688,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/opn0ek/risk_free_options_trade/,1,Risk free options trade,How I Used Options to Set Up a Virtually Risk Free Trade There is objectively zero price risk on this trade The movement of the stock was largely irrelevant and the trade we set up would profit no matter where the stock went There was some assignment risk on the short calls we sold which we discuss in the second to last paragraph This is entirely a broker imposed risk which we were able to solve without too much issue It is an important distinction to make though so I ve added that up here to the top of the post I ve been trading options for a while but about a month ago I saw one of the most unique opportunities I ve ever seen in the market Here is an explanation of how I set up a trade that gave me a trade where the worst case scenario was that I made a little over 2 500 https imgur com 7K4Z5MH This is about to be a wall of text so if you re a more visual learner here s a quick video I threw together explaining it VIDEO https youtu be ui2HxTDByY4 UPST first caught my eye back on June 9th when I came across news of its upcoming share lockup expiry on June 14th For those who are unfamiliar a share lockup is a pre determined period of time where certain initial investors in a stock usually institutions pre IPO are not allowed to sell their shares This is to prevent a mass selloff at IPO since these institutions are typically able to get shares in a company for far below what it ultimately is offered to the public at Once that pre determined lockup period expires those entities covered by the share lockup are free to sell their shares as they wish Now a share lockup expiry doesn t always mean a stock will drop For example if an institution owned a huge number of shares at 22 per share and the stock was trading at 25 headed into a share lockup expiry there probably wouldn t be a sell off because it s not worth it to unload a large position to lock in such a small gain However if an institution had a bunch of shares for 22 apiece and the stock was trading at 160 headed into the share lockup expiry then there would likely be a decent sell off because they would be locking in a monster gain and that s exactly what we were seeing with UPST This stock had run up from 22 to 160 between the IPO and lockup date so you could bet that investors with a basis around 20 would be itching to close their positions out and lock in a huge gain So with that in mind we knew that we wanted to play UPST down but the question was how I m going to walk you through the thought process that ultimately led me to discover the risk free trade we entered Idea 1 Covered Puts If you re familiar with a covered call you know it s a bullish strategy where you buy shares and sell a call hoping that the stock runs up to the strike of the call that you sold What we tried to do was basically the opposite a covered put where you short stock sell a put and then hope it drops to the strike of the put you sold Here is how that looks https imgur com Zc6MUXz and this is what the return profile on that looked like https imgur com gcbExAz using www optionsprofitcalculator com So this trade accomplishes what we want because it makes us money if the stock goes down But let s take a look back at the setup really quickly There is one issue With this play we re shorting the shares but the shares for UPST were listed as HTB meaning hard to borrow This occurs when a lot of people are trying to short a stock and the supply of shares available to be shorted becomes constrained This is a problem because 1 a broker may close out the short position without notice and 2 brokers charge high borrowing fees on hard to borrow stocks which would have cut into our profits So how do we solve this The answer is to open a position that is synthetically the exact same as shorting shares which we did with our second idea Idea 2 Replacing short shares with an option We solved the issue posed from shorting shares by selling a call with little to no extrinsic value We did this by selling a 45 strike call which was deep in the money This 45 strike call had 111 25 of premium which if you add those two numbers together 45 111 25 comes out to 156 25 almost EXACTLY the price of the stock at the time we calculated this indicating that there is basically zero extrinsic value on these calls that we sold Here is what that setup looks like https imgur com bwZqJi8 and here is what the results look like https imgur com wq16xVa You ll notice it s very similar to what we first laid out minus the risks associated with shorting shares of a hard to borrow stock So why does this work the same as shorting shares Let s say the stock drops 1 If you re shorting 100 shares you ll make 100 If the stock drops 1 and you ve sold 45c like we have the price of the 45c will drop from 111 25 to 110 25 resulting in a 100 gain So synthetically these are the exact same position with the added benefit that we don t have to worry about paying borrow fees or getting our position automatically closed out during the day by the broker So that leaves us with these potential outcomes https imgur com wq16xVa however there is still a ton of risk if the stock shoots up And this isn t quite the zero risk play we ve teased for this video So let s work on that part What s the best way to hedge that risk What would protect us if the stock ran up The answer is buying a call Idea 3 Hedging upside risk by purchasing a call We wanted to play UPST down but the level of upside risk wasn t within our personal risk tolerance so we decided to hedge that by purchasing a call This is what the setup on that would look like https imgur com U1t1S6N The important thing to note here is that we purchased calls at a 2 1 ratio to the call and put that we sold for the first two legs of this trade This turns infinite upside risk into infinite upside returns and actually skews the trade bullish This is what the potential outcomes of this 3 leg trade look like https imgur com Ys4TtUL and you can see that this trade is basically risk free at this point as movement below 45 is virtually impossible in such a short timeframe However the title of this post would be a lie if we didn t eliminate ALL price risk so we re on to Idea 4 Idea 4 Hedging the downside risk by purchasing a put Similarly to our upside risk hedge we hedge our downside by purchasing 45p That way any move below 45 is recovered on a dollar for dollar basis by the puts These were going for 0 05 apiece so it was basically a 10 hedge to fully eliminate the downside risk which gives us this setup https imgur com b0jVFl1 And finally that gives us these potential outcomes https imgur com 7K4Z5MH The website we re using doesn t even know what color to shade the boxes because there isn t a scenario here where we lose money All in all this took about 16 000 of collateral and resulted in a trade where the worst case scenario was that we made 2 600 which is a baseline return of 16 25 Not too bad for a few minutes of work So now you re probably wondering Why did this work and what s the catch This works because we ran into a position where the extrinsic value on the deep ITM put that we sold far outweighed the price of the calls that we purchased to hedge the position Extrinsic value is the portion of the option premium that is subject to theta decay and will be fully eliminated by the time the option expires The value of our play was derived from the roughly 19 of extrinsic value on the 280p that we sold which is really uncommon for such a deep ITM option There was roughly a 17 difference between the extrinsic value on the 280p that we sold and the premium that we paid for the 240c that we used to hedge which is what made our hedge turn our entire trade profitable This is NOT typical to see in an option chain The fact that the share lockup expiry was coming up for UPST provided a huge put skew meaning that puts carry more premium at comparable strikes This is what allowed us the opportunity to create this risk free play You also might be wondering if we had to sell exactly the 280 strike on the puts and buy exactly the 240 strike on the calls for it to work We modeled out a ton of different possible trades and strikes and this is the one that I felt gave us the best trade off between minimum base level return and maximum return At the end of the day as long as the extrinsic value on the put we sold was at least 4 5 greater than the calls we bought to hedge we were going to find ourselves in a risk free trade I give the 4 5 number because it s tough to open all of these legs at once so you might have 1 or so of slippage in getting the orders filled A 4 5 gap is what I would be comfortable with for a trade like this in the future In this situation the difference was roughly 17 And last but not least there is one little catch I m sure you ve heard there s no such thing as free money but this is really really close Since the 45c we sold were deep ITM and had zero extrinsic value we were at risk of being assigned early During the first week we were holding this trade that happened But there s no need to panic Getting assigned on the 45c now means that we are just short 100 shares which is the original position we wanted in the first place so we ll remember that the risk was our broker could close them out at any point and completely shift the return profile of the trade To address that risk we reached out to our broker let them know our plan bought back our short position and sold another 45c with no extrinsic value There is zero price risk on this trade but rather a little broker imposed risk that can be mitigated So there you have it An example of how we can use option selling strategies to take advantage of special cases in the market and set ourselves up with virtually risk free trades Thanks for reading and feel free to let me

loans through issuing stock which may be related to the acquisition of Immediate Properties LLC My guess would be that Immediate Properties held the properties or mortgages for the locations that Medican operated in The Real Estate investments from 12 2020 to 3 2021 multiplied by 10 exactly by 10 Either Immediate Properties held a 90 stake in their real estate or they had real estate that was

Immediateproper ref src twsrc 5Egoogle 7Ctwcamp 5Eserp 7Ctwgr 5Eauthor Immediate Properties is still doing what they ve been doing acquiring properties and renting them out and generally acting as a real estate broker They started a vacation rental division invested in technology that would help keep selling homes during Covid and recently started assessing their holdings to complete the merger The oldest tweet on the profile that loaded for me was 7 26 2019 basically announcing the coming merger with Medican which is around the time of several of the purchase sale and joint venture agreements that traded some of Medican s stock My Predictions There s going to be several spikes over the next few months each one going slightly higher than the next Basically occurring whenever there s some news of valuation coming out There should be one very soon when the property assessment from Immediate Properties is made public The debtors will sell off what they can during the spike and the short sellers will swoop in and put further downward pressure Eventually the debtors will clear out their stocks There is the possibility that there will need to be a reverse stock split in order to get the value up high enough to return to the market but that won t be able to happen so long as the debtors that want to sell are still holding their stocks Even with a 10 1 reverse split the number of stocks will still be in the billions However this won t necessarily Medican is positioned to become the McDonalds of Marijuana The main way that McDonalds makes money is not from the food that they sell but from owning the property that each franchise is located They collect money from everything that the franchise location needs to operate besides water and electricity Medican just acquired a real estate focused company that still operates as it did before Once the merger completes all they need to do is adopt McDonalds model and start franchising dispensary locations You know the stock is about to blow up if they announce a franchising option
