20TrueCar It is likely that by 2033 2035 a majority of U S cars are electric 2 This will cause big increases in demand on the grid This https www energy gov sites prod files 2019 12 f69 GITT 20ISATT 20EVs 20at 20Scale 20Grid 20Summary 20Report 20FINAL 20Nov2019 pdf is a fantastic read the high EV adoption scenario doesn t show 90 EVs till 2040 which smaller than what is currently happening with new EV models State Country bans on ICE vehicles The average American home uses 33 kWh of energy per day I own a model 3 75kWh battery BARELY drive no commute and still charge 6 7 times a month from 20 to 80 averaging around 13 kWh per day A commuter may use around 30 35 kWh per day just to drive especially when heating the car For a non commuter thats a 30 40 increase for a daily commuter that s almost a 100 increase By 2025 if 30 of the U S fleet is electric that ll cause a significant increase in grid demand More important though is that energy generation planning permitting and construction takes a long time They have to front run this big time because generation facilities wind solar take time to plan permit build and hook in HVDC We re already seeing an absolute renaissance in wind and its only going to keep accelerating along with the EV adoption curve 1 2B Additionally there are other factors behind growing grid demand California is considering banning gas heating in new homes Electric heating and anti gas legislation will increase electric demand for thermal units an increased interest in hydrogen via electrosis for aviation industry 2 2C Some people think that added capacity will be curtailed because everyone will charge at night where there is bandwidth for capacity boosts from existing generation facilities These people are wrong While night charging will assuage total added generation capacity requirements there isn t enough current night natural gas generation capacity to meet the demand of 40 50 EVs and see below its unlikely Natural Gas is gonna keep as fast as it has been for political reasons Additionally 1 Not everyone is going to have home charging apartment buildings street parking rowhomes and thus will supercharge at work while commuting 2 many people aren t that disciplined to save 3 4 on a charge 3 people will live their lives normally charging when they need often during the day A ton of added capacity is needed 3 Added capacity is likely to be green As of yesterday r Energy had an article https renewablesnow com news renewables make 71 of new us power capacity in 11 mo 2020 727014 showing how 71 of the added energy 8000mW wind 6500mW solar capacity in 2020 was renewables This phenomenon has two causes 1 Finance Coal isn t cost competitive with solar and wind anymore Solar is getting very very cheap and more and more efficient Offshore wind is having a renaissance Nuclear is greener but more expensive 4 200 per kW and NIMBYism will prevail Solar wind is FAR cheaper than 4 200 per kW right now Banks are scared of liberals Alaskan oil can t even get bank financing now Just this week Trump opened up those Alaskan areas for bidding and nobody bidded literally and Coal isn t expanding People see the end of oil and honestly nuclear is near 2 Politics Dem administration for the next 4 years and green energy isn t the political football it was 10 years ago Fighting renewables isn t the focus of the right anymore Additionally Democrats resist natural gas expansion as noted above Natural gas isn t that green big methane problems and while it s cheap af its not everywhere pipeline limits and I deem it unlikely that population centers NE Corridor Cali Chicago etc etc which are ALL liberal are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants I deem it unlikely that we re gonna be a 50 natural gas country Don t believe me Go read up on California banning natural gas Yea Cali can be crazy but it is almost ALWAYS the harbinger of progressive thinking Expect that to carry forward 4 Biden will do an infrastructure bill This will happen Its popular its needed and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president Its an amazing kick off to his first year in office He needs to find a way to boost employment before 2022 in order to have a growth narrative for the midterms 2022 midterms don t look good for democrats and if he doesn t have a strong 2021 year or at least optically he ll get lame ducked in 2023 2024 He s not running in 2024 he s too fucking old So how does he go into the twilight of his career with the narrative of a Unifier He does something everyone can get behind infrastructure With the recent Trump supporter capital storming Biden has some great political bandwidth to hit the ground running 5 Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won t get green policies otherwise Even with the two blue Georgia seats there is ZERO chance the Dems blow the filibuster You have 1 a president that won by a narrow margin that 2 isn t that popular 3 who has a bad looking 2022 midterm that 4 won t run in 2024 cause he s ancient with 5 a not too popular VP can t afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects No filibuster 50 50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote Please Not happening Yet Biden does need to cater to his liberal supporters and fire up the DNC base in 2022 A great way to get people onboard is to blend an infrastructure bill with elements of the Green New Deal He has to do this Its the only way to sneak green policies into implementation to cater to the Left Standalone Green New Deal isn t happening and McConnell isn t going to let something named that pass but may let green elements be sluffed into a general infrastructure bill All this aside infrastructure is NEEDED Everyone and their mother knows this It s pushing on an open door at precisely the right time 6 Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states in order to get passed We re not gonna get a carbon tax cap and trade system We re not gonna get massive oil taxes Yeah he ll help EV adoption but that s pretty limited to subsidies the 7 500 subsidy expansion for Tesla and GM just failed as a line item and research subsidies Not good enough for the Left 7 A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables Look at the maps below for for U S solar and Wind geographic advantages What do you notice For the most part there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest Great Lakes and NE Offshore region There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South Outside of California and Northeast Corridor Great Lakes offshore wind renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South If you want to do a Green Energy bill that also serves as a bipartisan stimulus there are

Observe how many are in Asia Euro vs the U S It s not our fault in the past grid owners could easily locate generation facilities near enough to minimize high voltage lines However things are changing wind and solar take space aren t as location independent as gas coal nuclear amp x200B 8 Microgrids won t solve the issue Obviously Tesla city level distributed powerpacks will happen but this isn t an either or situation The speed of EV adoption and the heightened demand environment are going to vastly outpace the adoption of rooftop solar what many microgrid proponents suggest can fully deal with grid demand Grid level wind solar is still needed and those sources need to be connected in so again a regionalized HVDC connection system from renewable gt population center is still needed 9 The more HVDC connections that are installed the more compelling it will be to form longer linkages more HVDC between population centers and therefore storage Connected regional grids think Minnesota Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania connected mutually via Great Lakes Wind farms that are in turn connected to the NE Corridor marginally decrease the amount of total net storage needed in the system as the wind is always blowing sun is always shining somewhere This process will continue until we eventually have a Supergrid but NOT one by original purpose which is what people usually argue against when people mention that word but convenience alongside thousands of microgrids If this seems extreme to you sit back consider the 2nd point of this post then imagine 80 of Cars are EVs within 15 years A vast majority of Semi trucks are electric Advances in batteries mean that Planes shipping and tons of military applications now all use huge amounts of power Grid demand is way WAY higher than it was when the biggest demand source were light bulbs and your shitty AC unit 10 The way to play this is by going to the manufacturer installer Prysmian Group PRYMY an ADR is the largest HVDC provider in the world It s also a pure play It is based in Milan but its a union of 3 companies one of which is General Cable American which produces HVDC domestically See the below image which is from Prysmian s 2019 annual report The green dots are energy cable HVDC manufacturing facilities See a trend They re almost all in Red states again renewables largely in Red States HVDC manufacturing

What happens when Prysmian s revenue goes up by 3x over the next 5 years and 10x by 2030 There is SO much work to be done modernizing the U S grid but then on to the rest of the world The realities I am describing EVs gt heightened demand gt green is cheap gt it needs to be hooked in gt regional grid connections lower net amount of storage needed in aggregate etc etc etc aren t unique to the first world Other countries will follow suit Conclusion I do not believe this reality is baked into the price Although everyone knows grid upgrades are coming hence 44 P E I don t think that people are taking these large phenomenon down to their lower level logical conclusions The gradual inadvertent development of the Supergrid is inevitable necessary and politically convenient for a guy so desperate to bridge the political divide Prysmian is well suited to take full advantage of American infrastructure as well as the rest of the world TL DR EVs adoption curves are getting faster and faster and are going to drive higher electrical demands from the Grid which will be met with Green Energy This will require a huge increase in HVDC installations This is occurring at exactly the time Biden needs a big infrastructure plan for political economic reasons and the realities of Green energy in the U S actually benefit Red States pretty bigly Gradually HVDC networks will reach a point where a macro regional Supergrids become a reality in order to lower aggregate storage requirements and add more safety redundancy PRYMY Prysmian Group is the worlds largest HVDC provider and they manufacture HVDC in the U S They are primed to benefit from this trend and it is currently vastly undervalued Sorry no rockets Also there aren t options available so you ll have to slow boat this

news 01 08 , Stocks finish at all time highs as Tesla passes Facebook in market value Lemonade rises by more than 20 again while reports continue to come in on the Apple Car Let s talk about this and other stock market news Very Long Post Hello everyone and Good Morning So let s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a big rally in the stock market after the Biden https ibb co QpPkkvg confirmation and Trump called for a smooth transition with the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite https ibb co sw8bKdb recovering the previous day losses and closing at over 13K We also saw the broad stock market SP500 https ibb co MnjT8BH gaining almost 1 5 and finishing over 3800 while the Dow Jones https ibb co ykPckZD also posted a gain of over 200 points to close at just over 31k with all 3 of the big indexes finishing at new records This broad rally pushed the VIX https ibb co 5MY0P1w down as the volatility index finished the day lower by more than 10 as 9 of the 11 SECTORS https ibb co nmc7x8X finished in the Green with Technology leading the way up 2 7 while Utilities was the biggest laggard dropping by 1 3 Growth companies largely outperformed yesterday https ibb co XpHGdhb with both small and large cap growth companies posting big gains across the board while value plays lagged behind as 2 3 of the companies were advancing YESTERDAY https ibb co NLLMyLY with over 300 new highs on average volume So let take a look at the HEAT MAP https ibb co ys6zg6M from yesterday as big tech companies flourished with the likes of Apple Google Microsoft Facebook Nvidia Tesla and many more posting gains at least 2 while most of the losses were concentrated in the Chinese stocks that are being delisted and the more value heavy utilities sector Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment SURVEY https ibb co 10gRPgn which saw a worrying move in the stock market as bullish investors surpassed 50 of the total investors and is near the 1 year high from November Most of this move to the bullish side came from neutral investors which are way below the historical average https ibb co XbyKxjB which probably decided to get back in the market rushing in the clean energy sector the industrials and many others after the Democrats swept the Georgia election I remind you that I usually use this survey as a contrarian indicator when sentiment moves to this much greed in the market I usually don t like to add to my positions as I await to buy stocks on red days We also received some economic data yesterday as we saw December s homes for SALE https ibb co 7Y3njz3 fall to an all time low below 700K as the housing market keeps on booming with homes selling faster by about 2 weeks compared to last year while the national inventory dropped by almost 40 since last year as the median listing price was 340K up over 13 since 2019 Today https ibb co t4bS0wH is a quieter economic day with the biggest number coming in the early morning as we wait to see the non farm payrolls In some other stock market news we saw Nikola https ibb co DLP8f1P joining the broad rally in the EV STOCKS https ibb co mJgVqwr yesterday which pushed almost every single stock higher while we also saw a report from JP Morgan on some possible good developments on their trucks I don t believe in this company it s bad history bad management and reputation will hurt it in the long even if they manage to develop a decent product which is still to be seen as they haven t really brought anything innovative to the market One other stock that rose yesterday was Lemonade https ibb co FbZZ5Lz as the stock spiked more than 27 yesterday after the company was pitched by the Motley Fool yet again I really like this company and I think it has major disruption potential in the insurance world so I agree with this report The stock did suffer a slight pullback about a week ago after a report from The Friendly Bear but I don t believe it will have a long lasting effect as I believe this stock has great growth potential Apple https ibb co Xzscpk6 also seems to be confirming the previous reports and is in talks with Hyundai about a development of a self driving EV as we heard something about this from Hyundai before some confusion made them kind of back out of the previous statement This report is pretty much as anticipated as Apple would probably be looking to either collaborate on manufacturing with a traditional car manufacturer or actually just acquiring pretty much any one of them We also saw Snowflake https ibb co vZ1v7yw regain some momentum yesterday rising by more than 13 despite the expiration period of another 38M shares The latest IPOs and small cap stocks have recently been able to raise a lot of capital as investors seem to be grabbing any share available at almost any price regarding valuations This is a very dangerous thing yet again This kind of stuff was happening in the last dot com bubble though I don t really expect anything like that to happen with the overall stock market but I think we might see some stocks have a big crash when valuations start to come back in the mind of investors Meanwhile we saw 2 big milestones for Tesla amp Elon

back,First to reduce any confusion the company will be referred to as Papa John s and the person will be referred to as Schnatter I was joking about the idea to take over Papa John s with some of my friends yesterday to get Schnatter back in control of his company and when I started doing my research I actually liked what I saw purely from an investment standpoint This post will have two main parts how we can get Schnatter his job back and also how we can easily make money on PZZA We ll do the money stuff first amp x200B Chart As of writing this PZZA is currently trading at 94 10 and the ATH is 102 25 It is basically guaranteed that it will go back to the ATH It has also sailed past the 20 and 10 day moving average so there is no resistance until ATH This is great for options https

finviz com quote ashx t pzza float I know that s a lot but Schnatter already owns almost 1 3 million shares https ir papajohns com stock information ownership profile Guys it s take out pizza in a pandemic it should really be self explanatory amp x200B amp x200B Now we can talk about how Schnatter can become reinvolved with the company which should help PZZA stock even more As you will see ever since he left the company has not been in as good of a position Why Schnatter Left In 2017 he made a controversial comment about how the NFL player protests were hurting Papa John s sales https www npr org sections thetwo way 2017 12 22 572779230 papa johns ceo steps down following controversial remarks on nfl because they were the official pizza sponsor of the NFL I don t want this to get political but this is essential to talk about Schnatter stepped down as CEO but remained on the board of directors Fast forward into 2018 where Schnatter was reported to have used a racial slur https www forbes com sites noahkirsch 2018 07 11 papa johns founder john schnatter allegedly used n word on conference call sh 376e4e6e4cfc in a meeting and it was recorded Then he stepped down from his position and no longer had a role in the company besides for shareholder amp x200B Schnatter s Fight for Innocence Ever since both of these allegations have surfaced Schnatter has maintained his innocence and that his words were taken out of context In a recent interview https www youtube com watch v 1lYGrUA6YjA Schnatter had with the H3 Podcast I know many people don t care for them myself included but those opinions don t change what Schnatter says in the interview where he explained why both allegations were false Regarding the NFL drama Schnatter claims that he was talking about how the NFL had a leadership problem because they were not addressing the issue His exact words were https www foxbusiness com retail ex fbi director clears papa johns founder of racial bias slams clearly inaccurate media The NFL is hurting and more importantly by not resolving the current debacle to the player and owner s satisfaction NFL leadership has hurt Papa John s shareholders In regards to the allegations of him using a racial slur former FBI director Louis Freeh wrote a report https papajohnschnatter report read the report where he explains how that in the phone call where he used a slur he many times stated how he does not support any form of racism and when he said the word he was referring to how Colonel Sanders used it and it bothered him There are two parts to the recording that Schnatter has been fighting in court to get released The first part includes him using the slur and the context and the second part includes the other people on the call celebrating after Schnatter hung up talking about how they got him and they needed to get it to the press right away This is all according to the H3 interview It is common sense that Schnatter would not want a recording made public that would damage him and the company seems intent on keeping it secret showing that they are likely hiding something amp x200B Sales are Slumping Sales are decreasing https www statista com statistics 221441 papa johns total revenue text Revenue 20of 20Papa 20John s 20worldwide 202007 2D2019 amp text American 20pizza 20restaurant 20franchise 20Papa seeing 20a 20decline 20in 20revenue every year since his role as been minimized It s as simple as that They are in no way a failing company they are just making less money than they were Processing img 934fvr5jq4a61 In addition to slumping sales in the H3 interview https www youtube com watch v 1lYGrUA6YjA Schnatter claims that Papa John s total number of customers is down significantly and that the quality has decreased He says he buys about 600 pizzas every 90 days from stores around the country to check on the quality In my personal experience I can say the quality at my local Papa John s has decreased over the past couple years amp x200B Why Schnatter Can Fix This Schnatter is more devoted to Papa John s than most CEOs after Karp and Elon even though he technically doesn t work for them anymore As I said before he does frequent quality checks on the restaurants The reason he does is is because he cares about the franchise owners and employees who have been negatively impacted by the new management and slumping sales Who else still puts effort into a company after they ve been fired from it Also this is just speculation but since he is still closely associated with the company it is still his reputation amp x200B What we can do It s simple buy shares If we buy enough shares of PZZA we along with Schnatter can become the majority shareholder of the company There are just over 31 million shares float https finviz com quote ashx t pzza and Schnatter still owns almost 1 3 million shares https ir papajohns com stock information ownership profile or 3 88 of the company If he can convince a few of the other large investors that it is in their best interest to see him in charge again we can easily call a shareholder meeting vote out those who wrongly accused him and put him back in charge amp x200B Historical Implications Schnatter has long been touting The Day of Reckoning but has not given any hints as to if it has already happened if it is multiple events or what it will be specifically If we can accomplish this WSB would go down in history it already has again for giving a man his company back and we will make money in the process We can be the day of reckoning amp x200B Is This Legal Yes it is perfectly legal This would technically be a hostile takeover which is legal but we can just call it something else Besides I m pretty sure Ryan Cohen is trying to do the same thing with Game Stop amp x200B TLDR PZZA chart shows easy money Schnatter is innocent of accusations only he can bring Papa John s back to its former glory and we can be the ones to do that The Day of Reckoning is here amp x200B PZZA PLTR GME SPCE ICLN TSLA amp x200B Also if I misspelled Schnatter anywhere I m sorry

political post I don t care and don t want to hear about your politics in the comments This post is intended as an example to demonstrate how degenerates could gamble invest or legitimately hedge based on international geopolitics TL DR there s a lightly elevated risk of a crisis in the ME oil might go up a bit as result options on oil futures gt Tendies BUT be careful So what s the play Buy call option exp mid Feb on CL or other oil future I ll explain pros and cons of CL below but ditch at end of the month Cost currently between 200 300 bucks per contract for a 60 Call on CL Technical considerations and warnings First off do NOT buy the underlying future unless you know what you are doing and since you are reading this you probably don t The CL future is for 1000 barrels so quote x 1000 gives you price at the till for physical delivery at terminal So if things don t go your way you stand to lose 1000s and will need to find some tanker trucks fast Note because of this these option contracts are also priced as quote x 1000 So 20c is 200 bucks for the mathematically challenged among you You know who you are The options if things don t work out will just laps and your max loss is obviously limited to your premium just like with an FD If things go well you still need to sell in time though bc the options settle through to the underlying contract Some brokers will force you to sell automatically close to expiration If you absolutely want to own a future may I suggest QM which is for 500 virtual barrels and thus is settled financially rather than by delivery But no options available on those Why not Brent or other crude varietals instead of CL which is WTI You could if you broker has the options chain for those I chose CL for convenience and due to better liquidity usually No good if you want to exit your contract and nobody is there to buy it from you at a reasonable price Are there drawbacks to CL over others Yes maybe crude is traded based on the fields it comes from and has distinct qualities for each so it does not move in lock step Refineries are even calibrated to the kind of crude they can will process So an event in the middle east would likely affect local brands stronger than US ones But you should still see an effect Just note when WTI CL went negative last spring Brent was still positive because the capacity constraints causing the negative excursion did not apply to it So what makes you think a move is likely Tensions between Iran and the US have been heightened for a while and definitely increased when Soleimani was killed during an air raid last year A few days ago the Pentagon ordered the USS Nimitz to turn around and head towards the Persian gulf as a warning to Iran Iran recently voiced personal threats against members of the current administration Lastly there has been talk in Beltway circles and press that the outgoing administration might want to limit political options vs Iran for the incoming team by escalating the Iranian issue into a hot conflict What speaks against your theory In light of recent events there are moves by Congress to constrain the military authority of the outgoing administration making last minute actions more complicated Iran might also hold still depending on the situation in the hope of trading short term pain for a reset of relations with the US The goal there would be to get sanctions relief Sanctions have escalated domestic tensions in Iran and the regime might want to counter their destabilizing effects So with the above there are no guarantees things might go either way or nothing at all might happen Is there anything else Yes maybe Saudi Arabia ha recently somewhat unexpectedly cut production quotas to lift the price of oil One might speculate that pandemic related budgetary pressures domestically drove this move and it could not be the last cut While this will not make you rich it might help you break even upon exit in case nothing else happens Finally if there were a conflict it would most likely lead to a market correction esp if there is a large upward excursion in the crude markets Given that these options are for 1000 underlying barrels a 10 dollar in the money call would give you a 10k hedge against any short term dips of the regular markets Are you invested and are you just pumping Yes and hopefully no I own one contract currently with no real intention to of getting more The volatility and prices for oil are driven by forces so much larger that even the combined might of all Robinhood brosefines and brosefs so would likely not move these things much Production quotas global demand and political events that affect either are the dominant drivers here Ok fine so when should I get out For something expiring mid Feb I d get out sometime between the 20th and 30th of Jan since that seems to be the end of this event window That s my plan at least As usual do your own DD this is not financial advice only gamble invest what you can afford to lose Alright here s hoping that this was interesting to someone Enjoy your weekend

1196,ktbamc,t2_37p5epfw,1610138558,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktbamc/nano_x_fraud_nnox/,2,Nano X Fraud NNOX ,Summary Nano X has made a range of claims concerning their cold cathode X ray technology on their site in interviews and in a recent demonstration at the Radiological Society of North America As a PhD physicist and patent attorney I am in a good position to analyze the technical aspects of these claims and the Nano X patent portfolio I restrict myself in this piece to the technical aspects of the Nano X cold cathode and do not treat other issues that have been raised e g CEO track record sales partners FDA From the available evidence the Nano X tube does not appear to have any demonstrated nor potential relevant technical advantages over existing technology Long term our forecast is pessimistic The valuation of Nano X NASDAQ NNOX is amplified beyond its intrinsic worth I believe a close look at the website interviews and promotional material of the company reveals consistent overstatement of their case and disingenuous conflation of issues of technical import to give the erroneous impression of a breakthrough technology Nano X is using a cold cathode X ray tube where the heated filament of the standard X ray tube is replaced by a set of nanometric pointed tips which release electrons at room temperature and relatively low voltage This difference which conceivably might be leveraged for competitive advantage in certain situations does not appear to be useful in the context of medical imaging On Nano X s Our Tech page they have listed a series of purported advantages deriving from their cold cathode which we address in order after which we look at a few more issues of interest Rapid time switching In a hot cathode the acceleration of the electrons towards the Anode thereby creating X rays is done by activating and switching a high voltage supply This process takes time on the order of milliseconds In a cold cathode one can set the high voltage and switch only the gate voltages a process that can take only microseconds It is not clear how this is relevant to medical imaging millisecond turn on and turn off times are quite sufficient even for the frame rates of a full body CT which reaches at most tens of frames per second Blur can be a problem due to the rapidly moving CT mechanism but it appears the limiting factor here is not the turnon turnoff time but rather the amount of illumination possible to deliver in the short timeframes available e g 50ms less the turnon turnoff time for a 20fps device And as we stress below Nano X is not making a CT machine NASA has developed a sub nanosecond 100keV Xray source thousands of times faster than the Nano X device All the other cold cathode vendors see Unique Positioning section below will enjoy the same but quite possibly irrelevant fast turnon and turnoff Rapid intensity change independence of current and voltage The Field Emitter current depends on the applied voltage and the X ray intensity depends on the Field Emitter current With cold cathode technology it is possible to uncouple these two parameters i e the current s power is independent of the voltage Thus the X ray intensity can be rapidly controlled by increasing the speed of switching or by creating short pulses This is a somewhat confused statement given that the cold cathode technology uses field emitters while the hot cathode uses thermionic emission If the claim is that for field emission intensity depends on emission current which in turn depends on applied voltage then these parameters are by definition dependent but then Nano X goes on to claim these are independent So let s assume for the moment that the statement should actually claim that for the thermionic source voltage and current and therefore intensity are dependent while for field emission these are independent In passing we note that the title of this section on the Nano X page Rapid intensity change seems to have nothing to do with current voltage independence which is the actual subject of the section While we re at it the current s power is a clumsy terminological misstep current having units of amperes and power Watts being rather different quantities eliciting pained winces from the technically conversant Source Nano X The graph above from Nano X s site shows that currents I a and I g are independent of acceleration voltage past about 10kV If we assume that I a is anode current which is proportional to emission current and X ray intensity and I g is gate current then indeed the field emitter current is independent of acceleration voltage and we note that whoever produced this graph forgot to use a negative exponent for his her current units However this is largely the case for thermionic emission as well see graph below The graph shows the anode current I a as it depends on acceleration voltage U a for a series of different filament currents I f Note that the Nano X graph shows a current of I a 0 01A 10mA or 10 2A which on the graph below lies squarely in the region of constant anode current with varying acceleration voltage Source IAEA Diagnostic Radiology Physics Handbook p 95 Even if this were not the case the fact remains that with control over both filament current and acceleration voltage any cathode anode current proportional to X ray intensity can be reached for any given acceleration voltage One can think of it like this the X ray operator has two knobs acceleration voltage and filament current and by spinning these knobs can reach any point in the I a U a plane Colder Mechanism Electrons are extracted from the metal cathode by an applied electric field while the emitter temperature is significantly lower than that of Hot Cathode thermionic emission filaments Hot cathode temperature is over 2000 degrees Celsius while a Cold Cathode temperature is that of room temperature And from a Motley Fool interview The typical technology requires a massive machine because it has to manufacture a lot of heat up to 2 000 degrees Celsius and then cool itself down The Nano X device distributes this task of creating electrons across 100 million digitally controlled nanocones That s what makes this X ray a lot smaller and a lot cheaper to manufacture and maintain It doesn t appear that Nano X has in fact found a way around heat production at the anode they do avoid heat production at the cathode since there is no heated filament But the heated filament of a conventional tube is a relatively minor energy input 30 150W into the entire heat load of e g 100KW in a CT tube while for low power intermittent use tubes these heat loads are inconsequential in any case A Nano X device of a given power must still reject the same amount of heat as a conventional tube since it generates X rays by the same inefficient process of braking radiation 1 X rays 99 heat As is clear from their figure below the Nano X cold cathode tube is identical to the conventional hot cathode tube except for the cathode and therefore will have the same heat rejection issues as a hot cathode tube of the same power Source Nano X website 4 Longevity Lifetime improvement Filament Burn The hot cathode s longevity is of thousands of patients lifetime whereas that of the Cold Cathode is gt 1M patients lifetime If true this would be great although it is somewhat offset by the fact that the tubes are also supposed to be cheap The Nano X tube lifetime has not been demonstrated in any publications including the Nano X patents In any case replacing 100 tubes a few times a year vs a few times a decade would hardly make a difference to the overall operating costs Beyond this point current CT tubes which have the most demanding requirements being high power devices have a lifetime expectation of 10 000 40 000 hours operation enough for hundreds of thousands of patients For a 150 000 tube this would work out to a few dollars per patient for tube replacement And Phillips for one has implemented a Tube For Life guarantee rendering the point doubly moot 5 Cost A key Nano X claim is that their 100 tube replaces a 150 000 CT tube As detailed here this is an apples to oranges or perhaps grapes to watermelons comparison of the 100W Nano X tube to a 100kW CT tube having a thousand times the power This comparison is repeated in the Nano X RSNA demonstration and is perhaps the most clearly troubling indication that Nano X is overstating its case Note that Nano X hasn t developed an Xray detector only a source The Nano X Arc appears to use the Exprimer DRTECH detector or similar below the table in their latest videos thus the entire device will have to be at least the 40k 50k price of the detector belying the Nano X claim of a total 15K production cost for their device Efficiency High efficiency due to sturdy gate design It s unclear what this might mean Nano X relies on the same highly inefficient process of braking radiation as regular tubes with 99 of the energy going to heat and 1 going to X ray production Uniformity and Stability These are minimum requirements for a usable device and do not appear to signify improvements over extant hot cathode technology which is also uniform and stable Power Management Supply of less than 50V is required to activate electron ejections from the chip and enable voltage independent current The control electronics for a 50V gate are indeed somewhat simpler than that required to switch a 50kV source but suitable AC DC power supplies were available in the 1950 s and a later generation of high speed switching has been available since the 1980 s The independence of current and voltage was treated above IN advisability of yearly scans for early detection One screening for each symptomatic patient every year Using Xray for early detection has a drawback namely that Xrays carry some degree of cumulative exposure risk The more scans you have the more likely you will get cancer David J Brenner PhD director of Columbia University s center for radiological research put it this way If you start at age 45 and have them full body CT annually until you are 75 you are talking about a one in 50 chance of radiation induced cancer which is a huge risk Until the benefit is clear there is not much of an advantage to having routine body scans yearly or even every two years Obviously routine screening for risk groups is a different matter Intellectual Property From a Nano X SEC report As of July 8 2020 we had three issued patents in the United States and eight provisional or pending U S patent applications We also had three patents issued in each of Israel Japan and China three pending patent applications in the European Patent Office three pending patent applications in Korea and six pending Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications which are the counterparts of our U S patent applications We intend to continue filing for patents on new technologies as they are developed and to actively pursue any infringement upon our patents We believe that our know how and trade secrets represent de facto barriers to potential competition However a detailed analysis of the Nano X portfolio does not show that they are in a strong position in terms of patents None of the 13 patents studied show any particular breakthrough in dealing with known problems of nano Spindt emitters current uniformity lifetime and none show any experimental work beyond simulations Several other companies operate in the digital X ray source space as detailed below Unique Positioning The Spindt array was patented in 1970 and a number of companies have developed variations thereof for X ray imaging There are number of systems currently for sale using digital sources either using small numbers of macroscopic Spindt emitters or carbon nanotubes as emitters Carestream Vec Imaging Micro X and Adaptix are all active in the digital Xray source space with FDA approved devices for sale now Multispectral Magic Nano X CEO Ran Poliakine has asserted in at least one interview that because it s digital it s multispectral You don t need different machines to do different kinds of imaging X rays CT scans mammograms not requiring breast compression angiograms and fluoroscopies have all been claimed as within the purview of the Nano X Arc due to this multispectral operation However the spectrum range of energies of X rays produced by both cold cathode and hot cathode sources is almost entirely determined by the braking radiation process wherein high energy electrons hit the metal usually tungsten anode and release X rays The spectrum has a characteristic form as shown below Source Sprawls Educational Foundation Here the intensity vs energy aka the spectrum is shown with a broad braking radiation aka brehmsstrahlung curve and several peaks due to atomic transitions aka characteristic radiation The point is that there is a wide spectrum produced by braking radiation which is the process occurring in regular hot cathode tubes as well as the Nano X cold cathode tubes so there is no significant difference between the Nano X spectrum and a regular hot cathode spectrum In any case the ability to discriminate between different energies doesn t depend on the source unless it has been filtered to produce only one energy but rather upon the detector This ability is very useful allowing for instance identification of different atomic components of a sample in an EDX equipped electron microscope but has nothing to do with the source Summary The Nano X claims of breakthrough technology do not stand close inspection Their cold cathode source provides no clear theoretical nor demonstrated benefits over extant X ray tubes and suffers from the same limitations Repeated comparisons of a low power 100W 100 Nano X tube to a high power 100kW 150 000 CT tube are at best disingenuous this being only the clearest example chosen from a series of similar sleights Were Nano X to publish a paper or give a demonstration showing that their tube or machine was in some relevant way superior to extant technology I would gladly stand corrected being an Israeli citizen I indulge a bit of patriotic pride in the accomplishments of my fellow citizens and suffer an analogous embarrassment at their shenanigans Lacking such evidence the Nano X stock price is a case of tulip mania in which FOMO and hype overwhelm intrinsic value for the nonce As Keynes warned in the quote at the head of the article judging when these two worlds might converge requires a finer analysis than mine Perspicacious investors may be interested in Nano X in light of FDA 501 k announcements e g in the next few weeks for their single source machine from which a jump in a direction comporting with the sense of the FDA announcement and IV crush may be expected

country moves on from Y all Qaeda s storming of the capitol A number of high level admin officials from policy advisors to cabinet members have bailed the sinking ship that is this current administration Chatters of invoking 25th amendment Second impeachment POTUS has stated that he will NOT attend the upcoming inauguration who knew he s a gdamn snowflake after finally putting out a statement that an orderly transition will occur Psuedo SJW social media companies and platforms have banned POTUS in tandem conveniently doing so after the Dems have clinched both chambers of Congress and will likely sit on committees regulating them No real movements from these actions yet though TWTR is pulling back after it banned POTUS for 12 hours until he deleted the offending Tweet TWTR
