liked it https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lsn7ke finra data now shows over 58 million gme stocks utm source share amp utm medium web2x amp context 3 so I have updated to include today s data and some new data sources availability and fees for shorts Enjoy this light weekend reading Part 1 FINRA I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days http regsho FINRA org regsho Index html http regsho finra org regsho Index html CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion https www FINRA org FINRA data short sale volume daily https www finra org finra data short sale volume daily Note if you want to find this raw data use the link above and you will need to go into each day s file updated at 6pm daily and search for GME then copy the raw numbers the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to this is not a user friendly document There was an additional 22 million in short volume today on top of the 33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio The short volume as of total daily volume as published by FINRA is at 57 which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27 29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price CAVEATS This data does not include NYSE which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million Thanks to u tri fire engineer for bringing this up He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that once NYSE data was included Short Volume went up from 56 8 to 57 6 I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke t daily data does NOT equate to of total shares that are shorted as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered shorting but is not what we would usually define The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn t sound very fun Here are my data tables again all taken from the FINRA daily data Assumptions used GME Float Stock 54 490 000 this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M GME Total Shares 69 750 000 https preview redd it 2lpie1wm12k61 png width 807 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74 https preview redd it 3jkeam6o12k61 png

decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME The data available through iborrowdesk com https iborrowdesk com report GME https iborrowdesk com report GME For those wondering about the site check out the about page the site uses text files from Interactive Broker s FTP site https iborrowdesk com about https iborrowdesk com about Note This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost https preview redd it roplc5ly12k61 png width 1198 amp format png amp auto webp amp s f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9 Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from 2 million at 1 1 borrow rate to only 450 000 at 9 borrow rate The last time there were less than 500 000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5 as seen through this site was on Jan 27 when we saw some huge intraday price swings Part 3 ETFs This data of course doesn t take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME For example EX AR TEE is currently 175 shorted 16 1m shares on 9 2m and GME as 9 of its portfolio https www etfchannel com symbol xrt https www etfchannel com symbol xrt Doing some quick math of 73M of GME at 117 620k shares of GME x 185 short position 1 1m GME

even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved ie shorted gt we have detected an approximate 85 8 million dollar outflow that s a 12 0 decrease week over week from 9 200 000 to 8 100 000 If these numbers are true then it is shorted closer to 199 16 1m shorts 8 1m shares NOTE you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows shrinks this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF TLDR THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME BUT will prevail Stake shares in GME PS you guys I m truly honored by how popular you ve made my posts You are the best

some research amp analysis ,Before I start I just want to say I am writing this because last time I put up speculative DD and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism Hypothesis GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market New York Stock Exchange NYA Market Cap 22 9 trillion 2400 stock listings Nasdaq IXIC Market Cap 3300 listings S amp P 500 MC 31 61 trillion Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA Market Cap 8 33 trillion 30 largest of NYA and Nasdaq TLDR Abstract I compare the relationship between GME and the world s largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA The data didn t suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship As GME rises the market responds by dropping Based on this data my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market If this data is accurate then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently possibly help for not just GME indicators but also prospective market strategies positions In short when GME goes up the market goes down TLDR for data I found that the NYA DJIA and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME NYA NYA p 0027 DJIA p 0018 Nasdaq p 0 88 START I noticed that anytime GME is rallying up my entire portfolio goes red My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result However whenever I mentioned this idea I ve been met with opposition so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above amp x200B GME DJIA IXIC NYA YTD DATA https preview redd it ijpbroximxj61 png width 1251 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695 If you look at the chart big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price Meaning while the whole market collapses GME rises The opposite is also true as GME drops the rest of the market rises The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are coincidences as many have suggested PROCESS I calculated covariance correlation and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME NYA DJIA IXIC All data can be found there amp x200B Covariance amp Correlation Matrices https preview redd it msw9tittmxj61 png width 364 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553 P values Statistically significant values highlighted https preview redd it gwdaxycymxj61 png width 360 amp format png amp auto webp amp s cd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0 The results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA DJIA For those that are not into statistics the p value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on luck or chance It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance Any p value less than 05 is considered statistically significant A p value less than 05 basically says that there is less than a 5 chance that the relationships are due to luck As you can see there is a 27 chance that the NYA dropping is random and a 18 chance for the DJIA While the IXIC does not fit the bill I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC or when comparing DJIA to IXIC So what does this mean My opinions To me this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber rich but rather a battle for the entire market On January 26 the DJIA dropped 600 points the IXIC 300 points and NYA 400 points with just a 266 dollar increase in GME Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars At this point you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market and while that should initially cause worry when you remember the fact that the top 10 own 88 of the ENTIRE market you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted it s theirs My opinion is that if the short squeeze happens we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen but larger than any society in history has ever seen That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market Final thoughts Disclaimers Anyway this is just something I wanted to share not trying to convince anyone to do anything to buy anything or not to buy anything None of this is a fact it is vulnerable to error and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it I would love feedback especially if there are any statisticians out there I also want to clarify that this was based on limited YTD data I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff If anyone has access to quality data I would love to sink my teeth into it I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR Edit Wow I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community Thank you all so much I also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of correlation does not imply causation There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality Correlation is a measure for the strength of a relationship meaning it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable In a statistical context the term significant is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective it carries mathematical weight which is established by the P test The P test essentially measures the likelihood that the correlation between 2 variables is unrelated meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck If you look on the labels of nutrition items if in the corner of a claim you see a little it means that statement was deemed statistically significant For instance vitamin b 12 claims helps turn food into cellular energy while other vitamins make claims with no In layman s terms the p test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided there is a 27 chance that the two are UNRELATED or a 99 73 chance they are related In the scientific community anything below 5 or less than 05 is considered statistically significant Also I didn t just test correlation I also tested covariance Covariance is not the same as correlation Covariance measures the direction of the relationship In this case the very large negative values are indicative of an inverse relationship Meaning when one goes up the other one goes down So with that in mind this analysis provides a measure for the direction of the relationship the strength of the relationship and the statistical significance of the relationship Apart from that it does not say why or how they related That is purely speculation and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data I am not convincing you to buy into mine Lastly I ve seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of 500 dollars https firstratedata com cb 1 complete us stocks index etf futures per data set Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it Other than that Thank you all so much for the support and awards Edit 2 The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility u big boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA He got a correlation coefficient of 0 53 which is close to mine of 0 49 u big boolean Graph https preview redd it uu51ljdpsyj61 jpg width 600 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69 For those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post post your results and I will add them on For reference I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations Edit 3 I ve started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in depth understanding of applied statistics than I do To all of you experts I welcome your criticism Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself or better yet I m sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields If you do decide to provide suggestions if you could list them in stepwise instructions that would be even better Pointing out problems faults is important but providing actionable solutions even more so

1294,ltiai5,t2_51mqad4i,1614408107,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltiai5/grocery_outlet_is_an_attractive_value_investment/,47,Grocery Outlet is an attractive value investment with Tinfoil Hat possibilities, Grocery Outlet is a boomer bet with overtones of possible insane growth First the bedrock boomer shit Grocery outlet buys strategically so they can offer products for 50 to 70 cheaper than the competition Essentially they allow my broke ass to eat organic ribeye every night if i so choose GO has just 375 locations in 6 states Their most recent 10k was released in 2019 and stated they have a longterm potential of 4 800 locations nationwide GO is just getting started Their longterm growth is projected as 14 7 as compared to industries 12 4 in 2019 They plan to expand their number of locations by at least 10 a year This alone gets my dong hard As stated in their 10k their management is not accustomed to operating a publicly owned business This sounds bad but is actually a good thing imo GO is already an amazing business model Imagine if an Ackman R Cohen type character came in and bought a huge chunk or the company installed a few heavy hitters to help scale the business In fact last week they added Maria Fernanda Meija former VP Kellogg s and Gail Moody byrd AI marketing analytics at noodle ai to the board The above would be enough to get me to invest if i were a boomer but as a WSB mutant I need a possibility of a tendie volcano Now for storytime HOW GROCERY OUTLET OFFERS DEEP DISCOUNTS If a store overstocks a truck gets misdirected packaging changes production changes or any such interruption in the Chain of freshness occurs GO capitalizes on this while saving the other company from taking losses THE CHAIN OF FRESHNESS You may have heard that up to a third of all food produced by Americans is thrown away https www google com amp s amp theatlantic com amp article 491513 The Chain of Freshness describes how this happens and how food MOVES 1 Food is grown 2 Food sent to be processed and or packaged branded 3 It goes to warehouse this sometimes involves many layers of regional and local warehouses 4 It goes to a store 5 You buy it Anywhere during this chain product can get slowed down It wont be fresh enough to be accepted at the next checkpoint in the Chain so it goes into a dumpster Although the actual freshness of the product may be fresher than you would ever see at a store its not fresh enough to go to regional then local distributors before landing at the store not only fresh enough to consume but fresh enough to be able to sit on the shelf for however long is required by the stores business plan This would be a good time to state that im technically an industry insider as ive been dumpster diving for years Ive seen warehouse dumpsters full to the top with product all packaged and nice fresher than you would ever see at a store You may have heard in the news recently about portland police guarding dumpsters full of food from citizens Fred Meyer said the food was spoiled but it was just unsellable due to liability issues and food quality laws Perfectly edible food https apnews com article portland storms oregon 4eebd2cd2f1b9f798667994bc871a647 This is just the tip of the iceberg as warehouse dumpsters are usually behind fences and guarded with cameras so no one sees that waste except for me I fill my backpack with organic chocolate hipflasks of brandy and have personally recovered enough frozen marinated ribs to grill up and play Meat Jenga with which we actually did This waste is caused by logistics problems which could be alleviated by Grocery Outlet adding value to everyone involved Now imagine this company if Food Waste Laws are passed penalizing companies who waste food With images of cops chasing people away from a dumpster full of perfectly good food in the news the discussion is very likely to surface among other progressive talking points Grocery Outlet is uniquely positioned to profit from this trend If Companies were all of a sudden compelled to reduce their waste it would be a huge growth opportunity Just based on their current guidance GO is a great bet But in this rapidly changing world a newly public company like GO with an innovative business model can change its current guidance multiple times Tldr a long standing glitch in the logistics of how we sell and move food around leads to dumpsters full of perfectly good food that makes up about a third of all the food Americans produce GO has a unique business plan that with the help of a big dick activist investor hiring of corporate heavy hitters and the Possibility of Food Waste Laws could turn those dumpsters full of food into dumpsters full of money for everyone involved Heres a link to an article that has the numbers I referenced https finance yahoo com news heres why hold grocery outlet 144102370 html Positions All shares about 10 of my investment capital Long hold I literally love the stock I identify with grocery outlet on an emotional level They allow me to buy all the fancy snacks I like and my loyalty to them is the closest ive come to truly experiencing religion in my life

degenerates hope you all are in good health and spirit TLDR Shorting bonds could be one hell of a play Shorting emerging market foreign junk grade corporate bonds might be the fucking moonshot if I m right Today I want to talk about the most boomer investment there is Fixed Income securities or bonds So just some background information Bonds are a debt based security Meaning that you are loaning a company municipality or government money in exchange for regular interest payments But the underlying issue I see is when any significant inflation happens it s when not if more on this later and the fed hikes rates most of the bonds issued now and in the past few years suffer from something called interest rate risk Interest rates share an inverse relationship with bonds So when rates rise gt existing bonds fall This makes sense because why would you ever keep money in a bond paying x when the current going rate for bonds is much higher This kind of market pressure can quickly tank bond prices Which is why I think shorting certain corporate bonds or ETFs who hold corporate bonds is a good idea Why Inflation is going to spike This topic has been discussed to death here on WSB by the few who haven t yet been hunted to extinction by JPOW s money printer Now I m not going to waste your time and explain in detail every reason I believe relatively high inflation is just on the horizon That being said I m going to recap the highlights of the core arguments M1 Money supply has increased drastically through quantitative easing but unlike 08 where they lowered rates through decreasing yields on treasuries they ve also started buying up other debt securities directly decreasing yields across the board They did this to help ease the burden on businesses and allow them to borrow money for much cheaper They also did this because the credit market froze and when the debt market freezes you know shit is about to go down But this time also unlike 08 the fed went full BRRRRRR and well amp x200B Does injecting this much money into the system seem sustainable to you https preview redd it fqcibc65ezj61 png width 960 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 4d0c2609a617f0bab6205f30d1b90c293dac884e amp x200B The graph really speaks for itself So much money has been injected into the economy through the debt markets that bonds yields are practically nothing The reason we haven t seen that money actually inflate the economy is because the velocity of money has tanked For the retards in the back who fell asleep in econ 101 the velocity of money is the rate at which money changes hands to purchase a good or service within a given timeframe Because economies all across the world are dampened at the moment with all the restrictions and shutdowns the average consumer is spending much less now than they would otherwise be expected to The velocity of money is going to skyrocket as the economies of the world open back up https preview redd it lvzafh5zfzj61 png width 728 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 735b0e7796514ed098450521303cb7bfcabf0867 As all this money which was previously locked up in households and businesses reenters the economy we ll likely see a sharp uptick in inflation Now the people who run the federal reserve aren t dumb they realize that this sharp rise in inflation is bad The Fed doesn t want to see runaway inflation and so they ll do whatever they can to counteract the effects of printing this much money The most effective way of the fed counteracting all this printing is by creating a big negative liquidity shock This is known as quantitative tightening Read raising interest rates Which is going to absolutely decimate bond prices Which is why credit where credit is due As a liquidity shock occurs the market usually does sell off so the converting to a cash position isn t actually the worst thing you could do But then again being cash gang means inflation gang is slowly eating your effective capital It also means you hold a position even more fucking boomer read boring as shit than investing in bonds Congrats Now that we established what interest rate risk is how it effects bonds and why we re likely to see a substantial amount of it in the coming months years it s time to narrow down the pool of bonds we could short Governments across the world are printing money like there s no tomorrow and this is because the growth corrected interest rate is negative It s not only negative in Europe and Japan but also much of the developing world Which means governments there are much likelier to take on higher amounts of debt Now mathematically speaking this is fine as long as compound growth outpaces or stays in line with compound interest this debt is manageable It becomes less and less of a burden with each subsequent year inflation The problem occurs when that growth is strained or when interest rates get hiked Most rates are effectively negative accounting for growth https preview redd it 7c49p6gckzj61 png width 318 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 11be27b9e3264f759ebade62098727b026bb1e75 I think the prime target is emerging market foreign junk grade corporate bonds that are denominated in USD The reason I say this is in the event of QT by the fed there will be a liquidity shock creating a spike in demand for US dollars which is what the world relies on for most global trade This makes the dollar gain value in relation to other currencies quite quickly and probably unexpectedly Unless the market prices this in which will see these bonds decrease in value anyway making your short position profitable Bonds from companies that primarily do business in local currencies but hold debt denominated in dollars face Exchange rate risk If the price of their local currency falls in relation to the US dollar they end up paying much more than expected in their local currency to keep up with their payments If this is not an investment grade bond it means rating agencies think the company has heightened default risk So this very well could be the straw that breaks the camel s back and bankrupts some of these companies even if they stay solvent I think the increased risk would cause a decent sell off Now because I m not blind and I see the sentiment on this sub and their views on short selling Unlike Melvin and co I am not over shorting or illegally naked short selling a company and directly engineering the failure of these assets companies I am merely using the data available to me and making a bet on where bond prices will be in a few years time If I enter this trade and or make money off it I will donate a portion of the winnings to a charity that operates within the emerging markets I shorted Why the fuck are you telling me this now if this isn t going to happen for a while Because the sooner individual investors recognize the opportunity the sooner individual investors can pick the best targets Furthermore all of this is for naught if rate hikes are priced in before individual investors enter their short position tHiS iS aLrEaDy PrIcEd iN No the fuck it isn t Why do you think there s usually a market selloff and downward pressure on debt markets directly following rate hike announcements Unless the news is ridiculously old most of the time it isn t priced in I watched you retards claim Disney was priced in for weeks and I still saw Disney s stock spike on rollout day DISCLAIMERS Disclaimer I am not as familiar with debt markets as I am with derivative and equity markets so I may have missed something obvious There s a reason I post this shit before I actually call my broker to initiate the short position I am also not a certified financial advisor investment in any security poses risk Not all positions are suitable for all investors Keep your goals needs and risk appetite in mind before you invest Disclaimer 2 Shorting debt instruments like bonds carries hidden interest payment risk You re liable for paying the interest payments until you close out of your short position Bonds are also much less liquid than stocks so finding bonds to close out your position could be difficult Shorting is also an unlimited risk strategy So idk maybe buy calls on the bonds to hedge Let me know what you think Am I the next Dr Michael McFlurry Burry or the most retarded thing this sub has seen since Robinhood box spreads I don t want to go full retard so I figured I d let you glorious autists critique my position Tell me if how I m wrong etc

20of 20Bruce 20stock Gilbert began buying up shares of Bruce in February 1958 at 16 875 to acquire majority ownership of the company As Gilbert bought more and more shares Bruce s stock price rose and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like Bruce wasn t worth the price it was trading at In the process Gilbert was acquiring all the float in Bruce s stock As the price of Bruce stock rose further the shorts were forced to cover their positions On June 12 1958 the American Stock Exchange suspended trading in E L Bruce Stock when the stock soared to 77 a share Shares were in short supply because the management of E L Bruce owned 50 of the outstanding shares and Gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50 of Bruce stock The shares that were sold short represented the balance between Bruce and Gilbert Typically in a situation like this the exchange would step in negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position and settle outstanding short contracts for cash but Gilbert didn t want to do this Gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned E L Bruce Corp Although the American Stock Exchange required that all shorts cover their positions the stock no longer traded on the ASE and the shorts had to find shares over the counter This led to a mad scramble among the shorts and the stock reportedly traded as high as 190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions Short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16 134 shares on May 15 to 6 440 shares by August 15 and to 3 500 shares by September 4 The remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no fair market in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established however in Aronson v McCormick the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares https globalfinancialdata com the piggly crisis Saunders vs the Shorts Clarence Saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the New York Stock Exchange in 1923 The corner became so prominent that the whole affair became known as the Piggly Crisis Clarence Saunders was generous determined stubborn and well known in Memphis Saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of Wall Street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in Piggly Wiggly stock The goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them When the stock declines in price the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price make a profit and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from In a bear raid several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline The bulls on the other hand can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss If the bulls can buy up the existing float the stock is cornered The shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand Of course creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock Once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price little demand is left for the stock The price of the stock can collapse leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt The whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls Piggly Wiggly shares started trading over the counter in July 1920 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE in June 1922 In November 1922 several of the independently owned Piggly Wiggly stores in New York New Jersey and Connecticut failed and went into receivership Although Saunders corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable some Wall Street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on Piggly Wiggly stock The bear raiders began selling PIggly Wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape Saunders took this challenge personally He had created Piggly Wiggly stores created the concept of self shopping was spreading his stores across the country and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores Saunders decided to beat the Wall Street professionals at their own game Saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis Nashville New Orleans Chattanooga and St Louis to buy up the existing float In the Wall Street of the 1920s bear raids came and went Companies didn t go bankrupt because of bear raids and if the fundamentals of the company were sound the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over Nevertheless Saunders refused to give in to the Wall Street city slickers Saunders hired Jesse L Livermore the most famous bear on Wall Street to help him break the back of the bear raiders Within a week Livermore had bought 105 000 shares of Piggly Wiggly over half the float of 200 000 shares The bears had shorted Piggly Wiggly stock in the 40 range but by January Saunders bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60 The shorts were losing money The Shorts Are Cornered Piggly shares were traded on both the Chicago and New York Stock Exchanges In January the Chicago Exchange announced that the stock had been cornered though the NYSE denied that a corner existed So Saunders decided to try a new tack He announced that he would issue 50 000 shares of Piggly Wiggly shares at 55 each Saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors Saunders pointed out that Piggly Wiggly stock paid a 1 per quarter dividend yielding 7 to investors Since this occurred before the S E C came into existence Saunders could promise that this was a once in a lifetime opportunity and get away with it Since Piggly stock was then trading at 70 why would Saunders offer shares at 55 leaving 15 on the table for each of the 50 000 shares The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered the demand for Piggly stock would dry up Saunders stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan put 25 down and pay 10 a month for three months Since the new shareholders couldn t sell their shares until they were paid for this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions On March 19 Saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1 128 shares of Piggly Wiggly s outstanding shares He had cornered the shorts On Tuesday March 20 Saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him By the rules of the exchange the shorts were required to produce the shares by 2 15 on March 21 The stock opened on the March 20 at 75 moved up to 124 by noon but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the Exchange planned to suspend trading in Piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts It was no rumor The NYSE did suspend trading in the stock Saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on Thursday the 22nd by 3 p m at 150 per share Thereafter his price would be 250 per share The exchange permanently halted trading in Piggly and gave the shorts until 5 p m on Monday the 26th to settle with Saunders With this ruling the NYSE saved the shorts This postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1 128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to Saunders Was it right for the Exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in Northern Pacific in 1901 Or should the Exchange have left the shorts to their fate The NYSE justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market Saunders Wins a Pyrrhic Victory On Friday the 23rd Saunders offered to settle at 100 per share In the meantime the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in Iowa or New Mexico to cover their positions Shareholders in Sioux City who knew nothing of the Piggly Crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere 100 Saunders now had complete control of Piggly stock but he was also deeply in debt It is estimated that Saunders made half a million dollars out of his corner but that proved insufficient to cover his costs After Saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds he found that he was five million dollars short half of which was due on September 1 1923 and the balance on January 1 1924 Since Piggly shares could no longer trade on the NYSE Saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again offering Piggly Wiggly shares at 55 Although the public was sympathetic toward Saunders and his battle against the Wall Street bears the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay Saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if Piggly Wiggly were ruined it would shame the whole South Memphis s newspaper The Commercial Appeal lined themselves behind Saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince Memphians to buy Piggly Wiggly shares and save their local boy The newspaper planned a three day campaign to sell 50 000 shares to Memphians at 55 a share This was to be an all or nothing proposition If they were unable to sell all 50 000 shares none would be sold The campaign began on May 8 and soon 23 698 shares had been subscribed Despite this skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign Saunders or the public They asked for a spot audit of Piggly Wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment Saunders refused the audit but offered to step down and let a committee run the company Skeptics also asked why Saunders was still building his million dollar Pink Palace when Piggly Wiggly was possibly in its last throes The Pink Palace was a huge house built using pink Georgia marble The Palace was to include a pipe organ Roman atrium indoor swimming pool ballroom bowling alley its own golf course and other luxuries Saunders promised to board up the Pink Palace and stop construction Unfortunately the campaign was unable to sell even 25 000 shares and the campaign soon fizzled Saunders responded by selling Piggly Wiggly stores rather than stock to raise money Despite selling stores in Chicago Denver Kansas City and elsewhere Saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the September 1 payment of 2 5 million Saunders turned over his Piggly Wiggly Stock the Pink Palace which was sold to the city of Memphis for 150 000 and opened as a museum in 1930 Today it includes a replica of the first Piggly Wiggly store a planetarium a natural history museum and a museum of twentieth century Memphis and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan By Spring Saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings If Saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy Pride went before the fall https www americanheritage com jacob schiff and northern pacific corner 2 In 1901 James J Hill who controlled the Great Northern Railroad and was the largest stockholder in the Northern Pacific used the latter to seize control of the Chicago Burlington and Quincy a smaller road that threatened the Union Pacific s territory When Hill refused to address Harriman s concerns Harriman determined to get control of the Burlington by seizing control of the Northern Pacific Morgan was Hill s banker so an attack on Hill was a direct attack on Morgan Before long Schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock which had equal voting rights in Northern Pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority Morgan and Hill had been caught napping Morgan was in Europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150 000 common shares of Northern Pacific at the opening of the market on Monday morning May 6 1901 If Hill could get a majority of the common he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control The cost at the very least would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars Morgan cabled his immediate approval and the battle was joined between the titans Those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves On Monday morning Harriman and Morgan held between them 630 000 of the 800 000 shares of Northern Pacific common in existence By the close of the market on Tuesday the Morgan bank had purchased 124 000 shares more That left only 46 000 shares un accounted for But the volume of Northern Pacific for those two days totaled 539 000 shares The vast majority of these of course had been sold short When too late the short sellers realized what was really happening panic swept the Street Suddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary As they liquidated their other assets to buy Northern Pacific stocks and bonds plunged Morgan s new U S Steel which had been at 54 only a few days earlier skidded from 40 to 26 on Thursday morning while Northern Pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute One broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from Albany Another incautiously admitting he had 10 000 shares to sell was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the Exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price That morning the firm of Street and Norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share ten times what the price had been a week earlier By noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the Street itself The Morgan bank and Kuhn Loeb called a hasty truce They would buy no more Northern Pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at 150 a share Calm began to return to Wall Street Kuhhn Loeb had fought the Morgan bank to a standstill This allowed Harriman to get what he really wanted which was not control of the Northern Pacific but attention to his interests from the Northern Pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary the Chicago Burlington and Quincy Railroad Harriman was soon on the board The New York Times likened the affair to so many cowboys on a spree shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders It is ironic that Morgan and Schiff so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of American business were among the principal antagonists in Wall Street s last great railroad war so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the Civil War era https www ft com content 0a58b63a 4294 3e07 8390 c3aabef39a26 https www reuters com article us volkswagen idUSTRE49R3I920081028 FRANKFURT Reuters Volkswagen VOWG DE briefly became the world s biggest company by market value on Tuesday as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by Porsche PSHG p DE Short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1 005 euros a share during the session following Sunday s news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market At that price Volkswagen s voting stock was worth 296 billion euros 370 billion or more than the 343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil XOM N VW shares later closed trading on Tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros The share price has rocketed since Porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on Sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of Volkswagen s voting shares In March when Porsche was still sitting on a long held 31 percent direct stake it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent bearing in mind that the state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake in VW The speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of VW Porsche said at the time In view of the fact that Lower Saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of VW the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low Meanwhile on Tuesday a spokesman for German market regulator BaFin said it was looking into the VW share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation Porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect We vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation a spokesman for Porsche said The ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling Volkswagen share price Porsche s statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42 6 percent held a further 31 5 percent in cash settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world s third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year It said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in VW were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets without haste and without greater risk Around 12 8 percent of Volkswagen s entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25 the most recent day for which data was available according to financial market data consultant dataexplorers com This compared with an average 5 percent for all DAX stocks The mother of all short squeezes as one analyst phrased it led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by Porsche Dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed VW shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of Porsche s holding Someone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses because someone must have lost a lot of money said Christian Schick head of portfolio management in Germany for Fortis Investments Shares in Morgan Stanley MS N Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS N and France s Societe Generale SOGN PA all tumbled on Tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving Volkswagen Goldman declined to comment but people inside the company said it had no Volkswagen losses while a Morgan Stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker SocGen could not immediately be reached for comment but earlier on Tuesday said it was sticking with its third quarter earnings forecast VOLKSWAGEN DAX WEIGHTING Shares in VW were up 45 percent at 689 9 euros by 1604 GMT after tripling at one point in the previous session This meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009 at a massive premium to rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203 T and Daimler DAIGn DE Analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for German large caps but they could foresee VW shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels The problem is from a fundamental point of view shares are really overvalued But when the short squeeze comes to an end there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down said one Frankfurt based analyst Despite the massive rise in VW shares and talk of little free float remaining the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said it did not plan any changes in the German blue chip DAX index But Wolfgang Gerke a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange s Exchange Council told manager magazin s online portal that VW stock should be reweighted on the German DAX bluechip index as soon as possible When asked about the current nearly 17 percent weighting that Volkswagen s stock has on the gauge Gerke said Deutsche Boerse needs to act now and reduce VW s weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the rise in the Volkswagen share price and the Economy Ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment https www marketwatch com story squeeze on goldman put falcone in penalty box 2013 08 21 Philip Falcone the billionaire hedge fund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement did something many people on Wall Street wish they could do He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid In 2006 Goldman Sachs GS 2 53 as the great cephalopod is officially known was shorting distressed high yield bonds from a bathroom fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc Goldman one of the most powerful investment banks in the world was also encouraging its customers to do the same Poor MAAX The company was just trying to make shower doors sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean Poor Falcone His Harbinger Capital owned a ton of these MAAX bonds and Goldman was flushing them right down the drain It is an awful thing to learn Goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it People often respond to such news in crazy ways You might remember a firm called Lehman Brothers back in 2008 blaming the entire financial crisis on short sellers including a short selling cabal led by Goldman Lehman fired back by getting the Securities and Exchange Commission to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks As for Falcone well he responded in his own way He grew up playing hockey in a dying Minnesota mining town not far from the Canadian border He made it to the pros in Sweden and now owns a piece of the NHL s Minnesota Wild In hockey if another player smacks you against the wall you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face In hockey this is called sportsmanship Falcone according to his confessional settlement with the SEC sought revenge against his opponent Falcone bought up every piece of the MAAX bond offering there was He even bought more than there was According to the SEC he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued because on Wall Street you can always buy stuff that doesn t actually exist This move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that Goldman was trying to short and it put Goldman right up against the wall Goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position That s when Falcone said something like Hey squid You want some MAAX bonds I got your MAAX bonds right here and then demanded that Goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds Now I am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault This call doesn t happen very often though in an arena where such violations occur all the time The SEC came down on Falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid forcing not just an 18 million settlement and a five year ban from the industry but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong Today s charges read like the final exam in a graduate school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully said Robert Khuzami in 2012 when he was then director of the SEC s enforcement division and announced the charges against Falcone I very naively had no idea business schools taught such courses Perhaps now that Falcone has been banned from his industry he can go back to his alma mater Harvard University and teach them Clients and market participants alike were victimized as Falcone manipulated the market for certain bonds and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales Khuzami added https moxreports com kbio infinity squeeze Removed to keep within character limit https nypost com 2017 11 01 ackman has bailed out of his short position on herbalife After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street Bill Ackman has finally given up his 1 billion short bet against Herbalife The embattled hedge fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a pyramid scheme and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife s stock falls But Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer Herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company which vehemently denies Ackman s allegations that it practices a predatory business model The rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a short squeeze in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they ve sold to make their bearish bets a move that also drives up the price Among those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis billionaire Carl Icahn who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares There is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC Instead of shorting Herbalife Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don t pose the risk of a short squeeze Unlike holding shares short where Pershing Square s losses could be unlimited Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital what he called modest investment Nevertheless They re going to charge Ackman a premium for the privilege of him owning a put Ihor Dusaniwsky head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post Ackman s dealer who sold the put option now holds the short position according to Dusaniwksy Ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety Dusaniwsky said estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated 455 million paper loss on Herbalife Pershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet or the terms on the new put options it has purchased But that didn t stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company We ve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business We ve been wrong on the share price Ackman told CNBC Herbalife s stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down Pershing Square is down 5 8 percent through the end of September Reps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment Herbalife shares were down 2 4 percent at 70 85 Wednesday https medium com KeithAkre vanderbilt and the greatest corner never told 12f1bffe4d1d The Harlem and the Hudson were both poorly run lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable Vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto Manhattan island Sensing an opportunity he started to accumulate shares in Harlem At the same time Vanderbilt was buying there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short That is they were borrowing shares and selling with the hope to buy them back at a lower price netting the difference This group of sellers bears in Wall Street parlance included members of the New York City council as well as members of the board of directors for Harlem rail One of those board members was long time Vanderbilt rival Daniel Drew With all these inside interests betting on the price of Harlem to go down there had to be something going on Sure enough a franchise bill that authorized Harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded The price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory except that Mr Vanderbilt was still on the other side buying everything that was being sold Not only did the stock stop going down but it started to rise quickly Now for those that do not know shorting a stock can be a dangerous business When you buy a stock go long you only have your investment to lose If you pay 100 for a stock it can only go to 0 thereby wiping out your investment However if you borrow a stock and sell it short there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing If you borrow shares and sell them at 100 and the price goes to 200 you have lost your entire investment But if the price goes to 300 or 400 you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position Now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock If you sold it short at 100 and now you have to buy it back to cover your position what price does the owner set This is the danger of being caught short when someone has cornered the market As John Brooks explains in his classic Once in Golconda Since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price any finite one is a theoretically a bargain This is what happened to the short sellers of Harlem stock Vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy In order to escape complete ruin the city council gave back Harlem s franchise which now Vanderbilt owned outright Already this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the Commodore a ton of money in the process However this was just the beginning Watching this epic battle unfold some Wall Street speculators decided to attack the neighboring Hudson rail line This group thought that Vanderbilt must be short of cash after all that buying and attention and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit What they did not know was that Vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying Hudson shares using futures This was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date The intermediaries Vanderbilt used were actually part of the short selling group who would gladly accept the options from the Commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market Little did the bears know they were selling this stock to allies of Vanderbilt who far from being short on cash still had plenty of powder left When finally he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except Vanderbilt himself Mercifully instead of raising the price to infinity Vanderbilt let the short sellers off relatively easy They weren t ruined merely badly burned Within the span of a couple months Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to Manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process Daniel Drew still stung from his losses in the failed Harlem short decided he wanted one more crack He convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of Albany to revoke the franchise for Harlem overriding the city council If they revoked the license and shorted Harlem stock they could make a bit of money as well This turned out to be a fateful mistake From The Great Game Drew s scheme was of course a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring One is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted The statesmen at Albany E C Stedman a veteran of Wall Street in the 1860 s wrote at the turn of the century in the spring of 1864 were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at New York had plunged themselves less than a year before by their bear campaign against this stock Yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt as if Vanderbilt has proved an easy victim Interestingly the timing on this second attempt to bear raid Harlem stock was in favor of the shorts The price went from 140 down to 101 The greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here Instead of covering at a net profit of almost 40 per share the shorts tried to press their advantage They held on hoping to see it drop to 50 Despite really not being very liquid this time around the Commodore was still not easily defeated He rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock The price rose to 109 then to 125 and by the end of April was all the way to 224 Feeling less charitable than the last time Vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price Asked what to do he bellowed Put it to a thousand Fortunately for the shorts and their brokerage houses who also would have been decimated at that price Vanderbilt relented and settled at 285 The second Harlem corner was over and there would not be another Indeed for a full generation on Wall Street the phrase short of Harlem meant much the same thing as up the creek

insurance https en wikipedia org wiki Car insurance to drivers in 30 U S states Root requires drivers to download their mobile app https en wikipedia org wiki Mobile app and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background If the driver passes the driving test they are offered a premium https en wikipedia org wiki Insurance premium which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies Root offers a discount to Tesla owners who drive using Autosteer https en wikipedia org wiki Tesla Autopilot Autosteer mode making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a semi autonomous vehicle https en wikipedia org wiki Autonomous car Semi automated vehicles In 2020 Root had its initial public offering https en wikipedia org wiki Initial public offering IPO where shares sold at 27 each raising 724 4 million which was the largest IPO in Ohio history Now after half a year they are sitting at all time low of 13 https preview redd it vbxtfuld22k61 jpg width 624 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292 As you can see above this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars It got swept hard due to no momentum due to no interest in the stock then shorted the shit out of it Now In the lows undervalued bound to recover worst case is NEUTRAL Third sibling of Lemonade stock Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person s driving skills Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone and it tracks their driving allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share Lemonade is an insurance company like Root except they are NOT a TECH company Their business model is just traditional reinsurance The only thing tech about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good So this brings me to my next point valuations Lemonade as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company They have a QUARTER YES A QUARTER of Root s sales 97Mil vs 402Mil respectively and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW 6 55B vs 4 58B respectively Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies But no it is literally the same as every other insurance company While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been This text was a quote from a reddit user u peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts What is their current situation amp x200B https preview redd it tblgfbtg22k61 jpg

98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4 As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27 down to 14 then up to 25 and down a whooping 50 to 12 9 First time it was around their first earnings December 1st The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17 18 to 14 The exact same situation happened now It went all across down to 12 9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee but a huge amount of shares I also preview an image from their statistics of shares 14 shares floated 40 held by institutions Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid 19 and having to drop premiums and plans They reported an OK quarter but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below

believe I have a decent knowledge of it But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate I expect puts to be already exercised and closed Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12 5 the MOST while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15 now we are literally in the lowest point possible We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15 17 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks I do not expect a rapid price change but a bit green color is to be seen Volume Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down Now I am no expert but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where if the stock was shorted oversold etc it rebounded days and or weeks after I share the images below What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting

amp s 204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df Lock up season for hunting up in April after that good to buy But what if it is still not worth it to buy Well we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios First of all as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known ROOT sucks at marketing even Lemonade is better than that and they don t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO They cut expenses they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available They also have 30 states in their contracts but have not yet acquired New York and I believe not sure about this one California some other states as well The competition in insurance business is quite strong difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road Q4 report and team guidance So basically what will you get from reading the transcript Well quite literally they are in the weeds little weeds maybe moderate They are battling losses and licking up their wounds planning out future funds and revenues marketing they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses but expect to double triple expenses in the future But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be expenses to be gains to be literal metrics and good guidance they are on course for long term and are here to stay worst case scenario This will bounce back after covid 19 overall entire industry of insurance is Some of transcripts you read are mostly reports on earnings revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever Look at SPCE transcript no revenue no guidance and look at the price market cap Guidance is key and in most scenarios I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part To me it said that basically look we are aware that covid 19 drilled our asses but we have a plan nothings changed we met our metrics and stayed on course This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago I believe a rebound is soon to happen

better GUIDANCE TLDR Root Inc is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to be known wise This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50 Last time this happened it bounced back to near original price immediately in a week They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13 14 dollars line I believe same thing will happen now we have strong resistance in 13 14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15 17 20 dollars I would buy shares calls for mid late March expiry recovery and puts for April share lockup ends Share price now good for both short term AND long term which I like a lot TLDR of TLDR All time low strong resistance line does not look like a falling knife short percentage big volume more than 400 on Friday bound

thought but in A DIFFERENT WAY,Hey folks I m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers but over the last few days I ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance but actually UNDERPLAYING it Apologies for the lack of rockets but I m not writing this on a phone Have fun with all the text So The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills which was often along the lines of well yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares but since the effective GME float is whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares again reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago significantly larger than the 1 or so of VW shares there was in effect the 13 short interest on VW led to a 13 1 short float ratio meanwhile GME would by nature of its much larger float have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far far greater short interest math 101 I accepted this for the last few weeks but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned TL DR You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share as long as you make an infinite number of transactions but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share Let s explain that for those that don t immediately get the logic Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW Presumably the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way you start with 0 shares you borrow one from a broker you now have 1 shares you sell that share completing your short you now have 0 shares Now imagine the short squeeze happens And let s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each The thing is you can buy a share off the market returning your total to 1 shares before you return it to 0 shares by giving it to your broker Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts and they to other shorts etc The point being when working with real shares an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts while still driving the price up Now here s the kicker which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund named Delvin Capital You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting you start with 0 shares you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker you sell a share promising to fulfill the step you just skipped sometime soonish maybe you now have 1 shares Now the squeeze happens as above But this time the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned and also made naked short positions Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy you buy that one share off the market to cover your short Notice your total is not positive but only 0 since you were actually negative to begin with Thus you can t give these shares to your broker or another fund since doing so would only return you to a negative value THE POINT BEING naked shorts unlike normal PG 13 shorts have what is effectively a 1 1 COVER RATIO The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is as far as I can reason IMPOSSIBLE Maybe that s why they haven t squeezed yet Here s where VW vs GME comes back in though GME s nominal institutional ownership is over 100 Furthermore with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100 When you consider that with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION this 1 1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts their desperation seems to have been if anything undervalued this whole time The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH which makes this fucking crazy Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold it is not just exceedingly costly but impossible for them to cover If you ve gotten this far congratulations Now think about that again Effective TL DR 2 0 People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule Probably pretty fucking high VW may be a good example But here s MY question What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it VW is definitely not a good example If anything it s an understatement I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we ve never ever seen before in all of financial history Please reflect on this and correct me if I m wrong I hope I m not Joy to all Unimportant this is not financial advise and I am not a financial advisor
