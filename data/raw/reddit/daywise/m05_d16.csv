actually ARE rational To start out i d like to say this will be full of totally non referenced facts that i ve heard over the years in reading books studies and video presentations If that bothers you stop reading If you are still here I want to outline the difference between Apes and Autists why they have a hard time understanding each other and how each type of person can be profitable in the stonk markets Agenda 1 First I will describe how to determine if you are an Ape or an Autist 2 Second I will describe how each should approach investing using this forum and the world around them 3 Third I will summarize why both Autists and Apes Cost hedge funds bigtime money in the internet age and explain some common phenomenon in current markets to back up my theories Summarizing eventually why markets are currently rational Part 1 intelligence actually does matter To determine if we are autist or ape we need to make a few assumptions 1 Autist here refers to someone not just on the spectrum but of above average intelligence likely by a few tiers I will use IQ for this conversation Why does this matter There are many tests to determine intelligence but IQ has been proven to be the best most reliable test That said it isn t overall very reliable at all Scores can range for the same person from 10 20 depending on the type of test Given all of that let s accept this assumption as a way to speak on intelligence Are we discounting the genius artists and visionaries that would score below average on an IQ test Sure But those people probably aren t in the market anyways Now that we know how important IQ is the problem becomes much more interesting Studies show that a person with an 80IQ has a hard time understanding how a person with a 100IQ thinks However a person with a 100IQ has just about as hard of a time understanding the 100IQ person For reference an IQ of about 110 would be needed to be a decent performing college student at a main university Genius level IQ would start at about 140 and go to 180 and higher There are approximately 25 of the population of geniuses or 200M people on this planet APES by IQ If you are at about 80 120IQ you are probably an ape There are differing levels of ape but you will have an easier time understanding how each other think AUTISTS by IQ At about 140IQ and above you are disconnected from the reality of how others think and live It s possible you aren t even on the spectrum believe it or not autism is not usually associated with high IQ its a myth still 25 chance of genius What if you can t take an IQ test to determine this Here is where I help you APE by OUTLOOK You work a shitty job and you think other people are really smart You tell your smart friends how you think one of your buddies is like good will hunting They aren t You probably have good work ethic if you are a contributing member of society Often times the people you think are weird are just smarter than you If you think alot of people are weird probably an ape Generally if you are an APE you will be preety happy in life and will blame most of your failures on circumstance and bad luck You could be right but that doesn t matter The point is this is your personality AUTIST by OUTLOOK You probably also work a shitty job and you used to think other people were really smart You had friends that told you dude X person is like good will hunting and you got excited to meet them You are always let down when you meet them Because you fit into a super high of IQ you will have a super hard time understanding anyone For this reason you have few friends you can connect with You are probably generally unhappy and you blame yourself If you have a good job you are probably still unhappy because you see people that you know without a doubt are retarded in charge of you as managers You are probably right This is most likely your personality Part 2 How should each invest APES You need to realize you are NEVER going to be able to analyze financials Just stop trying Your strength is you understand how the average American thinks When something gets hyped pumped get in early and just sell before the hype dies down You need to stay on social media with your friends tick tok instagram twitter etc and make trades FAST Speed is your greatest ally take tips from others and trade with SPEED You are gambling this is a wendys you need to buy in when it starts getting hyped and sell when its STILL hyped Not when the hype starts to die down So just live your life follow socials and trade FAST on HYPE Easy AUTISTS You yes you are the ones that complain when markets aren t rational because you read some books about PE s and some good DDs and all the numbers made sense Well guess what Numbers are only half the equation Public sentiment in gambling speculation all short term trading is gambling this is casino etc is super important You as an Autist cannot understand what the retarded Apes are doing It s like imagine you are in the forest and a group of gorillas come up to you and they are chilling and a big silverback rolls in ranting Would you have any idea what they are saying No but I bet the other gorillas figure it out faster than you It s the same with the Apes If you want to make money you have to either learn to understand Ape thought processes and logic or lack thereof OR trade only on numbers and extreme logic You are most likely to do well trading on numbers and extreme logic but with longer time lines So Leaps are probably better than FDs for you or even owning shares However when you hit you will hit BIG if you go in on FDs Michael Burry a self proclaimed autist and king of autists even himself almost went tits up if the housing market didn t crash soon enough Keep in mind Autists you may only be a college professor type intelligence of like 120IQ and you aren t a genius If you can memorize a shit ton of numbers but can t make mind leaps you will get burned so so hard when you think you are being perfectly logical Part 3 IS THE MARKET RATIONAL Yes The problem is it s rational for the majority of the population that are Apes Sub 140IQ etc It s a problem of perspective For APEs it really is as simple as AMC movies movies open soon must buy movies It s likely those that think the market is irrational are 1 confused apes that are parroting a line they don t understand BuY tHe dIp or 2 agitated autists who just can t see or understand 60 IQ points below them where the logic is much simpler and hype is much more effective It truly does all come down to no one can see above or below their IQ Implications and conclusion How does the rise of the Apes in investing thus dominate the market The average American just has a shit ton of disposable income now In Austin Texas you have hobos with smart phones riding on scooters down the street They could easily open a robinhood app using the starbucks wifi they camp there literally and toss 500 on a yolo bet Middle or average Americans Apes have a stupid amount of buying power as a collective In most countries Autists and smart enterprising people use govt corruption and money to destroy a middle class and concentrate wealth at the top This keeps their money in the hands of rational autists Doesn t work in America not yet Here retards got moneys Hedge funds really really don t like this To be honest most hedge fund types are actually autists They are extremely smart logical people Probably most successful decision makers are genius or close to genius at least on an IQ test They just don t see the apes coming and the internet has made ape s ability to mobilize and their velocity extreme Now that even low IQ minimum wage apes that work in Wendy s can invest with stuff like robinhood makes it simple enough to trade for a retard we truly have a threat to the system And it s all ultimately a translation problem If payment for orderflow didn t exist they would face existential issues Love it or hate it Apes are here to stay It s literally market of the apes and I love it amp x200B An Ape probably

buddies is like good will hunting They aren t You probably have good work ethic if you are a contributing member of society Often times the people you think are weird are just smarter than you If you think alot of people are weird probably an ape Generally if you are an APE you will be preety happy in life and will blame most of your failures on circumstance and bad luck You could be right but that doesn t matter The point is this is your personality ARTIST by OUTLOOK You probably also work a shitty job and you used to think other people were really smart You had friends that told you dude X person is like good will hunting and you got excited to meet them You are always let down when you meet them Because you fit into a super high of IQ you will have a super hard time understanding anyone For this reason you have few friends you can connect with You are probably generally unhappy and you blame yourself If you have a good job you are probably still unhappy because you see people that you know without a doubt are retarded in charge of you as managers You are probably right This is most likely your personality Part 2 How should each invest APES You need to realize you are NEVER going to be able to analyze financials Just stop trying Your strength is you understand how the average American thinks When something gets hyped pumped get in early and just sell before the hype dies down You need to stay on social media with your friends tick tok instagram twitter etc and make trades FAST Speed is your greatest ally take tips from others and trade with SPEED You are gambling this is a wendys you need to buy in when it starts getting hyped and sell when its STILL hyped Not when the hype starts to die down So just live your life follow socials and trade FAST on HYPE Easy ARTISTS You yes you are the ones that complain when markets aren t rational because you read some books about PE s and some good DDs and all the numbers made sense Well guess what Numbers are only half the equation Public sentiment in gambling speculation all short term trading is gambling this is casino etc is super important You as an Artist cannot understand what the retarded Apes are doing It s like imagine you are in the forest and a group of gorillas come up to you and they are chilling and a big silverback rolls in ranting Would you have any idea what they are saying No but I bet the other gorillas figure it out faster than you It s the same with the Apes If you want to make money you have to either learn to understand Ape thought processes and logic or lack thereof OR trade only on numbers and extreme logic You are most likely to do well trading on numbers and extreme logic but with longer time lines So Leaps are probably better than FDs for you or even owning shares However when you hit you will hit BIG if you go in on FDs Michael Burry a self proclaimed autist and king of artists even himself almost went tits up if the housing market didn t crash soon enough Keep in mind Artists you may only be a college professor type intelligence of like 120IQ and you aren t a genius If you can memorize a shit ton of numbers but can t make mind leaps you will get burned so so hard when you think you are being perfectly logical Part 3 IS THE MARKET RATIONAL Yes The problem is it s rational for the majority of the population that are Apes Sub 140IQ etc It s a problem of perspective For APEs it really is as simple as AMC movies movies open soon must buy movies It s likely those that think the market is irrational are 1 confused apes that are parroting a line they don t understand BuY tHe dIp or 2 agitated autists who just can t see or understand 60 IQ points below them where the logic is much simpler and hype is much more effective It truly does all come down to no one can see above or below their IQ Implications and conclusion How does the rise of the Apes in investing thus dominate the market The average American just has a shit ton of disposable income now In Austin Texas you have hobos with smart phones riding on scooters down the street They could easily open a robinhood app using the starbucks wifi they camp there literally and toss 500 on a yolo bet Middle or average Americans Apes have a stupid amount of buying power as a collective In most countries Artists and smart enterprising people use govt corruption and money to destroy a middle class and concentrate wealth at the top This keeps their money in the hands of rational artists Doesn t work in America not yet Here retarts got moneys Hedge funds really really don t like this To be honest most hedge fund types are actually artists They are extremely smart logical people Probably most successful decision makers are genius or close to genius at least on an IQ test They just don t see the apes coming and the internet has made ape s ability to mobilize and their velocity extreme Now that even low IQ minimum wage apes that work in Wendy s can invest with stuff like robinhood makes it simple enough to trade for a retart we truly have a threat to the system And it s all ultimately a translation problem If payment for orderflow didn t exist they would face existential issues Love it or hate it Apes are here to stay It s literally market of the apes and I love it An guy probably

given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery confidence remains extremely weak The importance of weak confidence also affects the risk business owners will take concerning capital expenditures employment and sales Importantly this is a sentiment based survey Such is a crucial concept to understand as planning to do something and doing it can be very different An Economic Boom Will Require Participation Currently many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021 The basis of those expectations is massive pent up demand as the economy reopens I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or pent up consumption into the present However the NFIB survey also suggests much the same Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don t have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings As such they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability If businesses were expecting a massive surge in pent up demand they would be doing several things to prepare for it Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand Unfortunately those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows Employment To Remain Weak If small businesses think the economy is actually improving over the longer term they would also be increasing employment Given business owners are always optimistic over estimating hiring plans is not surprising However reality occurs when actual demand meets its operating cash flows To increase employment which is the single most considerable cost to any business you need two things 1 Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future which leads to 2 The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand Currently there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy amp x200B https preview redd it qgpd1rqeshz61 png width 804 amp format png amp auto

current demand As such they can not commit to the costs of long term employment for a short term artificial economic boost The Big Hit Is Coming Retail sales make up about 40 of personal consumption expenditures PCE which comprises roughly 70 of the GDP calculation Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality amp x200B https preview redd it 9vqsosfkshz61 png width 876 amp format png amp auto webp amp s d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17 While stimulus may lead to a short term boost in consumption the impact of higher taxes more regulations and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer term Despite economic headlines the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than booming A Recovery Versus An Expansion With this background it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small cap stocks may be premature While small cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity Currently the run up remains the assumption that the stimulus fueled recovery is sustainable Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually However since deficit based spending is deflationary https realinvestmentadvice com macroview a vaccine and the new new normal the outcome will fall well short of expectations gt in 1998 the Federal Reserve crossed the Rubicon whereby

8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e Conclusion Given that debt driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee While there are indeed inflationary pressures short term as the massive infusions coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks higher prices will erode purchasing power The decline in purchasing power combined with higher input costs and potentially higher taxes will continue to weigh on confidence near term There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters The damage from the shutdown on the economy and most importantly small business suggests recovery may remain elusive Most importantly there is a massive difference between getting back to even versus growing the economy One creates economic prosperity by expanding production which creates consumption The other does not Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom However it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends which help protect one s wealth longer term

go from here,Recently I ve been trying to put my thoughts and analysis down in writing instead of just living in my head as a way to fully think through what s rolling around in my head as I look at charts read articles listen to podcasts etc Every so often I start to see an opportunity to re assemble my view of the market and make some assertions and I think after last week this is one of those times Hopefully this doesn t end up too disjointed I m trying to put this together in the midst of a hangover either from last night my second covid shot yesterday or some combination of both and I m finding it a bit difficult to be any kind of articulate amp nbsp So I want to start by giving some disclosure on my recent positioning and what I m trying to get out of this In mid late April I switched into short positions on all indices and got long a VIX all through longer dated options We were chopping around ATHs things looked stretched stocks were selling off on huge earnings beats and seasonality was coming upon us So I took the viewpoint then that we d see some downside volatility sometime in May and I was anticipating a 5 10 pullback when all was said and done Well three weeks later we ve had a move to the downside but things kind of look different now and while I unwound some of my shorts last week I m trying to determine if this sell off is done or if we re due for a larger downside move Let s start with a look at overall market performance by sector Sector Performance 1y https imgur com LJ0t7jN Sector Performance 2021 YTD https imgur com lEBNPW2 I m using ARKK here as a proxy for high growth unprofitable companies since that s a lot of what they own Some notes Tech and in particular unprofitable tech has underperformed YTD since about mid Feb Financials Industrials and Energy have out performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart This reflation trade started in about mid February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year s growth trade has lagged and given back Now let s look at index performance SPY 1y https imgur com 6mXqqVF QQQ 1y https imgur com NVWss5e IWM 1y https imgur com SylCIJy I ve tried to highlight ranges pullbacks and bounces in these Take Aways QQQ IWM have been in this kind of chop zone since about mid Feb and technicals look somewhat bearish here SPY has maintained performance and along with the DOW not pictured has led the market higher Looking at the charts every pullback has been bought and we can t seem to get any meaningful breakdown Buy the dip has to continue to be the mantra Comparing these to our sector charts we can see we need to look at more than one thing to tell a story These indices due in part to how they are constructed do not highlight the rotation and churn that s been going on the rotation out of high growth stocks into value with the latter responsible for driving the market higher as of late To further illustrate that last point let s look at just one section of the market as an example Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value Selected Indices 1y https imgur com LJmHP8r Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post crash The Recent Pullback and What to do Next So I think a good place to start with respect to what next is to rehash this last week Starting off with a downside move this accelerated Wednesday as the market reacted to the CPI data I use quotes here because I don t fully buy the inflation narrative that the media is spinning and I think for the most part neither does the market Inflation is a whole separate post that I may do at some point Anyway we followed this sharp downside move with a sharp upside move and by the end of the week the damage wasn t all that bad However this snap back may be concerning in terms of legitimacy and at least as far as QQQ and IWM go we re still looking bearish To get an idea if the selling here might be done or not I thought it worth a look at some of QQQ s largest components individually AAPL 1y https imgur com Z0Bh0mD INTC 1y https imgur com VOwvNhH NVDA 1y https imgur com OmqYSET FB 1y https imgur com 4JgNVxl Along with some others not shown here these show a common pattern all sitting at some kind of support level If we see a breakdown below these levels watch out But I have a feeling we re largely done here Building a Thesis I m just gonna throw down some bullet points here based on the charts above market sentiment and some stuff I ve been reading Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way the reflation trade is the trend and no reason to fight it Tech growth seems to be at support and may indicate the recent selling here is done but that doesn t mean we re going to be seeing ATHs again here anytime soon Need to watch out for Fed tapering talk There is talk that the Fed will need to at least taper it s QE programs at some point and some expectation that could start to be communicated as early as June Market reaction here will be interesting Inflation reactions Along with the bond market and Fed I may believe that surprising inflation data will be temporary and normalize but we could see short term volatility around these events while the greater market digests it The leading sectors banks and industrials were looking pretty stretched at the beginning of this week Ending largely unchanged the volatility has helped reset some of those overbought indicators though they are still high I think weakness here could lead to a greater sell off and performance of these is something to closely watch Consider seasonality We re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall It s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short term trades going forward Buy The Fucking Dip I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have you can have a bearish view on this market given all the bullshit but there is no way in hell you can t be long right now Stay with the trend amp nbsp I think right now if you re long you need to be long banks industrials energy SPY I would stay away from growth and tech until we see these push ATHs e g IWM QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside stay out or short them

SE and More, Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation Week 5 HD WMT TGT LOW CSCO GOEV XL SE and More amp nbsp What s poppin bull gang Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week cause it s time to do it all again Earnings season is slowly coming to an end so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks but that s alright there s still money to be made amp nbsp All that being said I fucking love earnings season It s an absolute battleground out there Insane volatility breaking announcements and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time What s not to love Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers roll the dice and amass a small fortune That being said the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders many find that they re one bad trade away from a complete blowout so you always need to think about each trade critically No shame in sitting it out altogether amp nbsp The Spreadsheet To aid us in planning our trades this week I ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week https docs google com spreadsheets d 1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A jJQKiQ edit usp sharing Using this spreadsheet we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker Obviously past performance isn t indicative of future success but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information If you re struggling to find a given stock click on the ticker symbol on the index page it should hyperlink you straight to the table If the above link isn t working for you refer to the link below amp nbsp Spreadsheet HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A jJQKiQ edit usp sharing amp nbsp Please note that scraping and compiling this data took hours If the sheet has helped you out in any way please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials It would mean alot to me Most websites also require you to pay for this data which I think is a load of shit amp nbsp Interesting Observations and Sample Plays Below I ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance If I missed anything feel free to bring it to my attention amp nbsp Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week Home Depot Lowe s Walmart and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves but will likely break trend this earnings Last quarter was fucking massive for these retail giants as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer to either the upside or downside amp nbsp Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week If you re looking for a fun little collateral play you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another If one beats they usually all beat and vice versa amp nbsp Don t fall for the Solar trap Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings and are likely primed for a reversal There isn t much farther for these stocks to go down and as a result a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in If they even match estimates or put up a beat they will likely move upwards This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers amp nbsp Obviously since I gave data on over 50 companies there s plenty that I ve missed Dive in have a look around and have some fun with it Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes and get the best risk reward possible Feel free to share your findings too I d love to see what you guys come up with amp nbsp Conclusion We ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week meaning there s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles Use the spreadsheet https docs google com spreadsheets d 1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A jJQKiQ edit usp sharing to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio and play accordingly If enough people found these useful I ll continue making them throughout the earnings season If the sheet has helped you out in any way please consider dropping an upvote or a comment and checking out my socials it would mean a lot to me Happy Trading Everybody
