tendies,What up fart quaffers I ve got some truly mas puro retard shit for you guys to snort like a line of coarsely ground Adderall So scooch your beanbags up and gather round my little dick strokers and bean flickers see I can be gender inclusive Let s discuss why your uncle is more retarded than you and how you re gonna make money while he sends his social security checks to buy more tin foil First let me say if you re illiterate ass isn t here for story time just skip to the bottom TL DR and my positions are that a way So by now many of you probably know that the 5G spectrums are up for auction Verizon and T Mobile and to a lesser extent AT amp T because they is over leveraged bitches are gonna be throwing 90 s money at it Gonna make it rain like Jenna Jameson feature dancing at some vaporwave strip club in Tampa circa 97 Now before you start jizzing all over your JNCO jeans that s not the money we re after here There s a bigger pot about to be busted out and that goons and goblins is what we re aiming for You see your Kool aide drinking uncle is right about something 5G is gonna be massive and who the fuck cares if Bill gates is gonna use it to give us microchip suppositories while infecting us with the Rona You ll live and you ll make money while your uncle keeps shouting at clouds and chemtrails poor and destitute If only the bastard weren t as cruel as he is retarded you might use those tendies to put him in a nice home for retards somewhere warm like Florida He d fit right in What s the difference between 4G and 5G Fuck if I know do I look like an electronics nerd But I do know this rather than building one big ass tower that covers a large area 5G is gonna use a bunch of Christmas tree sized towers and spread them over several city blocks You hear that What once was one tower is now many Is your retarded brain starting to piece this shit together You know what you need to get all those towers and all that data talking to each other Muthafucking switches Yes basically a shittier version of the router that s collecting dust while half dangling off your desk So picture this I m sitting at the table in my crayon room trying to force the square peg into the round hole when I ask myself which cunt makes 5G switches Well I put my big boy pants on and started looking at Chinese shit emphasis on shit You see as a younger autist I once lived in China I even have a degree in their retarded ass laws omfg their constitution is such hot garbage it s like someone put Trump tweets through a Communist formal language translator seriously if you re at all interested in law go read it and laugh weep from one of their retarded universities There are three facts that made me realize that China is not the answer to this 1 Chinese quality is fucking shit I don t need no wumao apologists coming in here and telling me I m wrong because I m not Chinese craftsmanship is is like what you d produce if I asked you personally to bake a 3 tiered cake and then allowed you to frost it with Play doh Everything is about cutting corners and covering it up with plastic it sucks Look at Ze Germans they re over there salting their pretzels with tears because ze machine do not look sexy enough Mutti whas rite I am failure Meanwhile in China they re wiping their tears with fermented tofu because they can t put poison into powdered milk you think I m joking 2 Not only is Chinese quality fucking shit it s riddled with goddamn spyware You know who is not gonna be cool with putting up a bunch of Christmas tree sized Chinese spies on every rooftop Hopefully fucking everybody well except Saudi Arabia we all know they ll just pay China to have a seat at the peepshow But for real President Xi has dramatically failed to engage in the world in good faith His predecessors were able to build good will and investment opportunities with the West but ever since Xi took over he s been pissing in Cheerios Indiscretions won t be waved away as aww look at that little shithole trying to pull itself up by the bootstraps anymore Nah we saw what happened with Huawei and we saw China nationalize Jack Ma s shit It s gonna go more in this direction under Xi and Chinese supply especially as it relates to data and information tech is only gonna be favored by jackboot cum guzzlers 3 IT S ALL FAKE GOVERNEMNT MANIPULATION Let me tell you a story about my time in Poohland You see if you want to open your Retards R Us store in China you gotta do the same bureaucratic bullshit like you do everywhere file your paperwork and wait But if you don t fucking offer a bribe your ass is gonna go broke waiting It s a goddamn institution They got these stores all they got inside is expensive whiskey and cartons of Marlboros that were made in 1987 No one ever buys from these stores because their prices are straight up ridiculous and who the fuck wants to smoke ciggies from back then but yet there they are What purpose do they serve Well when you go turn in your business application you swing by one of these stores pick up a carton of Marlboros that Ronald Regan farted on and make your way to either a some dingy ass Soviet dystopia looking ass building or b some super fancy and slick building that s got welds so shitty it look s like they tried to do them with chopsticks Either way when you slide your application across the desk slide that carton of Marlboros and whiskey too You know what fuckface on the other side does with it He goes right back to the goddamn store you were in 20 minutes ago and trades that shit for cash You know what else happens That store and the thousands if not millions like it pump those numbers into the economic reports Lord knows how much of their GDP is straight up due to corruption I m not even gonna begin to get into how the CCP manipulates markets and businesses all you need to know is you can make a quick buck off Chinese shit but ultimately you re holding fake ass doo doo that fell of the back of the truck Alright so we veered a little off course there but I say all that because I m gonna make the case for my boy ERIC You see ERIC is Swedish Sweden isn t pissing in anyone s Cheerios they re like the Canada of Europe When you think Sweden you think about a strange fascination with fermented fish kinda creepy avant garde movies and fucking STACKED blonde bikini models Take me to Valhalla you Swedish valkyries and sit on my face while you do it Sweden is the guy at the rave dressed in khakis asking how your family is doing and making sure everyone gets home safely Cool dude sk l You know what you would trust this motherfucker to do That s right you degenerates you d trust him to handle your fucking n00die pics He won t judge and he won t share So let s go hang out with ERIC for a moment he s got some meatballs and needs our help assembling flat pack furniture You see ERIC s been a busy lad You old Millennials and young Gen Xers might have even had a Sony Ericcsson phone back when nobody knew what the fuck a Yu Gi Oh is Sonny and ERIC dipped outta that scene when smartphones arrived and their bromance came to an end But ERIC is a nerd for this shit ERIC kept making comm tech when he wasn t too buys causing air traffic incidents with Surstr mming You know what his hard work got him Fucking becoming a pioneer in 5G tech As far as I m aware ERIC is the only muthafucka to have his shit on 4 continents so far ERIC got in this door early and unlike that Chinese shit it s good fucking quality and not trying to exploit you Furthermore EU is gonna love supporting one of their own especially after Xi been pissing in Mama Merkel s Cheerios America too is gonna start being more suspicious of China we ve seen it happen but fucking ERIC ERIC s cool man he ain t pissing in our Cheerios we ain t got beef with him handling data Our drunk girlfriend tried to hook up with him but he just took her to get some Mickey D s Class fucking act real stand up dude But alright we know ERIC is cool and that he isn t gonna threaten to send our dick pic collection to our mamas We know that ERIC has been making something that is about to be in high demand and that he is quite good at it We also know he has been busy getting his product out across the world ahead of his competitors and that his biggest competitors produce snitch ass dogshit Yeah just swiping through WSB Tinder ERIC looking kinda juicy Let s see what his bio says Oh shit dawgs are you seeing these charts That steady growth Look at how that sonuvabitch just shrugged off COVID and kept going all viking on his shit Not only did ERIC shrug off COVID he fucking feasted on it Look at that j vel make his money And what s this The motherfucker is integrating automated drone corridors with his tech He s raising his long term EBITDA margins He s out here acquiring businesses Shit that muthafucking Swede been a busy ass bee Now you may be wondering if ERIC is so great what about NOK And yeah NOK isn t a terrible idea either they also have some good news on their side and are a bit undervalued as well If you wanted to take a bite of NOK you probably won t get diarrhea might even shit some gold I dunno I m still looking into it but I like ERIC better But here is the part I want you to really look at the fucking call prices Cheddar Cheesus of Wisconsin That s some muthafucking value on a goddamn motherfucker leading the game Goddamn Buddha going down on Shakira in the Alps If you don t make money on this you re fucking hopeless So yeah there you have it ERIC is the fucking man He s got a good product is ahead of the game in rolling it out has geo political tailwinds solid and steady growth and his only opposition is your retarded uncle and his looney toons conspiracies So this is the part where you tell him to go whistle on a dick because you re making money off the switches that ensure that the camgirl you ve been simping for sees your little dick 150 miliseconds faster 5G is coming and someone s gotta make the hardware for it why not ERIC amp x200B TL DR Chinese shit is shit ERIC is cool You should give your money to ERIC amp x200B ERIC shares ERIC Jan 2023 12c amp x200B P S I m putting this at the bottom because I already know my inbox will be full of Is Jan 15 a good call date No motherfucker The telecomms are just now bidding on the spectrums I have no fucking clue when they ll actually start putting up the goddamn towers if I did I sure as shit wouldn t be giving that info out for free But I do know it won t happen over night If you wanna be retarded go play a meme stock this shit is for autists No rocket emojis here So when is a good date for calls Fuck if I know Noticed I bought fucking leaps Yeah you might wanna do the same they re dirt cheap but I tend to think anything expiring in June Sept and beyond is a safe bet Totally your call based on your own risk tolerance amp x200B Anyway if you see my boy ERIC just ignore the pungent smell of fermented fish

companies that are discussed much more than TSMC NYSE TSM on here such as Apple AMD Intel NVIDIA etc TSMC is a hidden gem that is getting ready to take off over the next few years Here s why TSMC was founded in 1987 with the intent of bringing Taiwan into the global tech market Morris Chang who previously worked at Texas Instruments for over 30 years is the founder and former CEO of TSMC and widely regarded as the godfather of computer chips TSMC is currently the world s largest semiconductor producer with over half of semiconductor revenue from TSMC Other notable competitors include GlobalFoundries AMD used them for Zen and Zen switching to TSMC for Zen 2 and Zen 3 Intel and Samsung TSMC is a pioneer in the pure play foundry business meaning that they do not produce any chips for their own products Instead they manufacture and sell chips to companies meaning that those who choose to source chips from TSMC do not have to build expensive silicon fabrication plants to manufacture their own chips TSMC currently operates 10 different silicon fabs manufacturing over 10 000 different products using over 250 distinct technologies to cater to 499 different customers in 2019 Not only is TSMC the largest semiconductor foundry it is also a pioneer in advancing semiconductor production and performance Currently TSMC has 7 customers for its new 5nm chips including Apple for A14 X chips and ARM based chips for Mac products Qualcomm and MediaTek for 5G smartphone chips AMD for next generation Zen 4 CPUs Bitmain Intel and NVIDIA TSMC is also currently engineering its N4 chips built on a 4nm process node its 3nm chips and its 2nm chips which will use new GAAFET Gate All Around Field Effect Transistor technology instead of the traditional FinFET technology So who are some of TSMC s biggest and most notable customers Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL Apple is the world s largest company in terms of market capitalization 2 17 Trillion and has become widely popular due to its heavy and cohesive integration between its products and widespread use by many prominent figures Currently it offers many products such as laptops phones smart watches smart TV products fitness products and more It also offers many services and software products which all integrate with each other via iCloud continuity software such as Handoff and more Recently Apple has confirmed that they are cutting support for Intel CPUs on their Mac products in a few years meaning they will shift to using entirely Apple Silicon chips for all of their Mac products This is in addition to Apple using their own chips for all other products that they currently produce iPhones iPads smart watches etc Apple is one of TSMC s largest customers and that is only expected to grow as they ramp up production for their M1 and next generation ARM chips for Macs Apple s M1 chips are a strong competitor to AMD and Intel CPUs especially if they can scale well up to 32 and 64 cores They are extremely efficient and consume drastically less power than x86 based CPUs Intel and AMD CPUs meaning that thermal requirements are much lower Macs have typically been targeted by PC enthusiasts as an overpriced underperforming lineup but we may see that change as Apple s new chips perform extremely well Apple reported a yearly revenue of 274 5 billion US Dollars in 2020 roughly a 5 increase from 2019 Since Apple relies on TSMC for their chips and Apple s Mac lineup is likely to become more popular I would expect that TSMC s revenue from Apple will increase more than we ve seen in previous years Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD AMD has certainly made a huge return since Lisa Su became CEO in 2014 and the production of Ryzen which was widely popular due to its high core counts and high price to performance compared to Intel Now Ryzen has developed into a strong all around player sporting high core counts and great single thread performance Currently AMD Ryzen 5000 desktop CPUs outperform Intel s current generation Comet Lake CPUs in games which is the first time that AMD has surpassed Intel in gaming performance AMD has slowly been regaining market share both in the PC enthusiast side and the server side In the past two years AMD has doubled their server market share from 4 5 to 8 This may not seem like much but considering that server upgrades are not frequent and those who buy Intel server CPUs are more likely to stick with Intel that is a massive increase On the PC enthusiast side AMD CPUs have accounted for 84 of CPUs sold on mindfactory de a German PC Retailer This is a massive increase considering that in 2016 before the release of Ryzen Intel accounted for roughly 75 of CPU sales on mindfactory de AMD launched their Zen 3 chips in 2020 which was followed by huge demand and a shortage of these CPUs This was in part due to demand at TSMC not being able to keep up with AMD s orders Zen 3 CPUs perform extremely well and next generation Zen 4 CPUs which will be on TSMC s 5nm process point to a shortage of fab space at TSMC Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Qualcomm is a semiconductor company that creates wireless technology chips CPUs software and services related to wireless technology Their most prominent products include their Snapdragon CPUs used in phones from some of the largest smartphone companies such as Samsung LG OnePlus Xiaomi Motorola and more They also produce application specific processors for things like cameras IoT devices kiosks robots and a lot more Additionally Qualcomm offers desktop CPUs such as their Snapdragon 8cx Qualcomm also produces various connectivity chips for things such as WiFi onboard chips in laptops desktop Wifi cards routers modems etc Bluetooth and internet connectivity chips on smartphones Currently Qualcomm relies on TSMC for the production of its Snapdragon chips Although Samsung beat out TSMC for the production of Qualcomm s upcoming 5G chips mobile chips accounted for 44 8 of Qualcomm s total revenue in 2020 while RF Front End chips smartphone internet connectivity chips accounted for just 9 8 of Qualcomm s total revenue NVIDIA NASDAQ NVDA NVIDIA has been a long time customer of TSMC dating all the way back to 1998 when NVIDIA switched over to TSMC s 350nm process for the Riva TNT Since then TSMC has manufactured nearly every NVIDIA chip up until RTX 3000 series also known as Ampere NVIDIA decided to switch to Samsung s 8N 8nm process node likely due to financial reasons or fab capacity reasons However NVIDIA is allegedly moving back to TSMC to manufacture more Ampere GPUs using their 7nm process There could be a few reasons for this TSMC might have offered NVIDIA a deal or capacity for 7nm fabs may have opened up due to large customers such as Apple and AMD shifting more focus towards TSMC s 5nm process NVIDIA s RTX 3000 series GPUs also known as Ampere are a massive improvement in the GPU space compared to previous generations and just for performance in general The RTX 3070 performs similarly to an RTX 2080ti where the former has an MSRP of 499 USD and the latter has an MSRP of 999 USD In addition to much greater price performance Ampere GPUs also heavily increase ray tracing performance so games that can take advantage of ray tracing hardware are actually playable They are extremely popular and currently Ampere GPUs are selling anywhere from 200 to upwards of 1500 dollars of their MSRP NVIDIA is also huge in the AI Computing space teaming up with NIO for AI based self driving computation Photoshop for neural filters and also powers some of the fastest supercomputers in the world In regards to AMD NVIDIA blows the new RX 6000 series GPUs out of the water for things like streaming performance and workstation performance Intel NASDAQ INTC While Intel has traditionally manufactured most of their products Internet connectivity products processors chipsets etc Intel is reportedly shifting a fair amount of their chips to TSMC Recently Intel announced they would use TSMC for 7nm Xe graphics chips on their CPUs In October of 2020 Intel CEO Bob Swan said Intel would decide by January whether it was going to expand its 7nm production outsource it to a foundry or both Intel has severely underperformed in the CPU space compared to AMD but if they decide to shift some production to TSMC this could mean that Intel will make a strong return into the CPU space and strong entry into the GPU space Cool but what does this mean Again TSMC is the largest foundry outclassing the likes of Samsung GlobalFoundries and other similar companies There is an insane amount of demand for TSMC s chips and they are extremely competitive compared to other manufacturers TSMC has customers such as Apple AMD and Qualcomm which all have great products and are only expected to grow with the release of new technology such as CPUs or 5G networking Many of its customers are expected to have massive growth over the coming years meaning that TSMC will reap some of those profits Ok but why should I buy now I mean TSMC is already up over 100 over the past year isn t it too late to buy in When you consider its most important clients all of them are going to use TSMC for future products that are important to their respective segments Apple has just begun their venture into producing their own CPUs for Mac products the release of DDR5 and PCIe 5 0 is right around the corner with AMD s Zen 4 processors set to release late 2021 or 2022 Qualcomm producing next generation Snapdragon CPUs and we may see 5G production shifted to TSMC Intel actually producing competitive CPUs once again which might be with TSMC and NVIDIA continuing to dominate in the computing space and the GPU space Considering that all of these things are happening in the next few years TSMC is getting ready to take off Positions Currently holding 4 21 calls will definitely roll calls and load up on more once we get closer to expiry

talk about the Tesla bubble But the Netflix bubble that no one is talking about and when popped autists will be getting fucked to the equivalent of Asa Akira on an episode of Brazzers Netflix is a great company good product but very soon will be outpaced and future earnings reports will begin to show investors how growth is dying due to competition life going back to normal from covid the lack of ability to funnel customers to it s streaming services and loss of quality content that is equal to a shitty re run of the Maury show where a guy finds that is his girlfriend is both his aunt and sister amp x200B Processing img hgio2xbcy0b61 Netflix who has been the background noise hook ups around the world is in a period where they can become the next blockbuster video in 7 years Market share is being gobbled up by competitors such as Hulu Amazon Prime HBO Max Disney plus Youtube Apple TV and direct tv on the go Growth dying to competition The biggest competitive threat to Netflix is probably Amazon As of the fourth quarter of 2019 Amazon Prime Video had about 150 million subscribers a number that s been growing at a fast pace over the past two years as the company has increased production of its original content Netflix and Disney had an exclusive relationship at least until the studio decided to jump into the streaming war When Disney announced it was going to launch its own service it ended the deal it had with Netflix Netflix offered a number of titles from the studio but agreed to cut them all from its lineup in 2019 Disney owns every Disney movie including every Marvel and Star wars movie that s pretty much every quality movie for fucks sake Netflix basic package for one person to stream only is 8 99 As of May 2020 package subscriptions to Disney Hulu and ESPN cost 12 99 per month Subscriptions to just Disney cost 6 99 per month or 69 99 per year Which is way cheaper then a Brazzers subscription The big news for Hulu came in May 2019 with the announcement of a deal between Comcast and Disney which had Disney purchasing Comcast s stake in Hulu for a reported 5 8 billion This puts Disney in full control of Hulu and consolidates the competition as Disney makes a big push into the streaming services field Netflix investors should be equally worried about AT amp T s new streaming service that launches in 2020 It ll cost slightly more than Netflix at 16 17 month AT amp T is best known as a cell phone company But its purchase of WarnerMedia in 2018 turned it into a media powerhouse It owns HBO the most successful premium TV network ever HBO continues to pump out all time hits like The Sopranos Game of Thrones and Sex in the City The lack of ability to funnel customers to it s streaming services Do you know why the Amazon Echo dot was dirt cheap Because Amazon wants every household in the United States and the world to have a fucking Alexa in their living room From that every time you go to order something whether it be a fridge butt plug or sweater for your wife s boyfriend you re going to buy it from amazon now this leads to Amazon prime Throw in the fact that google nest and apple homepod are a thing that are working towards this as well will lead to Netflix becoming a non S amp P 500 stock and leave call holders in shambles Netflix relies off other companies platforms whether it be Google s search engine to find their website Ipads with their app amazon fire stick its only a matter of time before Netflix is overridden by competitors and left in the dust I believe Loss of Quality Content Netflix s two most watched shows are Friends the The Office which are both now off the streaming service Family guy isn t on there Other then Queens Gambit and a couple other shows its pretty much shit selection and Broke Back mountain that I know you guys like to watch with your boyfriends Netflix is going to shit and there are rarely blockbuster movies from theaters on there You cannot tell me the content is getting better it isn t and the competitors are growing and their content is more entertaining I know boomer Amazon prime members who canceled Netflix for Amazon prime video amp x200B amp x200B

market share in streaming Even the CEO has admitted the company is trouble Going forward it will succeed or fail on the popularity of the TV shows it produces Over the past year Netflix s debt has shot up 58 to 10 3 billion For perspective Netflix earned 1 2 billion in profits last year Netflix s market cap is about 165 billion making it the 30th biggest publicly traded US company The PE ratio is around 80 meaning every 80 spent is for one dollar of profit but everyday Amazon prime video members Disney Plus members are cancelling their subscriptions as Netflix tries to raise their prices on their customers and the company is losing quality content every month Company is overvalued and will struggle to grow Netflix will survive But it will shrink Even in the most generous scenario within three years I can t see it being worth more than 100 billion That would put its stock price at about 225 share or about 40 below its current price Next earnings I am buying a FD Put The Netflix bubble

think I understand how this is happening If you look at the days with a high short volume ratio the narrative is clear Shorts are actively trying to defend GME crossing 20 significantly and coming in

problem is shorts are doing all this active shorting to defend their existing short positions but they re either not able or not choosing to close all of the intraday shorting so it s accumulating As of 12 31 the total short positions 71 2M exceed total issued shares 69 75M The precarious position of the shorter Shorts find themselves in a very precarious position Let s talk about the float and DTC days to close The DTC number you see above is a lie There s an argument to be made that DTC is infinity There are a total of 69 75M shares issued by GME According to this guy https www reddit com

will hold on to their shares but all of the other institutions will paper hand when shorts start to cover This is very conservative because there are other institutions that hold GME for their own

even if you can convince all of them to sell i e True DTC is Infinity This is part of the reason shorts haven t covered There s no way out of the burning building they re in How it gets worse part 1 Institutional Buying Here s how it gets worse Besides all the retards like you and me buying GME b c of Lord Cohen and Lord Burry GME is about to cross some serious thresholds that make it attractive to more institutional buying First in the recent Q4 numbers https news gamestop com news releases news release details gamestop reports 2020 holiday sales results release The Company is continuing to suspend guidance however unless further unforeseen COVID 19 related impacts occur it expects to realize positive comparable store sales results and profitability in the fiscal fourth quarter So GME is about to cross into the positive EPS category which in addition to the debt story below is going to potentially unlock more institutional buying that is currently blocked by rules like not investing in companies with negative P E Second let s talk about debt Debt Businesses leverage debt to scale particularly true with retail businesses that have to pay for inventory in advance of selling it High cost of debt gt lower profits gt lower ability to pay debt gt higher debt costs and the cycle continues On the flipside if GME was able to increase its credit rating you get lower debt costs higher

Moody s credit rating would suggest The market can move faster than Moody s Positive EPS Debt ratings upgrade massive institutional buying shorts further in the hole How it gets worse part 2 Passive Buying Feedback Loop GME is part of 62 ETFs holding about 10 7M shares https www etf com stock GME in addition to a whole bunch in index funds not ETFs I couldn t get a number for index funds but am going to estimate around 10M for them as well given the Vanguard Fidelity numbers above More than 50 of these holdings are passive market cap weighted funds Now here s the feedback loop that really fucks the short story up 1 Institutions buy GME gt 2 Price goes up gt 3 Market Cap Goes up gt 4 Weight in Funds Goes up gt 5 ETFs buy more GME for every of inflow gt 6 Price goes up gt return to step 3 At 20 GME is already up gt 5x from its low of 4 in 2020 This means that for every 1 thrown into IWM for example Blackrock is putting 5x as much of that 1 into GME as it was back at GME s lows As GME s price goes up any market cap weighted fund puts more money into GME for every 1 of inflow The passive feedback loop has already started It will really kick into high gear with institutional buying Other speculations 1 I believe RC is already slated to be CEO and this will be announced in the June 2021 annual shareholder meeting 1 This is why the ICR presentation was pulled RC didn t want the content in the ICR presentation to be the market adopted story on the GME strategy 2 3 board members are retiring I believe this is part of a pre negotiated deal where RC is taking over The 3 that are stepping down didn t agree with the mgmt change 2 GME is due for a re rate of price sales GME is currently trading at a P S of 1 if you ONLY include the ecommerce revenue From a total revenue perspective it s closer to 2 GME is currently worth less than its quarterly revenue From the Q4 sales pre release https news gamestop com news releases news release details gamestop reports 2020

popping in AH I thought I d sum up why it makes sense that Canoo is likely to be profiting bigly off this Apple Hyundai tie up despite the fact that The Verge is reporting talks fell through on an acquisition https www theverge com 2020 2 11 21133461 hyundai canoo electric cars partership kia I had predicted among friends only that Canoo s skateboard and designs lent themselves perfectly to AAPL so I at least purport to have some legitimacy on this Some of this has already been covered but I wanted to take the bajillions of threads on this thing and distill them into one with most of the info Sorry if you have GOEV fatigue and I don t blame you Here goes 1 Tim Apple reportedly met with the BMW i3 team in 2015 https www theverge com 2015 7 31 9081425 apple bmw i3 meeting rumor to learn about vehicle manufacturing The report stated Apple may be eyeing the i3 as the foundation for its own heavily rumored electric car Who used to work on the i3 Stefan Krause Ulrich Kranz and Richard Kim i e the team behind the i3 and i8 birthed Canoo into existence 2 Canoo s philosophy is much the same as Apple s They mention several times in their press materials and in their appearance on JLG that they sought to rethink the car from the ground up https twitter com canoo status 1229937399637139456 s 20 3 Canoo moved extremely fast compared to most EV players They took 19 months to reach beta phase have completed 50 crash tests have 32 beta vehicles and 13 driving prototypes Apple would like to see this kind of competence heck any partner would 4 One of the few things that Canoo has not improved upon at all in their skateboard is battery tech which Apple reportedly has in spades with their reported breakthrough EV battery technology https www engadget com apple car 2024 233505759 html What else has Apple been working on non stop Another of Canoo s weaknesses autonomous tech with their fleet of Lexus SUVs https www zdnet com article apple project titan to start electric vehicle production in 2024 says reuters 5 Hyundai and Canoo have an existing engineering partnership to design a skateboard https www hyundainews com en us releases 2982 that will underpin small cost competitive electric vehicles for Hyundai this is called the Electric Global Modular Platform E GMP Hyundai believes in Canoo enough to also invest directly in the company 6 Apple is definitely working with Hyundai on securing a manufacturing deal by the end of Q1 https www macrumors com 2021 01 10 apple hyundai apple car deal according to reports from South Korean media 7 Apple reportedly wants the Apple Car to be a personal vehicle for the mass market https www cnbc com 2020 12 21 apple targets car production by 2024 html which fits perfectly with E GMP or a variation thereof Apple has also long been rumored https appleinsider com articles 19 02 21 apple project titan vehicle could turn out to be an electric van to want to make something akin to an electric van for commuting 8 With the news report from The Verge surfacing in which it s revealed Apple wanted to acquire Canoo one can pretty easily see what is happening 1 Apple approaches Canoo about an acquisition in January 2020 2 Canoo execs engineers believe in their product too much to sell it But and this is key there is no way you say no to Apple when you re in that bad of a financial situation as reported in the same article Maybe they said you can invest maybe they said let s partner but I guaran damn tee you they did not tell the most prestigious company in the world to pound sand 3 Backroom dealings happen in secret Then Hyundai announces their tie up with Canoo in February Did Apple approach Hyundai about approaching Canoo Did Canoo and Apple jointly come to an agreement to bring a manufacturer in Did Canoo Hyundai happen organically to Apple s good fortune Who knows 4 Whatever happened now it s reported that Apple hopes to reach a deal with Hyundai by end of March Why Because they want Canoo s skateboard tech of course They simply found a workaround 5 Canoo Hyundai Apple allows each company to bring their incredible strengths to Apple Car Canoo execs engineers have 30 years experience in automotive and the i3 and i8 under their belt Hyundai have manufacturing at scale down Apple have design UX software battery tech autonomous This is the best possible outcome for Apple In other words Apple would probably want Canoo s experience 9 If Canoo knows their skateboard is valuable enough for Apple to want it they surely are going to demand a profit from Hyundai in some way likely through licensing their patents tech out No way they have a strictly engineering and investment agreement There must be royalties or other fees at play here Of course we don t know at the moment because the details are being held close to the chest 10 Canoo has stated in a slide deck https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1750153 000121390020022607 ea125677ex99 2 hennessy htm that their platform is fully autonomous compatible wink wink 11 Canoo stated in a slide deck https charts stocktwits com production original 270955872 png that they have interest from a Tech Strategic player in smart car and autonomous vehicle that has identified Canoo as a base platform to integrate systems Sounds a lot like Apple or Uber or something of that ilk 12 Canoo has mentioned several times that they have a partnership announcement in Q1 2021 They recently posted as a tease on their social accounts https twitter com canoo status 1345145017975726080 s 20 13 The reported timeline https www autoblog com 2021 01 10 apple car built by hyundai america for Apple car is 2022 prototype 2024 integrate Apple s battery tech Who s timeline is similar to that Canoo s Canoo hopes to launch the Lifestyle Vehicle in 2022 and their MPDV in 2023 with future models in 2024 and beyond All signs point to Apple wanting to acquire Canoo for their technology and Canoo turning down an outright acquisition so Apple went after Hyundai to back door access the tech they wanted Canoo has in bold and large lettering on some investor decks that they OWN PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY probably because they realized how valuable this was after the Apple overture With all that said even if the Apple tie up is completely unrelated to Canoo which seems like a stretch at this point it s more likely Canoo is involved in some way imo it s clear that GOEV is legit has valuable protectable IP and a team that believes in the product MORE obligatory rockets Position long GOEV only 300 shares because I m poor

376,kwczbv,t2_79jxtjk7,1610529541,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwczbv/flws_get_your_mammy_some_flowers_up_for_earnings/,1, FLWS Get your Mammy some Flowers up for earnings ,I am not a financial Advisor and I m not your Papa Do your own due diligence Thesis We are knee deep in this quarantine and solid quarantine plays that aren t already coming off of huge momentum are hard to come by But I believe this could be an exception Every stay at home dot com online ecommerce platform has been sky rocketed and flowers com 1800flowers com at first glance seems no different Trading at about 26 with ATH at 32 in August But I believe the market may not have factored in just how much flowers com is benefitting First and foremost this was brought to my attention at work I m a courier for one of the major shippers and I check every package that comes through there Over the past couple months I ve been watching as flowers com packages have been noticeably growing in volume The hypothesis is simple At a time when you are not able to see friends and loved ones flowers and gift boxes are a way to convey I love you I miss you Thinking of you Sorry for your loss Get better soon Congratulations Happy Anniversary and Condolences while we have the inability to do so in person What do you get grandma in the nursing home who doesn t need anything or the relative who s got everything Or an office that worked through quarantine It s as pure as it comes too Flowers com has pretty much dominated and monopolized the market for online flowers and gift boxes with the acquisition of competitors Recently expanding with another HCT Mention BBBY acquiring personalizationmall com that allows pretty much any gift wedding keepsake to be personalized although there is some ongoing issues with this acquisition due to pandemic They also purchased Sheri s Berries www berries com http www berries com a chocolate dipped fruit gift company The list goes on and on with baskets com simplychocolate com fruitbouquets com cheryls com cookies thepopcornfactory com a premium meats service baked goods enough said But out of all of those the big kicker for me is Harry and David s which I would love to get web traffic for too which is a gourmet gift box I saw a noticeable amount of Harry and David packages going out to homes and business over the last four weeks of holidays almost matching volume with flowers com https preview redd it 6k3hoblsg2b61 png width 665 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 1360ca9f02cd427a80e11f84b42e5774114debbd Early on I couldn t find the g trends to support my growing hypothesis but now that seems to have shifted and the data has had time to mature I believe flowers com is seeing a huge spike in sales growth It may be hard to tell but searches yoy for all trends is

This isn t a sexy EV play and I wouldn t bet on 100 gainz Last earnings was a beat and some of this growth has been factored into upcoming earnings no doubt about that But as with any social arb trade one of the questions is Is the market fully appreciating the trend I don t believe it has and I believe there is room to run up and past ATH s With a very good outlook for an upcoming earnings beat this seems like a pure play with solid gains potential and little downside risk Upcoming earnings are scheduled for the end of January and Flowers com and its subsidiaries have a clear market dominance to capitalize on a holiday season in quarantine Trades made It s a cyclical play and I m in through earnings with around 3 4 of portfolio in equity which I will build on any further dips to 8 of total portfolio I will add in calls on any down day through earnings in the same manner Just gut based speculation here but I believe it could pull back to the median range of 24 25 before hitting an upswing if so I will be aggressively building out my position There is also a solid argument to be made that this could be a solid long term play as well with continuous growth over the next 3 5 years Research https www pymnts com news partnerships acquisitions 2020 1 800 flowers buys bed bath beyond personalization mall https www pymnts com news partnerships acquisitions 2020 1 800

Market News 01 13 , Big tech struggles as small caps continue to overperform Plug Power rises on Renault venture while GM reveals flying car Is Tesla going to crush Apple Let s talk about this amp other stock market news Hello everyone and Good Morning So let s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market posting small gains with the Nasdaq Composite https ibb co V2Yn5xJ leading the way up 28 the Dow Jones https ibb co hMpFmmF gaining 60 points and the SP500 https ibb co YLYfs4V finishing flat for the day just about 3800 while the VIX https ibb co sgR88nB posted a 3 decline though it seemed it was going to go back into higher volatility territory in the middle of the day We also saw almost 70 of companies https ibb co vHBQThL advancing with 260 new highs on about average volume as 6 of the 11 SECTORS https ibb co 7pwD88M finished in the green with Energy leading the way yet again amp continuing to outperform in 2021 while Health Care and Communications lost more than 1 with Large Cap Growth Companies being the biggest laggard also continuing the huge underperformance compared to all other factors as small amp mid caps have largely outperformed https ibb co QH694Vc since the start of the year Here is the HEAT MAP https ibb co 2Kt4ChR from yesterday with most big tech companies losing ground though Tesla did recover after an 8 plunge on Monday and was also joined by the Banks the Semiconductors and the Oil amp Gas companies Yesterday we also got some economic data with the Small Business Optimism INDEX https ibb co 12TgvbS falling sharply to 95 9 in December vs the 102 expected and 101 4 in the previous month as the small business optimism has continued to drop after the highs it made in September while job OPENINGS https ibb co S0VG5PZ came pretty much in line with the previous report at 6 52M as the openings rate remained double the quits rate And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor MARKET https ibb co 8NZ79p7 gaining 7 year over year to reach 39 4B for November as the world will keep on needing more amp more semiconductors with improving technology I really like this sector and I believe it s one of the best for long term investing Today https ibb co s3c5sMQ we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED s Beige Book While in the IPO world we will see AFFIRM https ibb co 6WqTmZX start trading today as the company set the final IPO price at 49 way above the first and second ranges between 33 44 I really am interested in this company thought it s unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60 70 in my opinion while in the M amp A department we saw VISA https ibb co CVkG87d terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction In some other stock market NEWS https ibb co VBYhdY1 we saw Boeing land a 1 7B Air Force contract This is good news for Boeing as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production amp airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020 which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of JNJ https ibb co VCpS3Kw while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia though it s not expected to be from a manufacturing defect but RATHER https ibb co Y2TZtNK by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year We also saw Plug Power skyrocket https ibb co 3yChM7R yet again finishing the day up over 20 after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault This joint venture is expected https ibb co LhFHnrX to lead to further developments in fuel cell amp hydrogen fuel cell vehicle that will be based on Renaults platforms as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell amp hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power It s expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles fueling stations services amp selling hydrogen fuel to customers It s seems a good amp interesting development but I would avoid buying it after such a huge SPIKE https ibb co WkGwC79 it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon In the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES with announcements of a big PUSH https ibb co swv4wn3 into electric vans a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a FLYING https ibb co G5bP3YX Cadillac while TESLA https ibb co W2H1xrc just registered its Indian entity just as ARK s Invest CEO NOTED https ibb co qWjZqmF that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren t good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan amp others We also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the FINTECH https ibb co DVKSgGb startup as they are also planning on experimenting with even MORE https ibb co g7qgstZ delivery options as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency as they try to compete as much as possible with online purpose RETAILERS https ibb co YjMjDLw that are high flying yet again And one last piece of NEWS https ibb co zQBd1L5 is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020 exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10 to over 20 thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage So let s hope for a good day in the markets as both the WORLD https ibb co HB5P34r Markets and the US FUTURES https ibb co BgwpqT8 are mixed with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain Thank you everyone for reading Hope you enjoyed the content Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market Have a great day and see you next time

will post during open though Discord and telegram admins don t try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people when you don t even own the codes behind it There are a lot of SPY500 boomer

to this post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kn4wck aphria inc apha yes its cannabis yes its about to I made two weeks ago which was an update to this post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments k450e6 why apha is set for a 50 gain by u WatAb0utB0b https www reddit com user WatAb0utB0b a month ago I suggest reading those before reading this post Introduction a look back over two weeks People called me a bagholder a shill a clown People said weed stocks sucked and one guy even told me to buy an Xbox instead Others clowned on me for owning only 30 shares i m a poor student stfu Well look at APHA now it was below 7 when I posted the DD and now it s above 9 6 If you retards listened to me you would have had at least a 35 gain in two weeks My 20 loss has turned into a 10 gain Of course this was because of the democratic victory in Georgia which defied analysts predictions Like usual cannabis stock posts start popping up here after the price jump bandwagon andy s A lot of them are missing crucial information in their DD s so I hope you will listen to me now on why Aphria is the ultimate cannabis pick Democrats control everything The cannabis industry will become unstoppable in the next four years The price jump sinds the democratic victory is only the beginning Daddy Biden will decriminalize it over the entire U S A This thursday Biden will make his first plans as a president clear mainly around the stimulus plans for you Amerifats He might mention policy too if he does mention the cannabis industry in anyway expect another major price jump Another date to look out for is the Biden inauguration on the 20th of this month expect another price jump then as he will 100 mention the decriminalisation of cannabis there I m not a political expert as I m an Europoor retard but I ve been reading in and the democrats basically have a majority in every important political institution This means they can pass everything they want Cannabis decriminalisation should be at the top of their agenda as it has been mentioned in political discourse for years now For the long term there s no way that cannabis stock prices don t reach the same heights as 2017 2018 in the next four years You should have cannabis in your portfolio if you don t hate money After Biden s administration it will be a pain in the ass for a Republican leader to totally re criminalize it as the entire economy and justice system will have adapted already So this can be a short or long term hold just depends on how good you are at diamond handing Arbitrage free tendies because of APHA TLRY merger However I still see autists in daily threads and DD s disrespecting Aphria telling you that Tilray is the obvious better pick TLRY has indeed been growing more profoundly than APHA but I think there s something you guys don t understand about the merger I repeat from my last post about Tilray and Apha s merger They will form under Tilray s ticker but Aphria stock owners will get a 62 stake in Tilray while current Tilray owners will keep a 38 stake I don t think you guys realized what that means quote from merger announcement Aphria shareholders will receive 0 8381 Tilray shares for each Aphria share they own while Tilray shareholders will see no adjustment to their holdings What this means is that the price of APHA should logically be 0 8381 times the TLRY share price Aphria Inc s share price only matters relative to Tilray s price if held until merger I ll spell it out for you retards As of right now APHA is noted at 9 76 and TLRY at 14 56 The ratio of APHA to TLRY is 0 6703 far from the 0 8381 split that will happen at merger in the second quarter of this year That s a difference of 0 1678 Tilray shares that you get on top of what you actually should be getting What this means is if you buy in now it s literally an arbitrage opportunity free tendies at merger By buying Aphria stock you re indirectly buying Tilray at a discount From the point you buy in it doesn t matter how APHA s price evolves as long as you hold until merger you should only look at Tilray s price Compare your cost per share with Tilray s share price if Tilray keeps growing you ll only get more value at merger The only possible risks are if the merger doesn t go through one of the companies goes bankrupt or if somehow Tilray price falls badly and your cost per share to Tilray s price is suddenly above 0 8381 Chances of either of those events occurring are nihil TLDR On top of all the reasons mentioned in previous posts the cannabis industry is more likely to boom short and long term than ever American political developments are crucial and in favor of the cannabis industry The reason Aphria is the best pick as an investor is because of its merger with Tilray They will form the second largest cannabis company on the stock market under TLRY s ticker and APHA holders will get 0 8381 Tilray shares for each of their APHA shares Currently APHA is valued below that split This means that if you buy APHA and hold until merger in Q2 of 2021 APHA s price evolution doesn t matter because you basically buy Tilray at a discount free tendies

Val like valley Make sure before you go pitching this know it s not vail You will get laughed out of the boardroom or bus station depending on when you meet the MD TLDR VALE 25 Jan 2022 amp x200B Iron Ore Like MT which was the hottest meme stonk of 2 weeks ago before all the retards went back to trying to see who mark the top on GME VALE is driven by iron ore and resource prices However instead of the prices of finished steel products which is what MT deals in Vale deals in the dirty stuff out of the ground 1 So why not MT like a regular autismo Well finished steel products have already had the extended run due to demand far outstripping inventories from 2019 2020 Yes you can make the argument that the supply demand issue can become more problematic but you might be buying something very extended Plus these kinds of price shocks are called transitory meaning that the extra demand is unsustainable it s just all the orders hitting at once Plus we re dealing with steel here not something precious and supply constrained like gold or girlfriends 2 Honestly why not MT Well their input prices iron ore and energy might start heading up 3 If anyone here has taken basic economics this is the start of a curve shift instead of moving along the curve as everyone country in the world starts building with newly printed borrowed money more on that later Demand from mills will drive up prices of

Everyone who can borrow is borrowing We re in year 12 now of massive monetary loosening and it s not really working because all the new liquidity is going straight into stonks and financial assets which yield more than building bridges or improving that road 1 Why isn t this just lip service again In the US especially we have the return of Mama Yellen Her economics is pretty classical Keynesian or that you need fiscal government spending instead of monetary easing As Keynes said you can t loosen a bag by pushing on a rope you can slow the economy by increasing rates but you can t always improve it by going the other way She has had first hand experience in this during her term as Fed Chair rates are still dragging near 0 but inflation was still nonexistent Who has control of fiscal spending now The Tax and Spend Democrats who will definitely at least listen to what Mama Yellen has to say This is also the main driver of green stocks we re going to print borrow tax so much money and build so many chargepoints But before that we re going to build new highways roads buildings etc 2 What about overseas Infrastructure bonds are easier to issue than other types Basically the borrower would usually be a government slightly more trustworthy These countries which formerly borrowed at nosebleed levels in US dollars has suddenly seen their interest rates drop with the ability to borrow in local currency Are they going to spend on infrastructure Well that s what their bond is backed by Even though 80 of the money is going to go to an oligarch at least a bridge will be built

inflation to start heading up these next few years especially in the US because of where the money is going 1 Wage increases Biden s has repeatedly said he will raise the federal minimum wage to 15 Yes you can argue that will move towards more automation and lower the actual amount of people working but this section is not going to argue about that One of the main reasons why goods inflation not asset inflation has been so low is because those who benefited from lower yields do not automatically spend more How many burgers can Bezos eat in 1 day With higher wages hitting a larger part of the population who will actually spend it inflation is expected to go up driving up the prices of everything else 2 Central Bank tolerance of inflation The fed has already said they are moving more towards long run inflation averaging This means higher inflation will be tolerated for longer because the years before that had low inflation This view coupled with the fed s view that any spike in prices after we get out of the pandemic will be transitory means that we have the prefect mix of powder and oxygen to spark runaway inflation What benefits during these times Good ol usable metal Brazil Everyone and their mothers idiot wealth advisors are clamoring for emerging markets again This time there are a few different drivers 1 Cheap liquidity and even cheaper dollars Go read about the carry trade here The dollar will be weak in the next few years because of additional borrowing and spending but also even more because everyone will be selling dollars to buy overseas assets Why Well there s higher return overseas like the Bovespa vs SPX chart below 2 Higher tax rates in the US You know that s what s going to happen You know corporate taxes are going to get bumped up to 28 from 21 Tech companies are smart enough to move their profits overseas but not so much for domestic manufacturing Vale is incorporated in Brazil which last time I checked wasn t the US 3 Brazil is super cheap right now That also has to do with the fact most Brazilian companies are involved in natural resources and agriculture which doesn t have the shine of tech This is also why Vale is so cheap and doesn t move as much more below 4 Regulation Brazil doesn t have them You want to blow up half the Amazon Well does it make money https preview redd it z007jr85z4b61 png width 1458 amp

United States Steel Corporation X ArcelorMittal MT Schnitzer Steel Industries Inc SCHN POSCO PKX and Olympic Steel Inc ZEUS Link https www zacks com stock news 1244918 steel industry starts 2021 on upbeat mood 5 solid picks The steel industry has kicked off the new year on a high note building on the strong recovery that started in the final quarter of 2020 Shares of major steel companies are heading higher this month The momentum has been driven by surging steel prices on the back of rising steel demand amid supply shortage and prospects of infrastructure stimulus package this year from the Biden administration Material stocks got a thrust after the U S Congress formally certified Joe Biden as the next President last Thursday Biden has proposed spending 2 trillion over four years to boost clean energy and rebuild infrastructure The planned investment includes building and repairing roads bridges water systems electricity grids and broadband aimed at fixing America s crumbling infrastructure American steel stocks have been gaining this month on hopes that the sizable infrastructure spending would have a beneficial effect on the U S steel industry given the expected increase in consumption of the commodity that is used to make almost everything from rail tracks to roads to bridges and tunnels Notably shares of major U S steel makers such as United States Steel Corp are up 37 this month The optimism can also be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Steel Producers industry has gained 10 6 so far this month outperforming the S amp P 500 Index s 1 9 appreciation The steel industry has been urging for an infrastructure package since the early days of the pandemic Leading U S steel industry groups in March 2020 had called on Congress to include significant infrastructure investment in the next stimulus package to help the nation recover from the fallout of the deadly virus outbreak The pandemic induced demand destruction put a crimp on the steel industry for much of the first half of 2020 However an upturn in demand from the key industries such as automotive and construction and an upswing in steel prices have pulled the industry out of its funk Automotive and construction together account for a big chunk of steel consumption Recovery started to gain steam toward the end of the third quarter of 2020 on resumption of operations across major steel consuming sectors following easing of lockdowns and restrictions across the world Steel prices are also shooting higher on an upturn in demand Steel stocks also started to rebound in the second half of 2020 after getting hammered during the first half along with most other commodities amid the pandemic led demand slowdown Steel makers are seeing strong order booking in automotive Recovery in the automotive industry has accelerated following pandemic led shutdowns on the back of strong customer demand The automotive rebound is driving demand for flat steel products globally Moreover the revival in the construction sector globally is driving demand for long and flat steel products in this major market The construction sector has also bounced back on the heels of a resumption of projects that were stalled earlier due to supply chain disruptions and manpower shortage In particular the non residential construction market remains resilient Meanwhile a strong recovery in construction and manufacturing activities is driving demand for steel in China the world s top consumer of the commodity Steel demand is being driven by the Chinese government s spending on infrastructure projects A rebound in China s demand has instilled optimism in the steel space Moreover steel prices are on an upswing on the back of rising demand supply shortages and higher raw material costs Notably U S steel prices have staged a strong recovery and hit record levels after cratering to pandemic induced multi year lows in August 2020 The benchmark hot rolled coil HRC prices started to recover in September and are screaming higher since then Prices zoomed past 900 per short ton in December on U S steel mills price hike actions tight supply and rising demand and are hovering near the 1 000 per short ton level last attained in 2008 In fact HRC prices have catapulted to levels not seen in more than 10 years and doubled the lows witnessed in August A key reason behind the spurt in steel prices is the demand supply imbalance Lead times for steel delivery at U S steel mills remain extended indicating healthier demand Moreover supply remains restricted due to the idling of blast furnaces and production disruptions associated with mill outages These coupled with lower steel imports due to the pandemic and tariffs have resulted in the tightening of steel supplies a situation which is likely to sustain over the short haul Steel scrap prices are also on the rise amid tight supply As such there is room for further upside in HRC prices as the fundamentals driving factors remain in place Higher demand elevated input costs and supply constraints are likely to continue lending support to HRC prices over the near term Higher prices would drive profitability and cash flows of steel companies 5 Red Hot Steel Stocks to Buy Now Improving fundamentals in the steel industry make this space an attractive area to invest in right now The industry is
