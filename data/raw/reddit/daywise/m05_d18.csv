do as investors ,Inflation hedge is and will be the most importantly topic for both retail and institutional investors for a while given the flooded liquidity and Fed s new average inflation targeting scheme This analysis discusses 1 what does the April CPI data really means 2 what is the forward looking trend of inflation 3 why you should be concerned and what you should be doing as investors CPI came out meaningfully above expectation last week But is shouldnt be a shock to anyone 1 These estimates Dow Jones put together by surveying economists are fucking jokes sometimes 2 You should take into account the transitory factor of the easy comparison vs weak inflation of April last year Let s look at the data CPI was 1 4 last year assuming 2 is the targeted norm this means we have a 0 6 easy comparison YoY Given these the core CPI this April is more like 2 4 which is not that shocking 3 Any positive shock in inflation shouldn t come as a surprise to you as evidence in inflation pressure has literally shown up everywhere Except in the official inflation data ironically We heard it from anecdotes friends forward looking data and even on the news amp x200B So the takeaway here is that the data shouldn t come as a shock to anyone at all As we saw there was some shock to the equity market but it bounced back quickly in the next few days While the data itself is not a shock I believe inflation will inevitably continue rising and probably surpass current market expectations Reasons are On the demand side spending growth is skyrocketing in light of rising household income thanks to stimulus checks and pent up demand into continuous reopening Our best friend Uncle powell will also keep monetary policy super easy under his new Average Inflation Targeting scheme I also do not think the US government will be winding down aggressive fiscal supports soon Because it is almost free it supports economic growth And mostly importantly it could effectively deal with inequality issues which have been widening for decades On the supply side we have already seen a lot of signs of capacity constraints For example we already saw these in many commodities whose prices have gone up a lot Also keep in mind new capacity for some commodities especially industrial metals will take years to come online At the same time labor growth is not catching up with demand growth for many reasons as reflected in the recent non farm payroll data Employers are actually making workers to work longer hours as seen in the data which will eventually turn into higher wages Given all these why should you be concerned about inflation The answer is simple inflation eventually leads to higher long term interest rate thus higher discount rate for financial assets like stocks This means lower asset prices Just to explain a bit more the impact of inflation on long term interest rate happens through 2 channels 1 Higher inflation will pressure fed to raise interest rate faster and sooner which will flow to long term rate through rises in forward rates 2 Higher inflation simply means the creditor will demand higher interest payment in order to protect their purchasing power amp x200B So here comes the most important question what we could do as investors To be clear I am NOT saying you should sell all your stocks because inflation also has a positive growth implication on stocks Therefore I am not too sure where the stock is going with inflation In fact I think there is still some runway in the US stock market which I will explain in another video And I personally still have meaningful amount of growth stocks What I am really trying to say is As investors who have a lot of stocks we need to have inflation hedges in our portfolios which means assets that will do well when inflation rises above market expectations Here are a few options you can do Buy commodity futures if your accounts can trade those I personally like future as it gives you a lot of leverage And leverage is a good thing when you are using it to hedge or diversify your portfolio You may ask a lot of commodities have done super well this year Am I too late to the game My short answer is NO If you look at the commodities price curves most of the rise are led by increases on the short end of the curves This to some extend signals the gains in commodities so far has been driven by real physical demand instead of speculative activities So commodities especially those with inelastic supply still have some runway to go My favorite is copper In the near term copper benefits from the revived home building booms In the long term it also benefits from secular trends like electric vehicle adoption and renewable energy infrastructure buildout As all the wires transmissions are copper EV batteries also have meaningful amount of copper On the supply side it takes 5 7 years for a new copper mine to come online As a result I have all in ed copper futures with diamond hands no way back no questions asked You can also short bond futures given the positive relation between inflation and nominal yield If you are really fancy and want purer exposure you can also buy inflation linked bonds and short nominal bonds keeping dollar duration neutral It seems these options so far may not be too friendly to retail investors Don t worry the following ones will be better Next you can easily buy commodity ETFs For example SLV for silver IAU GLD for gold CPER for copper DBB DBC GSG for diversified commodities And I am sure you can find a bunch of oil ETFs but I personally don t like oil as an investment at this point so go find them yourself Among these I like silver it has industrial usage exposure to high tech and green economy and mostly importantly the precious metal wealth preservation attribute It also could also go to moon in light of SilverSqueeze We shall see Next option you can invest in stocks of miners and I have listed down a few as examples for you e g FCX copper Vale Nickle and others I am sure you can find more Pros these miners could do really well in industrial metal upcycles Cons you are also exposed to their operational risks To be honest the operational track record of this group is definitely not the greatest so do your own fundamental due diligence before investing Next you can also buy inflation protection ETFs like TIP These are conservative and offers inflation hedges However it may not the best option for hedging in light of the intrinsic low volatility of these products Because lower the volatility less effective the hedging will be which I will explain in another video Last but not the least Cryptocurrencies Most of the Cryptocurrencies have the wealth preservation attribute due to limited supply However you are most definitely introducing more idiosyncratic risks to your portfolio by investing in Cryptocurrencies TLDR if you hold stocks you need inflation hedges you can buy commodity futures short bonds buy SLV CPER GLD FCX Cryptocurrencies I am a hedgefund professional actually made a video about this hope you can subscribe and support if you like what you see hear https studio youtube com channel UCFw

struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed Several States have already begun or are considering a return to

coming out of other subreddits to promote their paint the tape exercise on GME lets touch the third rail of brigades in our quest for the elusive infinite negative karma score The image shown here is this morning s 18 May 2021 GME OHLC view on a time scale of 6 months with daily candles The GME Moon Cult Can Suck A Bag Of Cheap Dildos https preview redd it zc96dmrlkvz61 png width 1308 amp format png amp auto webp amp s ab1b3a4c28f05c7454e0832d2057e8417af178b0 Why are you using OHLC view you might ask Because the market manipulators like to conveniently ignore the intraday highs and lows so they can draw lines wherever they like There are two ways to do TA shapes either use all open and close prices or use all intraday high low prices Either is useful but mixing and matching is a recipe for SEC legal violations when you advocate buying a stock and promoting a knowingly shitty TA drawing Additionally the cult likes to use distorted stretches of the time X Axis and price scales Y Axis to create their arbitrary triangles and call it DD The other part they like to avoid discussing is that technical analysis is based on statistical inference You should never rely on a single signal whether its shape charting i e triangles candlestick patterns or the use of mathematical indicators like the MACD RSI or CCI that you see below The more signals you confirm the more statistically relevant your read of the TA is and most TA traders will aim for a minimum of 3 4 signals before they re comfortable with a trade Shall we do a proper technical analysis then Lets Based on the daily time scale there was an converging symmetric triangle formed between the January short squeeze and the February March gamma squeeze A symmetric triangle like this is ambiguous because normal TA traders would expect it to have equal chances of breaking bear or bull Therefore TA traders wait until a break out is confirmed in order to commit to a trade This one broke out bearish around April 12th To confirm that trade a TA trader would also look at MACD or the Moving Average Convergence Divergence https www investopedia com terms m macd asp https www investopedia com terms m macd asp MACD is a momentum indicator and usually you need to follow it on daily or weekly timescales to get its full statistical effect The red line tracks the expoential moving average EMA over 12 days The green dotted line tracks the EMA over 26 days The blue bars are the MACD which is red minus green The easiest signal to pull from MACD is a crossover of the red and green lines which indicates a change in momentum and a switch between bear mode or bull mode As you can see a TA trader would see a cross over off the dump on March 10th confirm trading within the converging symmetric triangle was in a generally bearish direction leading to the break of the triangle on April 12th Furthermore a TA trader would see the confirmation of that declining interest in the stock in the daily volume of shares traded which receded along the same lines with a minor uptick in interest in the two day swing trade around earnings That is further confirmed by the CCI numbers which crossed over the 100 signal heading downwards also a bearish indicator and then inflecting into a sideways trading pattern for the rest of April into May The last month and a half of GME trading has been trading sideways in a gentle downward negative channel The upward swings to the top of the channel were based on periodic gamma pumps by a group that moves in and out of meme stocks like PLBY and GME during the week and usually pulls out money to go play in shitcoins over the weekend If you played GME in April it was good for 10 20 momentum swing trades based on the Max Pain theory or a more refined version based on trading the net delta between imbalanced puts and calls Predictions for the GME Stock Price on 28th May https preview redd it h7s495ppkvz61 png width 1175 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 2fc8023eed39ca303ae11e88a0d9282603ed75ba As a side note Elon Musk utterly destroyed multiple cryptocurrency markets last week Now all those shitcoin champions need a new place to dump their money after Papa Elon took a raging dump on their flagship shitcoin Since Papa Elon s TSLA is persona non grata the next best thing for many of these folks is buying calls on AMC and GME That s why you re seeing dozens of posts in WSB from pumpers on GME over the weekend into today That s why you re stuck reading shitty TA that recycles poorly drawn charts with no other signal indicators That s why when a certain dog coin collapsed on the back of an SNL performance you saw a pump in GME stock last week and again yesterday with the collapse of the main shitcoin If you want to play GME based on the TA make sure you teaching yourself from first principles and educational sources like Investopedia Don t blindly follow fuckwit cultists who are engaged in illegal market manipulation to induce you to buy shares HODL them like this is a cryptocurrency play and then get shit on when the cultists exit their gamma pumped calls while you re left holding bags in the form of GME shares

financial advice Be cautious to bet against Winnie the Pooh One major risk factor is the fact that BIDU owns 53 08 of IQ and even more worrisome is that about 30 of BIDU s revenue in 2021 stems from IQ Whether or not China will intervene to prevent the plunge in value of its own version of Google is unknown but is certainly a risk that should be hedged against I m very confident on this trade and have verified some of the more important arguments lined in the paper but as always do your own DD and hedge appropriately amp x200B Hi everyone I m here with another DD but this time it ll be a little different than my usual options exclusive DD Today IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result I ve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again It has reached its historical low at servals data before but it soon rebound for 5 after the financial statement is released However me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you amp x200B What is IQ iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the Netflix of China It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video live broadcasting online games online literature animations e commerce and social media platform The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally produced content partner generated content and user generated content It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics The company s revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services The company earns the majority of its revenue from China The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu the Google of China It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around 13 3 per share amp x200B How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report Total revenues reached RMB8 0 billion US 1 2 billion representing a 4 increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of 1 180 000 000 Membership services revenue was RMB4 3 billion US 658 1 million representing a 7 decrease from the same period in 2020 The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118 9 million as of March 31 2020 which was a high base due to the impact of Covid 19 to 105 3 million as of March 31 2021 Our subscribing members grew 3 6 million quarter on quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter during which people spent more time viewing content Online advertising services revenue was RMB1 9 billion US 292 5 million representing a 25 increase from the same period in 2020 The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery Content distribution revenue was RMB779 1 million US 118 9 million representing a 29 increase from the same period in 2020 The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter Other revenues were RMB961 0 million US 146 7 million representing a 10 increase from the same period in 2020 primarily due to the growth of certain business lines Cost of revenues was RMB7 1 billion US 1 1 billion representing a 10 decrease from the same period in 2020 The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5 4 billion US 829 6 million representing an 8 decrease from the same period in 2020 The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost Selling general and administrative expenses were RMB1 2 billion US 183 3 million representing an 8 decrease from the same period in 2020 This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year Research and development expenses were RMB672 3 million US 102 6 million representing a 1 decrease from the same period in 2020 Operating loss was RMB1 0 billion US 154 8 million compared to operating loss of RMB2 2 billion in the same period in 2020 Operating loss margin was 13 compared to operating loss margin of 29 in the same period in 2020 Total other expense was RMB222 4 million US 34 0 million compared to total other expense of RMB628 5 million during the same period of 2020 The year over year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss Loss before income taxes was RMB1 2 billion US 188 7 million compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2 9 billion in the same period in 2020 Income tax expense was RMB20 6 million US 3 1 million compared to income tax expense of RMB4 8 million in the same period in 2020 Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1 3 billion US 193 4 million compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2 9 billion in the same period in 2020 Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1 61 US 0 25 for the first quarter of 2021 compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3 92 in the same period of 2020 As of March 31 2021 the Company had cash cash equivalents restricted cash and short term investments of RMB13 3 billion US 2 0 billion amp x200B Financial Guidance For the second quarter of 2021 iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7 21 billion US 1 10 billion and RMB7 65 billion US 1 17 billion representing a 3 decrease to a 3 increase year over year This forecast reflects iQIYI s current and preliminary view which may be subject to change Price Target If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B 480 share However I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America Canada Europe you name it Also the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it which is 105 million Also the member revenues of Netflix is about 24 7 billion while that of IQ is only 4 3 billion IQ has only about 18 of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an 86 share target price But my price target for the entire company is at least 200 share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ Also there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas

spam https www reuters com technology gamestop amc short sellers sit nearly 1 billion loss ortex 2021 05 18 It s a fairly brief read and talked about short attacks and the estimate of losses institutions engaging in them are taking One billion dollars is a lot to individuals but is this actually significant to a financial conglomerate To me I just imagine the increased losses represent a higher fee for the still profitable returns on the part of those engaging in short attack strategies But if we pan out from the stocks being shorted aren t there dozens of other standard stock targets these attackers also pull from making steady profit to keep peppering the target ones Isn t all the stable stuff essentially the supply line that helps perpetuate the other more shady approaches to nurturing big league stock portfolios One theory I ve heard is that retail traders would potentially keep buying bits of the shares from the selling attackers and the float slowly but inevitably shifts to the little person I can see that but why did I even put value in the title Let s expose my bias first out of respect to the reader s individuality and thinking skills I am of the belief that we are in a recovery not a growth or boom like many media robots say The media says people are desperate to get back to work yet you can search local news in so many counties in America the one actual objective thing i did right here lol saying that there is a worker shortage still My bias take is that people don t want to go back to normal anymore so that they can just sustain and continue to exist They want out of that process altogether To me that seems to be cultural aspect of this phenomenon for the individual trader regarding the transient over under value we see exploding and dying off in some stocks right now If something can make a person s life comfortable or mold it more to be lived more on their terms it s priceless to that person usually The money itself achieves that but the stocks represent it The media can t understand that part so we get this very out of touch synopsis going on about the excitement and idiocy of it all the pointlessness of fighting Wall Street the inevitability of things going back to how they ve always worked etc A billion dollars can t actually exist in my mind but a magic rope that can pull me out of the sewer hole I m stuck in potentially never to return is pretty damn fancy looking to me Is it nice looking to anyone else Governments and jobs we work for promise us safety ropes and to keep us out of sewer holes but they tend to fall short so why not try to make your own that might really do those things On top of being YOUR rope and not some ghetto pre owned bungee cord A news achor can t say Well Jim daily life is so unpleasant for the average person due to our multitude of failing systems that they d really just like to either become wealthy or delete themselves from existing But to me the phenomenon is that simple My bias comes from being a social worker I guess Wasted taxpayer money and clients who are living in the most unfair circumstances get paraded by me a lot When you already struggle struggling a little more in exchange for a dice roll that could randomly stop it You d naturally gravitate to that too A big conglomerate to me is more like an orchard or farm You have the seeds planted You have your own produce You don t need the rope and you can t relate to the sewer mentality because you live on a farm People tend to your harvest sow your land and bring you the yield You aren t trapped or starving because abundance comes to you through a system you oversee You could lose a billion apples and oranges altogether but you aren t losing farmers land or the seeds you planted The value of all that is going to be wildly different because these sorts of people are not dealing with a uniting basic need like the ones truly struggling So thats what I m the most interested in through all of this The philosophical sum of these differing fundamental values I am not a one or other because I think that we won t see a definitive outcome There will be something new over an extended transition especially when we see what these new regulations will ultimately be and very out of touch experts will tell people how to believe it all happened Even if you look down on retail investors you still need to be curious about what they value about their stock Even if you look down on your idea of hedge funds and the wealthy you still need to be curious about what they value about their stock Because stocks are a mainstream general topic now more than ever The relevance and interest is going to keep growing Beyond that the other reality is that retail investors AND short seller HF s are BOTH contributing to the changes being explored for regulating the market Both sides are ironically working together The questionable and reckless things each faction does is where regulators will try to marry together something from awareness of BOTH kinds of investor that protects from risks losses while the other will look more at the global economy and how the government can keep up with BOTH factions enough to even track volatility market manipulation I also personally think right now that the regulatory portion of this can be seen as a third faction one which I think is worthy of due diligence and scrutiny on both the parts of the individual degenerate investor and the evil hedge fund overlords I think the idea that the government rushing to aid the HF s get control back is over simplifying the relationship those entities have while I also think the RH shutdown they bring up is just pandering to retail traders still voters more than anything at present Thanks for reading all that TLDR The individual trader and HF s are driving us towards a significant change in how investing will be regulated and despite moments where one philosophy seems to prevail over the other the reasons for investing behind these two separate factions will equally be responsible for what regulators decide Small edit The circumstances of the world as it is also clearly helped create the phenomenon we are witnessing play out Just an acknowledgement so somebody out there doesn t have to waste time typing it for me

investors Last time I made some predictions https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments m36xah future sole owner of gamestop here with a about where GME was headed I was off on a couple of things Was 50 optimistic on the no way it s going under this price Was 50 150 optimistic on the expected price fluctuation range Everything else pretty much holds true The stock price is being held down by a spectacularly deep pool of resources the hedgies have access to The stock price is fluctuating within a very predictable range WSB has hella y all a cult vibes and it s growing more and more intense by the week Confession Time My original thesis was that GameStop was going to remain grossly undervalued and be manipulated into oblivion by the Market Ma ke nipulate rs and to be totally truthful I was sort of betting against the apes Bullishly but not MOASS ly Though I did not believe in the MOASS I did believe that GameStop was heading in a positive direction and impossible to go bankrupt I trusted the company fundamentals and the new leadership s badassery This is why I set myself to sell calls at or near the money using the premium to buy more shares weekly rinse and repeat With the inflated IV at the time I have screenshots clocking at the money calls with over 1 000 IV it was a no brainer to use the hedgies tactics against them After end of January chaos I have gone from 639 shares https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lqaxe9 i will own gamestop update feb 22 in Sheriff of Nottingham to 2 000 shares https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments nfkqgt i will own gamestop update may 18 yes it counts in Fidelity which reminds me I believe someone owes me some hieroglyphics https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments lym9nz i will own gamestop update mar 5 2021 gptl2bv Lookin at you u strait flagellan not that I m that into myself but this is WSB Y all know the rules Just don t harm a tree or deface anyone s property please I must say now looking at the incredibly layered and in depth DD complex or convoluted choose your own adventure as well as the price action coupled with some stonk predicting tools I think I ve come to believe in not only GameStop as a company but also this MOASS thing the apes are all on about Which segues nicely into Predictions for What s to Come 2021 And Beyond none of this is financial advice I m just putting it out there so I have a timestamp on it like my previous long winded posts 1 GameStop is going to the moon and probably a lot further Straight up I m officially calling it now Why Because The fundamentals rock socks around the world The leadership is insanely good and growing better nearly by the day They cleared all debts and quietly did a stock offering to amass an extra 550M in fluid capital The apes are never backing down Not until it pops off The shares are for sure ludicrously shorted and must be well over 100 honestly wouldn t be surprised if it turned out to be over 1 000 by the time everything shakes out and that data comes to light Week after week month after month those paychecks are going into GME all around the world Literally any action taken against the hedgies by the SEC DTC C FBI at this point that is more severe than a fixed fine or if GameStop does some crazy dividend offering like a yet to be created digital dividend and there just isn t a formula to predict what the hell is gonna happen 2 Much or most of WSB is going to miss the start just like they did at 10 ish and again at 40 ish There will be some spectacular FOMO buy ins and snapping up of calls as the price skyrockets and many of the same people who have been shitting on this stock will make out like bandits having waited until 250 and then sold at like 2 000 or some shit My hats off to ya future freeriders 3 GameStop s final and fair value will be like Tesla There are so many shareholders who are going to become quite wealthy from the impending price action and some are quite possibly playing the current price action very well as long as are holding and using options to make tendies money that is After the MOASS so many apes will just reinvest a tidy sum that they aren t accustomed to living with anyway right back into the stock This will be like the vehement long term shareholders of TSLA who refuse to sell even though they have been holding since 5 pre split and are now 7 and 8 figure millionaires for the record I ve been making this prediction since early January and my favorite comment on the TSLA comparison was Fuck off TSLA is a Fortune 500 company There is no comparison Well guess what internet stranger So is GME now 4 It is entirely possible that because the hedgies are so incredible screwed on this situation and cannot afford to lose that there will never be a major pop off That GME will continue to trade sideways and up Forever With no all at once squeeze and more apes putting cash every week month with the stock price simply rising slowly outpacing the shorts bullshit tactics we will continue to see GME price be very stable or rise like a good blue chip stock Given this the apes will have unwittingly become excruciatingly successful long term shareholders and value investors In the instance of 4 being true GME will be the number 1 safest most consistently growing place in the world to store money TL DR I am converted GameStop to the moon my friends I will be opening a substantial long options position in addition to my held 2 000 shares 950C 1 20 23 which will fall well within the realm of WSB YOLO rules The reason for this options IV has dropped to around 100 which is dangerously low for GME This is the time to begin buying options in my opinion And while I will gamble weekly to monthly on selling calls I have zero intentions of playing so silly with when I expect a moonshot GME s deepest OTM FD Calls are the safest bet on Wall Street right now Mods I promise to post this long options position once when I open it and do no updates on those call options until I close the calls position
