play or don t I do not care This is the part where I tell you that I m not responsible for the decisions that you make with your life AerCap Holdings Inc is an aircraft leasing company based out of Dublin They don t make planes they don t fly planes They just own planes and they lease the shit out of them out to airlines around the globe They do this a lot and in fact they re the largest jet leasing company in the world both in terms of units and revenues And within the next 30 days they re about to get a whole lot fucking bigger I m putting this here so that my thumbnail image isn t a

on your mind Is this a reopening play The short answer is no AER is already back to pre pandemic levels While airlines are generally seen as a reopening play that has yet to fully recover you can consider AerCap to be fully recovered at this point AerCap doesn t have direct exposure to demand for commercial flights but rather to the ability of commercial airlines to service their lease obligations For some time during the COVID pandemic there were doubts over not only the airlines ability to pay but even over their ability to remain a going concern AerCap like banks and REIT s all around the world was forced to defer lease payments and restructure leases to accommodate the sudden disappearance of demand for air travel While demand has been slow to come back the airlines confidence in a comeback has been enough to get them back to tap into whatever liquidity they have to get themselves back on schedule with their lease payments Currently AerCap has about a 98 utilization rate of its aircraft and substantially all lease payments have resumed their normal pace As of year end 2021 the business had totally recovered from an operating cash flow perspective per the 4Q investor presentation https preview redd it y6kvbwskhq871 png width 497 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 466407797da4858a678fcc902b3c37fbf51e4bed Furthermore CEO Angus Kelly has repeatedly gone on record stating that confidence is strong that the global air travel industry will return to normal as communicated to him by his customers and as evidenced by the collection of lease payments As for how that affects AerCap stock air travel recovery to pre pandemic levels has already been priced in AerCap Holdings what is it This is an extremely well managed boring ass business As I mentioned this is the largest commercial jet leasing company in the world They buy airplanes using debt then they lease those airplanes to airlines and collect monthly lease payments Think of them like a REIT but in the sky Their list of clients is really fucking long including roughly 200 airlines in 80 different countries Name an airline it is most likely a customer https www aercap com our business our customers According to 3 31 2021 financials the business controls about 42 Billion in assets with 34 5 Billion of that being book value of aircraft The aircraft consists of the following

commitments to purchase 285 new aircraft through 2027 This table also shows average remaining lease term of 7 3 years amp x200B Cash Flow Normally this is the most important thing for me to consider but on this deal I don t find it all that pertinent You d be hard pressed to find a company with more stable cash flows year over year Revenues between 4 5 Billion and 5 Billion each year Net income of right about 1 Billion every year 2020 was a shitty year for reasons we all know and understand As I touched on above the existing business is back to normal as of this writing amp x200B Ok so why are we here The Big Fucking Deal On March 10 AerCap announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with GE to acquire 100 of GE Capital Aviation Services GECAS The deal is worth approximately 30 Billion That 30 Billion is buying a lot of fucking aircraft This article from 2018 https www mototok com blog top 10 aircraft leasing companies shows GECAS as the 5th largest jet leasing service in the world however more recent articles from the date of the merger announcement in March say it s the second largest behind only AerCap In either case GECAS itself controls an additional 1 600 aircraft and helicopters consisting of aircraft owned serviced and on order and has a client list consisting of 200 customers in 70 countries So this deal makes AerCap the lessor to just about every damn airline on the planet It is the world s biggest buyer of aircraft from Boeing and Airbus It is partnering with GE which builds 70 of the world s narrow body aircraft engines It also expands AerCap s business into a brand new operational territory Aside from being a commercial aircraft giant GECAS owns an entity called Milestone which is currently the world s largest helicopter leasing company According to the website https www gecas aero solutions Milestone is the world s leading helicopter lessor with the largest civilian helicopter fleet and a suite of leasing

to die down to this level and I finally started buying yesterday The upper end of the channel it s been in is about 62 80 which is the pre COVID high I m betting on it busting through the top of the channel if we get deal approval in July I m also trying to stay a little conservative with my positioning If the deal does not get approved AER should still bounce off the 200 EMA and get back in an uptrend with a positive earnings report and strong guidance in July which it will be You can play this with shares obviously and you might see the open interest on the calls and decide that s a better

a little bit about what this company does This is a subscription service that will send you a new box of dog toys and treats every month There are a couple different types of boxes subscription services available So naturally I m going to exhaust myself listing them all out below The original Barkbox This box contains different toys treats with new ones sent each month This would be their most pupular heh heh product The subscription service offered for this product benefits those who choose longer subscriptions Here are some prices 12 months for 23 a month 276 a year 6 months for 26

market is quite open at this point in time This is priced at 30 a month on their website Bark Eats as the name implies if you can read this is a dog food subscription This is a service that is personalized to your specific dogs and their diet needs Prices for this based on a 40 pound dog run from 30 60 a month They can potentially run more depending on diet needs amp x200B https preview

distribution which essentially gt just means they sell this shit on the internet retail stores that weird store gt from legend of Zelda with the onion things that shoot bubbles at you etc I gt believe that personalization as well as having multiple channels of distribution gt can really make bark an attractive company Alright so now that we ve gotten that out of the way let s talk about why I think this matters Afterwards I might even throw some numbers and charts your way Numbers are kind of like letters except they represent amounts of something Pet ownership is a huge industry In 2019 the global petcare industry grew to 120 billion and spending in the US alone rose up to 50 billion dollars In 2020 the global market has risen to 207 90 billion and 70 66 billion in the US alone This shows a CAGR Camping Around Gay Rabbits rate of 5 6 With the petcare industry growing at this rate why wouldn t there be a need to rope people into a monthly subscription of chew toys and snacks for

SPAC Merger We gotta talk about this boring shit really quick because its actually important and the reason why we re able to talk about this stock today On 17 December 2020 BARK signed a definitive agreement to merge with Northern Star Acquisition Corp STIC a SPAC led by Joanna Coles formerly editor in chief of Cosmopolitan Magazine her head shot photo is the most intense thing I ve ever witnessed She is also a board member in reddit meme favorite Snap SNAP and admittedly boring Sonos SONO Post merger the company began trading under bark From Seeking Alpha s article Barkbox Barking up the right tree This merger gave Bark 454 million of gross cash proceeds which includes 354 million from STIC s cash held in trust and a 200 million PIPE deal led by Fidelity Senator Investment Group the Federated Hermes Kaufmann Funds and affiliates of the Santo Domingo Group Essentially what we are looking at here is an influx of cash to the company to expand their presence and build more business Company Highlights So what this company does really well is their marketing and distribution This helped them reach 1 1 million active monthly subscriptions and a super high monthly retention rate of 94 4 They also have a huge social media presence with 8 5 million followers For matter of comparison and because I want to point out what this random fucking dog toy company is doing better than it s competitors Chewy has 695k followers Petco has 650k followers amp x200B https preview redd it 3v1b4xt61t871 png width 640 amp format png amp auto webp amp s d86ca267e2aaf0c0c881c69bb31d9f6e5e251ec7 Bark has made some ridiculous strides over the past few years In 2014 the company went from 80 000 subscribers to a barking 663k subscribers in 2020 Now just over the past year subscriber count has risen 58 or from 663k subscribers to over 1M subscribers This accelerated growth is attributed to an extreme bump in pet ownership due to covid A recent management presentation available on chewy s website show an expectation of growth from 224M in revenue for FY2020 to 706M in revenue in 2023 Wait more financials So I must mention that this company is not currently turning a profit Bark is currently focused on throwing a ton of money back into their marketing as well as r amp d This is also due to the high cost related to barks current focus on third party retailers this helps get their name out there more but is costly So basically this company is throwing a bunch of money into roping Becky s across the world into coughing up their daddy s

amp auto webp amp s 24e1debe335145d59b106840b7642ff039e1ce5e As we can see here for the next few years this company expects to throw a fuckton of money into their marketing The goal behind this is to grow the business exponentially For 2024 and beyond operating margins are expected to decrease Gross profit per customer has gone up annually while their customer acquisition costs have decreased gt Simply put this happens when a company s expenses exceed its profits The gt solution There s a few viable ones but for BarkBox The answer was to go gt public Let s take a look at some pictures of lines When Bark first went public in December of 2020 the stock opened at 12 40 Over the next few days it saw a 50 rise to 19 54 Since then it has experienced a subsequent drop of around 50 again

this mean going forward I don t fucking know I m not a wizard I did once go on the Harry Potter ride at universal studios though So for myself I see a good opportunity for entry at this price Let s take a look at a similar company Chewy is another dog toy related company that just began turning a profit in the fourth quarter of 2020 They became a public company on June 14 of 2019 Also note chewy

see this stock has essentially gone nuts over the past year Previous to reporting a profitable quarter in march of 2020 the stock typically traded within the 20 30 range From the results of the company s positive 4th quarter of 2020 earnings report the stock then saw a 356 run up to a share price of 118 69 So yea chewy great Good for you Nobody s going to argue that your stock is beast amp

a bone the market has for a pet company especially one beginning to turn a profit Can bark follow in these footsteps It absolutely can It will require the company to continue sinking its teeth into new markets which is exactly what they are doing Personally I remain bullish on this company Do I expect a 355 run up this year Well id really fucking like it if it did but I m OK with seeing this stock inch up to the 20 30 range as seen with chewy while they remained an unprofitable company What do I think is going to drive this stock price up right now Over the past month this company has received several buy ratings On June 28 a Citigroup analyst hit the company with a buy rating On June 10 and 14 both Jefferies and Canaccord Genuity hit this shit with a buy rating as well So now the company is 3 for 3 on buy ratings Pretty cool if you ask me It can be the start of a bullish upward trend for this stock over the next few weeks months As a result we ve seen the stock seemingly bounce off of support in the 10 range over the past few days While Thursday we did see a red day for the company the stock still sit s at higher than seen earlier this month Anyway that s all I got I like this stock and I feel its value in my plums This is not financial advice just a brief analysis on some things I like about this company amp x200B TLDR Company with great management backing them goes public sees an initial rise in stock price followed by a subsequent fall to support where we stand today Comparable companies show that this could be a profitable company and a worthy investment

of US consumers are considered nonprime making it difficult for these consumers to access financing options Additionally 67 of consumers with a FICO score below 700 need a BNPL option for large purchases Katapult provides this solution for online customers Katapult s platform integrates seamlessly to merchant sites so customers can choose the financing option as they check out Consumers are given three payment options through Katapult First 90 Days Customers only pay the cash price a 5 fee After 90 Days Customers can complete the purchase at a significant discount to the full lease to own cost Full Lease Term Payment is 2x the lease origination amount over the life of the lease Katapult is partnered with merchants such as Wayfair Lenovo Purple and Motorola The company also has partner integrations with Ecommerce platforms like Shopify BigCommerce and OpenCart Katapult gives online platforms access to larger customer bases and higher repeat purchase rates 45 Katapult also

Katapult released Q1 earnings yesterday The company did 82M in revenue up 88 year over year Net income was 8 1M or a 120 increase from Q1 last year Adjusted EBITDA was 14 7M good for a 122 increase over last year too How about forward guidance Gross Originations 375 425 million Revenue 425 475 million Adjusted EBITDA 50 60 million While the EBITDA target dropped slightly revenue and originations are in line with December s projections Relationship with Wayfair One metric that stood out to me was the acceleration of originations from non Wayfair merchants 58 of Katapult s revenue came from Wayfair in 2020 However in Q1 2021 Non Wayfair originations were up 87 4 This is compared to a 66 increase in Q4 2020 and 46 1 for FY 2020 Meanwhile Wayfair originations were up 57 7 Recent execution suggests that Katapult is making great strides to diversify its revenue streams While Wayfair is still the company s largest source of income Katapult CEO Orlando Zayas is not concerned In a recent interview he said this about their parternship with Wayfair I m not worried about it because if you re going to have a partner to have high concentration right now Wayfair is a great partner to have So we re really thrilled with their relationship And the relationship is pretty deep too We re actually in the process of doing a direct integration with them so that you know the tentacles if you will within the company are a lot tighter and then we have a two year agreement with them So you know am I worried about it No because it s a great retailer And I think our relationship is very strong but you know I would like to minimize it and have you know five or six Wayfairs and a bunch of other smaller ones With Katapult hinting at a deeper partnership with the furniture retailer and the company showing accelerated growth in its non Wayfair base I am not too concerned with the heavy revenue concentration Valuation Gap Valuation is the driving factor in my Katapult bull thesis The stock is dirt cheap While several reverse mergers have priced deals at sky high valuations KPLT went public at a 1B valuation with 450M in 2021 revenue amp x200B https preview redd it 6ecqnpvgdt871

was trading at 2 7x sales and 22 3x EBITDA That s less than 1 3 of PayPal s PYPL revenue multiple and 1 2 of Paypal s EBITDA multiple despite growing revenue 3x faster When compared to Affirm AFRM a more direct competitor the valuation gap is even larger Push that valuation out to 2022 and KPLT is 8x EBITDA and 1 5x revenue That s a value stock price for a hypergrowth company 22 4x revenue for an unprofitable company growing at 40 vs 2 7x revenue for a profitable company growing at 65 If Katapult went public through a traditional IPO it would be worth over 2B right now Because it used a reverse merger sentiment around the stock has been poor Growth Prospects A study from Juniper Research suggests that BNPL transactions will grow from 226B in 2021 to 995B by 2026 55 of Americans used a BNPL option as of March 2021 vs just 37 in July 2020 There will be room for a lot of winners in this market and Katapult will be one of them Katapult is forecasting over 1B in revenue by 2023 and the company could beat this number if it keeps aggressively expanding to include new merchants Katapult added 26 new retail partners in Q1 alone Additionally Katapult will benefit from the growth of its current partners like Wayfair Here s the deal there has been no sell side coverage on this stock yet When IBs start initiating coverage it s going to moon Price target 35 based on XYZ estimates You want to front run those releases This a millionaire making stock When valuation is expensive execution has to be perfect When valuation is cheap Any good news is a catalyst I am giving you a 30 stock for 11 Don t miss it Risks Like any investment Katapult has its fair share of risks The primary risk factors are Customer concentration Credit risk from nonprime consumers Competitors entering the nonprime market While Wayfair is still the company s largest customer Katapult has been growing its non Wayfair revenue base at an accelerating rate Management assured investors that Wayfair would be a partner for a long time so I don t foresee this risk causing any issues with business in the short term Katapult has also been able to post consistent profits while dealing with nonprime customers and its risk model has proven to be more accurate as the customer base expands Finally I don t see Affirm or another competitor taking market share from Katapult KPLT has a multi year head start in this market niche and it has been able to scale its operations profitably While other companies could enter this sector in the future the total addressable market is large enough to accommodate multiple players Conclusion Stop chasing stocks that already peaked and get in early for once Katapult is a criminally undervalued stock given its growth rate and competitors valuations and I think it should be trading around 25 per share at the minimum As we move further away from the reverse merger Katapult will trade on its own merit and I think the stock will appreciate accordingly Assuming Katapult continues to scale its revenue and expand its customer base I think the stock has a massive growth runway I m long shares and I plan to hold them for a while

consumers to access financing options Additionally 67 of consumers with a FICO score below 700 need a BNPL option for large purchases Katapult provides this solution for online customers Katapult s platform integrates seamlessly to merchant sites so customers can choose the financing option as they check out Consumers are given three payment options through Katapult First 90 Days Customers only pay the cash price a 5 fee After 90 Days Customers can complete the purchase at a significant discount to the full lease to own cost Full Lease Term Payment is 2x the lease origination amount over the life of the lease Katapult is partnered with merchants such as Wayfair Lenovo Purple and Motorola The company also has partner integrations with Ecommerce platforms like Shopify BigCommerce and OpenCart Katapult gives online platforms access to larger customer bases and higher repeat purchase rates 45 Katapult also uses a waterfall method to gain customers that failed prime lending

s 903d916097cfb87bb9fe6a28bdf4d3410d322aa6 Source Investor Presentation Now let s see how the company performed Katapult released Q1 earnings yesterday The company did 82M in revenue up 88 year over year Net income was 8 1M or a 120 increase from Q1 last year Adjusted EBITDA was 14 7M good for a 122 increase over last year too How about forward guidance Gross Originations 375 425 million Revenue 425 475 million Adjusted EBITDA 50 60 million While the EBITDA target dropped slightly revenue and originations are in line with December s projections Relationship with Wayfair One metric that stood out to me was the acceleration of originations from non Wayfair merchants 58 of Katapult s revenue came from Wayfair in 2020 However in Q1 2021 Non Wayfair originations were up 87 4 This is compared to a 66 increase in Q4 2020 and 46 1 for FY 2020 Meanwhile Wayfair originations were up 57 7 Recent execution suggests that Katapult is making great strides to diversify its revenue streams While Wayfair is still the company s largest source of income Katapult CEO Orlando Zayas is not concerned In a recent interview he said this about their parternship with Wayfair I m not worried about it because if you re going to have a partner to have high concentration right now Wayfair is a great partner to have So we re really thrilled with their relationship And the relationship is pretty deep too We re actually in the process of doing a direct integration with them so that you know the tentacles if you will within the company are a lot tighter and then we have a two year agreement with them So you know am I worried about it No because it s a great retailer And I think our relationship is very strong but you know I would like to minimize it and have you know five or six Wayfairs and a bunch of other smaller ones With Katapult hinting at a deeper partnership with the furniture retailer and the company showing accelerated growth in its non Wayfair base I am not too concerned with the heavy revenue concentration Valuation Gap Valuation is the driving factor in my Katapult bull thesis The stock is dirt cheap While several reverse mergers have priced deals at sky high valuations

Information Requests Shed Light on the Role the Securities and Exchange Commission played in the Puerto Rico Bankruptcy Story By Richard Lawless In the early stages of the Puerto Rico bankruptcy many of the victims were screaming bloody murder FINRA received so many complaints that they had to hire additional staff to handle all the work But FINRA was not alone the Department of Justice also received a large number of filings claiming all types of criminal activity took place that led to the Puerto Rico Bankruptcy But with the largest municipal bond bankruptcy in the history of the United States starting to move its way to the courts no one agency was busier than the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC The SEC says the mission of the SEC is to protect investors maintain fair orderly and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation The SEC strives to promote a market environment that is worthy of the public s trust With seventy billion dollars in pending defaults and over fifty million victims mostly senior citizens the SEC must have been concerned about how this came about and what they could do to prevent something like this happening again We thought we would put in a number of Freedom of Information FOIA requests and piece together the role the SEC played in all of this Two FOIA requests were made accepted and delivered to us The information we received dated back to mid 2015 and ran up to the current day What we found will amaze and confound even the strongest supporters of the American government The SEC started to receive reports as early as July of 2015 that there was massive theft taking place at the various Puerto Rico Municipal Agencies There were credible reports that potentially billions of dollars a year were being stolen from these agencies and that the money was being laundered overseas and then it would come back to politician s families DOJ Officials and United States Senators And this was just the tip of the iceberg We counted over three thousand complaints and whistleblower reports that were sent to the SEC between mid 2015 and June of 2021 The reports included forensic audits that showed the municipal agencies had been bankrupt for a long period before the bankruptcy filing as early as 2010 some have claimed The Agencies would falsify their financials by claiming phantom accounts receivable as income to qualify for good credit ratings If you took out this phantom income the agencies did not have the sufficient income to repay the bonds In the years that followed 2010 it simply became a Ponzi Scheme where the municipal agencies would refinance that debt before anyone could find out they could never repay it No different than what Bernie Madoff did More than that the Agencies included covenants promises in their bond offerings that would make the bond appear safer than it really was The Banks Fiduciaries and the SEC knew that the Agencies hadn t honored those promises for years but allowed the Bond sellers to continue to promote those covenants promises even though they have proven themselves worthless For example if the bond issuer could not make the bond payment from their current income they would raise their fees to protect the bond holders A promise that was broken repeatedly Now you would think that with evidence like that the SEC would have moved against the bond issuers the rating agencies and the banks Think again Based on the SEC s lack of actions it was clear the SEC felt this was all okay What if I told you that the FOIA disclosures showed that the ratings agencies knew that the Puerto Rico Municipal Agencies were bankrupt when they issued their good credit ratings or that the Banks knew they were bankrupt when they sold the worthless bonds to their best customers Based on FOIA documents this all happened according to the SEC So why didn t the SEC take action on these obvious and major securities violations FOIA documents appear to answer that as well It appears that between late 2015 and mid 2016 the ratings agencies and banks sent our U S Senators over one hundred and twenty million dollars in political donations Those donations resulted in favorable legislation that would protect the Municipal Agencies the Rating Agencies and the Banks In addition there were recorded telephone calls that implicated senior U S Senators in their effort to provide protection for the money they received by pressuring the SEC leadership to stop all investigations and regulatory actions You see according to the FOIA documents the CIA was tracking large wire transfers coming out of Puerto Rico and going to Venezuela When they started to wiretap those involved with the wire transfers they found out about the Political payoffs DOJ payoffs and U S Senator bribes This went on for a number of years and those recorded telephone conversations were offered to the DOJ twice once by the CIA and once by me The DOJ declined to accept that evidence Anyone can request these public documents through a FOIA request and can confirm all these facts for themselves My advice to you and your friends think twice about investing in bonds or anything that flows through the American financial markets there is no one looking out for your best interest Mr Lawless was a career banker investigative journalist and the author of Capitol Hills Criminal Underground Mr Lawless has written extensively about the Puerto Rico Bankruptcy and his articles have appeared in over fifty major publications

inject liquidity into their pools or in some cases make a buy sell of LP CAKE that increases their value without any reason The most amazing thing is that this type of hack is bending the rules of the blockchain by using exploit LP attack and making a chain of transactions usually at the same block where they buy LP CAKE and selling back at much higher value after a very short time As far as it

working together according to the time frames they attacked other tokens and the fact that in some cases they were able to make actions together at the same block We made a small first injection and when we noticed this anomaly we started to investigate it finally arriving at some conclusions about how to make future injections safer While analysing our transactions we also reviewed our code and its functions for any anomalies that might effect the security and we re happy to say it turned out completely secure and unaffected by this incident If it s all true it doesn t look like there is a way to stop those CAKE LP attacks and it seems that the entire BSCscan network is exposed to those cases Token owners make sure to check your LP tokens after liquidity injections and monitor your LP CAKE contract for any similar transaction as we mentioned Our team has sent an e mail to BSC Scan regarding this issue and we await their reply Wishing you all safe swapping BidenSwap Team

sensitive info that might aid other investors projects on BSCscan, Apparently some wallets can make a chain of transaction events that eventually steals LP CAKE from token owners who are trying to inject liquidity into their pools or in some cases make a buy sell of LP CAKE that increases their value without any reason The most amazing thing is that this type of hack is bending the rules of the blockchain by using exploit LP attack and making a chain of transactions usually at the same block where they buy LP CAKE and selling back at much higher value after a very short time As far as it seems the exploit LP attack happens through the BSCscan network unrelated to any token s code or function As far as we noticed they attacked much bigger projects Last example we found was Tron TRX TX https bscscan com tx 0xa7af78ed9ce9354acaaccfdf5a9fc076f2c53ed6f5970daa031cc2bf1d2fcaa3 https bscscan com tx 0xa7af78ed9ce9354acaaccfdf5a9fc076f2c53ed6f5970daa031cc2bf1d2fcaa3 The last wallets found

working together according to the time frames they attacked other tokens and the fact that in some cases they were able to make actions together at the same block We made a small first injection and when we noticed this anomaly we started to investigate it finally arriving at some conclusions about how to make future injections safer While analysing our transactions we also reviewed our code and its functions for any anomalies that might effect the security and we re happy to say it turned out completely secure and unaffected by this incident If it s all true it doesn t look like there is a way to stop those CAKE LP attacks and it seems that the entire BSCscan network is exposed to those cases Project owners make sure to check your LP tokens after liquidity injections and monitor your LP CAKE contract for any similar transaction as we mentioned Our team has sent an e mail to BSC Scan regarding this issue and we await their reply Wishing you all safe swapping BidenSwap Team

misinformation and quite frankly stupidity on this sub recently okay for a few months now Usually i just shake my head and sigh when the latest session of musical chairs on one ticker or another occurs after being pumped on here The dump then occurs within 5 to 10 minutes of open leaving a lot of bag holders I ve tried to stay out of these things even though i could profit off it The reason for this is two fold First I d rather buy companies that I am actually okay with holding because unlike most of you i can be patient and therefore my investment horizon for a baghold is longer than a day week or month The second reason is that I feel gross taking advantage of people who just dump their life savings without much due diligence into what they are investing in in the hopes of getting rich quick much too often resulting in them buying utter garbage While it would be equivalent to taking candy from a baby I m not out to harm people for my own benefit I grimace when i recall cases like the individual who was expecting his 4th child in two weeks but who dumped his entire savings into a RKT earnings options play and subsequently lost everything I can understand gambling with your money but i find it deeply disturbing when people gamble with their families money With that said somehow WSB ends up sweeping me along for the ride sometimes First with the Corsair 35 Call Options I bought for August 20 and had bought much before the pump of Corsair that i was forced to sell because it would have been ludicrous to keep them The second was when I bought some calls on SOFI expecting a short term jump after it crashed and ended up selling because it got pumped I kept my shares in both because I strongly believe in them and because the premiums are great for covered calls I was in SOFI before it got pumped and decided not to sell because I believe it is the next Ant Financial alongside Square but for America and eventually globally With that said people who had done their DD would have known that EagleTree Capital Insiders keep selling when the stock moves past 35 I digress however because I wanted to make some points The first one is that there are people who have been pumping stocks they know to be shit because they want to make money off your hopium This guy here is one Russell Reconstitution and why I believe RIDE is the best play to capture gains wallstreetbets reddit com https new reddit com r wallstreetbets comments o6tev5 russell reconstitution and why i believe ride is To be clear this was only one of a few posts made around that time but I confronted the individual who has now deleted his account you ll likely see why further down because I knew people were going to get fucked without lube and I didn t want to see people lose their money Ultimately i was downvoted to pieces However i ended up being right because now in addition to the SEC investigating Lordstown the DOJ is now doing so as well Justice Department Is Probing Lordstown Motors WSJ https www wsj com articles justice department is probing lordstown motors 11625239730 mod hp lead pos3 The second thing is that you guys are playing musical chairs with each other and more often than not taking money from each other when you do your little short squeeze plays Let me explain two things to you and you ll understand why The first is the concept of daily short interest fee and the second is the concept of maintenance The short interest Fee is calculated daily What does that mean Well if the short interest fee is 100 and you have 1M dollars worth of shares sold short then you multiply 1M by 100 So you literally do this 1 000 000 1 Then you divide by 365 So 1 000 000 365 2 739 72 So we ll round up and say that the short interest fee is roughly 2 75K a day While it can be punishing in the short term in the aggregate it will take a sustained period of high interest rate fees to actually dislodge someone that s sold short You as the buyers are in essentially a prisoner s dilemma as you need to cooperate but are also cognizant of the fact that when it all tumbles down it will tumble down hard As anyone with half a brain cell can tell you investing trading is not a team game and being first is what s important when it comes to these types of plays To add to that short sellers can add to their position at inflated prices knowing that the vast majority of times the share price will decrease significantly because it has been artificially inflated Let me be clear as to why it can be lucrative by going back to my 1M dollar hypothesis We know that 2 75K rounded up is how much you pay as a daily fee but let s say that the stock you have sold short 1M dollars goes down by 1 You are up 10 000 dollars which means that even if the fee is elevated for a day or even a few days the short seller still comes out on top Maintenance requirements are a function of volatility and maintenance requirements go up as volatility goes up With that said hedge funds do not go all in on selling short one stock They diversify Which is why you usually see other companies that they are short on spike when one of their holdings is attacked by a short squeeze attempt It s because they are liquidating their usually positive position to post the collateral for the maintenance requirement as they wait you out with the understanding that 9 9 times out of ten the prisoner s dilemma will win out Most of the time the companies these people short are unprofitable or extremely ill which means they dilute themselves and end up allowing people who sold short to exit mostly intact This ends up hurting existing shareholders as well as people who hoped to squeeze the short sellers This is another form of the prisoner s dilemna For a successful short squeeze there are several elements in play that must be met for it to have a decent to strong chance of success These elements do not have to be the same but the broad strokes are usually the For three successful ones I would direct you to Volkswagen Gamestop and UWMC If you want an explanation for why each one of them was met i can explain below Now this is for the Mods as i believe that it s better to be constructive than critique mindlessly These are my suggestions 1 Tier the Due Diligence Section Have one section for approved individuals like u pennyether Individuals who have made past contributions with the caveat that they were well written and researched The other section for unapproved individuals would function just as the current board does now for DD where anyone can post with the understanding that most of the due diligence will be garbage but there will be diamonds in the rough so to speak as people post there who know what they are talking about Once identified even if the poster has only ever written that one due diligence post they can be given access to the section for approved individuals I don t like to toot my own horn but at least i cite my sources Some other individuals i can think of other than Pennyether are 1 The guy who wrote about SKTelecom twice even though it was an OTC 2 The guy who talked about MX 3 u gingermanns though i disagreed voraciously with his legal argument 4 Whoever originally wrote the OG RKT Earnings Play 2 Sticky a post describing all the steps it actually takes to do a short squeeze and then make a rule stating that they have to advance a legitimate thesis hypothesis about how it would come about using the guideline posted in the sticky For example force them to address the possibility of shareholder dilution etcetera Then shut anything down resembling muh short squeeze that doesn t conform to that 3 This is really something out of left field but I ve always questioned your ban on OTC tickers that met the minimum market cap requirement as there are a lot of good companies that have been posted here CDProjectRed a few times as well as the aforementioned SKT Telecom The liquidity should not be a problem for these companies If you believe that there is however you should increase the market cap requirement for OTC tickers but allow them with that heightened market cap requirement I get that IFRIS is different than GAAP but it IS internationally recognized and there is nothing wrong with large companies listed n EUROPE HK London etcetera To end this all I d just like to clap back at some people who badmouth one of the fundamental analysis G O A T s and my boy Warren The Bestest Buffet He says Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful And the majority of you folks are greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy Otherwise known as buying at the top and selling at the bottom So you know the GOAT s a winner maybe listen to him a bit
