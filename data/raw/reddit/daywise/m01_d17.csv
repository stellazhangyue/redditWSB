about the technical factors for GME and felt inspired to make a post about the reasons why I m long this stock which is the fundamentals I don t do options or techincal analysis so please refer to other posts for that info GME had been on my radar for quite some time but I finally dipped my toes in two weeks ago The basis for that wasn t the potential for a short squeeze or short interest but the underlying fundamentals behind GME I had posted a long comment in a previous thread and will expand on that to explain why I m bullish long term for GME I hope this helps This post is meant to be a personal opinion and not advice to buy or sell Gamestop Case 1 Digital sales will make Gamestop the next Blockbuster The digital game sales argument like all arguments are weak The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle So maybe the are right but they re right in 8 years which means they re wrong now Additionally digital sales growth has decelerated and are returning to pre covid levels as more people go back to stores This trend should continue if the pandemic improves Additionally game publishers don t care about the fractionally larger margins from selling digital direct They only care about moving as many units as quickly as possible If they could sell the games on floppy disks they would Go read the public filings for any game publisher and they will tell you that they only care about selling what customers want and guess what they still want physical Blockbuster died because Carl Icahn got involved killed Blockbuster s attempt to pivot to a Netflix model by offering an online rental service and Blockbuster s old business model relied on late fees Icahn insisted that Blockbuster s greatest asset was its physical location and late fees killed the pivot and forced them to triple down on their old strategy Carl ended up losing 98 of his investment in Blockbuster There continues to be demand for physical movie rentals as evidenced by Red Box locations and Netflix still has a few million dvd by mail subscribers Gamestop has also recently started to pivot away from software sales into other areas and now software sales now make up large minority of Gamestop s total sales They re pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware Everyone knows that they signed a revenue agreement with Microsoft where Gamestop will get a cut of the lifetime revenue from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate This shouldn t sour the relationship with Sony or Nintendo If anything Sony and Nintendo should be compelled to offer a similar revenue share agreement because Gamestop will inevitably push Microsoft products if Gamestop stand to profit more from it This will be a bigger deal in later years as console availability increases and consumers actually deciding to cross shop consoles as opposed to getting whichever new one is available right now Sony and Nintendo won t stop selling products through Gamestop because of this agreement with Microsoft it s too large of a sales channel to give up 2 Gamestop will go bankrupt This is highly unlikely to happen Gamestop managed to survive the single worst brick and mortar retail sales environment in modern history and ended the year with a cash surplus of a few hundred million Now its the new year and the beginning of a new console cycle This console cycle should last as long as the previous ones which is close to a decade plus or minus a few years During that time they will be printing money hand over fist selling consoles new games used games accessories protection plans etc 3 Brick and mortar retail is dead Gamestop locations are shutting down left and right this must mean they re going bankrupt Gamestop s average lease durations are actually quite short A lot of brick and mortar shops have lease duration lasting a decade but the average lease duration for Gamestop is just 2 4 years This allows them to close underperforming stores and open new ones very quickly Gamestop s saw e commerce grow by 250 last quarter The company has been and continues to pivot towards a digital first omni channel ecosystem for games and entertainment Case This MOASS could be long and protracted like Tesla in all of 2020 as many continue to bet against Gamestop instead of a sharp spike like Volkswagen where Porsche played a large role in spiking the share price Keep in mind that at 1x sales the share price should be 80 100 Compare that with another retailer Chewy which has a p s of 6 7x Pet products also has a much lower TAM than gaming This isn t even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning Look at the newest board composition Newest members are Reggie my body is ready the head of cloud 9 esports and the current president Petsmart and Chewy board member Ask yourself are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales This has moved beyond a short squeeze yolo to a long term hold If RC succeeds in transforming this into the next Chewy you re looking at a 20x multiple This is based on fundamentals and industry tailwinds I added 10k shares weeks ago and added 20k shares at 38 because this thing is going much higher and idgaf about a few bucks in share price right now Also don t attempt to time the market because you could be left behind at the launchpad Simply put if I told you there was a business that served a 200 billion total addressable market with very discerning and loyal customers with a lot of disposable income to spend on this market They have over 5 000 retail locations all across the world Last quarter they saw Ecommerce grow by nearly 300 and ended a year where many other brick and mortar retailers went bankrupt with hundreds of millions of dollars in extra cash This company has a database called PowerUp consisting of tens of millions of customers that pay them a yearly premium membership They re starting a multiyear pivot into several new growing areas and have new board members that are industry leaders in each of those respective areas at the start of a new product launch cycle that will last a decade A young visionary founder who made his billions by creating a customer centric experience that defeated Amazon who is well known to focus on one idea to the point of obsession just became this company s largest shareholder and now controls the board I tell you this company trades at 5 sales Would you short or long this company TLDR But not because of the MOASS

took a lot of research and typing to prepare this for you But personally I m a GME believer and it WILL fly So you bought GME shares because strangers online told you to and you begin to ask yourself if you are retarded The answer is yes yes you are But there is a good chance you are a lucky retard If you are FOMO guy you have to decide which scenario is more likely and enter if you believe in happy endings There is a lot of noise regarding GME and there is barely any good DD anymore This is why I decided to put this together You have to keep in mind that I am a retard myself and not an OG GME gang I entered GME in January paper handed in worst possible moment because I thought squeeze has sqoze I am now back in the game and reinvested my profit and more back into GME Only reason why I feel competent to do this is because a I read a lot about GME and shovel through all the noise to find meaningful info b apparently no one else is willing to do it properly So here it goes from the worst case to the best All possible scenarios I can think of If I miss anything or I messed something up please let me know and I will update this list This is not a financial advice You have to make up your own mind and if you can actually read do your own research WE ARE FUCKED scenarios Ryan Cohen played us all In this scenario RC sells or already sold his shares We have been duped and it all has been pump and dump We are all royally fucked For this scenario RC despite what you can read around here is not your actual daddy He is a business man looking to make profit Against this scenario RC is fucking rich and if he wanted he could already retire It would ruin his credibility How do we know it is happening We learn through official paperwork that RC sold his shares price reaches near 0 within minutes My personal opinion Near zero chance this happens But if its does Price Target PT is very low Shorters pull a fast one on us In this scenario institutions find a way to squeeze margin positions outplay options and wait out long positions For this scenario They have written the rules of the game and honestly they know much better how to play it then us Against this scenario If they could do it they would probably have already done it instead of loosing almost a billion in optoions last Friday How do we know it is happening Serious price drop on Tuesday despite short restrictions Price falls in following days below 20 per share and refuses to come back up for a very long time My personal opinion Non zero chance this happens It is possible But IMO unlikely because I believe that if they could save their options they would have done it already PT uncertain but definitely below 20 10 15 if I had to guess Neutral scenarios We are in a deadlock aka neutral but actually bad In this case old shorts are actually covered and we have new shorts on our hands Price volatility and actual price slowly decrease Both sides play a waiting game RC and GME are radio silent for few months For this scenario Institutions has already proven that they are committed to their shorts And they will not admit defeat Shorts have more money and patience If shorts are replaced by new ones they will not bleed but that s unlikely We believe but a lot of us have paper hands and or can t afford to keep cash frozen to wait this out Hype will die down and with it our conviction Against this scenario If the price settles above 30 or even better above 35 shorts will bleed money If the price remains low 30 or below there may come other large investors for a long position after they realize that this is a good value investment This would trigger good scenarios How do we know it is happening Price volatility decreases over next week or two and settles probably somewhere between 25 and 35 My personal opinion Honestly I m mostly afraid of this scenario But at the same time it s not very likely that shorts are replaced Then again if nothing major happens relativly soon this is still a likely scenario PT 25 30 for months to come until one side wins We are in a deadlock aka neutral but actually good In this case price volatility slowly decreases and both sides play a waiting game RC and GME are radio silent for few months But in this scenario we overcome our collective retardation and show how strong we are through our unity Price slowly rises over next months as shorts slowly close their positions For this scenario If the price settles above 30 or even better above 35 shorts will bleed money and will be One should never underestimate autists Against this scenario United retards with diamond hands Retail investors are market makers I want to believe that we have that power but lets keep it real How do we know it is happening Price volatility decreases over next week or two and settles probably somewhere between 25 and 35 But the trend will become upward after that My personal opinion Hard to say I think some actually good scenarios are more likely then this one Good scenario Slow and steady short squeeze We win Shorts are out of ammo Friday dip was their last hail Mary to stop loses on their puts and are forced to close their position GME begins it s burn to the moon For this scenario Shorts are already kind of fucked Big investment firms have proven many times before that they are arrogant and they can be very wrong GME is shorted into oblivion and unless it declares bankruptcy in next weeks or months they will HAVE to exit Any good news will make this only more likely like new investor reveals that they are getting involved for a long position Against this scenario Like I said before we don t exactly know what shorts could have up their sleeve If shorts are replaced by new ones they will not be forced How do we know it is happening Price jumps on Tuesday and continues the trend more slowly later even without short restrictions My personal opinion It s likely and this is my bet PT very hard to say but could be anywhere between 60 and 200 or even way more in next weeks or months Mother of all Short Squeezes We make history It turnes out RC actually is your father In next few days or weeks he reveals his master plan and shorts are royally fucked They will sing songs about us For this scenario All of the good scenarios fors but the good news is actually something big RC or GME reveals that sends shorts running for their life Against this scenario RC signed a document that prohibits him from acquiring more then 20 shares and while float is low compared to shorts it s not enough for MOASS How do we know it is happening Price opens at 200 or 400 and only goes up PT a random number between 420 69 and infinity Sorry FOMO guys the rocket is already past Jupiter My personal opinion I and many others dream that RC drops a bomb before Tuesday but I honestly give this maybe 10 chance of happening My position 254 long shares at 35 90 205 leveraged shares at 36 48 Don t judge me I am europoor

basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards Dont give me awards legit go buy a powerup membership for a year Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by Suck Elons Cock somehow im also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates TLDR GME DD sumarized Margin doesnt affect longs the same way as shorts right now Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though s mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us Compulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something Basically been seeing posts about blah blah margin this short interest this WS to clever blah Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree cuck so dont expect any bear bloomberg level shit or something 1 GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri So basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money This man bought apple stock in 2017 Hes fucking rich Hes also an eccommerce wizard taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co founded company to a 4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something Its now valued at 40 Billion granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit idk im a virgin so dont listen to me so it may well be a bubble Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing mitosis on agar jelly THEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD the market for that is like what 1 Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand Hell fucking do it again About digital everyone here already knows microsoft deal Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having Digital game exchanging or something image below Processing img 2ba9j5d2zvb61 He also mentions streaming digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres Internet cafe table games like Dungeons and dragons and 40k rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid and as we now might know due to this post https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kypuyb gme dd buildapc kiosks coming https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kypuyb gme dd buildapc kiosks coming BUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS This is the literal smell of money Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC s and it cant go tits up Now for some pussy boomer talk aka fundametals or something The expected Q3 EPS was 0 84 or something close to that The actual loss was 0 53 but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores In the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below 11 of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3 Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5 They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect Eccommerce is up 300 over holidays In Q3 they reported 800 to date In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT Online sales now account for 33 of Gamestops sales now This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen We are still trading at 0 38 P S at this price The average P S for the SP500 is 2 753 Massive upside on these two numbers alone Burry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value At the time intrinsic value was like 22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights GME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying omnichannel at the speed of light Yes the revenue dropped 30 but thats covid for you As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too as youll see in a crayon drawing later The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get Combine the fact that they share game pass a massive hit revenue from the xboxes they sell something no other retailer has revenue could be sky high Now I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life How do you think I feel My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences Holdiay report was a bear trap imo saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah Lies Comparitve store sales rose 5 and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated Also in Ryan cohens letter they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth Gamestop realistically needs like 1 2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency https www entrepreneur com article 349890 https www entrepreneur com article 349890 this article the messiah himself wrote In it he states gt At Chewy we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money The company wide culture of frugality came from his example Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth We grew Chewy from 200 million in sales in 2013 to 3 5 billion in 2018 while spending only 130 million in capital all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers Maniacal Thats all I need to say The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every cuck analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen So in the headin i said its a steal That implies some future higher price target right Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard amp x200B The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares another reason shorts are fuk https preview redd it dehiug393wb61 png width 1552 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9 8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach 9 8 2 48 3 95 3 95 35 5 140 The share price now to reach old mkt cap is 140 fucking dollars Thats a 4 bagger from now It gets better from statista https statista com gt Considering the annual inflation rate in the United States in recent years a 2 24 percent inflation rate is a very moderate projection If we take 2 24 inflation the this share price target in todays money means we should reach 182 because of 140 1 0224 12 182 in adjusted Thats more than a 5 bagger basically we could see 10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket I really dont understand the bear thesis The only bear thesis short term this one was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit Buy shares with cash though dont use margin Own your piece of GME dont borrow it Bears just spout DigITaL or BlOCKbuSTER so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them All the bears think theyre clever What the fuck makes those cucks special How are they different now than the ones from 2 or 4 or 10 Bears are betting against Ryan fucking cohen buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment now 40 billion Michael burry Investing legend predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april u DeepFuckingValue the new WSB god

own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit All of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears Microsoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME amp x200B Some valid bear thesis left now the only ones left gt Ryan Cohen dies 2 Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data Ok everyone on here and their cat dog bedbugs and wifes boyfriend knows about the squeeze Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1 of their fund Although I know all you cucks hate shares and hate holding if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me STONK ONLY GOES UP This squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood Most of the funds where shorting this from 30 15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care It all changed with 2 people u DeepFuckingValue and Dr Michael Burry These guys are as OG as it gets with GME I think u DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train Ive been in since 13 with 125 shares If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok Im merely a medium for this money made information The stats for this stock now short wise are from ortex Concrete short interest as of 31 December 2020 71 Million Estimated short interest January 11th data This isnt predicted this is from data in flow has margin of error 77 Million Short shares on loan 7 days ago 50 Million Short shares on loan now This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis 54 2 Million of known float short 147 as of 31 December 2020 of know free float on loaned shorts 108 as of January 11th Some guy https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kyocql updated potential holdings of gme on here took into account extra buying on wednesday Institutions Burry RC s extra 7 and WSB ownership something so stupendously retarded no serious firm will do it that float on short could be in the 100s of Total short float now I would say could be 200 400 if the numbers are correct This pisses on all other short squeezes Some countries ban shorting above 100 cos of how autistic it is The recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday remember some guys are now buying lambos with GME money If they held they could by 10 calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was 10 Gamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now Processing img xsetax08pwb61 Need rockets Ok so now if WSB owns an estimated 6 8 of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls we should be minimizing longs getting margin called Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts blockbuster and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal 54 Million shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more Why Because every long on margin is in the green and now a true zealot extremist autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call Shorts are in the massive red zone How do I know you ask Ortex data from Jan 4th 2021 Processing img urqb3c3zbwb61 So this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66 98 Million shares From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from 21 to 17 so shorts took profits The shares on loan arent for longs too This is all purely short data and 47M shorted at 17 this shows These shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared Now for the data for this week amp x200B Ortex short data for Jan 14th for Gamestop https preview redd it 5ryumpl1dwb61 png

short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount Longs on margin need to supply collateral but we are in the massive green zone shorts are underwater Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day so shorts can only short on the way up Im not saying itll happen but this shit is skewed in our favour big time we need to https

hedging right That shits up their with the black scholes equation and feynman kac solution Forget about it The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because no one except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market and wow who couldve guessed it like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible That guy talking about Gamma Delta and margin calls is on weeklies Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts on to the options distributions Two images now Top one is before the end of the 15th the other one is after market close amp x200B Processing img t8odq9btgwb61 amp x200B Processing img 3nqb33f0hwb61 These two graphs show before market close and after As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high They expired worthless Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money Something else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before tens of thousands We are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash then shorts are likely on more margin than longs Regardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others Bear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time but differences in free float change the share price differently Kodak went from 2 16 to 33 2 Volkswagen went from 200 euro to nearly 1000 Overstock went from 21 to 123 Blue apron went from 2 31 to 18 Ive been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates 1 now is 2 81 of the share price Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest This assumes no sell off and no new shorts new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen 35 5 1 0281 77 299 GME to moon This shit can happen Hold on GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles Shorts never win and they wont win now amp x200B Processing img 4ysv7bzclwb61 Basically the crayon chart shows green outstanding shares orange short shares purple Market cap and cyan Share price In 2006 2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest Like now Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price This happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned Now we get to the best part History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares which have been decreasing since 2010 Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future well ever Ps5 and Xbox Series X are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2 This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before This shit has literally never happend ever Uncharted waters and we

but I ve seen an opportunity for GameStop to be the Amazon of gaming for a long time I do inbound marketing SEO and PPC for pretty large companies for the past 15 years almost and GameStop is literally leaving money on the table I ve been trying to contact them and help them implement some easy changes that will help them rank on page 1 of google for huge keywords and those rankings will translate to more traffic which will turn into more sales and of course more sales hopefully stock price increase Quick Analysis Amazon com https Amazon com Domain Rank Score 96 Domain rank is a quick not always accurate but in this case a decent way of gauging a domains ranking power on Google Bestbuy com https Bestbuy com DR88 I ll explain why this matters in a second Newegg com https Newegg com DR84 Same Gamestop com https Gamestop com DR81 So just on domain rank Gamestop can hang with the big boys Gamestops ability to rank for highly competitive keywords is fuckin insane the domain has been around for a long time it s SUPER strong Note Domain Rank is just 1 signal of a websites ability to rank but there s a reason Amazon com https Amazon com ranks highly for anything without even trying they have a super strong domain GameStop also has a super strong domain just not utilizing it properly like at all they re making fuckin rookie mistakes and hopefully Ryan Cohen plans to fix them but he and nobody else on the marketing department replies to my emails so who knows They should AT LEAST be able to hang with the big boys on page 1 for pretty much any gaming term they want position 1 on Google will be tougher but with the right strategy implemented they should be able todo it Now check this one 1 example I literally sent this to their entire marketing department they opened the email like 132 times and nobody responds saying thank you or yeah we re working on it so I assume they are not Go to https www gamestop com video games pc accessories monitors https www gamestop com video games pc accessories monitors First problem Look at the title tag in your browser by it is optimized for PC Monitors WHY WHY You do not sell PC Monitors game stop you sell Gaming Monitors do not try to cater to the masses Cater to the gamer which by the way the term gaming monitors gets 246 000 searches month so there s still a massive amount of searches demand for that Second problem There is literally 0 written content on the page it s a list of monitors go back to Google and search gaming monitors look at position 1 and 2 best buy and newegg notice they have a bunch of written text at the bottom of the page Google likes this Third problem Look at Newegg and BestBuy pages again notice they both have an h1 tag at the top of the page that says Gaming Monitors Go back to Gamestops comparable version there s not even an h1 tag Intermission rant GameStop is making rookie mistakes with a powerhouse of a domain They have such a strong domain that just doing these 3 things would skyrocket them to page 1 of Google Most companies come to an industry with a shitty domain they registered 2 weeks ago it has 0 authority in Google s eyes no strength but they nail all of these things I just detailed all of these easy wins while a huge company like GameStop just overlooks this stuff and this PC Monitors is just 1 example they are missing the mark for EVERY category page on their site end rant Fourth Problem Notice at the top of the page there s a banner ad This is Google AdSense Why the hell are GameStop letting other companies run ads on their site This is the sign of a company who has thrown in the towel they get like 0 10 per click on that banner maybe They should be monetizing their own traffic by selling visitors products not allowing other companies even competitors to come buy their traffic for pennies amp x200B Why do I care why should you Yes it would be nice to see our GME shares go up but also I m really passionate about what I do and I feel like I m watching someone dig for oil and I know that if they just moved over 3 feet to the left they d strike I feel bad for not trying to help them I m not trying to sell them on my SEO services that would be cool to land them but literally if they just take everything I outlined here and applied it with their already existing inhouse staff they would without a doubt jump a shit ton of spots in Google and at least be in the fight against domains like Amazon Newegg Bestbuy etc Right now they dont even exist when someone does a search for gaming monitors and dozens of other searches If they got to page 1 they d increase traffic clicks hopefully sales I m not really sure how to get this message in front of them tried emailing the marketing department tried tweeting them maybe I m just not patient enough for they just don t give AF If one of you has a contact tell them to respond to the marketing moron who keeps harassing them and let him help

of WSB autists being the new market makers and us having control over the market now but many of us may ask ourselves is that really true Below is a thought experiment to help quantify this discussion using the current example of GME If ur retarded and can t read theres a TLDR at the bottom and a couple rocket emojis We will begin with a quick history lesson on the VW short squeeze https moxreports com vw infinity squeeze Everyone seems to compare this GME situation with the VW short squeeze but how similar are they The short answer is that on paper they are not similar but in reality they could be VW was viewed as high probability bankruptcy candidate and as such had a short interest of 12 8 of outstanding shares in October 2008 That s not a lot Short interest is the number of shares sold short borrowed that have not yet been covered or closed out Compare that to GME which as of 1 15 apparently has 138 short interest https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kyp0q3 gme short interest update 13808 ref share amp ref source link So that s it right Game over because GME has more short interest so its a bigger squeeze than VW No not exactly See its easy to avoid a short squeeze when there are shares available to close the position VW shorts could have easily closed out a measily 12 8 of outstanding shares since in October of 2008 only 55 of VW shares were unavailable At the time Porsche already owned 30 of VW shares Lower Saxony owned 20 and various indexes owned 5 That left 45 of shares available and only 12 8 needed to cover But then under the noses of VW shorts Porsche announced over the weekend that they had increased their stake by an additional 44 of shares meaning that 99 of VW shares were unavailable only 1 of shares were left and shorts had needed 12 8 of the shares to close their position Thats Bad and Thats What Sent The Shorts Scrambling to Cover Later that week VW shares peaked at 1000 What is interesting here is that the shorts weren t even acting irrationally they were just unaware of the extent of which shares were unavailable until it was too late Now lets compare this to GME Previous estimates of the quantity of GME shares unavailable can be found here https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kwb827 gme endgame dtc infinity ref share amp ref source link here https www reddit com r wallstreetbets comments kyocql updated potential holdings of gme ref share amp ref source link and here https www morningstar com stocks xnys gme quote For simplicity we will use Morningstar s estimate GME has a float of 27 29 million shares which means that all but 27 29 million shares are tied up due to insiders and institutions So 39 of shares are available that s less than VW before Porsche upped their stake but with far greater short interest Now here is when the thought experiment really begins and we transition from a history lesson to math class So VW shorts got pinned in a situation where only 1 of shares were available but they had 12 8 of shares outstanding GME shorts are in a position where 39 of shares are available and they have 138 of shares outstanding So a short squeeze certainly seems on the horizon but the ratio of shares available and shares needed to cover isn t as extreme as VW But what would happen if less shares became available Well if Ryan Cohen purchases the remaining 7 4 9 million of shares that hes allowed the shares available would drop to 32 further polarizing the ratio But this is what I want you to think about Float shares available does not account for retail investors because the consensus is that we are paper handed bitch bois and are apt to easily sell our holding What if that wasn t true WSB retail investors has 1 9 million members if we all hold an average of 1 share each the true shares available would drop to 29 4 If we hold an average of 3 shares each then shares available drops to 24 With an average of 5 shares each shares available becomes 18 5 10 shares each only 5 of shares are left available So VW had a ratio of 1 of shares available to 12 8 outstanding 12 8x Currently we are sitting at 39 available with 138 outstanding 3 5x If Cohen ups his stake we get 32 available and 138 outstanding 4 3x To match the VW ratio there would need to be 10 8 of shares available with the 138 outstanding 12 8x For that to happen it would mean that WSB alone has to hold an average of 8 shares per member to expect a squeeze of similar strength as the VW squeeze How far can this thought experiment go though What if GME had only 1 of shares available just like VW did Well for that to happen it would mean that WSB holds an average of 11 25 shares and that would get a ratio of well 138x So you guys do the math is retail really in control here It s looking like a maybe To conclude this thought experiment I will present you with a hypothesis that will either prove or disprove this theory If retail investors can hold their shares and reduce the available float then they have control over the market in this particular example The hypothesis will be proved if retail investors can cooperate and act as an institution taking enough shares out of circulation The hypothesis will fail if retail investors do not take shares out of circulation and have no control over the float Now this is a thought experiment so I have to provide some realistic criticism for you to accurately judge the situation Ryan Cohen has no obligation to buy the addition 7 but the consensus is that it seems likely WSB may not have 1 9 million users who are active bullish and dedicated to holding and they certainly may not have an average of 8 shares each this is less likely but possible I am not a financial advisor I am retarded like you guys do not take this thought experiment as the word of god Furthermore I am not advocating that ever member here go and buy 10 shares of GME to force a squeeze this is simply a way to explain the mechanisms behind the VW short squeeze and compare them to the current GME situation Do your own research and make an educated decision on whether or not you believe GME is a wise investment TLDR Thought Experiment If VW squeeze hard cuz very few shares available and too many shares shorted but GME only have moderate shares available and way too many shares shorted then if GME only have very few shares available that mean GME squeeze hard too

think Palantir has a lot of room to run over the course of the next week or so just hear me out Let me just start out by saying this is one opinion of a single retard on wall street bets and you should not just buy in cuz of me Anyways here we go pigeons on Friday 1 15 2021 Ark Invest all hail our queen Cathie Wood made a significant stock purchase of Palantir for the first time since initially taking a position mid November The Ark Invest hype train is real right now look at other similar new investments from ARK we ve seen significant positive price action in the weeks that follows mass quantity share purchases Last time queen Cathie bought a significant amount of shares in PLTR we saw the stock price nearly double in the coming weeks Now before you clowns try to call me out let me be clear this alone is not enough to double up the stock price from current levels BUT WAIT DID I MENTION THERE IS MORE On January 26th 2021 Palantir will have a major event called Live Demo Day where the company will display the efficiency of its products to the world This could be a massive short term catalyst combined with Queen Cathie s purchase What the hell does this tendy lious company sell you might ask Their products are basically Artificial Intelligence that rapidly analyzes massive quantities of data for business s in order to improve daily operations The more the internet scales and the more data is collected by businesses the more demand there is for data processing As companies scale their technological forces they often cannot keep up with processing the data to make efficient business decisions this is where Palantir comes in Oh and did I mention Palantir has contracts with the US Army and FDA Government entity partnerships are very good way to get large businesses to trust your ability to analyze data efficiently Palantir has also been processing vaccine trial data to look for patterns this opens the door to pharmaceutical companies pursuing partnerships in the future as they observe what significance Palantir has in gathering Covid vaccine data It also appears to become more and more common for businesses to need data processing to make better business decisions as the internet scales So what the fuck is my point This is a great story for investors to buy into and is exactly the kind of thing that can get the hype train going IN MY OPINION three very powerful words In my opinion Demo day is very similar to an event like Tesla battery day where significant progress in the business model is on display a provides investors of a vision of where the company is heading And if there s anything I ve learned in 2020 vision fucking matters The fact the company went public through a Direct public offering rather than an initial public offering can prove to be significant allow me to explain Direct public offerings tend to not get as much hype upon listings compared to Initial public offerings Now I know you clowns reading this thinking BuT LoOk HoW mUcH tHe StOnK hAs MoOnEd AlReAdY But consider this look at how Snowflake Doordash and other various IPO s have absolutely skyrocketed on their opening trading days and they were all backed by major underwriters Since PLTR was a direct public offering I personally believe the true hype is not entirely baked into this stock Instead it has slowly been noticed and demo day is a fantastic opportunity for the world to hear Palantir s story and finally really understand the long term vision and the profitable scalability business opportunity they have Demo day in case you can t connect the dots DEMO nstrates Palantir s product lineup of artificial intelligence Regardless of what we actually see from the products there will for sure be a lot of hype about the potential of these products Palantir Counter Arguments Lockup Period Expiry The lockup period ends mid February shortly after earnings are reported The lockup period could go either way but if the employees believe in the company they will hold a majority of their shares are they have first hand vision of what s unfolding for Palantir Can t stomach the risk of the lock up period No worries this is still a month away and there s plenty of time to get in and out of this stock before the lockup expiry even becomes a relative issue Last ER showed significant losses A majority of losses last earnings report were a result of direct listing regulatory fees These fees are not recurring they were one time fees to take the company public Considering this is a tech company operating costs tend to be low and generally consistent Therefore as revenue scales profit margins should theoretically soar along with it over the long term Again earnings are a month out so if you cannot stomach the risk of a bad earnings report you can still sell out prior to this All in all my point is this Short term catalysts could really start to push this stock upwards to new all time highs this week into next leading up to Demo day And for long term consideration any dips over the next couple months could be fantastic buying opportunities Only time will tell Just remember I am not a financial advisor you fucking

, Hello fellow autists I am back Nothing makes me more upset than the big boys trying to manipulate the autists It actually makes my blood boil What got me motivated to write my first reddit post ever was exactly this So there was a post recommending GME puts that got unusually high numbers of upvotes as well as awards at an unusually high rate I m convinced that this guy is from the short side It wreaked of PR farm The knowledge level displayed within the post proved that the OP has a pretty good grasp on the market However they omitted some of VERY important key details while recommending puts forecasting bearish movement They re promising tendie heaven while they lead you to a slaughter house This is good though the fact the shorts are employing tactics like this means they feel that heat is turned up and they are starting to sweat Unless you are ready to die now don t follow them Here are some FACTS longer but super easy to understand as always 1 Yes margin requirement is shooting up on multiple brokers and a lot of LONGS as well as SHORTS are going to be margin called Margin requirement going up is something that naturally happens as big movement volatility is expected It s just like how you pay a higher interest rate higher down payment when they think you are a risky buyer wanting to buy a car house giant dildo The Melvin underling OP wrote Big institutions who are holding shorts won t be affected by this Are you fucking kidding me Shorts are borrowed shares from the shareholders If you are buying on margin you have what is called a hypothecation agreement with your broker The shares you buy on margin are automatically available for the big institutions to borrow to short the stock Just Google your broker hypothecation agreement Most brokers have this What does this mean Yes the margin call happen to both longs and shorts but margin call happening to longs also mean the institutional shorts are forced to cover because the shares they are borrowing is getting liquidated called away Also on most brokers margin account is a requirement to short a stock as well What does THIS mean When margin call happens the short side gets a double whammy Short positions of many retail account holders are forced to close and short positions of big institutions are also forced to close Yeah they ve been touting Buy only shares don t buy calls duh because they want to have advantage over you Shares as well as calls have their own merit Yes IV premium is high I know but just do the math and don t get stuck buying just shares They are basically telling you knives only when they are bringing knives guns who remembers those conniving bastards from playing CS See my first post for more information on this Think about it why would they say buy shares only at the same time Melvin Capital spent over 35 million dollars on buying 51 000 puts This expired completely worthless btw good job 2 Uptick rule SSR kicked in because the stock dropped 10 Long story short this rule was created so shorts can t just keep chasing and drilling stocks to the ground There are a lot of videos explaining YouTube I don t want to keep this long Multiple videos also mention higher probability of a squeeze when this happens Basically the shorts hands are tied and they can only kick The long side is free to swim however Now tell me who can swim to the tendie island faster The yachts are anchored there and they are yours for the taking Remember Cohen is a smart dude who built a 3 5B business from scratch which is now 44 61B as of today You guys hate on some of the board members selling on Friday but they may have done this on purpose to wave the 10 flag for the whole world to see The 10 rule triggering uptick rule actually applies intraday as well but not all are aware of this and while awareness of GME is good now not everyone has their eye on the intraday chart Have faith BofA and Melvin are big boys but now with the 10 flag raised high and proud the whole world of smart money is getting ROCK HARD are FUK Oh yeah one more thing The Melvin underling also wrote There s contradictory evidence as to if the shorts went up this week or went down this was a dead give away The data was out on the 15th It went way up Shorts doubled down but they are close to tapping out It s like when you go to a casino you bet 1 you lose so you bet 2 you lose you bet 3 you lose you bet 6 etc etc to recoup losses You feel me Right now they are at hundreds of millions They might not have enough money to play the next round hence the desperate shilling moves on WSB Don t fall for it Remember BofA market cap is only 1 1 Billion dollars Yes the assets they control is higher blah blah blah but this is going to be a big blow for them Positions Shares and calls I took profit on the pop and with that I m gonna be loading up more on shares and calls at about 7 3 ratio p s I haven t forgotten you guys seemed to have liked the distribution points and used consumer electronics angles of my previous DDs but there s more WAY MORE I will put the Stadia digital console argument to rest next p p s I m not saying Tuesday will be the squeeze just saying it s net bullish and you can smell the shorts fear now so anything can happen

to run over the course of the next week or so just hear me out Let me just start out by saying this is one opinion of a single retard on wall street bets and you should not just buy in cuz of me Anyways here we go pigeons on Friday 1 15 2021 Ark Invest all hail our queen Cathie Wood made a significant stock purchase of Palantir for the first time since initially taking a position mid November The Ark Invest hype train is real right now look at other similar new investments from ARK we ve seen significant positive price action in the weeks that follows mass quantity share purchases Last time queen Cathie bought a significant amount of shares in PLTR we saw the stock price nearly double in the coming weeks Now before you clowns try to call me out let me be clear this alone is not enough to double up the stock price from current levels BUT WAIT DID I MENTION THERE IS MORE On January 26th 2021 Palantir will have a major event called Live Demo Day where the company will display the efficiency of its products to the world This could be a massive short term catalyst combined with Queen Cathie s purchase What the hell does this tendy lious company sell you might ask Their products are basically Artificial Intelligence that rapidly analyzes massive quantities of data for business s in order to improve daily operations The more the internet scales and the more data is collected by businesses the more demand there is for data processing As companies scale their technological forces they often cannot keep up with processing the data to make efficient business decisions this is where Palantir comes in Oh and did I mention Palantir has contracts with the US Army and FDA Government entity partnerships are very good way to get large businesses to trust your ability to analyze data efficiently Palantir has also been processing vaccine trial data to look for patterns this opens the door to pharmaceutical companies pursuing partnerships in the future as they observe what significance Palantir has in gathering Covid vaccine data It also appears to become more and more common for businesses to need data processing to make better business decisions as the internet scales So what the fuck is my point This is a great story for investors to buy into and is exactly the kind of thing that can get the hype train going IN MY OPINION three very powerful words In my opinion Demo day is very similar to an event like Tesla battery day where significant progress in the business model is on display a provides investors of a vision of where the company is heading And if there s anything I ve learned in 2020 vision fucking matters The fact the company went public through a Direct public offering rather than an initial public offering can prove to be significant allow me to explain Direct public offerings tend to not get as much hype upon listings compared to Initial public offerings Now I know you clowns reading this thinking BuT LoOk HoW mUcH tHe StOnK hAs MoOnEd AlReAdY But consider this look at how Snowflake Doordash and other various IPO s have absolutely skyrocketed on their opening trading days and they were all backed by major underwriters Since PLTR was a direct public offering I personally believe the true hype is not entirely baked into this stock Instead it has slowly been noticed and demo day is a fantastic opportunity for the world to hear Palantir s story and finally really understand the long term vision and the profitable scalability business opportunity they have Demo day in case you can t connect the dots DEMO nstrates Palantir s product lineup of artificial intelligence Regardless of what we actually see from the products there will for sure be a lot of hype about the potential of these products Palantir Counter Arguments Lockup Period Expiry The lockup period ends mid February shortly after earnings are reported The lockup period could go either way but if the employees believe in the company they will hold a majority of their shares are they have first hand vision of what s unfolding for Palantir Can t stomach the risk of the lock up period No worries this is still a month away and there s plenty of time to get in and out of this stock before the lockup expiry even becomes a relative issue Last ER showed significant losses A majority of losses last earnings report were a result of direct listing regulatory fees These fees are not recurring they were one time fees to take the company public Considering this is a tech company operating costs tend to be low and generally consistent Therefore as revenue scales profit margins should theoretically soar along with it over the long term Again earnings are a month out so if you cannot stomach the risk of a bad earnings report you can still sell out prior to this All in all my point is this Short term catalysts could really start to push this stock upwards to new all time highs this week into next leading up to Demo day And for long term consideration any dips over the next couple months could be fantastic buying opportunities Only time will tell Just remember I am not a financial advisor you fucking pigeon But

trading floor and will be legally unable to share tips after I get into the office This is my parting gift to the community of idiots that sparked a fire that changed the course of my life Fucking Alibaba This is an absolute juggernaut of a company that is currently plagued by every piece of FUD possible Chinese government whipped out the cock amp a centimeter ruler Ant Group IPO hamstrung Impending regulation Jack Ma in hiding for fear of having his mouth cauterized shut Down 30 from ATH WSB mocking call holders who caught the falling knife This kind of dark cloud overhang is exactly what I look for in my trades There are always big gain opportunities but comeback stories often have a lower floor than other highflying momentum opportunities GME EVs SPACs Catalysts amp opportunities amp x200B RELATIVE VALUATION First and foremost this is a great company This isn t some kind of I m the smartest idiot in town play where you try and make a buck off of something worthless This is a truly undervalued equity Chinese stocks have been super hot lately Mega hot This isn t necessarily bubbly China is arguably the strongest market in the world and the emerging middle class over there will fuel rocket like growth for years to come Look up Dalio s thoughts on China if you need to be convinced Stocks like JD PDD BILI BIDU NIO have all seen unbelievable rises Money managers are foaming at the mouth looking for Chinese exposure I don t blame them However after these astronomical rises money managers will start rebalancing positions and looking for new opportunities Cue Alibaba This one has herpes currently It won t have herpes forever There s a black swan risk for Alibaba It won t happen As gains get trimmed in other Chinese stocks money will flow to BABA undoubtedly The valuation is too sexy It s been underperforming for reasons that have absolutely fucking nothing to do with fundamentals UM AKSHYUALLY IT S A VIE YOU DON T OWN THE STOCK Shut the fuck up People talk about the ownership structure like it s a latent scam to defraud American s of 100s of billions of dollars This will not happen China needs access to US capital markets This would singlehandedly destroy that relationship and hamstring China Yes China is the manufacturing capitol of the world Yes the USA is the financial capital of the world We are mutually dependent If this falls through we all have way bigger problems than your 2000 call position Market is fucked period if USA amp China go nuclear in the financial markets Nothing functions without Chinese sourcing INVEST WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT CCP has a ownership interest in Alibaba The CCP also came out and said that they want ownership stake in Ant as well It s so transparent CCP is pushing down Alibaba s value seizing more ownership then going to let it fly with favorable outcomes to the FUD that they created themselves Do you really think China is going to kill something that is seen as the golden goose of Chinese ingenuity and progress China wants to become an economic superpower at all costs I don t care if the put Jack Ma in prison for life This thing will continue to grow Baba is bigger than Jack Ma HOLY FUCK LOOK AT THE FUNDAMENTALS skip if you re afraid of numbers 30 YoY revenue growth 60 YoY growth in AWS copycat 900 million MAUs FCF up 33 YoY to 6 Billion US Increased share buyback And the margins Look at the fucking margins 29 net profit margin for FY 2019 With 30 Revenue growth AMZN s net margin is 4 This thing is an EPS powerhouse that will continue to see bonerworthy FCF and boost buybacks In my opinion this is literally the cheapest listed stock in the world Held down by FUD FINALLY WHAT MAKES THIS MOON 1 Jan 20 Joe Biden takes office He wants to show all his friends how much cooler he is than Donald Trump so he gets a patty cake deal done with China Fears about delisting subside Institutional money gets braver Black swan risk becomes more muted I expect positive China relationship commentary to come out within a month of him getting sworn in His administration will be much less hostile and unpredictable Great for BABA amp US China relations 2 Feb 11 Earnings Earnings will be stellar as always China handled Covid way better than we did and its economy has been chugging ahead at full stream The great numbers will remind everyone how fucking cheap this thing is Expect a pop if it hasn t already ran up a shit ton beforehand 3 Date unknown Resolution gets announced between CCP and Alibaba It will not be as bad as everyone expects This is literally a dog and pony show to show everyone how cool and strong the government is Once that uncertainty gets removed this thing flies Same goes for Ma reappearance When that dude comes back with his 1000 yard stare and says everything is cool expect an instant pop in share price There is literally every bad piece of news baked into this This is where you want to be going long How do I play it Shares are fine I was long BABA shares sold them to buy LEAPs because the pricing was so good 40 IV not bad for the actual volatility I expect I wouldn t buy calls expiring before the summer Time is your friend here because of the situation and waiting on clouds It has been trading in a tight range from 220 245 If it dips back to 220 I m adding summer expiry 270 strike calls to my position which

advance for mistakes that may be present below If you do see anything please call it out in the comments Twitter TWTR appears to be on sale with good signs of upside Twitter s share price has fallen substantially in light of allegations of censorship and removing Trump from their platform Other firms in big tech have also experienced similar scrutiny by taking similar steps in light of recent events i e FB and the Zucc This has left shares on sale with some appearingly positive buy signals on TWTR Bull Case Recent price trends and technicals may give an indication for price projections in the near future While WSB might not like TA I think it can be useful for making price projections especially when used in conjunction with evidence from times it has worked previously amp x200B red low where we are blue two other interesting lows https preview redd it nojbl40jbyb61 png width 1104 amp format png amp auto webp amp s e35f91ec51393a44e36e1a02981f35a80efd8ff0 The stock has a strong up trend line support blue that is touched 3 4 times over the duration of the pandemic rally March Present The two blue arrows signify two important times this support has been touched previously and reversal ensues At these two points it also touches or partially penetrates the ichimoku cloud which can act as an additional support level Both are also marked by a distinct local minimum in RSI of roughly 40 in the purple pane After both of these lows a substantial retracement occurs often reaching the value of the previous high rapidly Note values below are estimated The pattern in these two lows suggests that once the price hits the support it rapidly retraces to the previous high and then price increases in excess of the previous high In this first this is represented by a high of roughly 35 in June falling to a low of 28 in July where it touches the trendline and then rockets back to 35 within 2 3 weeks and then exceeding that value in the next weeks gain of approximately 20 with a buy at 28 and sell target at 35 Similarly in the second area this is represented by a high of roughly 52 at the end of October falling to the indicated low of 40 at the start of November indicated by the second blue arrow which then rises to 52 in roughly 6 weeks mid December and then continues to increase beyond that This represents a gain in excess of 25 from the low around 40 with a sell target at 52 At present red arrow the stock is poised with the lowest RSI that s been seen in the pandemic rally falling below 30 This suggests that the stock is oversold and it is likely to experience a reversal in the near future Moreover the price is sitting just at the ichimoku cloud and near the trendline two supports that were observed in the previous two examples There is also additional resistance caused by a double bottom as a result of another candle that shares a low with the current low price This evidence suggests that TWTR will likely see a big move going upwards in the near future Buying in now 45 18 and setting a price target around the previous high 55 87 could be return a profit of roughly 23 based on previous patterns The time horizon for this gain is relatively short with expectations of around 2 6 weeks based on the two previous trend line touches blue With the oversold RSI condition it may even be able to reach or exceed the target in a much faster time than previously Disclosure of Concerns Currently the price has fallen below the up trendline albeit not by much If the price does fall further this could suggest indicate the trendline has been violated and the share price will collapse I think due to the oversold RSI this is unlikely and that the price is more likely to reverse back into the trading range Moreover while the ichimoku cloud does tend to act as a resistance the price being inside the cloud often suggests greater risk of the stock moving sideways note how after the second blue arrow price increases much more slowly when it is trapped inside the cloud Confirmation of a movement upwards or downwards should be sought before making any trades on twitter stock in light of these concerns The climate around Twitter isn t positive at present and this could prolong the amount of time before the the move completes or even drive down the share price if the situation does not improve Even after the Trump presidency has ended twitter is likely to face additional controversy over decisions it may make with the incoming administration One example is the suggestion that Twitter might reset follower counts to 0 for official White House accounts once the new administration enters This could put twitter under greater scrutiny once the new administration takes office with accusations of unfairness already in the air TLDR TWTR appears to have positive upside Projections may suggest a gain of over 20 over a span of about 2 6 weeks based on previous price patters However there are multiple concerns present in the current climate surrounding the stock and some concerns regarding the current technical position Positions in TWTR None I made this DD for fun If you are interested in purchasing TWTR shares or calls I highly encourage doing your own DD before you buy in This is not financial advice All of the material presented is just opinion that needs to be verified and is subject to change

real so apologies in advance Disclaimer This is not investment advice and only serves to provides commentary on of the financial markets and a mosaic theory on what is to come with respect to GME Should likely be flagged as NSFW as for many this will be a masturbatory aid for many until the markets open Pre amble I had an epiphany last night and the world just starting make sense Instead of being overcome by a wave of relief and calmness I was crushed by a feeling of dread and experienced one of my restless nights of my life Respite only came by drowning out my thoughts with a bottle of bourbon This first post outlines why GME will experience a short squeeze in the very short term Dread is the pending dead of this community undue blame will come from the media with WSB and retail traders in general to take the immediate brunt of the assault With the additional media attention will come calls for regulation of financial derivatives and further assaults on the gamification of investing This post is just to set the foundation of the actual record on what is going to come Those that are active in this community or have been lurking for the past couple years can attest to the increasing media attention that WSB has been receiving This growth is now exponential with Jim Cramer basically leading a WSB public relations campaign and providing near daily commentary to his audience There has been a material shift in dynamics in this subreddit over the past year Many new faces of which quite frankly are financially illiterate Please do your own research and understand how financial markets and derivates work I have made this as friendly as possible but if you can t grasp it get your wife s boyfriend to simplify it for you Many of you will not with in the financial markets and not yet grasp the scope of the WSB community as a whole which is collectively its own hedge fund The userbase is the working class looking to break out and live some kind of semblance of normal life chasing the American dream which is only getting further and further out of reach We are little guys and accordingly rely on free brokerages like Robinhood which results in our collective trade execution being complete garbage Buying into a position results in thousands of users spamming the ask price on Robinhood and driving up market price If we were a proper hedge fund the aggregate positions would be acquired through algorithms co located with the exchanges and other than potential volume spikes would only be actionable through review of regulatory filings We also maintain like the largest research group in the country with thousands of users undergoing financial research and compiling DD on potential new plays This research is compiled disseminated and reviewed and actioned in real time which is why attention is picking up We are fundamentally disadvantaged hedge fund and to the dismay of the existing financial community we are actually winning Cramer giving the shifting demographics I highly suggest you incorporate more rocket emoji s into Mad Money or let us sponsor our own segment GME Short Squeeze 1 Why can insider purchases sales move the market Company insiders generally posses more knowledge of a company and when they buy it s a signal the share price is undervalued and when the sell its overvalued Capital is a scarce resource and directors of companies are human or some kind of reptile robot human hybrids and they need money to service their lifestyles In WSB terms if you are yolo ing funds for a down payment on your house or to buy a much nicer house with a lambo in the driveway do you realize your gains when you hit your goal This can be a prudent financial decision to satisfy a basic human need shelter and Lambo s and isn t always a signal that you think the real estate market and Lambo s are better long term investments than the stock market Insider trades are a potential signal only 2 What happened last week From 08Jan2021 close to 14Jan2021 close GME increased 126 from 17 69 to 39 91 ignoring intraday highs with the gains partially retreating on 15Jan2021 to 35 50 resulting in a 1 week gain of 101 As per media the pre market 11Jan2021 SEC filing with Cohen assuming 3 board seats Cohen and his 2 Chewy pals Alan Attal and Jim Grube spurred and increase in retail demand and set off a short squeeze with the Friday declines due to the sale of 810 000 indirectly controlled shares by director James Wolf Media is partially correct in that the Ryan Cohen filing resulting in a material increase in retail investment and drove up the share price however it wasn t a short squeeze The combination of the increased demand and the precariously low float set off a gamma squeeze which further exacerbating the upwards price movement The James Wolf divestiture for any other company should have been relatively neutral news and should not have resulted in the Friday declines these shares were indirectly owned shares by Hestia Capital Partners LP with the sale to adhere to the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital James Wolf and his wife personally own 50 689 shares unchanged James Wolf is on the board due to a proxy battle that goes back to 2019 and it is well covered on pages 13 15 of the 2020 Proxy Statement and is worth a quick read https news gamestop com node 17701 html toc878410 6 https news gamestop com node 17701 html toc878410 6 As a result the Friday market reaction is very peculiar If you manage a portfolio s for others and the maximum single stock exposure that can be held is 10 for example with that stock increasing in value more than other positions you need to reduce the exposure and rebalance to be within the investor policy statement thresholds otherwise it s a breach of fiduciary duty Majority of the disposal was on 12Jan2021 at share price of 19 99 with the remaining 11 90 000 shares sold on 13Jan2021 were at 31 08 The requirement to rebalance came before the price spike this week and James s clients missed out on 50 one day gains Additional insider sales were noted on 15Jan2020 post market by the outgoing directors not nominated for the 2021 Director Slate as follows Lizabeth Dunn 5 000 shares or 8 03 of holdings at 31 34 Raul Fernandez 34 619 shares or 51 36 of holdings at 35 27 average Kathy Vrabeck 50 000 shares or 38 60 of holdings at 27 99 This represents an additional 89 619 in shares sold by outgoing directors and would be relatively normal given This should cause an additional market decline on Tuesday absent any other information however as above these trades should be relatively neutral signals and likely would have occurred with or without a price run up during the week What is currently missing is additional filings for additional share acquisitions of Ryan Cohen Alan Attal and Jim Grube that will be forthcoming in the coming weeks and would displace the 900 000 shares divested above 3 What is a Gamma Squeeze This is going to be an oversimplification as to understand a Gamma squeeze you need to understand the math behind option s and the role of Market Makers MM I am going to keep things simple and only focus on the key points as this has already played out Delta measures the impact of change of the underlying asset Hopefully you retards understand what a share is and if the share price goes up 1 the price of the share will also go up 1 and shares have a delta of 1 The delta on options will constantly change as the price changes this is measured by Gamma below however what is important is that far out of the money options have a delta closer to 0 and deep in the money options have a delta closer to 1 or 1 if they are puts Hypothetical example a call option that as a current delta of 0 7 will go up 0 70 in price for a 1 increase in the share price as the share price increased the delta will also increase to say 0 71 and then 0 72 and so on Gamma measures the rate of change of Delta This measures how much the delta will increase with every increase in the share price and will be the highest when the options are at the money Market Makers the MM s trade for their own account and make money based on bid ask spreads stock and options and will look to be delta neutral MM s create most of the liquidity in the stock market With that out of the way what happened with the gamma squeeze Well this is thanks to our friends at Melvin Capital Management LP Melvin who is well know and documented to death on this boards As a special thanks to Melvin we should chip in with 100 when they set up their Go Fund Me account next week as none of this would be possible without their assistance Cole s notes are below Melvin s most recent filing dated 16Nov2020 disclosed a position of 54 000 put options and has been documented that the open interest was on 15Jan2021 24p https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1628110 000090571820001111 xslForm13F X01 infotable xml https www sec gov Archives edgar data 1628110 000090571820001111 xslForm13F X01 infotable xml The Put options would have allowed Melvin to sell 5 400 000 shares 7 83 of total GME shares at 24 to a MM The MM would have hedged the delta on this position by selling shares short As the puts went from ITM to ATM to OTM the market make would have continued to manage a delta neutral position through buying the stock covering shorts buying back puts or buying calls all which would have created positive price pressure Cohen s board appointments set everything in motion share price started spiking and to remain delta neutral the MM s exacerbated the upside price movements as above due to the changes in delta Positive price movements and FOMO on a short squeeze continued to drive up the price especially with WSB buying deep OTM options and volatility spiking This defines the price movements on 13Jan2021 the previous downward pressure of the MM short position was unwound 4 Synthetic shares and Regulation SHO When you short a stock you borrow a share sell it with the intent of buying in back at a later date for a cheaper price When the Borrowed stock is sold there is now a synthetic share that has been created and you think of this as a legal IOU Naked shorting is illegal with an exception for the MM s which as noted above is completed to remain a delta neutral position on the security For all other players that are shorting they need to locate and borrow the share before they can short it When there is a purchase or sale and the underlying share certificate is not delivered it is reported as a failure to deliver Regulations are in place on short sales and a quick summary is available on https www sec gov investor pubs regsho htm https www sec gov

Circuit Breaker or the alternative uptick rule This was triggered on Friday due to the 10 price decline and will remain in place for Tuesday At a high level if the market crashes or continues to fall this rule is in place to protect the long positions and allow them to exit before new short positions can be created Rule 204 Close out Requirement If a security is on the Threshold securities list

complaints however there is enough information to infer that markets might not be fair as they seem As per the pre amble the collective community has always been fighting an uphill battle 6 Ryan Cohen s Twitter Profile For any of you following Ryan Cohen on twitter his most recent post was today with a meme of Dumb and Dumber so you re telling me there s a chance He is building a social media presence that previously didn t exist and everything appears to be focused on aiding what was building up to be a proxy battle for GME At this point the dude could tweet a video of himself having sex with a pig and I would buy more GME shares direct reference to Black Mirror S1E1 The National Anthem The historical tweets have generally referenced more share purchases or material pending discloses board seats however the underlying is giving fair warning to the short holders to exit positions Some of the previously deleted tweets are not back and he likely realized that once posted there was no taking them down 7 Short Interest Position Short Interest is the number of shares sold short that have not been covered or closed out Short Interest is formally published to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA twice a month and daily reports published 2 hours post market close http regsho finra org regsho Index html http regsho finra org regsho Index html Processing img o6i5x4u0qyb61 What is import on all of this is that the current short interest on the company is 79 52 million shares with only 69 75 million shares issued by GME The 31Dec2020 short interest position was 67 98 million shares so in 2021 the short positions have grown by 11 54 million shares and there was no actual covering last week What we know is that if the price continues going up the shorts will at one point be forced to buy 80 million shares 6 Volume Reconciliation and Price Volatility amp x200B https preview redd it 1l3xc375qyb61 png width 2207 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 2e61fa16d0468900fb7f992198bf002bc6efe26d The last 10 trading days all of 2021 is depicted above From 02Jan2021 to 12Jan2021 the average daily volume was 7 95 million shares with the respective volume from 13Jan2021 to 15Jan2021 being 114 50 million 93 72 million and 46 75 million shares So what the fuck is going on Face appearance looks like volume has surged and liquidity has increased more buyers and sellers So back in my pre amble I mentioned a fundamental disadvantage that WSB maintains on trade execution as the big players have trading algorithms on servers co located with the exchanges The massive increase in the short positions was used to defend a short squeeze which by all rights should have been set off on 13Jan2021 absent this unfair advantage The cost of the shorts defending their position was opening an additional 11 54 million short positions the long security holders gobbling up these securities Why would they do this Well it s their last stand the magnitude of potential losses in a short squeeze would result in many of the short holders being liquidated and if they started covering their shares throughout the week the volume would have disappeared and the stock price would have been going up dollars each tick In section 2 I noted that the price action on 15Jan2021 was peculiar as the news was neutral Well this is our friends is volatility at play any news or a tweet from Ryan Cohen like his Dumb or Dumber tweet today will result in material swings in the stock price as there isn t any float remaining the same shares being traded back and forth hundreds of times a day with additional long positions resulting in the 14Jan2021 and 15Jan2021 volume declines For those like Crayons I am not a fan of technical analysis however the last 3 days looks awfully like a bull flag in the above chart when you considered the price suppression on 13Jan2021 7 What will come As many are aware many brokerages started increasing the margin rates on GME to 100 Brokerages are afraid of their exposure and don t want to get caught Cohen lit the final fuse with his tweet today and we are going to lift off next week The short interest being over 100 is unprecedented and this should by all rights be the most aggressive short squeeze ever witnessed in the financial markets I started writing this post yesterday as I was hoping to be able to reconcile a price target for exit There are a ton of factors at play however I truly believe now that some of the original posts about this being an infinity squeeze are correct The 100 million shelf offering will not be sufficient and GME will need to announce an additional offering to provide the necessary liquidity for this to fully unwind My personal exit strategy 10 of holding at 1 000 with an additional 10 to be sold every 1 000 price increment
