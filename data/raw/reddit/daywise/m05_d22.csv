74,niahr7,t2_1lm17m4q,1621656984,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/niahr7/market_timing_vs_pricing/,1,Market Timing vs Pricing,Hello apes Just read Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor which briefly talks about the distinction between market timing and pricing and it was a bit of a holy shit moment Graham describes market timing as essentially buying stocks because you think the market is on its way up and pricing as buying stocks because you think they are undervalued based on your own assessment of what they re actually worth without any theory of what the market is going to do in the short term They re both two sides of the same coin obviously in both cases you re basically betting on a stock because you think it s going to go up but the difference between the two is crucial When you re timing the market you worry about what other people think about the stock You create all sorts of narratives about why the market is down and why it s going to go up If someone is trying to time the market and a stock goes down 30 after they buy it they think holy shit I made a mistake potentially sell and all sorts of bad things happen Graham equates market timing to speculation with the results of market timers being the same as most speculators i e not good When someone is pricing they don t worry too much about why the market is pricing a stock where it is They just accept that the market can be irrational and misprice stocks sometimes and for whatever reason this is one of those times They also don t care about short term market fluctuations they don t buy a stock because they think it s going to go up in any specific time frame just because they think it s undervalued now and they know that in the long term the market should bring the stock to its true value If a stock goes down 30 after they buy it they don t panic and if anything look at it as an opportunity to buy more As long as you ve got time to wait Graham believes pricing is the fundamentally better approach When reading the above I think we all like to think we re pricers not market timers In practice though human nature being what it is we re probably a lot closer to market timers than we d like to admit The core thing about this distinction in my view is that to be successful pricing you not only have to actually be right in your analysis of the true value of a stock you also need have the conviction to stick by your belief that your value of the stock is right and the market s is wrong even for long periods and in the face of huge potential losses Having this conviction is not a question of your brain s computing power but your temperament emotional control almost like the difference between intelligence and wisdom It sounds easy on paper but it s one of those things that s a lot harder to do in practice The boom and bust history of the stock market for the past 150 years is proof that most people can t or don t do it In any event I have no actual point to this post I just thought it was a really good insight Go read his book

that is about to follow is speculation It is purely a theory of mine based on known facts and common sense Any dates included are to provide context They do not indicate the beginning middle or end of the impending squeeze Disclaimer 2 I am not a financial advisor this is not financial advice I just really like this stock TL DR Wanda AMC and the SEC are working together to build a case against the major short sellers committing blatant fraud daily that is suppressing the price of AMC stock Wanda and AMC will stand to make a lot of money in lawsuits for capital losses Meanwhile the SEC will be able to prosecute fraudulent entities using information shared by AMC The Players Wanda America Entertainment Before February of 2021 Wanda had voting stake in AMC and was the single largest institutional shareholder of AMC In early February 2021 Wanda converted class B common stock to class A common stock which allowed them to sell shares on the open market On March 19 20 2021 Wanda sold 15 6 million shares of AMC stock reducing their holdings from 8 8 of AMC common stock to 6 8 of AMC common stock Pay attention to those dates AMC Entertainment Led by CEO Adam Aron AMC has staved off bankruptcy during the COVID 19 pandemic They have raised a total of 752 million dollars from direct offerings in 2021 That is in addition to the funds raised in december 2020 This influx of capital has put AMC into a position that they can maintain operation at current levels until the end of 2022 per their Q1 2021 earnings call The first dilution of 2021 put an additional 63 3 million shares on the market That was completed on January 27 2021 The second dilution was the ATM offering program that completed the sale of 43 million shares from April 27 to May 12 Remember these dates too Securities and Exchange Commission As the lead regulating agency for the stock market the SEC is supposed to legislate investigate and prosecute any entity committing securities fraud We vilify them and rightfully so They have taken a sideline seat and watched as we battled back from our own 1 yard line to be 1st and goal today Their only interest in all of this is to mitigate the effect on our economy as a whole and to prosecute the offending parties In order to do that they need evidence Not just evidence of when and what dates naked shorting amount illegal FTD resets etc but also the WHO We all have our sights on Citadel but they are not the only complicit player here This is systemic and market wide AMC and GME are not the only securities affected by this but that are the most public They are also the ones that can provide information that the SEC desperately needs The Game Remember when I said to pay attention to the dates before Well lets dig into those January 27 This was D day for the HFs We had them cornered a squeeze was imminent Share price rocketed to over 20 a share trading halts comprised most of the market hours brokers weren t allowing people to buy and Apes were throwing shit all over the walls with excitement Marge was dialing During all of this at the peak of all peaks with us getting ready to get out of the atmosphere AMC announced the 63 million share dilution The following day AMC plummeted to the 10 14 range and started its descent back down to 5 a share Why would they do this now It doesn t make sense until you read below March 18 20 On March 18th AMC is on the rise We are about to break a critical resistance level at 14 50 Intraday we break that wall We are all watching patiently to get our tendies out of the fryer It feels like January 27th all over again Then March 19th comes and instead of going up share price drops Not as heavily as on the 27th but it doesnt continue the upward trend All of a sudden shares available to borrow goes from 0 to millions Apes are confused It doesn t make sense We broke the wall it s time to move Maybe it s just the last breath of the HFs before they let it run and Marge calls March 20th rolls around and again the share price drops This time we crash below the 12 50 support level In the following days we come back down to the 10 11 dollar range where we sat until the end of April We later found out through 13F filings that Wanda sold 15 million shares stalling our ascent and bringing us back down to earth Why would a company who stands to gain billions from a squeeze do this It doesn t make sense until you read below End of April 2021 Once again we are on the rise Not quite to the 14 50 break point but we are in a streak of green days shares available to borrow are almost gone and cost to borrow is skyrocketing when they are available It feels like January and March again We re getting ready to break 12 50 and gap up to the 14s again Then AMC announces its ATM offering program Once again from the 27th of april through the end of May we drop back to the 10 11 dollar range We found out at the Q1 earnings that during this period of descent AMC had sold over 15 million shares onto the market raising a significant amount of capital Once again we plummet back to earth Why would a company sacrifice billions in profits off of the ATM offering to sell all of it s remaining sellable shares at 9 50 10 50 a share It doesn t make sense until you read below Where are we at today Once again we are getting ready to break the resistance levels and shares available to borrow are somehow appearing out of nowhere Borrow rates have dropped 75 percent in a week and every time we push that level of resistance we get pulled back down Does this sound familiar I think Wanda is unloading another block of shares This is horribly bad for us right Can t be good Wrong This was always the plan it was always the game They re adding shorty rocket fuel FOMO is kicking in Retail is seeing a huge increase in liquidity as new buyers join in for liftoff It is the perfect time to drop shares if you are intentionally delaying the squeeze Those shares are gone almost immediately Literally if they sell at open even the full 30 million would get eaten up in the first hour of trading In order to figure out why they would delay the squeeze we need to look at the playbook The Playbook AMC and Wanda s goal throughout these last 5 months has been to build a case for the mother of all legal claims against the entities short selling the stock with synthetic shares Each time we reach a breaking point for the good they are keeping the SP down as they gather the information they need to file a lawsuit I graduated with a political science degree with the aim of going to law school so I have a decent amount of knowledge when it comes to legal proceedings Having said that this is what you need to prove damages in a civil lawsuit 1 Who Who was the offending party that caused the damage 2 When During what period or at what time did they cause you the damage 3 How What did they do that caused you to incur damages 4 Damages incurred You need to be able to define the amount of loss incurred due to the actions of the offending party In this case its a pecuniary damage money lost The plays 1 Share count In order to identify the who and the how AMC needs to be able to prove which entities wronged them and the amount of damage EACH of them caused IE how many shares did they short using malpractice naked shorting FTD resets etc The share count does this for them In order to disseminate voting materials they need to know the information of who owns the shares of stock how many they own and have the contact information to send out voting materials This gives them the who and the factor to multiply damages incurred per share against 2 Delay annual meeting I firmly believe AMC delayed the meeting because of the sheer amount of shares they counted The last thing a company wants to do is go into a critical vote with an inflated number of shares In order to get anything on the ballot to pass they need a majority of shareholders to approve If the amount of shares and votes is inflated they could potentially see all of their ballot items fail to pass 3 Involve the SEC When they knew the who and amount of shares I believe AMC got the SEC involved They were able to provide concrete evidence to the SEC of the fraud that was ongoing since December The SEC needed that information to file legal proceedings Keep in mind they need the same things AMC does minus the damages incurred to bring a case against the malpracticing firms At this point the SEC can actively watch the actions of the offending parties in real time Building a case until the next share count In addition this gives AMC the ability to follow with a civil lawsuit using the SECs findings as the How of their claim Here s the bonus the SEC will be able to show AMC the how during the time of the 43 million dilution These illegal activities were going on during a share dilution directly affecting the share price AMC should have gotten for their shares sold 4 2nd share recount I think the SEC advised AMC to conduct another recount for a few reasons 1 the illegal activity ramped up from Janurary to April and the actual share count would have undoubtedly increased in this period and 2 It allows the SEC to track another data point while getting ready for the market implosion this could cause It also delays a notification to the public of just how broken the system is Now when AMC announces the share count the SEC can announce the legal proceedings it will pursue naming the defendants 5 Timing of dilutions If AMC diluted during or after the squeeze they wouldn t be able to correctly identify damages incurred and when they occurred By having Wanda and AMC dilute when share price was not inflated it gives a concrete timeframe of when they were damaged as well as a count of shares that form the basis of the damage claim 15 million for Wanda and 103 million for AMC 4th and Goal how it ends On June 2nd AMC has to finish their share count so they can disseminate materials Adam Aron has already stated he will make the share count public When he announces the total shares counted it will clearly show the blatant manipulation and illegal activities Retail will FOMO institutions will FOMO and large private investors will FOMO If you want confirmation that this was the end play look for an announcement of a share recall a formal investigation or both with the announcement When they recall the shares the MMs will need to get real shares and only real shares back from the HF before the date specified This will ignite the margin calls and form the catalyst from the squeeze The squeeze will be squoze in theory Again no dates shhhh When the squeeze is over AMC can now identify just how much they were damaged They now have the who and when share recount the how SEC investigation and the damages incurred delta between share price at market offering and top of the squeeze A civil lawsuit will follow At any point after June 2nd the SEC can announce the legal proceedings it will have and identify the offending parties Here is the beauty they can file for an immediate injunction to take control over the offending parties assets In fact this is common in legal proceedings involving malpractice You have evidence the offending party is committing illegal acts so you stop them from continuing them during legal proceedings Confirmation bias time Why would Wanda and AMC sell shares pre squeeze Remember I said you would find out below Well buckle up Imagine the shares you have now and knowing that you could get the maximum gains possible the top of the top peak for your shares That is the position AMC and Wanda have put themselves into it is honestly genius if you really think about it They don t have to time the sales Just watch it go and when the dust settles they can name their price from HISTORICAL FACT I think we would all take this option AMC and Wanda stand to make billions from this from the way they have played this game Thank you if you made it this far This was a labor of love and took some time If you disagree with the above any of it let me know This is just a THEORY It makes sense though doesn t it Beebs EDIT 1 IF YOU WANTED MORE CONFIRMATION THAT THIS THEORY MIGHT END UP BEING PROVEN RIGHT LOOK NO FURTHER I AM SHAKING AS I TYPE THIS Thank you to Corinth1982 and ReturnoftheBri on Stocktwits for pointing this out to me I love you both for this one rubs hands Remember how a part of the process for bringing a case is proving damages Remember how to prove damages you need to prove that you have a quantitative loss The best way to do this is to sell during a period where the illegal activity is holding the SP down I present to you Exhibits A and B click the links below then go to the ownership dropdown and select sellers They detail massive INSTITUTIONAL sales of both AMC and GME this week Amongst sellers on both stocks is a full closeout by Susquehanna for both This is the confirmation bias I needed today I hope it is what you needed too We are so close Teetering on the edge close https fintel io sos us amc https fintel io sos us amc https fintel io sos us gme https fintel io sos us gme Edit 2 i cannot express the excitement i felt when i read wanda had indeed sold shares on the 13th 17th and 18th of this month With only 10 000 left we have almost no tutes to slow us on the way up now Part one of my theory has been proven right Also i want to congratulate all you crayon eating smooth brain diamond handed diamond hearted banana hoarding apes You have done what no fund can do You have done what no government has done You stood at the precipice of the mother of all tute exodus and you held Think about that I didnt run the numbers but tute sales in the last two weeks have to amount to at least 80 100 mil shares Combine that with the hundreds of millions of shares shorted and almost any other stock would be sitting at 5 right now Not us Never us We buy and hold I love you all Seriously the outpouring of support has been unreal

idea of inflation the rise in the price of goods over time Inflation is a very very old concept It is an ancient concept almost as old as man himself There has been nothing really new about inflation in the thousands of years of inflation s history and there still is not Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation Foolishly each new government discovering this magic of money seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before The end result is always the same the death of money Admittedly this is a long post but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today That is exactly what we will do We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened the 2008 financial crisis Later in the post there is a comparison between what the Federal Reserve is doing today regarding the Covid 19 response stimulus package and the inflation trends throughout history Finally we will make our case why we believe that inflation is about to rise in the United States Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results Albert Einstein In the beginning was inflation Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt Not long after he started hunting he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value greater than its intrinsic value was true money Because of human nature s inherent yearning for more power and status it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune If he could decree what money was then he could issue the money and gain political power Not only that but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in It does not really matter What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control Probably something in the form of a specific animal s skin that only he was allowed to hunt Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more As he hunted more more animal skins became available and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading Undoubtedly it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value the subordinate cavemen experienced the first ever inflation Not only was this the first example of inflation but it was also the first example of government finance amp x200B https preview redd it ik8uu4qsvp071 jpg width 1600 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 34b1dbd674630498d0d1475d55e251b92b544f89 Inflation through the ages Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider Yet in contrast there has been little progress in the area of inflation In terms of inflation there is nothing new under the sun From the caveman beginnings to today governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present

most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A D Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty Nummi was a Roman empire era government issued coin It was made of copper washed with silver The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and as a result cheap to manufacture As a natural consequence the Roman empire under Emperor Diocletian produced more and more coins As more and more Nummi coins were produced the Nummi started losing value The price of goods and services began to rise In response to this the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty After inflicting many death penalties the situation still did not improve There were just too many Nummi in circulation rendering it worthless At some point ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood The result The death of the Nummi Throughout history we will see the same pattern emerge where the magic of inflation leads to the death of money Inflation through the centuries So it has gone throughout man s recorded history Man has known inflation for centuries Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations The kings of England and France were inflationists especially King Henry The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century Throughout history rising prices have been the rule and not the exception The 1920 Germany hyperinflation One of the well known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s In the early 1920s Germany was in a period of hyperinflation In the end the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value By November of 1923 the currency would depreciate to 4 200 000 000 000 marks to one US dollar Below are examples of 20 000 000 50 000 000 1 000 000 000 and 5 000 000 000 mark bills

World War I Germany decided to drop the gold standard The gold backed Reichsmark or Goldmark as it was referred to from 1914 became the unbacked Papermark Initially the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt Total public debt rose from 5 2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105 3bn in 1918 Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered Like all other governments before them the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation During the war the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public Regardless of their propaganda attempts the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives As a consequence many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families In November 1918 things reached a boiling point From all walks of life Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany s cities Furious at their material conditions they demanded an end to the war Kaiser Wilhelm II s monarchy was toppled and the war ended The treaty of Versailles The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges Already under pressure from internal crises the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire According to the treaty repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters For this reason the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively As a result of this tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays Consequently the Reichsbank Germany s central bank started running the printing press The result of the German hyperinflation From April 1920 to March 1921 the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference the rates worsened and hyperinflation quickly reared its head At its height hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30 000 per month To put this into context one has to compare the price of eggs over time In 1918 you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg Essentially the money was worthless Prices of goods and services doubled every few days In fact the money was worth less than firewood Below are some historic photos from the time amp x200B A woman feeding her fire in

hyperinflation end Hyperinflation has become untenable Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty As a result starvation and civil unrest loomed On Oct 15 1923 the Rentenmark Ordinance was published This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution the Rentenbank This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold linked prewar mark or Rentenmark At last the printing of the now defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th On Nov 20 The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one As a consequence the hyperinflation ended and Germany was back on a gold standard system Interestingly the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion Instead the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry Moreover the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of paper money The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered In return they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments Still the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency The second lesson is that fiat paper money won t work without being backed by some standard Throughout history the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control Paper money is political money and as such it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money HJALMAR SCHACHT Paper money injected into the economy through bank credit brings about a situation of over indebtedness The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over indebtedness Printing even more money Undoubtedly it is a vicious cycle The present day United States has been using credit produced paper monies for decades Because of this we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic But first we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus response never caused any significant inflation The inflation that never happened Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008 In reality the two situations could not have been more different When central banks print money at a fever pitch it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses 2008 is a classic example of this The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage backed loans from the banks In turn this money goes to the bank s reserves that they can then lend out So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis Instead of lending the money out the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self preservation It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves causing them to default After Lehman Brothers went bust banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible The consequence Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people As a result inflation never increased The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U S Notice the increase after 2008 amp x200B https preview redd it 166omqizwp071 png width 1168 amp

causing the currency to degenerate in value A picture is worth a thousand words and the below graph showing the money supply in the U S economy shows it all amp x200B Processing img hjpy98c3xp071 In 2020 alone the Federal Reserve printed more than 20 of all dollars ever printed Illustrated by the graph above one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response In context 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined Why the Covid 19 stimulus will cause the inflation We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks As a result very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses The Covid 19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects The first is that banks can not hoard any more money They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation The second reason is unlike in 2008 billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history In fact there is no difference Banks complain they have too much money now The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008 They followed the same recipe If it worked for them in 2008 why would it not work now The problem is that banks have too much money now It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people Why would anyone complain about having too much money you might ask We will cover that in detail First have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject amp x200B https preview redd it be3qwedbxp071 png width 852 amp format png amp auto webp amp s deb5cbb9ae23b2bccbe9d13f70ef2bdd90981357 https preview redd it

is a bad thing for banks we first have to explain the basic business model of banks Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate In return they also pay an interest rate to the depositor albeit a lower rate With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have banks already sit with too many reserves Adding to that you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages At the same time there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid 19 Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on At the same time they are not making money from it by lending it out Whereas in 2008 the banks were propping up the reserves they are now desperate to lend out money Of course there are other dimensions to this problem like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each 1 deposited Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues In short banks can not take on any more money If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money it will push banks into having liquidity issues Unlike 2008 banks are desperate to lend out money Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the 2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus and you have the perfect inflation storm The similarities between the Covid 19 stimulus package and past inflations All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern First a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity That in turn is later followed by inflation leading to the death of currencies We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people The Covid 19 stimulus is very different in this regard This time around the U S stimulus package allocates more than 2 trillion to different groups in society injecting money into the real economy The breakdown is as follows 560 billion to individuals 500 billion to large corporations 377 billion to small businesses 340 billion to state and local governments 154 billion for public health 44 billion for education and other causes Not only that together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U S GDP That s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid 19 pandemic is Japan We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U S There is nothing new in terms of inflation from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day The magic of money causes the death of money Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies inflation followed The one exception was 2008 The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money As a result most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy The Covid 19 stimulus package is different in this regard First of all the banks don t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of 2 trillion into different parts of the economy This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history where more money was injected into the economy at this scale inflation always followed without fail Disclaimer This post was originally posted on Retail Investor Blog

help or you hold shares please get in touch It s a long shot but we will fight this to the end We re very happy to receive news coverage on this but we need more of us to join I ve copied and pasted my full blog post on it here Let me be clear this is not an anti China article Far from it Bacanora Lithium and Ganfeng have been sharing development and ownership of The Sonora Project which is the world s largest lithium resource 8 8 Million Tonnes of lithium with an NPV of 3 4 Billion and a 250 year resource this was the perfect example of both the East and the West working together fusing the geological expertise of Bacanora with the technical expertise of Ganfeng Lithium Except it s not quite happening that way On the 6th May 2021 Bacanora Lithium announced a possible offer from Ganfeng to purchase Bacanora outright at a price of 67 5p per share In principle Ganfeng had offered over a 30 premium over the share price at the time of the offer and it looked to be a fair offer However it suddenly doesn t look too good as we look into the history of this project In 2018 the Bacanora share price reached an intra day high of 157 1p before the lithium price depression saw them unable to fully fund the mine themselves This was before the project was fully financed This saw Bacanora engage potential partners in attempt to assist into building what is a major resource for the Electric Vehicle industry Stepping into the fray came Ganfeng Currently owning 51 of Lithium Americas Cauchari Olaroz Project alongside over 15 of Lithium Americas itself they agreed a partnership with Bacanora to develop the clay deposit in Mexico This saw Ganfeng take a 22 5 stake in the project itself alongside a stake in Bacanora Lithium This is how it should be done Joint venture agreements with all working alongside one another With the recent EV boom it is clear that lithium supplies will be in a shortage from 2023 Many Australian miners have dwindling reserves and EV adoption is growing exponentially This is concurrent to shortages of Rare Earths REEs Nickel and Cobalt All key elements for production in electric car batteries In November 2020 Bacanora Lithium announced that Ganfeng would be increasing their stake in Sonora to 50 and in Bacanora Lithium to just under 30 subject to approvals from the Chinese Government Several months later in February 2021 Bacanora Lithium then offered a share placing to raise 65 Million to fully fund the construction of the project This resulted in a significant dilution for shareholders and many argued that the offering was significantly underpriced 45p per share prior to the 67p it was before the dilution That being said many shareholder accepted that the board wanted to ensure the fundraising was successful especially considering the previous failure in 2018 Furthermore to this many were pleased to simply see the financing of the project to be complete Peter Secker CEO of Bacanora Lithium stated in a speech in 2019 that Ganfeng may increase their stake in the Sonora Mine to 50 but will NOT be attempting a takeover Clearly this is not the case The recent RNS filing from Bacanora Lithium had stated that they were pleased to have entered into an agreement surrounding the terms of a potential 67 5p offer Within the same RNS it was made clear that Ganfeng have received approval to increase their stake within Bacanora to 28 88 following the recent dilution at a cost of 31 Million At this stage it raises significant questions surrounding both the terms and the timing of this agreement Based on the above figures Bacanora Lithium have at a minimum 96 Million in cash alongside 120 Million in debt financing available from RK Mining Bacanora raised a significant proportion of this cash from their recent placing and Ganfeng are clearly taking advantage of this situation The offer of 67 5p per share is an offer for the remaining 273 587 492 shares is a total of 184 671 898 USD At this price Ganfeng will acquire all the shares of Bacanora Lithium alongside 96 Million in cash As of December 30th 2020 Bacanora s cash position was 39 2 Million USD Factoring in any cash burn Ganfeng are purchasing a 250 year resource a 44 stake in Zinnwald Mine in Europe over 130 Million USD on the books all for a cash payment of 186 Million Funds which could be going towards the construction of Sonora itself It is clear why Ganfeng are taking this course of action what is not so clear however is why the Bacanora board are going to recommend such an offer The terms of the deal have stated that Bacanora and Ganfeng have been in discussions regarding this offer What is unclear however is for how long Neither Bacanora nor Ganfeng have made clear whether any formal or informal discussions took place prior to the February 2021 fundraising or how it all came about at such a drastic pace The veracity of the situation is unclear and tenous at best with many shareholders having to sell at what is deemed to be an unfavourable price Hanwa the Japanese trading house purchased their shares in conjunction with an off take agreement at roughly 80p per share Both Hanwa and M amp G Investments holding 15 have gone through numerous dilutions and are unlikely to be favouring such an agreement The value of the mine speaks for itself and is a clear multiple of the offering by Ganfeng Another factor was the recent comments from Mexico s AMLO highlighting many lithium concessions were being used as trading instruments as opposed to being used to create viable projects With the in roads Ganfeng are making across the world of mining projects it is feasible that they could attempt to re assess timelines following on from their purchase of Bacanora Lithium For Bacanora this is their only project For Ganfeng It is one of many Key questions have been raised by shareholders querying how the board could accept what is argued to be a derisory offer Looking at price Ganfeng are paying counterbalanced by the NPV of the mine and the scalability of the resource it seems to be a deal that inherently benefits Ganfeng first and Ganfeng last Questions have been raised by Sir Iain Duncan Smith former leader of the Conservative Party asking for the UK government to step in and block this sale Compared to its peers Bacanora Lithium is grossly undervalued when calculating its share price to NPV Lithium Americas and Piedmont Lithium are both trading at above 70 of its NPV even with Piedmont being further behind in development Bacanora is currently trading at less than 10 of its NPV An incredibly low share price leaves a company open to such takeover offers but it is difficult to assess what the board have done to assist in promoting the story or lack of of Bacanora Lithium Moreso how they could announce on the back of such a low valuation to be pleased with the potential of an offer at 67 5p With Bacanora themselves stating that Lithium demand will increase by 800 by 2030 it is unclear how this takeover fits in with regards to the global clamour for resources and Mexico s own plans for the lithium industry Disclosure I am we are long BCLMF Additional disclosure I m a long term shareholder of Bacanora Lithium

If you can help or you hold shares please get in touch It s a long shot but we will fight this to the end We re very happy to receive news coverage on this but we need more of us to join I ve copied and pasted my full blog post on it here Let me be clear this is not an anti China article Far from it Bacanora Lithium and Ganfeng have been sharing development and ownership of The Sonora Project which is the world s largest lithium resource 8 8 Million Tonnes of lithium with an NPV of 3 4 Billion and a 250 year resource this was the perfect example of both the East and the West working together fusing the geological expertise of Bacanora with the technical expertise of Ganfeng Lithium Except it s not quite happening that way On the 6th May 2021 Bacanora Lithium announced a possible offer from Ganfeng to purchase Bacanora outright at a price of 67 5p per share In principle Ganfeng had offered over a 30 premium over the share price at the time of the offer and it looked to be a fair offer However it suddenly doesn t look too good as we look into the history of this project In 2018 the Bacanora share price reached an intra day high of 157 1p before the lithium price depression saw them unable to fully fund the mine themselves This was before the project was fully financed This saw Bacanora engage potential partners in attempt to assist into building what is a major resource for the Electric Vehicle industry Stepping into the fray came Ganfeng Currently owning 51 of Lithium Americas Cauchari Olaroz Project alongside over 15 of Lithium Americas itself they agreed a partnership with Bacanora to develop the clay deposit in Mexico This saw Ganfeng take a 22 5 stake in the project itself alongside a stake in Bacanora Lithium This is how it should be done Joint venture agreements with all working alongside one another With the recent EV boom it is clear that lithium supplies will be in a shortage from 2023 Many Australian miners have dwindling reserves and EV adoption is growing exponentially This is concurrent to shortages of Rare Earths REEs Nickel and Cobalt All key elements for production in electric car batteries In November 2020 Bacanora Lithium announced that Ganfeng would be increasing their stake in Sonora to 50 and in Bacanora Lithium to just under 30 subject to approvals from the Chinese Government Several months later in February 2021 Bacanora Lithium then offered a share placing to raise 65 Million to fully fund the construction of the project This resulted in a significant dilution for shareholders and many argued that the offering was significantly underpriced 45p per share prior to the 67p it was before the dilution That being said many shareholder accepted that the board wanted to ensure the fundraising was successful especially considering the previous failure in 2018 Furthermore to this many were pleased to simply see the financing of the project to be complete Peter Secker CEO of Bacanora Lithium stated in a speech in 2019 that Ganfeng may increase their stake in the Sonora Mine to 50 but will NOT be attempting a takeover Clearly this is not the case The recent RNS filing from Bacanora Lithium had stated that they were pleased to have entered into an agreement surrounding the terms of a potential 67 5p offer Within the same RNS it was made clear that Ganfeng have received approval to increase their stake within Bacanora to 28 88 following the recent dilution at a cost of 31 Million At this stage it raises significant questions surrounding both the terms and the timing of this agreement Based on the above figures Bacanora Lithium have at a minimum 96 Million in cash alongside 120 Million in debt financing available from RK Mining Bacanora raised a significant proportion of this cash from their recent placing and Ganfeng are clearly taking advantage of this situation The offer of 67 5p per share is an offer for the remaining 273 587 492 shares is a total of 184 671 898 USD At this price Ganfeng will acquire all the shares of Bacanora Lithium alongside 96 Million in cash As of December 30th 2020 Bacanora s cash position was 39 2 Million USD Factoring in any cash burn Ganfeng are purchasing a 250 year resource a 44 stake in Zinnwald Mine in Europe over 130 Million USD on the books all for a cash payment of 186 Million Funds which could be going towards the construction of Sonora itself It is clear why Ganfeng are taking this course of action what is not so clear however is why the Bacanora board are going to recommend such an offer The terms of the deal have stated that Bacanora and Ganfeng have been in discussions regarding this offer What is unclear however is for how long Neither Bacanora nor Ganfeng have made clear whether any formal or informal discussions took place prior to the February 2021 fundraising or how it all came about at such a drastic pace The veracity of the situation is unclear and tenous at best with many shareholders having to sell at what is deemed to be an unfavourable price Hanwa the Japanese trading house purchased their shares in conjunction with an off take agreement at roughly 80p per share Both Hanwa and M amp G Investments holding 15 have gone through numerous dilutions and are unlikely to be favouring such an agreement The value of the mine speaks for itself and is a clear multiple of the offering by Ganfeng Another factor was the recent comments from Mexico s AMLO highlighting many lithium concessions were being used as trading instruments as opposed to being used to create viable projects With the in roads Ganfeng are making across the world of mining projects it is feasible that they could attempt to re assess timelines following on from their purchase of Bacanora Lithium For Bacanora this is their only project For Ganfeng It is one of many Key questions have been raised by shareholders querying how the board could accept what is argued to be a derisory offer Looking at price Ganfeng are paying counterbalanced by the NPV of the mine and the scalability of the resource it seems to be a deal that inherently benefits Ganfeng first and Ganfeng last Questions have been raised by Sir Iain Duncan Smith former leader of the Conservative Party asking for the UK government to step in and block this sale Compared to its peers Bacanora Lithium is grossly undervalued when calculating its share price to NPV Lithium Americas and Piedmont Lithium are both trading at above 70 of its NPV even with Piedmont being further behind in development Bacanora is currently trading at less than 10 of its NPV An incredibly low share price leaves a company open to such takeover offers but it is difficult to assess what the board have done to assist in promoting the story or lack of of Bacanora Lithium Moreso how they could announce on the back of such a low valuation to be pleased with the potential of an offer at 67 5p With Bacanora themselves stating that Lithium demand will increase by 800 by 2030 it is unclear how this takeover fits in with regards to the global clamour for resources and Mexico s own plans for the lithium industry Disclosure I am we are long BCLMF Additional disclosure I m a long term shareholder of Bacanora Lithium

Appointed Chairman of the U S Chamber s U S Korea Business Council On Friday May 21st South Korean President Moon Jae in met with President Biden where steps were taken to reinforce economic cooperation between the two countries Tellurian quoted the tweet stating TellurianLNG ready to support this cooperation with USLNG from Driftwood TELL LNG This tweet may be a tease but we all know what they re trying to tell us South Korea was the top country for US LNG exports in September 2020 What is Tellurian Tellurian was founded in 2016 by two industry icons Charif Souki and Martin Houston Charif set in motion the first liquefied natural gas LNG exports from the United States Lower 48 and founded Cheniere Energy Martin originated the concept of LNG destination flexibility ensuring that LNG became a commodity Tellurian is currently a debt free company What is LNG Liquefied natural gas LNG is natural gas that has been cooled down to liquid form for ease and safety of non pressurized storage or transport It takes up about 1 600th of the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state LNG is odorless colorless non toxic and non corrosive When LNG is returned to its gaseous state it is used across the residential commercial and industrial sectors for purposes as diverse as heating cooking generating electricity and manufacturing a wide variety of products LNG is also used as a fuel for heavy duty and other vehicles Who is Charif Souki To put it in simple terms Charif Souki is the Elon Musk of LNG Charif co founded Tellurian and serves as Executive Chairman of the Board He also founded Cheniere Energy Inc in 1996 and served as Chairman of the Board of Directors Chief Executive Officer and President until December 2015 Prior to Cheniere Charif was an investment banker He serves on the board of trustees of the American University of Beirut and as a member of the Advisory Board of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University Charif received a B A from Colgate University and an MBA from Columbia University Charif Souki was the highest paid CEO in 2013 this proves that he s the real deal Charif Souki was voted out of his position at Cheniere by Carl Icahn Charif Souki was fired because he wanted to expand Cheniere with projects such as Driftwood whereas Carl wanted to spend their cash flows on dividends Carl Icahn to date has never met Charif Souki in person Charif Souki resurrected his Driftwood plans by co founding Tellurian What is Driftwood Driftwood LNG LLC owned by Tellurian Inc is developing a liquefied natural gas LNG production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River south of Lake Charles Louisiana Once complete the terminal will be able to export up to twenty seven million six hundred thousand tonnes of LNG per year to customers worldwide Tellurian s Team The team at Tellurian together accounts for 75 of the LNG export from the USA today In 2020 5281 BCF of Natural Gas was exported from the USA At current JKM Asian Market prices for June 2021 that is equivalent to around 37 508 302 500 At current TTF prices European Market prices for June 2021 that is equivalent to around 32 161 290 000 These numbers tell you that the team at Tellurian is no joke and should not be taken lightly The President amp CEO of Tellurian Oct vio Sim es brings 38 years of impressive energy industry experience to Tellurian s remarkable infrastructure team Previously he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG amp Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra s efforts to develop build and operate liquefied natural gas LNG receipt terminals liquefaction facilities natural gas pipelines and storage facilities He led the company s efforts at Cameron LNG Energia Costa Azul LNG and Port Arthur LNG where he focused on reliability of deliveries to customers safety and gas sourcing strategies that assure reliable production of LNG Oct vio has deep relationships in the LNG market and an unmatched tenacity for developing new projects Martin Houston the Vice Chairman and Co founder is also an LNG veteran with nearly 40 years of experience He s managed all forms of enterprise in the energy industry has established a strong external reputation in the international gas business and is largely credited with being the key architect of BG Group s world class LNG business In recognition of this in 2011 he was the first recipient of the CWC LNG Executive of the Year award Why hasn t Driftwood started construction yet The Driftwood project will cost 27 5 Billion including pipelines Driftwood will produce 27 6 MTPA of LNG Tellurian has been looking for Equity partners to help with the funding of Driftwood Tellurian currently has one equity partner which is TOTAL SE If FID for Driftwood isn t reached by June 2021 then TOTAL can choose to back out of their position If they choose to exit it won t be an issue for the company as Charif Souki said building the terminal is no longer dependent on the Total agreement Tellurian currently has all permits required for Driftwood and Charif Souki confirmed that they are intending on starting basic construction this summer and planning on giving Bechtel the green light to begin full construction early next year What s going on with commercial agreements In a recent interview with Citi Group Charif Souki stated that We want to finish our commercial agreements which will happen in the next few weeks Souki said the offering has been very popular and if Tellurian hits its target in the next few weeks would be oversubscribed A recent video targeting Short Sellers was posted by Tellurian Charif Souki asked the shorts What do you think is going to happen when we start announcing some of these long term commercial agreements that we ve been working on for so long This will be an interesting question and we will see how the market reacts when this happens We are the market and it s

business and that TELL is not a trade If you just want quick profits then this stock is NOT for you Tellurian s Competition Although no one in the US will be able to come up with a business model more profitable than Tellurian s Driftwood Qatar in many people s eyes is seen as a big competitor and one that will destroy all US LNG exports but this is simply just not the case Countries that import LNG diversify their LNG portfolio and will buy from a variety of countries and not just anyone in particular No matter how profitable Qatar s LNG plan is Success is almost inevitable for TELL Charif Souki personally talked about this and with utmost respect reassures us that Qatar is not a competitor Stock Price Tellurian themselves have implied that the TELL stock will have a value of 12 17 at

entire healthcare industry Information below helps provide clarity on how vital chlor alkali is to the healthcare industry Chlorine On the Front Line in Hospitals americanchemistry com https chlorine americanchemistry com Chlorine Front Line Chlorine and Life Saving Drugs From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments In fact probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry Today about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine including medications that treat heart disease hypertension cancer AIDS arthritis pneumonia depression diabetes allergies meningitis glaucoma

provides one of the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in these life saving electronic instruments It s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent
