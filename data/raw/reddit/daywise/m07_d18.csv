few grand flipping puts late June when first bad news wave came in I m now deep AF on this going back to 280 in next 60 days but realistically 295 by Aug 10th I ve spent at least 100hours doing DD from reading their 2019 trials EMERGE and ENGAGE that they cancelled both midway due to an independent board saying no noticeable benefits by patients or MD s at midpoint thr trial Was specially cancelled because up to 22 of the one study had brain swelling on MRI amp other ASIA effects such as brain bleeds 10 To their backdoor meetings with Billy Dunn of the FDA in 2019 then daily communication for years forward To watching both of ICER s and AD COM meeting where adcom voted 10 0 1 1 abstained rest againt approval I ve read why all 3 who have resigned did so ICER 100 does not support and gives it yearly price cost benefit analysis of 3k 8k year vs the 65 80k yearly this will cost when including pre amp yearly PET scans looking out for that pesky brain bleed side effect Besides the recent label revision esentially cutting off 4mil of potential 6 mil patients they d have a shot at the yearly price cuts in rebates and reductions will end up in 75 range resulting in quite the forward P E projections vs getting well over 10bil a year within 5 years from it amp x200B Won t even touch whether CMS medicare will end up covering this treatment at all period I don t think they will which will greatly further reduce possible patients The public comments from MD and chains has been resoundidly HELL NO needs more trials But the big deal is the House Oversight

were pinned to one drug Talicia https www redhillbio com talicia a drug targeting the h pylori salvage care market the market for treating h pylori for people resistant to the mainline treatment RDHL s commercial strategy in 2019 was to use revenue from Talicia to fund further research operations However that strategy has failed Below you can see a table that breaks down fair pricing of RDHL based on Talicia sales Talicia has not come close to consolidating the salvage market and generates only nominal profits relative to RDHL s annual costs Some of that is attributable to Covid but the rest is because treatment guidelines have not been updated to recommend Talicia over other salvage therapies amp x200B Talicia Sales and Fair Redhill Value https preview redd it 5n0xnht8swb71 png width 1415

perspective of its main business RDHL looks like a speculative biopharma company the success of which is contingent on it maintaining access to capital while trying to get drugs other than Talicia to

associated with the development of certain cancers It performed well in early trial safety studies It also has anti viral properties and anti inflammatory properties which made it an ideal potential candidate for Covid treatment When Covid started RDHL began clinical trials on Opaganib as an oral therapy for Covid It was initially used in very small scale compassionate use https www medrxiv org content 10 1101 2020 06 20 20099010v1 trials where it produced positive outcomes In January RDHL completed a Phase 2 study https www prnewswire com news releases redhill biopharma announces positive top line safety and efficacy data from phase 2 covid 19 study of opaganib 301199664 html of 40 patients demonstrating safety of the drug and affirming its positive impact for patients according to several measures Now for the interesting stuff Timing The Opaganib phase 2 3 trial is the most advanced trial in the United States for an oral covid treatment to my knowledge The trial had complete enrollment by June 7 2021 According to https clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT04467840 https clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT04467840 drugs are administered for 14 days and All participants will be followed up for 28 days after their last dose of study drug So the data from the study will be collected 6 weeks from June 7 or on July 19 July 19 is this coming Monday The results could come out anytime over the next week Market Leadership The trial has several clinical endpoints and Opaganib has already been demonstrated to meet several of these in trials which were underpowered Although it s possible that the low power resulted in false positives it s pretty unlikely that it did for positive outcomes among multiple indications A fully powered study is almost certain to show Opaganib has clinical efficacy on at least some of its clinical endpoints It will be the first oral covid therapy to complete its clinical trial in the U S again to my knowledge If RDHL is able to get emergency use authorization from the CDC it could realize many billions of dollars in revenue Merck https www marketwatch com story merck to supply u s with oral covid 19 treatment 271623236860 just started a Phase 3 trial for its oral covid treatment and was awarded 1 2 billion from the U S Even a reward a small fraction of that size would cause RDHL s value to soar It s annual revenue over the last 4 quarters was around 80 million and that s with in licensing products for which it receives only marginal profit Pricing Anomaly RDHL was one of several companies that ARK IZRL purchased several months ago and then sold most of its holdings in each day over the last week to fund the purchase of new Israeli firms This action forced the value of RDHL down significantly Additionally the July 16 call expiration date on RDHL was preceded by selling from several hedge funds who presumably were protecting the 7 5 calls that they ve sold With no option expiration date until August 20 and ARK no longer selling shares the downward pressure on the stock should lift The company s value has dropped 8 percent over the last five days and 24 percent over the last four months If you buy you aren t paying a premium Takeaway I don t pretend to understand pricing or technical analysis well enough to say anything useful My pitch for RDHL is that in the next two weeks it will report results on an oral therapy for Covid Those results if all previous data is any indication will be positive It has a reasonably chance of being first to market with an oral Covid therapy which would be a huge financial boon If RDHL realized a deal with the federal government for 1 10th what Merck got for a drug Merck is further from bringing to market than RDHL RDHL would be valued at p e of 2 3 Realizing such a cash windfall would stabilize the other parts of their business and allow them to stop releasing new shares yada yada Anyway I ve bought a pretty big chunk of shares over the last two weeks I m normally a very conservative investor but you all aren t and I figured this is the place to go with reasoning about why I m putting a bunch of money in one stock right now Good luck everyone good

understand pricing or technical analysis well enough to say anything useful My pitch for RDHL is that in the next two weeks it will report results on an oral therapy for Covid Those results if all previous data is any indication will be positive It has a reasonably chance of being first to market with an oral Covid therapy which would be a huge financial boon If RDHL realized a deal with the federal government for 1 10th what Merck got for a drug Merck is further from bringing to market than RDHL RDHL would be valued at p e of 2 3 Realizing such a cash windfall would stabilize the other parts of their business and allow them to stop releasing new shares yada yada Anyway I ve bought a pretty big chunk of shares over the last two weeks I m normally a very conservative investor but you all aren t and I figured this is the place to go with reasoning about why I m putting a bunch of money in one stock right now Good luck everyone good night

everything starts to get made up and ignoring inflation because it ll affect all car manufacturers the same I ll grant that TSLA can somehow absolutely CRUSH the competition over the next decade and maintain a CAGR of 35 which would put TSLA somwhere around 10M cars yr sold in 2030 AND TOYOTA STOPS GROWING Effectively this 20x s TSLAs current revenue figures However this growth would HAVE to come from the Model 3 and low end Model Y though because it s the same consumer s purchasing the cars as today people aren t just magically getting richer to buy more expensive cars so the revenue numbers would not increase proportionally because it will be a higher proportion of cheaper cars than the segment includes today Now even if Sir Elon heroically pulls 35 year for a decade he ll still be on par with Toyota in revenue and cars sold Which still leaves some 350B in unexplained TSLA market cap over Toyota s current value Is their paltry Energy generation amp storage sales unit going to somehow maintain an unbelievable 80 CAGR over the same 10 year span Is their magical insurance division going materialize to become the white knight and somehow magically become worth 50 more than the car division Is Uncle Sam gunna keep dishin out those sweet sweet Automative regulatory credits For the love of that holy mother fucker in the sky WHERE IS TESLA S VALUE COMING FROM SHOW ME THE NUMBERS You don t need to compare it to Toyota You don t have to accept my made up 35 CAGR that s just some random shit I did while writing this post But your argument better involve at least a reference to Tesla s reported segments and a modicum of reason and math Make any believable argument and I ll make that 2nd donation to Dana Farber Make a good argument that makes me buy some TSLA and I ll make that 3rd donation Donation proof will follow tomorrow if anyone has a strong argument that doesn t smell like total bull shit

Global E They are a company that integrates with e commerce platforms to remove complexity with international transactions and provide localized solutions that improve the online shopping experience The core of the services revolve around the following from the S 1 amp x200B gt The vast capabilities of our end to end platform include interaction with shoppers in their native languages market adjusted pricing payment options tailored to local market preferences compliance with local consumer regulations and requirements such as customs duties and taxes shipping services after sales support and returns management These elements are unified under the Global e platform to enhance the shopper experience and enable merchants to capture the cross border opportunity amp x200B They are the plug and play of making e commerce international Their vast network of APIs allow a customer to simply integrate their platform and seamlessly begin selling across different borders and languages Here s what they do https preview redd it iu033n8ylzb71 png width 1446 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 80b6e7ff09081d8ec26559daaba269f34c0a742e Currently Global E supports Local messaging in over 25 languages Purchases in over 100 currencies Accepts over 150 payment methods A multitude of competitively priced shipping options amp x200B Business Model Global E generates revenues by charging a fee service fee for the integration of their platform into a merchant s services Service fees are highly variable based on transaction volume destination markets level of customer service provided etc and are generated as a percentage of the Gross Merchandise Value GMV that flows through the platform Global E mandatorily bundles certain components of their integrated platform solutions that they believe are essential for achieving improved sales conversions from international traffic However their fulfillment services are offered on an optional basis and merchants can choose to utilize those services or cancel at any time Think of it as bundling service A and B to have the greatest effect while offering service C as an add on component Service fees make up for approximately 35 of revenue while fulfillment services are currently accounting for roughly 65 amp x200B Partnerships amp why they use Global E Global E has formed many key technological as well as service partnerships These third party e commerce platforms include Salesforce Commerce Cloud Shopify BigCommerce Magento Commerce SAP WooCommerce PrestaShop and others amp x200B What they do for merchants Some of the key benefits they provide for merchants are increased sales conversions converting international traffic offloading complexities handling local pricing payment collection import duties fraud etc reduction of risk reduce legal complexity manage import duties and taxes handle compliance enabling growth to new markets allowing merchants flexibility to expand to cross border opportunities All while emphasizing merchant branding The customer always faces the digital store front and never leaves the brand page to check out amp x200B What they do for shoppers Global E s goal is to offer a frictionless shopping journey regardless of the origin of the customer This means Localized languages Re pricing in local currencies Handling cross border payments Accurately pre price import duties and taxes and include them in the final cost of the product Delivery using an extensive network of over 20 shipping carriers they are able to offer multiple shipping modes at attractive rates After sale support and returns Merchants integrating Global E into their platform generally experience a significantly higher international traffic conversion rate often exceeding 60 The Global E platform removes many complexities involved with international expansion They already have more than 400 merchants from small companies to globally recognized retailers on the platform across various diversified verticals amp x200B Shopify Deal As mentioned above one of Global E most lucrative partners lies with Shopify making them the exclusive third party and cross border solution across the large network of Shopify merchants Shopify knows what kind of business that will bring for Global E and thus Shopify has bought 7 75 million shares and acquired a 6 5 stake in the company As Shopify grows Global E grows and Shopify knows this hence the stake in a company that reflects their own revenues by proxy amp x200B TAM amp CAGR First came the transition to domestic e commerce as well as sourcing and reselling products from China aka Dropshipping Next is going to be the transition of global e commerce and cross border sales According to this 225 page research by GlobeNewsWire the global cross border B2C e commerce market was 780 billion in 2019 and expected to grow at a CAGR of 27 through 2026 where it will become a 4 82 trillion market https preview redd it 96veafozlzb71 png width 1680 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 6d3fc8afcb51b413dbdbb3deb95b24fadf89d313 amp x200B Global E s Smart Insights One of the company s strengths lies within sophisticated Smart Insights they use to scale their applications Smart Insights is a big data network that uses various metrics such as country price point and shopper behaviors allowing Global E to provide highly optimized experience for shoppers This ends up driving increased conversion rates and revenues for the merchant and a better overall experience for the shopper The company has noted by integrating big data into their platform they can experience economies of scale as well as economies of skill enabling them to optimize merchants cross border sales These insights are continuously expanding as they collect additional data points along the purchasing journey amp x200B Competitive Advantage amp Growth Opportunities What seems to be becoming more of a trend since 2020 and even more so now in 2021 are corporation s use of big data I m not talking about basic user data such as age gender location but more on the lines of vastly large information networks These networks can utilize things such as time spent on page scrolls and clicks all in one massive database Global E differentiates themselves through their main data asset Smart Insights that informs them on certain decisions and is able to optimize how merchants sell their product across different borders They integrate this data network into a flywheel effect for example their current analytics drives more sales to merchants which then feeds new data back into the system which then allows for higher optimization and better conversions They feed into each other back and forth getting smarter with each website visitor and purchase This aligns perfectly for their products Net Dollar Retention Rate of 134 and 172 in 2019 and 2020 respectively amp x200B Global E attributes much of their growth to being a first mover and doing it right in the cross border e commerce space Their success has been accelerated by several key factors such as Accelerated shift towards e commerce outpacing traditional retail Cross border e commerce growing faster than domestic e commerce Their merchant s strategic focus on D2C sales maintaining relationship with shoppers globally The complexity and limitations of leaving the merchant responsible for implementing what Global E offers This doesn t come down to just a cost but also time intensive as well as being difficult to maintain and scale Covid 19 tailwinds amp x200B As a result of the above and other market factors the cross borders e commerce market is expected to continue the surge in growth I previously mentioned the forecast in TAM however Forrester a research company also expects the cross border e commerce markets to reach 736 billion by 2023 Global E has several opportunities to expand on existing channels and capture new markets This can be done with Growth through existing portfolio of merchants and strengthening relationships Acquiring new merchants in existing geographies Expanding in new geographies that they don t have exposure to Continue to expand and innovate their platform Continue to develop strategic partnerships with key brands and players amp x200B Risks Many of Global E s risks fall under the category of general business risks Some of these include retaining old merchants and attracting new ones failing to enhance the platform as well as successfully competing against new and existing competition failing to manage growth pricing pressures from competition and being highly dependent on cross border regulations sales and operations amp x200B Revenues Scale amp Profitability In FY 2020 Global E helped process 4 6 million orders for their merchants generating 136 4 million Their Gross Merchandise Value GMV also grew to 774 million for the same period Other impressive metrics were their net dollar retention rate and gross profit as of revenue both of which continue to climb at 172 and 31 9 respectively Stellar https preview redd it 2quy1ct0mzb71 png width 1074 amp format png amp auto webp amp s

acb11f768d6c2f19dae64fdbaa43d4be321e92bb Although the company has recently turned a profit while growing top line revenue and GMV at a high pace The company suggested that short term profitability might be sacrificed due to the expansions they are making to cover larger markets As noted from the S 1 amp x200B gt We expect our operating expenses to significantly increase over the next several years as we hire additional personnel expand into new geographies expand our partnerships operations and infrastructure continue to enhance our platform develop and expand its features integrations and capabilities expand and improve our service offering and increase our spending on sales and marketing We intend to continue to build and enhance our platform through internal research and development and we may also selectively pursue acquisitions amp x200B Let s take a quick peak at their consolidated statement of operations Note the revenue growth and total operating expenses that decreas e as a percentage of total revenue as revenues increase almost doubles YoY https preview redd it tsq4hmx3mzb71 png width 1656 amp format png amp auto webp amp s caa3a9af7e659b3e3721817a5dad8e06495dba72 Valuation Looking at GLBE s valuation it is clear that you pay a premium when owning this company amp x200B The Good GLBE is growing revenue at 134 YoY Gross margins are improving while the company continues to scale Many tech and services partnerships they can piggy back on amp x200B The Bad Consistent profitability could be years away as the company is investing heavily into their own expansion of current and new markets GLBE is currently trading at roughly 50x price to sales and 260 forward P E amp x200B Up for Debate Global E has almost no long term debt but current liabilities are stacking up while the company is not generating much FCF I wouldn t expect them to be generating this much FCF this early in the game after their IPO Lock up expiration on August 11 2021 amp x200B Final Thoughts In my opinion Global E is top of the class when it comes to their business They are growing extremely fast while improving margins and this is the premium you would pay versus investing in a stable company generating tons of FCF but not much growth Due to the nature of being a high growth stock there will naturally be more volatility around the trade While it s currently trading at 50x price sales I am more likely to shy away from entering a new position We could see this stock swing to 40x p s and potentially enter on the dips This is somewhat of a chicken or the egg situation because there might not be any dips to buy with this kind of growth For example at current growth rates 100 135 YoY if stock price is maintained it would only be trading at less than half it s price sales valuation only one year from now This is definitely a stock to monitor closely if you are wanting to find the right entry point for a long term hold amp x200B TLDR 1 Global E is an enabler that allows e commerce and digital stores to seamlessly integrate international transactions They deal with tasks from translations currency re pricing international shipping amp returns compliance amp tax regulations etc 2 GLBE integrates their proprietary Smart Insights application that analyses customer shopping and transaction data to continuously improve on sales conversions The feedback loop is always learning as it collects more and more data along each customer s purchase journey 3 GLBE is trading at a rich valuation given their total revenue was 136 million in 2020 However they are growing top line revenues and Gross Merchandise Value GMV over 130 Y o Y Shopify holds a 6 5 stake in Global E as GLBE facilitates a large amount of transactions on the Shopify network As Shopify grows GLBE grows 4 GLBE is growing through many tailwinds such as those from covid lockdowns and accelerated shift toward e commerce outpacing traditional retail They ve got an opportunity to expand into more international regions strengthen relationships with existing merchants while continuing to expand and improve their platform

a wall of text So apologies in advance If you want pretty colors save some of your snack crayons to draw on your own screens amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B I ve written about Himax HIMX before Other folks as well have posted some DD on them and I won t repeat it all here as there s a lot of info amp x200B amp x200B That said a tiny sampling of background amp x200B amp x200B One of their biggest revenue sources is from ICs for flat panel screens amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B They also make LCoS displays famously used in Google Glass a technology which also has the added benefit of being a main component in up and coming LiDAR systems for autonomous vehicles and they also look to be poised to take off with their flat panel tech for the automotive and trucking industry amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Suffice to say they make stuff that makes your tech toys more fun amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Lots of things in their favor but two that stand out are their negligible debt and the fact that the brothers Jordan and Biing Seng Wu secured fab time before COVID so they can make their goodies Hence they re gonna make money amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Which leads me to amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Dividend Yup they pay out a dividend Now that usually doesn t indicate rockets that will take us to the moon and beyond quickly but bear with me amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B They paid out their dividend on Monday July 12 2021 based on their income from 2020 It came out to around 26 USA per share which closed on July 12 2021 at 15 39 USA each amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Here is why this is relevant amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B 26 is approximately 1 7 of 15 39 This gives us numbers we can work with amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Maffs is hard but I ve tried to write this in Apeish so everyone can read and enjoy amp x200B amp x200B So let s dive in amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Now let s talk about the divvy for next year amp x200B amp x200B Scenario I amp x200B amp x200B Let s assume HIMX pays out a divvy at 100 next year as they did this year amp x200B amp x200B Let s also assume they re on target for their second quarter projected estimate but let s go with the figure in the lowest possible range given so that s gonna be 54 amp x200B amp x200B Now let s also assume they have a shitty rest of the year and make absolutely no more money amp x200B amp x200B So the total amount made for 2021 Quarter 1 2021 plus Quarter 2 2021 is approximately 92 amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B This is the absolute minimum they can make for the year 2021 as of this writing and for the sake of our little exercise in Scenario I it s also gonna be the maximum amp x200B amp x200B Let s project forward to dividend payout date in 2022 amp x200B amp x200B If the percentage remains the same 1 7 of the share value then the price per share on the dividend payout date in 2022 which is typically in late June early July calculated from a dividend payout of 92 per share would give us a share price of around 54 12 USA amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Take a moment and let your smooth brain work on that one amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B 15 39 USA to 54 12 USA in about one year s time amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B An increase of approximately 251 amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Now a share price less than 54 12 would mean our percentage goes up because remember 92 dividend payout is for the sake of this exercise both the minimum and a constant amp x200B amp x200B So let s say the share price stays completely flat and is 15 39 USA on Divvy Payout Day 2022 That would mean the percentage on the payout of 92 would be approximately 6 amp x200B amp x200B To reiterate if one were to purchase HIMX at 15 39 around now and the price never moves up for a year in a year s time one would earn a minimum of 6 ROI with no downside it does not go tits up amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B If the share price goes up our percentage return on the divvy goes down 92 being the constant but our shares are worth more AND we get a divvy payout Again no downside no tits up amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B If the share price goes DOWN potential investors keeping tabs on HIMX have an OhShit Moment realizing they can get in on some sweet sweet divvy action and start buying driving the price back up to our purchase price and quite probably above it Again no downside no tits up amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B As previously mentioned the heads of this joint secured fab time before COVID so they can make their goodies That means they re gonna make money for Quarters 3 and Quarters 4 of 2021 so the dollar figures for Scenario I are unlikely amp x200B So onward to amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Scenario II amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Just for shits and giggles as they are gonna make more money than in Scenario I let s say they clear 78 combined for both Quarters 3 and 4 average of 39 USA per share for each quarter amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B That puts our total profit for the year 2021 at 1 70 per share amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Again let s assume HIMX pays out a divvy at 100 next year as they did this year amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B If the dividend percentage remains the same 1 7 of the share value then the price per share on the dividend payout date in 2022 again which is typically in late June early July would be 100 USA amp x200B amp x200B Sip on your juice box eat a crayon and contemplate that for a moment amp x200B amp x200B Scenario III amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Okay we ve been using data based on this most recent payout while also looking at some extreme examples of data Let s expand our data set and also start working with some reasonable numbers for next year to get what I feel will be much closer to reality when the divvy pays out in 2022 amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B https preview redd it bb26ixons0c71 png width 1450 amp format png amp auto

amp x200B 2020 27 amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Since I ve calculated from 2008 through 2020 and we ve got cash amounts for each year let s calculate the percentage of the payout based on the previous year s EPS amp x200B amp x200B 2021 100 amp x200B 2018 62 5 amp x200B 2017 80 amp x200B 2016 86 6 amp x200B 2015 76 9 amp x200B 2014 75 amp x200B 2013 83 3 amp x200B 2012 100 amp x200B 2011 63 amp x200B 2010 114 dunno about this perhaps a special dividend payout amp x200B 2009 57 amp x200B 2008 57 8 amp x200B 2007 51 amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Now time for disclosure some data I do not have in front of me is the minimum percentage a publicly traded Taiwanese company must pay out for a dividend There are requirements for them to do a payout with some exceptions meeting some requirements Capex for example which is why HIMX did not pay out a divvy in 2019 and 2020 as they had Capex and met other requirements in both of those years but I don t think it has to be 100 As can be seen above it s been all over the map over the years As I don t know what the minimum would be and the laws did change in 2018 for Scenario III I m going to use 75 This allows HIMX to use 25 of their profits for Capex which I feel is reasonable amp x200B amp x200B Also instead of 1 7 for our divvy as a percentage of the share price ending on the payout date based on the Average Percentage after removing top and bottom outliers over the years we re going to use 4 07 amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Finally we ll use Nasdaq s Quarterly Earnings Forecasts to fill in the blanks for the rest of the year using the low EPS forecasts For Quarters 3 and 4 I feel their projections are way too low but as they re conservative and we re bound to hit them we ll go with them The Brothers Wu will be giving us better estimates for at least Quarter 3 come August 5 2021 Those numbers give us a total EPS for the year of 2021 at 1 31 per share amp x200B amp x200B Okay Based on this data which I feel is in a completely reasonable and realistic range we have the following amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Projecting forward to dividend payout date in 2022 if HIMX pays out a divvy at 75 next year on a percentage which is 4 07 of the share value then the price per share on the dividend payout date in 2022 which is typically in late June early July calculated from a dividend payout of 1 31 per share 75 of which is 9825 would give us a share price of approximately 24 14 amp x200B amp x200B Based off of the recent closing price of 15 39 this represents an increase of approximately 57 amp x200B amp x200B I feel this is an extremely realistic share price for the Dividend Payout Date in 2022 approximately one year from now as the absolute minimum it should be based on the data provided amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Additional thoughts amp x200B amp x200B Most people as well as institutions might not be interested in a stock for a 1 7 divvy payout but some might That return is far better than what a bank is giving on CDs these days amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B That said at around a 4 return calculated from our historical data above institutional investors may start to sit up and take notice I feel based on the past performance 3 4 is probably the sweet spot for the return and as a result will entice more institutional investment This will also stabilize the share price historically HIMX has been owned largely by individual investors with a fairly low percentage of institutional investment amp x200B amp x200B This is actually why the divvy is so important not as a dividend but as a way to help stabilize the share price amp x200B Reason as I wrote if the share price stays completely flat and is 15 39 USA on divvy payout date 2022 that would mean the percentage on the payout of 92 would be approximately 6 Again a share price less than that would mean our percentage goes up above 6 because remember 92 is for the sake of this exercise both the minimum and a constant amp x200B So if you re an institution and you want need a place to park large amounts of cash something that s giving a return on investment of 6 is fantastic Ergo institutions may be most interested in buying up HIMX thus driving the price back upwards and overall keeping it afloat and quite possibly preventing it from taking the massive dips it has in the past not to say it won t whipsaw again in the future but it may just not be quite as violent as it has in the past amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B While I feel the price per share will reach approximately 24 by dividend payout date in 2022 it by no means is relegated to reaching that price or higher by next year amp x200B In fact if history is any indication even with more institutional investment I suspect we may see wild price swings for the share price of HIMX between now and next year s dividend payout amp x200B Now as indicated these might be tempered somewhat by the institutional purchases or individuals buying really large blocks of HIMX as described previously said purchases essentially stabilizing the price and preventing it from dropping significantly below its current price point That said an example of the possible upcoming action might be to see it run up to say 30 then drop back down to around 17 and finally stabilizing at 24 by Divvy Payout Day 2022 amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B We haven t even begun to look at options yet If you re interested in options when they become available I d recommend looking at June July LEAPS buying calls or possibly selling puts amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B That s only for the next year As HIMX has more design wins and their newest bleeding edge technologies are adopted by more and more companies coupled with the current chip shortage that will last probably into at least 2023 they are poised to print for quite a few years to come amp x200B amp x200B Recent article posted on Digitimes entitled ChipMOS Chipbond may further raise backend quotes in 2H21 stated the following amp x200B Backend houses ChipMOS Technologies and Chipbond Technology are expected to raise again their backend service quotes later in the second half of 2021 as robust demand for car use display driver ICs DDI and NOR flash chips continues to fill their factory capacities according to industry sources amp x200B Taiwan s DDI vendors including Novatek Microelectroncis and Himax Technologies are set to ramp up shipments of both LCD and OLED automotive DDI chips in the third quarter as they have just passed strict client validations after two years of deployments in such chips the sources said and they mainly rely on ChipMOS and Chipbond for testing and packaging services the sources said amp x200B Both backend houses are expected to sustain full capacity utilization throughout 2021 and will surely raise their service quotes later in the year amid their increasingly tight capacity supply the sources noted Their additional high end testing capacities for DDI chips and memory chips have been fully booked soon after they began purchasing new testing machines the sources continued amp x200B Translation the tendies are gonna shower down like manna from Heaven amp x200B Finally HIMX closed Friday July 16 2021 at 14 That s a discount from Monday Trade accordingly amp x200B Easiest thing to do right now is simply buy shares and hodl Get your divvy next year and if you want to sell do so and pay long term capital gains instead of short term amp x200B Tendietown my fellow apes amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B TL DR amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Maffs is hard so let s just say HIMX is gonna go to the moon and beyond over the next few years and pay you a divvy while it does so Buy and hodl and get a bucket of tendies either in the form of 4 divvy or a stock price that provides ROI at the very least 56 8 or greater probably much much more AND gives you a divvy amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Buckets of tendies for everyone on Mars

of earnings This week is jam packed with companies reporting within highly volatile sectors the most notable being steel and airlines so keep an eye out for those Alongside those we ve got a handful of boomer blue chips pulling through as well whom I m expecting beats from all across the board There s a lot of money to be made this week especially with collateral plays https www reddit com r

us in planning our trades this week I ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week https docs google com spreadsheets d

Obviously past performance isn t indicative of future success but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information If you re struggling to find a given stock click on the ticker symbol on the index page it should hyperlink you straight to the table If the above link isn t working for you refer to the link below amp nbsp Spreadsheet HERE https docs google com spreadsheets d 1I57fF zCVw1OV jHUnY brJdm2v4YlypyY7Ip1p7BTY edit usp sharing amp nbsp If the sheet has helped you out in any way please drop an upvote or a comment so I know whether or not I should keep on making them Most websites also require you to pay for this data which I think is asinine amp nbsp Interesting Observations and Sample Plays Below I ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance If I missed anything feel free to bring it to my attention amp nbsp Steel stocks move in tandem with one another CLF and NUE will put up their numbers on Thursday morning and the market will then price all other steel stocks accordingly That means if CLF NUE are up the rest of steel gang will also be up bigly The flipside is also true If either tanks they ll take down the respective companies If you re looking to make a steel play I would look to play MT or X options instead of CLF NUE options as they will move roughly the same amount but they won t get IV crushed Those looking to roll the dice should look to enter a position Wednesday before close as that s when the options will be the cheapest thanks to theta gang amp nbsp Airline stocks also move in tandem with each other Similar to above AAL LUV and ALK all report Thursday morning If you re looking to make a collateral play look to play DAL or something to avoid the IV crush Alternatively you can also look to go long or short on the entire sector through JETS The IV on JETS is half that of the reporting tickers meaning we ll get huge gains on a relatively small move This is key since we re going to get a large move in JETS as the entire sector will fly lol or crash after Thursday since the market will price all airline stocks not just AAL and LUV based off of the AAL and LUV earnings On average airlines move around 4 5 post earnings so we should see a comparable movement in JETS If we get such a move in JETS we ll have at minimum a five bagger on deck More information about this here https www hungrybotalerts com blog collateral plays amp nbsp Snapchat is inefficiently priced Since going public SNAP has had an average post earnings move of 17 The options this week are pricing in a move of under 6 on both sides of the chain What really makes this pricing weird is the fact that Snapchat has never moved less than 6 post earnings since IPO If you re gambling on this one the odds are really in your favour That being said maybe Wall Street knows something I ve honestly got no idea The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true amp nbsp Summary and Conclusion We ve got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round There s many trades that have a great risk reward ratio on them this week which is extremely odd

mid late May I ve been generally bullish on the market it seemed that nothing could accelerate meaningful downside move and this I think was further proven with the post FOMC reaction of a small

latter being the equal weight S amp P 500 index We can see that while the SPY has bounced to new highs from the mid June low the RSP has traded largely sideways At first this may look similar to previous patterns in the chart where the performance has diverged but this is in fact a divergence of direction one going up and the other sideways This is still a nascent pattern in my opinion but a worrying sign if this continues The second chart shows the SPY vs the percentage of S amp P 500 stocks making new all time highs the latter of which continues to hover in a range around 10 For example on Friday only 9 of S amp P 500 stocks closed at ATHs Our last chart shows the the SPY vs the S5FI the percentage of S amp P 500 stocks above their 50DMA at close on any given day What this might tell us is that this recent rally has been narrow in other words lacking broad participation and fueled by a few select stocks dragging the index higher That s generally not considered a healthy move and

d02ac5846db3cbb2ac0954995b2b082a8073beb4 Takeaways ARKK representative of the growth trade seemed like it had taken a turn for the better but then stalled out around the 130 mark which seems to be overhead resistance It s since given back a good bit and with it now below it s 200DMA I wonder if we ll continue to see further downside here I think the RSP here tells us a lot It s been in a tight range for awhile now and failed to make new highs in concert with the SPY which again is a real indicator that a handful of stocks are dragging the index higher IWM continues to be range bound but I m getting the feeling we could test the lower end of that around the 208 210 area soon given recent performance SPY and QQQ don t look terrible especially with last week s stumbles cooling off RSI but as I ve discussed here the credibility of this rally is in doubt As mentioned above it s hard to see any clear leader here in terms of a trade but also hard to see a meaningful pullback happening either Perhaps this earnings season will be the catalyst for some well defined action direction going forward I think at a high level I buy in to this idea that we re in a phase two of this bull market where phase one has aggressively pulled forward valuations and now companies must prove their stock s worth This likely means a more challenging environment where we trade sideways at the index level and investors must find alpha at the individual stock level and I think this has really been the case since February or March this year What I ve Been Reading Variant Perception Phases of a Bull

What s up fellow retards will add images after dumb autom doesn t delete I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are I m a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations relative volatility index and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy sell areas on stocks no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations 68 of a stock s price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation 2 blue lines of it s average regression trend middle line 95 within two deviations first upper and lower purple lines and 99 7 within 3 deviations second upper and lower purple lines known as the 68 95 99 7 rule Most importantly these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels with deviations once crossed becoming either the new resistance or new support level I generally use this to find stocks that are trading above 2 deviations to short buy puts or at 2 deviations to buy calls stock as these areas represent only 5 of the price action over a given time period and statistically there s a 95 chance the price will drop back below or climb back above 2 2 deviations respectively I did this with Amazon puts recently Otherwise I mostly trade off deviation support and ride volume up to next deviation resistance level before exiting the position which is what these TAs will be about See my Previous SOFI and AMC and AMZN NVDA etc TA s if you want examples of how this strategy works I don t have all damn night so let s get into my personal price targets on these stocks which I will be playing Monday if the support setups are reached These will be named under the stock ticker and its chart and my upside target at which I ll theoretically be exiting along with a general TA of what price action we might see Deviation support resistance lines will be drawn on the One Year and 6 Month charts and the same deviation lines will be visible on the intraday chart posted next to the Daily and 4 Hour Daily 1 year 4 Hour 6 month chart These charts are already zoomed in to provide more detail on the current price action what s important is the deviation lines drawn from long term statistical trends which act as true support resistance relative to the current price Format will be long term charts first zoomed image of One year 6month then the intraday chart to the right Remember Blue lines 1 1 deviation and first purple lines 2 2 second purple lines 3 3 deviations All acting as support resistance levels relative to price After Monday s trading is over see where the prices of these stocks found support and resistance guarantee be the deviation levels you see on the One year and 6month charts below You don t even need my explanation just look at the first image I ve drawn red lines at deviation levels on both long term and intraday charts for you XELA One Year 6month and Intraday XELA has the last few days consistently held 1 deviation support on the 6 month chart and held through after hours trading Friday of 3 20 I will only be entering it if its holding the 3 20 deviation level so I can ride it up to our next 2 deviation resistance of 3 73 on one year chart before exiting There is also a bounce trade to be played at the 3 1 deviation on the one year chart AEHR One Year 6month and Intraday AEHR s moves would be similar to XELA for me It tested 6month 1Dev support on 6 month chart early Friday then broke up to 2dev resistance levels of 3 74 3 67 on one year and 6 month chart I bought in at 3 20 premarket and rode the move up and exited I ll pretty much be looking for it to repeat this move Monday should it hold support and hold till the 2deviation resistance levels Should it crack these levels pre market I won t be entering a position until long down the line when we hit 1dev on Daily and 4hour chart SPCE One Year 6 Month and Intraday Pretty much waiting for this one to hit It s 1dev support of around 25 26 on both one year and 6 month chart Likely would be a quick scalp trade exiting the position before it nears its resistance regression trend of 35 37 100 buying in long if it reaches 2deviation support of 14 16 in the near future VERB One Year 6Month and Intraday Verbs extremely overbought hovering over 2 deviations For a quick scalp trade Monday I ll be looking to buy potential support bounces at 2devs on both long term charts of 2 50 area If you look at the intra day and long term charts you can see we bounced around 3dev resistance support on the Daily and 4Hour chart red lines on intraday and long term image on Friday but an entry this off trend is too risky for me Hoping for quick scalp around 2 50 and exit around 2 70 area At some point this week we ll likely see it hit 1dev support of 2 09 2 04 on Daily and 4hour chart which is where I d buy in big and exit before 2 deviation resistance of 2 50 is hit ATOS One Year 6Month and Intraday Atos is a falling knife right now and is primed to make a bounce off 1Dev support of 3 30 area on 6month and should that not happen I ll enter at 1dev on one year at 2 26 and ride 90 of the deviation bounces back up to their regression trends of 3 72 and 5 03 middle lines on Daily and 4hour chart We still have to pass through the 3 72 regression trend on Daily one Year chart to truly be heading to next support 1 deviation levels but I never play the regression trend SGOC One Year 6Month and Intraday Broke out of 4deviation support on daily chart Friday ran up to 2 dev resistance on 6month chart and surprisingly held there This one s bull flagging hard but given how off trend it is I won t be playing it till we get back to 2 dev support levels of 8 80 area and 10 20 on long term charts or 1dev support of 7 40 on 6month chart similarly looking for a quick scalp of 80 of the move up to next deviation resistance If options are available on this one I d hold puts all the way down to 1deviation support on long term charts top blue lines Extremely overbought If it does break out of support Monday I d exit before 4deviation resistance level of 15 80 area RCAT One Year 6Month and Intraday Look at intraday bounced perfectly off long term deviation resistance support levels This one technically has room to run it broke out of 1 deviation resistance of 4 88 on 6month chart on Friday ran up to 3 deviation resistance then broke back down slightly back above 4 88 deviation support This one technically still has room to run If it bounces at 4 90 area I ll buy in and ride up to deviation resistance of 6 21 before exiting this is only 1deviation on one year If it breaks 6 20 resistance I ll re enter and exit before 3dev resistance of 7 43 on 6month NEGG One year 6Month and Intraday Pretty much not playing this till it hits 1dev support on Daily one year chart of 22 40 for a quick bounce scalp Broke out of 1dev support on 6month chart Friday and ran up to 2dev resistance as you can see on intraday This was already likely its big move before selling pressure pushes us back to 1dev on one year at which point I ll be targeting the next closes upper deviation resistance 2 on 6month or 1year of around 30 on one year and 35 on 6 month Draw your own support lines at 1 deviations on both long term charts a 8 30 and 10 60 as this will be a strong deviation support bounce area in the next week or two CLOV OneYear 6Month and Intraday CLOV is high on my list of dip buys as its been sold down so hard over the past few weeks and is rapidly nearing its One year 1deviation support of around 7 80 After such a huge sell off I ll be looking for it to hold this 1dev level for at least 30 minutes once it sells down to it then add 10 20k in shares for a potential half deviation bounce dotted white lines before exiting MRIN OneYera 6month and Intraday We re nearing a seriously strong 1deviation support trend line right around 8 coming in on the on year chart I ll be looking to add share at this price point to ride most of the deviation bounce up towards 2devs of 11 29 area on one year chart BLIN One Year 6month Intraday Should be some strong support at 1deviations of 4 95 on One year chart should it bottom out here I ll be entering a position around this price point and exiting it at 2deviations on One Year Chart around 6 Remember deviation support lines be broken the next deviation is support and the deviation it crossed becomes resistance These charts should be accurate for one to two days regarding accurately identifying buy and sell areas but the deviations will begin to be off too much in three days as new price information changes the statistical trends If you understood my explanation of support resistance levels being at deviations on the one year and 6 month and just look at the the examples of the intraday bouncing perfectly off them you can use these deviation lines to mark your own supp resist levels for a day or two Good luck out there everyone Hope this helped Happy Monday tomorrow MAKE SOME MONEY MY FELLOW RETARDS

find stocks that are trading above 2 deviations to short buy puts or at 2 deviations to buy calls stock as these areas represent only 5 of the price action over a given time period and statistically there s a 95 chance the price will drop back below or climb back above 2 2 deviations respectively I did this with Amazon puts recently Otherwise I mostly trade off deviation support and ride volume up to next deviation resistance level before exiting the position which is what these TAs will be about See my Previous SOFI and AMC and AMZN NVDA etc TA s if you want examples of how this strategy works I don t have all damn night so let s get into my personal price targets on these stocks which I will be playing Monday if the support setups are reached These will be named under the stock ticker and its chart and my upside target at which I ll theoretically be exiting along with a general TA of what price action we might see Deviation support resistance lines will be drawn on the One Year and 6 Month charts and the same deviation lines will be visible on the intraday chart posted next to the Daily and 4 Hour Daily 1 year 4 Hour 6 month chart These charts are already zoomed in to

Xxxx to the ELA One Year 6month and Intraday This stock has the last few days consistently held 1 deviation support on the 6 month chart and held through after hours trading Friday of 3 20 I will only be entering it if its holding the 3 20 deviation level so I can ride it up to our next 2 deviation resistance of 3 73 on one year chart before exiting There is also a bounce trade to be played at the 3 1 deviation on the one year chart AEHR One Year 6month and Intraday AEHR s moves would be similar to XELA for me It tested 6month 1Dev support on 6 month chart early Friday then broke up to 2dev resistance levels of 3 74 3 67 on one year and 6 month chart I bought in at 3 20 premarket and rode the move up and exited I ll pretty much be looking for it to repeat this move Monday should it hold support and hold till the 2deviation resistance levels Should it crack these levels pre market I won t be entering a position until long down the line when we hit 1dev on Daily and 4hour chart SPCE One Year 6 Month and Intraday Pretty much waiting for this one to hit It s 1dev support of around 25 26 on both one year and 6 month chart Likely would be a quick scalp trade exiting the position before it nears its resistance regression trend of 35 37 100 buying in long if it reaches 2deviation support of 14 16 in the near future VERB One Year 6Month and Intraday Verbs extremely overbought hovering over 2 deviations For a quick scalp trade Monday I ll be looking to buy potential support bounces at 2devs on both long term charts of 2 50 area If you look at the intra day and long term charts you can see we bounced around 3dev resistance support on the Daily and 4Hour chart red lines on intraday and long term image on Friday but an entry this off trend is too risky for me Hoping for quick scalp around 2 50 and exit around 2 70 area At some point this week we ll likely see it hit 1dev support of 2 09 2 04 on Daily and 4hour chart which is where I d buy in big and exit before 2 deviation resistance of 2 50 is hit ATOS One Year 6Month and Intraday Atos is a falling knife right now and is primed to make a bounce off 1Dev support of 3 30 area on 6month and should that not happen I ll enter at 1dev on one year at 2 26 and ride 90 of the deviation bounces back up to their regression trends of 3 72 and 5 03 middle lines on Daily and 4hour chart We still have to pass through the 3 72 regression trend on Daily one Year chart to truly be heading to next support 1 deviation levels but I never play the regression trend SGOC One Year 6Month and Intraday Broke out of 4deviation support on daily chart Friday ran up to 2 dev resistance on 6month chart and surprisingly held there This one s bull flagging hard but given how off trend it is I won t be playing it till

exit before 4deviation resistance level of 15 80 area RCAT One Year 6Month and Intraday Look at intraday bounced perfectly off long term deviation resistance support levels This one technically has room to run it broke out of 1 deviation resistance of 4 88 on 6month chart on Friday ran up to 3 deviation resistance then broke back down slightly back above 4 88 deviation support This one technically still has room to run If it bounces at 4 90 area I ll buy in and ride up to deviation resistance of 6 21 before exiting this is only 1deviation on one year If it breaks 6 20 resistance I ll re enter and exit before 3dev resistance of 7 43 on 6month NEGG One year 6Month and Intraday Pretty much not playing this till it hits 1dev support on Daily one year chart of 22 40 for a quick bounce scalp Broke out of 1dev support on 6month chart Friday and ran up to 2dev resistance as you can see on intraday This was already likely its big move before selling pressure pushes us back to 1dev on one year at which point I ll be targeting the next closes upper deviation resistance 2 on 6month or 1year of around 30 on one year and 35 on 6 month Draw your own support lines at 1 deviations on both long term charts a 8 30 and 10 60 as this will be a strong deviation support bounce area in the next week or two CLOV OneYear 6Month and Intraday CLOV is high on my list of dip buys as its been sold down so hard over the past few weeks and is rapidly nearing its One year 1deviation support of around 7 80 After such a huge sell off I ll be looking for it to hold this 1dev level for at least 30 minutes once it sells down to it then add 10 20k in shares for a potential half deviation bounce dotted white lines before exiting MRIN OneYera 6month and Intraday We re nearing a seriously strong 1deviation support trend line right around 8 coming in on the on year chart I ll be looking to add share at this price point to ride most of the deviation bounce up towards 2devs of 11 29 area on one year chart Bzz to the LIN One Year 6month Intraday Should be some strong support at 1deviations of 4 95 on One year chart should it bottom out here I ll be entering a position around this price point and exiting it at 2deviations on One Year Chart around 6 Remember deviation support lines be broken the next deviation is support and the deviation it crossed becomes resistance These charts should be accurate for one to two days regarding accurately identifying buy and sell areas but the deviations will begin to be off too much in three days as new price information changes the statistical trends If you understood my explanation of support resistance levels being at deviations on the one year and 6 month and just look at the the examples of the intraday bouncing perfectly off them you can use these deviation lines to mark your own supp resist levels for a day or two Good luck out there everyone Hope this helped Happy Monday tomorrow MAKE SOME MONEY MY FELLOW RETARDS

creating possibilities and markets once not thought possible Companies across all industries are moving as fast as they can to replace their old legacy systems with new ones that will help them reduce spending increase efficiency and give them the advantage they need to outdo competitors Although companies know they need to adapt to these new technologies many of them don t know where to begin or how to implement them into operations The business process automation market is based around helping companies make this transition through implementing a series of robotic automation solutions intended to replace repetitive and pre defined human tasks The need for business process automation or BPA is making an incredibly interesting investment opportunity in a market that is set for double digit growth in the coming years In 2020 the entire BPA market was valued at 9 8 billion and is expected to reach 42 3 billion by 2026 giving it a staggering CAGR of 43 in that time frame The business world is getting more competitive across all industries and only those who can create real value for their customers while keeping their costs low are going to succeed Business process automation is the magic pill these companies need if they want to not only survive but thrive in the increasingly digital world we live in today Company Overview https preview redd it kixlpkbu92c71 png width 826 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 124b7a0473046b4597c176f971c08dde58ca780c At the forefront of the business process automation industry lies EXELA Technologies XELA which founded in 2017 is leveraging a global footprint and proprietary technology to provide digital transformation solutions enhancing quality productivity and end user experience Exela is executing on this mission statement through their turn key software solution catering to the entire suite of a business s operations including accounting finance logistics business intelligence human resources customer support and marketing to only name a few Combine this with their extensive investments in research and development and Exela has developed a strong moat for themselves through numerous patents within robotics and automation Exela is also creating value for their customers by offering flexible pricing options through their flagship product Digital Now which is a single unified cloud based platform providing multiple solutions to help customers rapidly adopt and deploy their software at an enterprise level With BPA specialists there to help at each step Exela makes the transition for companies to implement automated processes incredibly easy and it is showing in their performance An Incredible Management Team Delivering on Profitability The CEO of Exela Ron Cogburn is bringing over 30 years of leadership experience program management and consulting to the table The rest of the leadership team brings a diverse set of qualifications across multiple industries all using technology to solve real world problems The company has done an outstanding job of assembling one of the most unrivalled management teams in the field with a combined experience of over 100 years Through first hand experience this leadership team knows just how inefficient and slow some company s operations can be and more importantly how crucial implementing business process automation is if these same companies want to excel within their respective industries In the first quarter of 2021 Exela saw revenue of 300 million an 18 decrease year over year Investors shouldn t worry though with the reasoning being the economic repercussions of the coronavirus in 2020 and despite this economic slow down E xela was able to improve their margins going from 18 to 22 5 from last year to now This improvement in margins from 2020 is setting Exela on a path to profitability sooner than most investors realize And with cash of 22 5 million on the balance sheet Exela is emerging from the pandemic primed for growth and stronger than ever before A Growth Company Built to Last With the majority of recently IPO d companies comes the criticism and concern from analysts that the company has yet to build a strong profile of customers putting them at risk of having a highly concentrated source of their total revenue Exela is the exception to this rule with over 4 000 companies in 50 different countries they have built an incredibly strong customer base to expand on Their top 20 customers only make up 20 of their entire customer base and with a large international presence with customers across virtually every industry Exela has formed the relationships and revenue sources of a company much older than itself This diverse customer base was no mistake Through these relationships Exela has created the perfect opportunity to up sell their customers and has no shortage of new products in the pipeline With 6 new modules to be released in the coming year that can be applied across all industries Exela is creating an incredibly sticky eco system within business process automation As their customers grow and develop new processes so too will their spending with Exela as they add more services to help them facilitate growth as efficiently as possible Competitor Analysis The business process automation market is unquestionably becoming more competitive However a brief comparison of Exela s top competitors will show frothy valuations with a clear limited upside in future growth ExlService EXLS provides operations management and analytics services in select parts of the world With a current market cap of 3 6 billion and an eye popping trailing 12 months price to earnings of 37 49 this company has years of future success already been baked into their current price eClerx Services ECLERX NS is a competitor coming from India who specializes in data management analytics and offers business process outsourcing With a long history in the industry they were founded in 2000 eClerx has achieved a market cap of 74 3 billion and has a current trailing price to earnings ratio of 26 15 This combo of valuation metrics could spell danger for investors who would be paying an excessively high premium for a company that has limited future growth considering their mega cap status Company Market Cap Trailing PE Exela 205 4 million N A eClerx 74 3 billion 26 15 ExlService 3 6 billion 37 49 amp x200B Both companies have had their valuation part ways with their fundamentals making it difficult to justify the price investors would pay for shares today Exela currently lies in that sweet spot growth investors search so hard to find With a smaller market cap the company has barely grasped 1 of their total addressable market giving them a long runway to grow for many years to come Factor this in with the diverse customer base international presence and multiple new products in the pipeline and it becomes clear Exela is not only one of the most innovative companies they are also one of the most undervalued at current prices Key Takeaway The business process automation market is locked in for further growth as new industries and companies realize how they can leverage this technology for their benefit and Exela is establishing itself as a major player within the industry At their current valuation the market has not yet priced in Exela s future growth prospects and investors today can take advantage of this mistake by buying an incredible growth company at bargain prices
