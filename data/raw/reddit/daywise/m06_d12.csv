demand was over 10 The next day on the 4th you simply see the stock go super low volume and like a loaded coil explode on the 7th Just so happens that this happened the Monday after the June 4th expiry It just so happens theres a June 18th expiry this week It will be very interestying to see whats possible from the recent move I d like to teach my fellow apes delta hedging Its this really really cool trick hedge funds use to avoid risk So say your delta on a contract is 0 25 Then you need to purchase with that contract 25 shares to maintain a delta neutral position The math works like this 1 contract 100 shares so 0 25 delta value 25 But what if the stock goes up What do you do When stocks go up the delta tends to rise as well Lets just say the delta goes to 0 50 Well now your short delta by 0 25 as you have 25 shares and the delta is now 0 50 To maintain your neutral position you should go back in and purchase 25 more shares This will then up your share count to 50 and you will be all delta neutral again well hedged for the future Whats really crazy is you can actually mathematically show how many calls purchased would actually take up a certain amout of float As the float is questionable at best here however as it may not even exist at all I m not even certain what number you can reliably base it on It could be that every option being bought by some idiot that thinks this is going to the moon should cause you to purchase the delta in shares for that contact but its all just so over my wee brain I mean its no wonder BOA just downgraded the stock theres no shares available and thats horrible customer service https www thestreet com investing clover health clove meme stock downgrade valuation concerns https www thestreet com investing clover health clove

beautiful apes remember that hedge fund who bought 8 million shares direct from AMC only to paper hand the same day for a tiny profit Remember how they also called AMC overvalued Well turns out Mudrick Capital had skin in the game amp were on the losing side of call options as AMC ran up to the 40s 50s 60s and 70s Congratulations apes Your diamond hands just cost another hedge fund hundreds of millions of dollars in losses AMC Bet by Hedge Fund Unravels Thanks to Meme Stock Traders Update BY Dow Jones Company Inc 6 13 PM ET 06 11 2021 A multipronged bet on AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc boomeranged this month on Mudrick Capital Management LP the latest hedge fund to fall victim to swarming day traders Mudrick s flagship fund lost about 10 in just a few days as a jump in AMC s stock price unexpectedly triggered changes in the value of derivatives the fund held as part of a complex trading strategy people familiar with the matter said Mudrick Capital s losses highlight how risky retaining significant exposure to such companies can be even backfiring on a hedge fund manager who was mostly in sync with the bullishness of individual investors Jason Mudrick the firm s founder had been trading AMC stock options and bonds for months surfing a surge of enthusiasm for the theater chain among individual investors But he also sold call options derivative contracts meant to hedge the fund s exposure to AMC should the stock price founder Those derivative contracts which gave its buyers the right to buy AMC stock from Mudrick at roughly 40 in the future ballooned into liabilities when a resurgence of Reddit fueled buying recently pushed AMC s stock to new records the people said As part of the broader AMC strategy executives at Mudrick Capital were in talks with AMC to buy additional shares from the company in late May On June 1 AMC disclosed that Mudrick Capital had agreed to buy 230 5 million of new stock directly from the company at 27 12 apiece a premium over where it was then trading Mudrick immediately sold the stock at a profit a quick flip that was reported by Bloomberg News and that sparked backlash on social media Mudrick didn t stab AMC in the back They shot themselves in the foot read one post on Reddit s Wall Street Bets forum on June 1 Other posts around that time referenced Mudrick as losers scum bags and a large waving pile of s t with no future Members of the forum urged each other to buy and hold Inside Mudrick executives were growing apprehensive as the AMC rally gained steam The firm s risk committee met on the evening of June 1 after the stock closed at 32 and decided to exit all debt and derivative positions the following day It was a day too late AMC s stock price blew past 40 in a matter of hours June 2 hitting an intraday high of 72 62 Call option prices soared amid a frenzy of trading that Mudrick Capital contributed to and by the end of the week the winning trade had turned into a bust costing the fund hundreds of millions of dollars in losses Mr Mudrick s fund is still up about 12 for the year one of the people said Meanwhile investors who bought AMC stock at the start of the year and held on have gained about 2000 The impact of social media fueled day traders has become a defining market development this year costing top hedge funds billions of dollars in losses sparking a congressional hearing and drawing scrutiny from the U S Securities and Exchange Commission More hedge funds now track individual investors sentiment on social media and pay greater attention to companies with smaller market values whose stock price may be more susceptible to the enthusiasms of individual investors Mr Mudrick specializes in distressed debt investing often lending to troubled companies at high interest rates or swapping their existing debt for equity in bankruptcy court Mudrick manages about 3 5 billion in investments firmwide and holds large illiquid stakes in E cigarette maker NJOY Holdings Inc and satellite communications company Globalstar Inc from such exchanges The flagship fund reported returns of about 17 annually from 2018 to 2020 according to data from HSBC Alternative Investment Group But distressed investing opportunities have grown harder to find as easy money from the Federal Reserve has given even struggling companies open access to debt markets Mr Mudrick has explored other strategies l aunching several special purpose acquisition companies and in the case of AMC ultimately buying stock in block trades Mr Mudrick initially applied his typical playbook to AMC buying bonds for as little as 20 cents on the dollar lending the company 100 million in December and swapping some bonds into new shares Theater attendance already under pressure had disappeared almost entirely amid Covid 19 pandemic lockdowns and AMC stock traded as low as 2 He reasoned that consumers would regain their appetite for big screen entertainment this year as more Americans got vaccinated Day traders took their first run at AMC in late January urging each other on with the social media rallying cry of SaveAMC and briefly lifting the stock to around 20 AMC s rising equity value boosted debt prices one bond Mudrick Capital owned doubled within a week quickly rewarding Mr Mudrick s bullishness AMC capitalized on its surging stock price to raise nearly 1 billion in new financing in late January enabling it to ward off a previously expected bankruptcy filing Around that time Mr Mudrick sold call options on AMC stock producing immediate income to offset potential losses if the theater chain did face problems The derivatives gave buyers the option to buy AMC shares from Mudrick Capital for about 40 viewed as a seeming improbability when the stock was trading below 10 Mr Mudrick remained in contact with AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron about providing additional funding leading to his recent share purchase But he kept the derivative contracts outstanding as an insurance policy one of the people familiar with the matter said

bagholders lambo owners retards and autists Have you ever opened Stocktwits and seen a ticker you ve never heard of trending because it mooned 400 in a day Have you fantasized about how you could finally buy a lambo and move out of your wife s boyfriend s shed if you d only gone all in on that company the day before Chances are that company was a biotech or a biopharma company This sector is truly the wild west of the stock market filled with low cap low float low volume high short interest stocks that can make outsized moves like mooning 400 or drilling 90 a day based on catalysts like FDA approvals rejections and trial results Now you read what I said about moving out of your wife s boyfriend s shed and said Chad is a fucking douche he always drinks all my mountain dew and won t let me stay up past 8 o clock and you want out on a volatile biopharm rocket to Valhalla Allow daddy u Academic Lake to introduce you to Blueprint Medicines Corporation BPMC BPMC is set to get FDA approval for a new drug called Ayvakit on June 16th which is this Wednesday Ayvakit will be used to treat Advanced Systemic mastocytosis SM which is a rare disease that can lead to organ damage and shorten lie expectancies Ayvakit is already approved for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors but gaining approval for additional disease will broaden the scope of the drug significantly and increase sales Analysts expect Ayvakit if it is approved to be a significant driver ion the companies sales going forward But how is the company going to make money on rare diseases Well the Ayvakit treatment is very pricey A 30 day supply of tablets costs around 35 000 and the total cost of a treatment can be up to 250 000 There is no generic version of the drug available so BPMC can effectively monopolize the treatments for these rare diseases BPMC became profitable this year and has a PE ratio of 14 9 compared to the industry average of 22 4 The analyst consensus for forecasted annual earnings growth is 56 6 compared to the industry average of 14 7 The average analyst consensus PT is 117 92 while I sawn site estimate a fair value of 763 57 per share It goes without saying that this is a significant upside from Fridays close at 86 90 This FDA approval in particular will be a significant step towards achieving these targets and BPMC also has a promising development pipeline of other drugs which I won t cover for the sake of brevity Now that we know about the catalyst that can fuel the next move up for BPMC let s talk institutional ownership and volume Institutions own 99 11 of the company and they have been buying heavily throughout Q1 and Q2 BPMC has an average 3 month volume of 401 428 and volume today was above average at slightly over 600 000 Regardless if the catalyst of the FDA approval on June 16th throws significant buying pressure behind this stock we could see an eye watering spike during the session There is also a significant amount of open interest on 6 18 95c so if they become ITM the spike could further be supercharged by MM gamma hedging So how do we play this Well we re not exactly buying bonds here and we re a bunch of degenerates In the spirit of this sub this is a true FD play Options are surprisingly cheap on this stock with 6 18 95c being 0 50c each as of market close Friday If the stock spikes by just 15 on the FDA approval the 6 18 95c will be TEN BAGGERS And as we ve seen previously with some other biotech plays these small cap biotechs can go significantly higher than just 15 on an FDA approval TL DR BPMC is significantly undervalued due to a variety of metrics and the upcoming FDA decision on June 16th can be a catalyst to return to previous highs and above This should go without saying but I am not a financial advisor and this is for entertainment only and not financial advice Biotech plays are usually boom or bust so do not gamble any money you cannot afford to lose I would appreciate

to make it clear I have 20 shares in CRSR as everything else is tied up in other investments but I do plan on adding more through the year I see a lot of comments on DD posts about CRSR about chip shortages their competition what they manufacture ect So I want to clear the air about a few things as someone who uses their products and as a hardware nerd who used to have a side hustle building PC s to flip and resell The chip shortage AFAIK nothing in their product stack is affected by a shortage there was a while a few months ago where PSU s were hard to get a hold of but it seems to be corrected now but besides their first party products Corsair owns Elgato SCUF and Origin PC Origin PC a boutique PC system integrator While yes SI s don t have to struggle to find parts like we do retail and SI s have separate allocation from chip manufacturers go and try to price out a system the price difference between a 6700 XT msrp 479 and a 6800 XT msrp 649 is 718 the price difference between the 2 cards is higher then the price the 6800 XT should be here s where the chip shortage is hitting them inflated prices Product stack Besides the PCs streaming equipment and game controllers the 3 brands above produce Corsair also provides RAM PSU s coolers fans storage cases keyboards mice and headsets there are a few things I left out like merch and thermal compound but that list are the important things RAM chips come from Hynix or Samsung and are assembled by Corsair no issues with the RAM good stuff PSU s are branded Corsair but made by Seasonic Flextronics and Channel Well depends on the PSU and to be completely honest this info is 2 years old contracts expire things change but they are all 2nd party rebrands Corsair does not assemble any PSUs Their PSU s go from ok to great price to performance wise and hold up with age Coolers and fans The water coolers are basically the same as everyone else as any with a pump on block design is paying Asetek to make them as they hold the patent on that design Their only air cooler the A500 is ok priced about double what it should be for the performance but on a motherboard that would have fitment issues with the fans over the RAM the slide for the fans solves it Storage The components come from Phison and Toshiba I BELIEVE Corsair actually assembles them and it isn t just a rebrand but they are solid drives the main problem is the SSD space is saturated as hell and the average buyer just looks at the size to price ratio The MP600 is currently a great drive for the price though Headset The midrange Voids are IMO the best gaming headset on the market and what I recommend anyone to try if they are looking to try a different brand the sound out the box is great as is the mic quality only down side is the battery life on the wireless ones The high end Virtuosos are fucking dog shit 3 4x more expensive then the Voids and no matter how much time you spend with the EQ settings the Voids out of the box blow them out the water Keyboards and Mice K95 Platinum with brown switches is my daily driver I love it all of their keyboards are good solid build prices make sense Are they better then Logitech Subjective I say yes I am not a fan of their mice and think Logitech wins in that category though unless you NEED a mouse with 15 buttons then the Scimitar has you covered Cases Mixed bag honestly some are lampooned by Gamers Nexus for terrible thermals others get a pass but again cases are a super saturated market and there isnt anything special here vs its competitors ICUE SOFTWARE This is Corsairs software solution to get all your RGB synced up set macros noise levels and audio EQ for your headset Honestly it s a steaming pile BUT DONT WORRY EVERYONES IS for some reason designing software is something nobody in the peripheral space can get rite PC Gamer ranks them by annoyingness instead of other metrics Corsairs actual value So if you made it this far you might think I am either against or at least hesitant on investing in CRSR as they exist today No because where they really shine is in their customer service Everyone has been using Ryan Cohen as a prime example for why GME is going to succeed as a company with what he did for Chewy Everyone loves Chewy because of their outstanding customer service Corsair is the Chewy of peripherals Their CS team goes above and beyond constantly they are active on Reddit and other social medias ready to answer any questions and provide support They will open support tickets for items out of warranty and in most cases if they cant fix the issue send you a new one Hell their was even a story a while ago where someone posted pics of fire damage destroying his new PC and a Corsair rep send them an entire new system This attitude is why I tell all my friends if they don t know what brand to go with at least TRY Corsairs offering first and return it if you don t like it TLDR Corsair nice people nice people retain customers some of their stuff could be priced better for its performance category and yes they are affected by the chip shortage at some level

Fuels Corp The company is THE leading provide of the cleanest fuel Natural Gas for the transportation market in the United States and Canada They primarily focus in on 1 Regional Fleets of Trucks 2 Heavy Duty Trucking 3 Airport Transit 4 Public Transit 5 Construction Vehicles 6 Waste Management Vehicles Dump trucks It s products consist of Compressed Natural Gas CNG Renewable Natural Gas RNG and Liquefied Natural Gas LNG One of its leading products is something called Redeem which is a form of renewable natural gas RNG won t bother getting into how it s composed but know that it provides up to 70 reduction in greenhouse gasses versus diesel and gasoline Redeem itself is made from organic waste from landfills and farms Natural Gas There has been a lot of stigma around what it really means to be clean or green when it comes to transportation most of us think that Electric Vehicles seem to be the most green product for transportation out there EV s are definitely the future I just want to state that before getting started spewing out more information but RNG has huge demand and can definitely lead the way for clean energy The company itself reduced 745 000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions and more than 401 000 000 gallons were sold in 2019 This may come as a surprise but how clean is natural gas Based only minimal research it looks to be cleaner than the electric truck

anything is possible The point is the opportunity with Biden supplementing a lot of stimulus into the clean energy market Clean Energy Fuels Corp is poised to get a large piece with it being such a staple within the Natural Gas industry Partnerships amp Programs 1 Chevron Chevron partnered with CLNE on July 8th 2020 with the announcement of the Adopt a Port program This will allow fleets across North America to subsidize costs transitioning into a greener product for transportation with cost advantages Chevron will provide funding for Adopt a Port and supply RNG to Clean Energy stations near the ports Chevron s funding will allow truck operators to subsidize the cost of buying new RNG powered trucks Clean Energy meanwhile will manage the program including offering fueling services for qualified truck operators 2 Total SE Total is a very large company focusing in refining petroleum They are the largest shareholder of CLNE 26 of outstanding shares Again a large company partnering with CLNE to produce revenues in the current year and future years With Total SE they ve partnered with CLNE in a joint venture valued at around 145 million to launch the Zero Now Program The Zero Now Program allows companies to purchase a natural gas truck for the same price as they could buy a diesel truck in the combined deal they would also offer a discount for fuel up until an agreed time to help persuade the companies to go greener 3 BP The third partner is BP CLNE recently announced that it will work with BP to develop own and operate RNG facilities at dairies and other agriculture facilities that will produce Redeem The deal is quite small but could mean big things if the partnership were to be progressed through time 4 Waste Connections Waste connections is the 3rd largest waste collections company in North America based on market cap they re currently worth around 40B They ve been a partner with CLNE for years and have recently promoted one of their regional fleets of dump trucks to RNG vehicles and will begin operating with Redeem as soon as possible The fleet consists of 110 trucks in the San Jose area The deal itself isn t that great I must admit but this could mean big things as if the trial goes well in the San Jose area this could mean upgrades to their regional fleets across the United States and possibly into Canada 5 Republic Services Another large company with a long partnership history with Clean Energy Fuels Corp In February 2019 they announced that they will utilize increasing amounts of Redeem fuel across 21 states over the next 5 years and this is in process This transition to cleaner fuel will represent 250 000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emission reduction each year which translates to around 53 000 passenger vehicles to be taken off the road Summary of Partnerships amp Programs These partnerships will continue to provide Clean Energy Fuels Corp with recurring revenues to drive growth across North America Their recent and past partnerships continue to give rise to increasing demand of natural gas in one of the largest industries that demands fuel of this nature The programs in place Zero Now amp Adopt a Port program were introduced and will drive growth in the industry by providing incentives to adopting RNG vehicles instead of gasoline or diesel powered vehicles There are a lot of advantages to adopting Redeem 70 reudction in greenhouse gases Cost efficient offered at 1 00 gallon Renewable Domestic Moving North America towards energy independence Growth amp Opportunities With most of the world in lockdown and the rise of eCommerce and the need for shipping and delivery services this will drive the demand for their Redeem product Companies like UPS Kroger FedEx and Republic Services have already signed up for large deals to use the product as a substantially lower cost then Diesel or Gas The cost of Redeem is 1 00 gallon to give you perspective Volume growth for their Redeem Product in the past 3 years averaged 34 67 growth and this was before the Pandemic The Heavy Duty Truck industry is one of the largest markets for fuel consumption and so the opportunities are endless to gain more market share as governments are demanding for greener transportation The Heavy Duty trucing industry demands 35 billion gallons of fuel 30 billion over any other market in the big rig industries There are a lot of opportunities for future advancement throughout the space by making partnerships that will be mutually beneficial for both the world CLNE and the company involved Companies that currently use Natural Gas for their national fleets include Honda FritoLay FedEx Anheuser Busch Verizon Bimbo J amp J Waste Management Republic Services Home Depot Lowes AT amp TT Costco Colgate Palmolive PepsiCo UPS HP Unilever Starbucks Amazon Kraft Kroger and McDonalds These companies are large and there is huge potential for future partnerships with them Other Notes You may be asking yourself that s not really that impressive why should I invest Well the recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies Government s are transitioning to non gas related vehicles and this will continue to be progressed for years to come The company itself has recently been partnering with well known industry leaders that want to be first movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation The CEO owns 0 7 of shares outstanding Current shares outstanding are 198M and of this the CEO himself owns approximately 1 38 million shares He definitely believes in the company Price Targets Some people may be curious of my price targets for CLNE It s been on an absolute tear recently so I apologize for the late post but this is just the beginning My conservative price target is 25 by June 2021 48 by end of 2022 TDLR CLNE has immense upside and has ridiculous room for growth especially with the market cap being a mere 2 Billion It is a much easier stock to move than Wkhs UWMC or CRSR It would take a fraction of the amount of people to accomplish a major price move Either way it is amazing in the short and long run I like the stock

starts the bullish run on November 9th 2020 and peaks about February 10 2021 It then enters a bearish trend until about May 5th That is when it reverses into the now bullish trend that we are excited for To analyze these trends I used two tools Fibonacci Retracement and Fibonacci Time Zones What are these Do they work for CLNE at least Yes Overviews from investopedia Time Zones Fibonacci Time Zones https www investopedia com terms f fibonaccitimezones asp Fibonacci time zones are a technical indicator based on time The indicator is typically started at a major swing high or swing low on the chart Vertical lines then extend out to the right indicating areas of time that could result in another significant swing high low or reversal These vertical lines which correspond to time on the x axis of a price chart are based on Fibonacci numbers suggests when reversals could occur based on Fibonacci numbers The vertical lines do not have to be on the money but the chart speaks for itself I used November 9th 2020 as the starting point because that was the first sign of increase in volume and price from the previous trends Also that was the start of the first remarkable price movement in over six months This bullish trend continued until February 2nd 2021 with a price increase from 2 49 to 18 28 not bad maybe it was election results and potential shift for heavy support of green energy Either way CLNE peaked the next day on February 3rd at 19 79 I purposefully did not set the end of the first time zone on this date because of the price action the thicker part of the candle was higher on the 2nd not the 3rd which indicates a possible trend reversal Now go back and look at the chart and yes CLNE reversed The second time zone suggests that CLNE entered a bearish trend that should end around May 10th and wouldn t you know it CLNE did And this is where we are now a possible bull run until around July 20th Disclaimer This is a broad time frame Between May 10th and July 20th we should see a long term price movement UP How far up Let s find out Just understand that prices don t just go UP They can have corrections trade sideways consolidate etc Expect dips within this window of time Retracement Fibonacci Retracement https www investopedia com terms f fibonacciretracement asp Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that indicate where support and resistance are likely to occur They are based on Fibonacci numbers Each level is associated with a percentage The percentage is how much of a prior move the price has retraced The Fibonacci retracement levels are 23 6 38 2 61 8 and 78 6 While not officially a Fibonacci ratio 50 is also used Pretty much it assists in predicting theorizing where support and resistance levels could be based on the Fibonacci numbers These levels are amp x200B 100 18 785 78 6 15 298 61 8 12 561 50 10 639 38 2 8 716 23 6 6 338 0 2 493 These prices should be the major support resistance levels moving forward from November 9th 2020 Now go back and look at the chart is it accurate Pretty much every major price movement has tested these levels then bounced or broke through these prices Blue Line The blue line is where the stock took a decent in 2014 and has never come close to returning until now I don t want to flood this post with too much depth on the history of the stock I just want to point out where the stock has been and analyze where it is going This post is about next week s price action Week of June 14th 18th Two Hour Time Scale of recent price movement https preview redd it

notice and near June 8th and the price breaks three levels of resistance Shorts get excited and unload The price falls down to the 50 Fibonacci Retracement and holds support I m excited to see if the long term trend from the 2nd will push the price up to retest 12 56 I suspect that if price retests that level we will excel beyond to a minimum of 20 If the price fails the retest of the 50 we bounced off it twice June 10th at 11 00 and 14 00 expect a dip to 9 79 On June 11th we spent the entire day on this level Which brings the next point Price has been consolidating for two days at the 50 retracement since the price launched to 16 32 and returned after shorting I strongly feel that the price will not fall through the 50 retracement Should it though there is a nice long term support at the 9 79 price Referring back to the Fibonacci chart you will see that the price has only fell through that price once on May 7th in the previous bearish time zone Furthermore look at the RSI The RSI indicates that the price has been hovering at the oversold territory since the descent on Thursday MACD is indicating a crossover is soon The 15 day SMA and 200 day EMA show the price is rising above the retracements and continuing a bullish trend Let s make a list Long term trend BULLISH At strong support and 50 retracement BULLISH Price consolidation for two days Massive move soon RSI Near oversold MACD BULLISH 15 SMA 200 EMA BULLISH Shorts Unloaded 8 2million shares since the 8th 800 000 available Options Everyone was excited for the 6 18 13c because of the open interest being 30k Let s look at Friday s close amp x200B Holy moly https preview redd it 23ofujakur471 jpg width 2715 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s 0fae2712acc2621e839dcd05167955c369385c3e Look at these options Just wow Okay so I fully expect the shorts to use the remaining 800 000 shares Because even if a fraction of the shares on loan are returned these options will instantly be in the money Here is where the star spangled explosion is and finally the will go over the If there is an increase in buy pressure you see where the ramp goes Let me add to the previous list Given that the price seems it will not fall through the 50 retracement it should go up Once the price starts to go up these options will accelerate the price past the 100 level at 18 785 The price will then be in the territory it has not seen in seven years amp 8203 As always do your own TA and DD I would love for someone to poke holes into this TA No price targets The price appears to want to go to the 15 298 78 6 retracement this week If it falls through expect a bounce off 9 79 and consolidate at 50 retracement until shorts cover then definitely 78 6 retracement TL DR So why didn t the go MOO n this week Shorts dumped about 8 2million shares on the run up stopping the previous momentum Shorts don t want the price above 13 see options chain The price needed to retest the 50 retracement to confirm support given the massive run this week CLNE broke three levels of Fibonacci Retracement without retesting any of the lines So what about next week Extremely bullish Gamma or no gamma CLNE is going to looks to hit 20 before July 20th What about that fibonacci stuff Bullish time zone until July 20th Currently at 50 retracement Suspect movement to 78 6 retracement sooner rather than later Options past my TA amp x200B

into an IPO Here are the results ,Let s be real here We all have bought into an IPO that we regretted We might have been swayed by the Red Herring report the marketing pitch or the investment banks roadshow I personally have lost money in both the IPOs that I bought into and now avoid IPOs like the plague However I wanted to keep my personal experience out of the analysis and wanted to understand Whether IPOs in general make or lose money for the average investor Where is the data from iposcoop com This is the first time in any of the analyses that I have done where the data was accessible directly in a usable format They have documented almost all of the IPOs from 2000 I have cross verified the data with Statista https www statista com statistics 270290 number of ipos in the us since 1999 and have observed coverage of more than 90 This period covers a wide variety of situations such as the dot com crash 2008 financial crisis market rally following the crisis etc which implies that our analysis covers both bear and bull market All the IPOs and my analysis have been shared on a Google sheet at the end https preview redd it 8cfa0ni07u471 png width 624 amp format png amp auto webp amp s cc604e1016e7aa4550141751f9904567d7209daf Analysis Before we jump into the analysis there are some things we need to understand about IPOs if you know the inner workings of an IPO please feel free to skip to the results When a company wants to go public they hire investment bankers to sell the shares The investment banks are then responsible for creating interest choosing the optimum time to go public and make sure the price is right so that there is enough demand But the banks offer a large share of the allocated stock to institutional investors such as pensions endowments or hedge funds Retail brokerages can end up getting shares but they may make up only 10 of the total allotment https money usnews com investing investing 101 articles how to buy ipo stock at its offer price Adding to this additional factors such as your brokerage account account balance the historical trading pattern will all contribute to whether you get the IPO shares or not i e Brokerages tend to allocate IPO shares to their premium clients For e g in the case of TD Ameritrade https www tdameritrade com investment products IPOs html your account must have a value of at least 250 000 or have completed 30 trades in the last 3 months I have factored in the above limitations and have calculated the historical performance of the IPOs in two different ways a You get the IPO allocated at the offer price the price at which institutional investors are buying b You buy the IPO when the market opens on the listing day opening price For the above scenarios I have analyzed the following Listing Change Difference between Opening price and Offer price One day change inclusive of listing One day change exclusive of listing To make it simple let s take the example of company X If the offer price of the IPO is 10 the Opening price on the day of the IPO is 12 and the Closing price is 15 then Listing change is 20 One day change inclusive of the listing is 50 One day change exclusive of the listing is 25 Results https preview redd it vby0prh27u471 png width 950 amp format png amp auto webp amp s be6276dde250412988455ba3d78d3b7e37418e24 On average IPOs did make money for the investor But the amount is significantly different if you got allocated the IPO at offer price vs you bought the IPO at market open The average listing change over the last two decades was 12 and the average one day gain in the market inclusive of the listing was 13 6 Adding to this more than 68 of the IPOs ended in green on the listing day But the story is markedly different if you choose to buy at the market open Only 48 of the IPOs ended at a price higher than the opening price and the average change was a mere 1 3 Now that it s out of the way diving deeper into the data brings

amount of gain on listing day Baidu com made a whopping 354 on its listing day Another interesting observation is 6 out of 10 companies in the list were listed in 2000 and were predominantly tech

IPO returns for each year after 2000 As expected the year 2000 was the most successful year for an IPO with an average return inclusive of listing gain of 35 The worst year was 2008 after the financial crisis with only a 2 3 return This graph also showcases two important things a On average the IPOs have made positive returns every year in the last two decades b There is a vast difference in your returns based on if you got the stock at offer price vs opening price and the trend holds across the years This brings us to our final question of which investment bank made the most number of IPOs and how was their performance on listing day https preview redd it dxy9xq597u471 png width 1028 amp format png amp auto webp amp s dc4dbd6096edbb790669325b91cce48759b4f393 Out of the top 10 list only 3 Investment banks had below average returns We are not going to draw any conclusion from this as an IPO is usually handled by multiple banks in partnership and the above analysis is done using Fuzzy match its an approximate match Limitations of the Analysis There are some limitations to the analysis a We don t have 100 coverage for the IPOs done since 2000 From comparing to other sources I could observe more than 90 coverage and I feel that this should be representative of the whole b There is no data showcasing what percentage of each IPO was offered to the retail investor Conclusion I have some theories to explain the IPO performance I think it s driven mainly by two factors One being the hype PR generated by the investment bank about the company and the second is that I think the investment banks slightly price the IPO lower than the market value of the company so that the IPO issue is 100 subscribed their fees are dependent on a successful IPO Both these factors contribute to the listing as well as the one day gain that we see across the board Overall this once again seems to a situation where having money makes you more money institutional investors having easier access to the IPO but as the analysis shows retail investors can still make significant gains by buying into an IPO Google Sheet containing all the data here https docs google com spreadsheets d 1nHsXW7

minutes to complete https www psytoolkit org c 3 3 2 survey s fRtOa https www psytoolkit org c 3 3 2 survey s fRtOa amp x200B Theoretical Background Homo Economicus the economical man is a hypothetical individual who always acts in their own rational self interest This hypothetical individual was first advocated by John Stuart Mill and though it has come under increasing fire in recent years it remains a central pillar of many neoclassical financial theories Thaler 2000 And yet when one reads the discourse surrounding GME Homo Economicus has disappeared To understand the absence of Homo Economicus as far as it is related to GME we must first address the limitations imposed by the human organism on rationality and reason as well as the role that communities have in the construction of knowledge representations and reality itself With that we can then examine the series of events that led to a divergence in the perceptions of what was reasonable rational and logical between the mainstream media and pundits and the WSB community When discussing Homo Economics and the idea of absolute rationality it behoves us to refer to one of its earliest critics Herbert Simon According to Simon there are two main conditions that must be met for a decision to be rational and by extension logical and reasonable The first condition is that the individual has to have options from which to choose and has to be able to evaluate and establish the value of the consequences which stem from any one choice The individual must then be able to rank the consequences and choose the one with is most preferred Simon 1955 The second condition that must be met follows from the first and is that of perfect knowledge For a decision to be truly rational a person must have a complete and total understanding of at the very least all their options and all the ensuing consequences This is impossible for two reasons cognitive limitations of which there are two and an incomplete awareness of one s options Simon 1955 The first limitation stems from our inability to process absorb and comprehend an infinite amount of data even if we were to acquire such knowledge in the first place The second cognitive limitation arises from our biases unconscious or preconscious thoughts and emotions which colour our evaluations of the hypothetical consequences of our decisions CLORE 2011 This is especially true when we receive information which concerns a group we relate to or are a member of Bangerter 1995 While cognitive limitations could in theory be compensated for by algorithms that provide bias and emotion free evaluations the limitations imposed by an incomplete understanding of solutions to a given problem cannot Simply put it is rare that we have every possible option in front of us at the same time in a dynamic organic situation What follows is the conclusion that rationality is limited constrained by our cognition and by the dynamism of human interaction Consequently a rational decision is rarely what turns out to be the absolute best choice in the long run but often the least worst or most acceptable option presented to us at the time the decision is made Further complicating the nature of rationality is that any decision can be defined as rational by both the person or group making the decision and by outside observers witnessing the event Under normal circumstances groups will share the same or similar understandings and representations of an object or concept and consequently largely agree on what constitutes a reasonable and rational course of action If however the groups differ in their understanding and representation of a given object or concept there will be a difference in what one group perceives as a rational and reasonable course of action The differences in rationality perception between groups arises due to the socially constructed nature of knowledge Any information we receive is filtered by our biases and then invariably developed by interaction with group members before being integrated into our cognition Wagner et al 1999 Consequently what enters our cognition is not necessarily an objective fact but rather a representation of the information we have received Given that these representations are developed by social interaction we can see that what is colloquially referred to as reality is a series of cognitive representations upon which all members of a given group agree The concept of bounded rationality can be said then to be influenced by socially constructed knowledge in that our evaluation of our options and consequences are affected by our group membership and the prevailing narrative of our group As such a reasonable and rational course of action is one that provides the most benefit for an individual where benefit is determined by self interest which in turn is influenced by group membership Furthermore given that internal representations of objects and concepts are inextricably linked to the people we socialize with a rational choice must be considered from the perspective of a given individual s social sphere In the investment world this socialization applies to both retail individuals who invest on their own behalf and institutional investors companies or organizations that manage investments on others behalf Both of these groups share three main high level representations to which all analytic research is reduced Buy Hold or Sell Grant 2020 Furthermore due to government regulation against insider trading and collusion more broadly an expert s representation of a stock is public knowledge which in theory allows every member of the investor group access to the same information at the same time Under normal circumstances a retail investor will consult experts who provide them with their representation of a stock The retail investor then either accepts the expert s representation internalizes it and acts upon it or rejects it in favour of a different representation which was generally another mainstream pundit Either way the quantity of shares a retail investor holds is either increased buy representation remains the same hold representation or is reduced sell representation Retail investors typically traded with both informational and temporal disadvantages compared to institutional investors Aramonte amp Avalos 2021 They have also been found to trade more frequently and with greater appetite for risk due to faulty assessment than their institutional counterparts Aramonte amp Avalos 2021 Montier 2002 The lack of coordination imposed by technology a lack of centralization and small uncoordinated trades meant that retail investors were generally incapable of moving markets due to their small uncoordinated trades This led institutional investors to conclude that retail investors were rational and reasonable individuals and therefore representative of the hypothetical Homo Economicus Representational unity was further maintained by the monopoly on information enjoyed by pundits and institutions Given that retail investors traded at a disadvantage they often aped the moves of institutions and since both groups were engaging in similar patterns of behaviour the belief in mutual rationality and reasonability was justified As the internet has matured and social media developed historical limitations and disadvantages have shrunk significantly Retail investors are now capable of accessing stock information from anywhere at almost any time and the formation of retail investor communities some of which have over 10 million members has made it possible for them to communicate on a grand scale Furthermore these communities meant that retail investors no longer derived their representations solely from institutional experts but could also begin to rely on information provided by ingroup members who had positioned themselves as experts So long as the two groups in this case institutional and retail investors experts shared similar representations neither the mainstream nor the special interest retail investment communities saw the other as irrational unreasonable or in violation of established norms That is not to say that there was no hostility between retail and institutional investors The 2008 Subprime Mortgage Crisis and the subsequent recession and government bailouts of Financial Institutions amplified existing divisions between retail and institutional investors and severely damaged consumer confidence in those self same institutions McCarthy 2021 and Bowman 2018 The 2008 financial crisis also caused heavy individual losses for retail investors who generally regarded the government bailouts as unfair The result of these combined factors was the formation of narratives which regarded institutional investors as hostile actors who benefited from unfair rules and regulations Thus the internal representation of Financial Institutions changed from what could be considered indifference to impotent anger and resentment the individual retail investor may have wanted to punish the institutional investor but they lacked the ability to do so Financial Institutions were simply too robust to be brought down by the decentralized movements of the time The slow formation of retail investor communities the rise of retail experts a clear leadership structure in the form of community moderators which could facilitate a rapid shift in representation among the rank and file members of the community Satherley et al 2018 and a central narrative to allow the formation of targeted movements Davis 2002 Chapter 1 laid the foundation for unprecedented retail investor driven market volatility The only missing component was a suitable target In Late 2020 retail investors realized that a hedge fund had shorted massive quantities of GME leaving them exposed to a sudden rise in the stock price A suitable target had been found This prompted the transformation of long simmering resentment into directed action Driven by a fundamental change in the community s representation of GME the WSB community purchased vast quantities of the stock driving up the price to a peak of over 500 USD up from a December 1st price of 15 80 USD triggering billions of dollars in losses for Hedge Funds and driving some into insolvency due to the subsequent short squeeze Members of the WSB community have continued to hold onto GME in anticipation of an even larger short squeeze amp x200B Methodology To facilitate narrative analysis I analyzed GME Megathreads between January 22nd to February 4th Each Megathread was a place for discussion solely about GME and over the course of those 14 days of which 4 were weekends and therefore no trading was taking place 7 days had dedicated Megathreads with each day averaging 2 megathreads for a total of 14 Reddit imposes a comment limit of 100 thousand comments per thread given that there were days with overflow we can assume that there were somewhere between 750 Thousand to about 1 Million Comments made on these threads alone For that reason it was decided that the megathreads alone would be adequate to analyze the narrative Additionally the most popular memes relating to GME were extracted and analyzed to provide a point of comparison To facilitate a search through the threads they were sorted by both Top and by Controversial to gauge both mainstream community narratives and the more controversial deviant narratives 224 Comments and 10 memes were selected due to their roles as exemplars of the broader conversation within the WSB Community Reddit is a public forum which requires users to take on screen names which preserves anonymity and as a public forum consent is not needed before posts are analyzed As such it was not necessary to secure consent or perform any additional checks as they relate to ethical or legal obligations That being said screen names have been redacted to comply with the broader culture of the community that was being analyzed Coding Structure Each post was coded along 7 criteria Sentiment Content Function Group Movement expression Conformative Buy In Persecution Expression of a Hostile Narrative towards institutional investors see Appendix Table 1 Sentiment was subdivided into one of three categories Bullish Neutral or Bearish Posts were coded as Bullish if it suggested positive sentiment either explicitly or via in group iconography such as rockets moons or expressions of the same Neutral if they expressed no strong opinion either way and Bearish if the post expressed a lack of faith or negative opinion See Appendix Coding 1 3 Content was subdivided into two subcodes Serious or Humorous Given the online environment and nature of the community a content code was deemed more effective than tone because even serious posts rarely had a serious tone See Appendix Coding 2 and 3 Function was subdivided into four subcodes Hype Inform Warn Caution Solidarity Hype posts were those that sought to promote the purchase of GME and encourage group members to buy more or posts which were exuberant and expressed extreme confidence in the rising price of GME Inform is coded to those posts which sought to convey information to the community about the stock the market or relevant political or social developments Warn Caution posts existed to warn group members about some danger risk or potential situation or urged caution vis a vis expectations and timelines Solidarity was coded to posts which expressed sympathy for or empathy towards group members who either bought stock on a daily high and were therefore left behind or towards the personal situations of group members It should be noted that posts could belong to one some or all of these categories See Appendix Coding 4 6 Group Movement Expression refers to posts which either used the first person plural we as opposed to the singular I as is common in retail investment posts or posts which used in group iconography such as ape emojis or expressions of the same such as Ape Together Strong Posts which explicitly referred to the idea of a movement were obviously coded as such See Appendix Coding 6 Conformative Buy In refers to posts which expressed an initial reluctance to purchase stock but that the individual purchased it due to group pressure or those posts which expressed that an individual was only buying because everyone else was This also includes variants of posts with the text stating that the original poster would purchase stock if they got a certain number of upvotes See Appendix Coding 7 Persecution posts were coded as those which referenced explicitly or conspiratorially activities which the original poster deemed to be unfair or hostile towards retail investors as a whole or the WallStreetBets community in particular See Appendix Coding 5 Hostile Narrative posts contain either overt hostility towards financial institutions reference the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis or express a desire to take revenge on or punish financial institutions or institutional investors See Appendix Coding 7 amp x200B Results amp x200B Sentiment Of the 224 posts 143 expressed Bullish sentiment 75 either an unclear or neutral sentiment and 6 expressed a Bearish sentiment It should be noted that the neutral posts also included those in which the author never explicitly indicated their position either in text or via symbolism rockets moons apes bananas Given that it is likely that the number would change in the favour of Bullish Sentiment given that many of the Neutral posts were conveying information Additionally Bearish Sentiment was found on 01 02 and was posted by people who had bought the stock at peaks and were therefore poised to lose money and on 04 02 when the price had collapsed to 53 50 USD Content With regards to content 180 posts contained serious messages while 44 were purely jokes with the ratio of serious to jokes remaining relatively stable at 85 15 Exceptions were noted on the 26 01 and 04 02 which both saw almost one third of posts being purely humorous It should be noted however that the tone was vastly different with the jokes on the 26th being considerably more upbeat while those on the 4th consisted of much darker gallows humour amp x200B Functionality Functionality was a more difficult category to code due to the potential of a post to have multiple intentions Often the Inform code occurred alongside Hype r InformXHype 63 p 0 066 or Warn Caution r InformXWarn Caution 0 955 p lt 0 01 Furthermore there were posts which were simple statements and thus did not have a suitable code and were for that reason excluded The most common code was Hype posts with 44 of all posts expressing confidence excitement or urging others to purchase stock Inform was the second most common accounting for 36 of all posts while Warn Caution and Solidarity accounted for 21 and 18 respectively Hype and Inform were the first and second most common respectively on all days except the 28th and the 4th On the 28th there were issues with trading apps restricting the purchase of GME which resulted in a massive spike in the number of posts containing some group relevant information 74 of total posts This day also saw a significant increase in the number of posts containing sentiments expressing unfairness of persecution 47 compared to the megathread average of 22 On the 4th the dominant expression was solidarity accounting for 44 of the posts These posts while coded as solidarity were different from the previous days because they were not expressing solidarity with so called Astronauts people who bought at peaks and were left behind but can instead be best described as community members commiserating with one another and lamenting the collapse of the stock price Furthermore the number of posts both in absolute terms and as a proportion of the selected posts rose as time progressed rising from a nadir of 10 on January 26th to a peak of 44 on February 4th Posts coded with Warn Caution fluctuated in frequency over the course of the seven analyzed Megathreads but could generally be categorized as either warning community members not to sell their stock generally combined with exhortations to hold or cautioning community members against getting their hopes up and urging them to be patient It is worth noting that there is a moderate correlation albeit with a p value above threshold though that may be due to the limited number of megathreads analyzed between Warn Caution codes and posts indicating Persecution r Warn CautionXPersecution 0 54 p 0 105 amp x200B Group Movement Membership Posts containing references either explicitly or implicitly by using the plural forms of language to the concept of membership in a movement could be found in 67 of all posts and was included in more than 50 of posts on all analyzed megathreads except for 04 02 but even on that day such posts were included in 44 of the analyzed posts Group Movement membership containing posts correlated most strongly with Hype r 0 96 p lt 0 01 and warn r 0 76 p 0 024 Group Movement Membership also showed a statistically significant correlation with posts coded to Inform r 0 69 p 0 042 amp x200B Conformative Buy In Post expressing Conformative Buy In accounted for 17 of posts in total but reached their peak on the January 26th megathread at 26 before dropping off as time went one It should be noted that of the 5 posts referring to Conformative Buy In on the 1st of February 3 were individuals expressing panic buying which is different from the Fuck it I m in attitude expressed in the first 3 megathreads Conformative Buy In CBI correlated most strongly with posts which also expressed Group Movement Membership r 88 p 0 010 and those posts which also expressed a hostile narrative or invoked the spectre of the 2008 financial crisis r 93 p lt 0 001 Conformative buy in was often expressed in one of three forms People who were asking questions in the megathread and being convinced by the broader community people who purchased stock due to the prevalence of GME related conversations and people who explicitly expressed a desire to punish or get revenge upon financial institutions and for whom GME was the vehicle which facilitated the aforementioned desire Individual categories of CBI will be analyzed in detail in the discussion amp x200B Persecution Posts referencing the unfairness of the financial system accounted for 22 of all analyzed posts Though initially relatively rare averaging 16 in the first 3 megathreads the instance of references towards Persecution or Unfairness skyrocketed to 47 the day trading apps restricted the purchase of GME and remained elevated averaging 26 from the 29th until the 4th Interestingly there is no correlation between posts referencing persecution and expressing a hostile narrative The only code to which Persecution correlates is the Inform code r 0 65 p 0 056 and as mentioned above there is a tendential correlation to the warn code r 0 54 p 0 105 This does reflect the different the two main categories of unfairness towards retail investors Misinformation spread via bots and Market Manipulation due to restrictions on retail investor trading amp x200B Hostile Narrative Posts expressing hostility towards Financial Institutions Institutional Investors Government or expressing a desire for vengeance or punishment accounted for 28 of posts Post expressing a hostile narrative were most frequent in the first week accounting for 30 of all posts until the 28th at which point they dropped off to an average of 19 over the subsequent three megathreads Hostile Narrative posts correlated strongly not only with CBI but also with Group Movement membership r 0 76 p 0 755 and Hype r 0 82 p 0 012 Expression of this hostile narrative can be subdivided into generalized anger at the perceived unfairness of the financial system or directly referenced the 2008 Financial crisis Invocations of the 2008 financial crisis were less common but tended to receive more upvotes attention and responses than more generalized expressions of anger

they ve got to keep it from happening because they borrowed every share they could find and probably some they didn t even have to drop it Thursday and Friday 9 days ago when I wrote that DD the magic number was 13 by 18 6 2021 because there were over 1 8 million shares that were going to become ITM if CLNE got there The 13 price is still the magic number but it s gotten so so much worse for them

volume when this guy usually only trades like 7 mil as they tried to sell every share they had to exhaust the buyers and we saw the beginnings of some covering The price got up to almost 15 in after hours trading that day and then the next day we had the revenge of the Sith What did they do First thing they did was release a stupid media report about Total selling a bunch of shares like it was new news when Total had been selling shares to pay for their part of a new refinery for over a month and it was month old news being recycled then they borrowed shrt every stock they could get their hands on and if it s anything like the movie biz some they didn t Check this out Processing img bpuqyek8ru471 There went from 9 million shares available to borrow to only 300 000 as the roaches attacked the stock price because they re hosed We knew they were going to fight like rabid roos to keep it under 13 and that s absolutely what s happening And maybe it s a Reynolds Wrap hat I m wearing or maybe it s real but I couldn t help but notice that when CLNE started flying all of a sudden a bunch of new accounts started talking up these new stocks nobody had ever heard mentioned here before every day in force with them coming out of nowhere and dominating the daily chatter only to fade 24 hours later 9 days ago my DD was really talking about more of a moonshot 50 in 2 weeks Seemed impossible Then we did it in 3 days Now we only need about 10 in a week and hold it till Friday to kick them whilst they re down take their lunch money and spit in their faces Personally I want to put a loogie right in Ken s eyehole The best part Even if they somehow find a way to win we still win because it s still just a good long term hold company that analysts agree should double in price in the next year Barron wrote a favourable article about it Even the CNBC guys jumped in with Dr J buying on Wednesday during a show and everybody s favourite 6 pm EST sideshow who had been talking trash about the company for weeks devoting the last few minutes of his show to talking about how he was wrong and it was a turnaround play for the ages that is going to start printing money because RNG is the future of transport Not only is it readily available right now but it s cleaner than even green hydrogen or electric That bloke almost never admits he was wrong about something Even though the calls are no longer a penny like they were 9 days ago they re still only about 30 cents right now with a potential to be worth 4 or 5 dollars How many 10 baggers do you see just waiting to be grabbed right now But they ve shown they re going to fight us for it so people have to BUY SHARES AS WELL AS OPTIONS The shares are the key If you look at the last couple of days share volume plummeted but option volume spiked And the price went down Gotta keep grabbing those shares to make the other side of the trade pay Positions aren t new Same 10 000 shares I did a YOLO on earlier this week though with a different entry price as I ve danced in and out of this one during the week and some calls that don t even involve Friday I just want to see it happen to screw the big money over I ve got a

,I wanted to post this in case anyone is researching the Moomoo app later before they consider opening a brokerage account on it and depositing money Hopefully this will come up on a search and they ll be able to read about my experience because not much comes up searching this app now It s very frustrating to open a brokerage account and deposit money only to discover the app does not provide the services it advertises and claims to do It turns into a mistake that takes almost one month to correct and get out of and get your money back You re looking at 5 business days for an ACH deposit to clear If you want to withdraw that deposit has to sit in the account another 5 business days plus a 3 day settlement time if you bought and sold stocks Another 5 business days for the ACH withdrawal to clear and hit your bank account And finally another 5 business days to deposit the funds and clear into a new brokerage account Tldr here s an imgur link to screenshots http imgur com a 8lXp2ti of the customer service chat and my options Level 1 Orders do not execute properly explained below Notifications for orders don t always work even though the slightest move for anything in your watch list sends multiple notifications 2 They have no phone number available for customer service Only chat or email with very inexperienced reps and takes a while to get a response on Update on this I actually talked to someone at Finra and found out brokerage firms are not required to have working phone number available for clients or customer service which is frankly ridiculous IMO Someone told me RH doesn t have a phone either but I don t trade with them for other reasons so can t confirm that If the internet or app or whatever goes down or you have a problem difficult to explain via chat email you re just stuck Can t call anyone or access your account in any way 3 Can t trade options even though they advertise you can and my account was set to Level 4 for options trading explained more below Customer service literally told me their system does not support covered calls They claim to only support long calls or puts but I never could place those trades either Definitely can t trade any advanced strategy either spreads strangles etc and I had nothing on margin even though I don t think that should matter for those trades 4 No desktop option or interface 5 Their PDT system doesn t appear to work correctly never counts or recognized day trades but that may be a plus for some folks The Moomoo app is part of Futu which is appears to be an established reputable and successful large company I recently signed up for an account because I really like their UI and the way it s easy to navigate through the stock data especially the options chains and you can change the name of the stock shown in the watch list where I add my basis which is very handy when selling covered calls and that basis is constantly changing So as far as using the app for a watch list that s the only thing I recommend and will continue to do 1 Orders do not execute properly I purchased XX shares of AMC a few weeks ago I set a stop limit order on Friday May 28 and have modified it several times to increase the stop and limit prices The last time I changed it was around closing on Wednesday June 2 when I increased the stop to 55 50 and limit to 55 Luckily I checked it around 6pm the same day and I saw the order executed at 5 39pm for 65 36 I did Not get a notification for the trade I checked the charts on Moomoo Schwab desktop program Fidelity and by tick on Webull and never see it drop anywhere close to 55 50 I bought back soon after I so I still have my position But the point is it shouldn t have executed Screenshots on imgur link Please note the time stamps in those are CDT times and the times I reference here are EDT a First I ve had accounts with several brokers and have never seen stops trigger after hours In fact the order instructions on all of those other brokerages stated their stop loss and stop limit orders would not apply to or be placed during after hours I could be wrong on that if anyone has experience otherwise please let me know That s actually a feature that I wish was offered b When I talked to customer service they didn t even understand what a stop limit was First the rep told me I placed two separate orders Then they told me the stop price of 55 50 was hit at 2 11 pm and the order didn t execute until 5 39pm because I had to wait in line behind all of the other orders that were placed before mine On AMC when the volume that day was through the roof over 760 million Obviously I wouldn t definitely shouldn t have had to wait hours for a limit sell order under the market price to fill Plus the stop wasn t set to 55 50 at 2 11pm it was at 50 50 And I didn t change it to 55 50 until right before 4 00pm c I waited hours to speak to a supervisor and never did but finally got an email from someone after 3pm the next day The email included a screenshot of the order book that supposedly shows a sell of 506 shares for 54 54 at 17 39 16 i Note the previous transaction was for 65 36 The 54 54 transaction is red with a down arrow as is the following transaction for 65 35 even though that s an increase from 54 54 ii Also note while my sell order filled at 65 36 at 17 39 17 verified in his email and my trade confirmation there is no transaction for that amount at that time The last trade for 65 36 was at 17 39 15 So did my more execute before the supposed 54 54 transaction or did it execute for 65 38 2 cents more but I only received 65 36 iii This transaction is marked with a U while every other one is marked with an I I m not sure of the meaning or significance of this letter code If anyone knows I d appreciate the insight d Like I mentioned notifications for order execution don t always work even though the slightest move for anything in your watch list sends multiple notifications Get bombarded by those and don t have many options to limit them to the ones you really do want to see 2 You can only speak to them through chat or email and they refuse to give a phone number And they give different customer service email addresses Some fututrade com and others at moomoo com 3 Can t trade options even though they advertise you can I wasn t aware of any broker that does not allow covered calls Customer service told me I could trade long calls and long puts but the app would never allow the order to to be placed always giving me an error Update After I originally posted this I looked at my account and saw that Moomoo had my Options Level set to Level 4 Yes that s a 4 not a 3 I ve never had an account above a 3 and honestly didn t know what Level 4 was or that it existed According to their definitions Level 4 has all the permissions trading ability as Level 3 plus it allows selling uncovered calls and naked puts Here it is copied straight from the site Your option level Level 4 Buying calls Buying puts Combinations Coming Soon Selling uncovered puts Selling uncovered calls Of course the last two on the list are trades I would never make selling naked calls or puts as those have got to be arguably the riskiest types of trades But I tried to put in an order anyway to test it for a very cheap option on a very cheap stock and of course it didn t work And I still can t even sell covered calls or buy calls or puts Go figure 4 No desktop option or interface Self explanatory 5 PDT not entirely confirmed but on the plus side for some people maybe their PDT count system doesn t appear work either The system always showed me with 3 3 3 3 3 even after one instance where I sold bought sold bought sold bought the same stock in one day a I monitored this for several days ago and the counts never changed Not sure if maybe that s because a couple of those trades were executed in extended hours I need to learn how the PDT requirements apply to trades executed pre and post market hours Still the bought sold bought was during normal hours The first sell was pre and the last sell and buy were after hours But all on the same day it should ve at least has one marked off and gone to 2 3 3 3 3 b I still never made 4 day trades in 5 days out of fear that it would start working or was working and their system was incorrectly reporting the count in the app That s the gist of it Sorry for the long post but I hope this helps someone in the future Happy to answer any questions or hear any explanations as to whether there are legitimate reasons for why I encountered some of these issues

1580,nyff07,t2_nk63ciy,1623529013,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nyff07/my_experience_with_moomoo_appbrokerage_firm_and/,1,My experience with Moomoo app brokerage firm and why I wouldn t use it and left ,I wanted to post this in case anyone is researching the Moomoo app later before they consider opening a brokerage account on it and depositing money Hopefully this will come up on a search and they ll be able to read about my experience because not much comes up searching this app now It s very frustrating to open a brokerage account and deposit money only to discover the app does not provide the services it advertises and claims to do It turns into a mistake that takes almost one month to correct and get out of and get your money back You re looking at 5 business days for an ACH deposit to clear If you want to withdraw that deposit has to sit in the account another 5 business days plus a 3 day settlement time if you bought and sold stocks Another 5 business days for the ACH withdrawal to clear and hit your bank account And finally another 5 business days to deposit the funds and clear into a new brokerage account Tldr there s an imgur link in the comments to screenshots of the customer service chat and my options Level 1 Orders do not execute properly explained below Notifications for orders don t always work even though the slightest move for anything in your watch list sends multiple notifications 2 They have no phone number available for customer service Only chat or email with very inexperienced reps and takes a while to get a response on Update on this I actually talked to someone at Finra and found out brokerage firms are not required to have working phone number available for clients or customer service which is frankly ridiculous IMO Someone told me RH doesn t have a phone either but I don t trade with them for other reasons so can t confirm that If the internet or app or whatever goes down or you have a problem difficult to explain via chat email you re just stuck Can t call anyone or access your account in any way 3 Can t trade options even though they advertise you can and my account was set to Level 4 for options trading explained more below Customer service literally told me their system does not support covered calls They claim to only support long calls or puts but I never could place those trades either Definitely can t trade any advanced strategy either spreads strangles etc and I had nothing on margin even though I don t think that should matter for those trades 4 No desktop option or interface 5 Their PDT system doesn t appear to work correctly never counts or recognized day trades but that may be a plus for some folks The Moomoo app is part of Futu which is appears to be an established reputable and successful large company I recently signed up for an account because I really like their UI and the way it s easy to navigate through the stock data especially the options chains and you can change the name of the stock shown in the watch list where I add my basis which is very handy when selling covered calls and that basis is constantly changing So as far as using the app for a watch list that s the only thing I recommend and will continue to do 1 Orders do not execute properly I purchased XX shares of AMC a few weeks ago I set a stop limit order on Friday May 28 and have modified it several times to increase the stop and limit prices The last time I changed it was around closing on Wednesday June 2 when I increased the stop to 55 50 and limit to 55 Luckily I checked it around 6pm the same day and I saw the order executed at 5 39pm for 65 36 I did Not get a notification for the trade I checked the charts on Moomoo Schwab desktop program Fidelity and by tick on Webull and never see it drop anywhere close to 55 50 I bought back soon after I so I still have my position But the point is it shouldn t have executed Screenshots on imgur link Please note the time stamps in those are CDT times and the times I reference here are EDT a First I ve had accounts with several brokers and have never seen stops trigger after hours In fact the order instructions on all of those other brokerages stated their stop loss and stop limit orders would not apply to or be placed during after hours I could be wrong on that if anyone has experience otherwise please let me know That s actually a feature that I wish was offered b When I talked to customer service they didn t even understand what a stop limit was First the rep told me I placed two separate orders Then they told me the stop price of 55 50 was hit at 2 11 pm and the order didn t execute until 5 39pm because I had to wait in line behind all of the other orders that were placed before mine On AMC when the volume that day was through the roof over 760 million Obviously I wouldn t definitely shouldn t have had to wait hours for a limit sell order under the market price to fill Plus the stop wasn t set to 55 50 at 2 11pm it was at 50 50 And I didn t change it to 55 50 until right before 4 00pm c I waited hours to speak to a supervisor and never did but finally got an email from someone after 3pm the next day The email included a screenshot of the order book that supposedly shows a sell of 506 shares for 54 54 at 17 39 16 i Note the previous transaction was for 65 36 The 54 54 transaction is red with a down arrow as is the following transaction for 65 35 even though that s an increase from 54 54 ii Also note while my sell order filled at 65 36 at 17 39 17 verified in his email and my trade confirmation there is no transaction for that amount at that time The last trade for 65 36 was at 17 39 15 So did my more execute before the supposed 54 54 transaction or did it execute for 65 38 2 cents more but I only received 65 36 iii This transaction is marked with a U while every other one is marked with an I I m not sure of the meaning or significance of this letter code If anyone knows I d appreciate the insight d Like I mentioned notifications for order execution don t always work even though the slightest move for anything in your watch list sends multiple notifications Get bombarded by those and don t have many options to limit them to the ones you really do want to see 2 You can only speak to them through chat or email and they refuse to give a phone number And they give different customer service email addresses 3 Can t trade options even though they advertise you can I wasn t aware of any broker that does not allow covered calls Customer service told me I could trade long calls and long puts but the app would never allow the order to to be placed always giving me an error Update After I originally posted this I looked at my account and saw that Moomoo had my Options Level set to Level 4 Yes that s a 4 not a 3 I ve never had an account above a 3 and honestly didn t know what Level 4 was or that it existed According to their definitions Level 4 has all the permissions trading ability as Level 3 plus it allows selling uncovered calls and naked puts Here it is copied straight from the site Your option level Level 4 Buying calls Buying puts Combinations Coming Soon Selling uncovered puts Selling uncovered calls Of course the last two on the list are trades I would never make selling naked calls or puts as those have got to be arguably the riskiest types of trades But I tried to put in an order anyway to test it for a very cheap option on a very cheap stock and of course it didn t work And I still can t even sell covered calls or buy calls or puts Go figure 4 No desktop option or interface Self explanatory 5 PDT not entirely confirmed but on the plus side for some people maybe their PDT count system doesn t appear work either The system always showed me with 3 3 3 3 3 even after one instance where I sold bought sold bought sold bought the same stock in one day a I monitored this for several days ago and the counts never changed Not sure if maybe that s because a couple of those trades were executed in extended hours I need to learn how the PDT requirements apply to trades executed pre and post market hours Still the bought sold bought was during normal hours The first sell was pre and the last sell and buy were after hours But all on the same day it should ve at least has one marked off and gone to 2 3 3 3 3 b I still never made 4 day trades in 5 days out of fear that it would start working or was working and their system was incorrectly reporting the count in the app That s the gist of it Sorry for the long post but I hope this helps someone in the future Happy to answer any questions or hear any explanations as to whether there are legitimate reasons for why I encountered some of these issues

and the sales efforts require considerable time and expense This is due to investing into sales to large organizations that typically undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage size organization structure and approval requirements A limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of C3 s revenue The top three entities together accounted for 34 and 44 of the revenue for years ended April 30 2019 and 2020 respectively The same entities have been with C3 for an average of 3 3 years CONCLUSION Given the success of C3 s customers I feel it will increase penetration of their existing customer base They are primed to expand the major account sales organization to focus on large enterprise software agreements Additionally C3 will continue to develop high volume distribution channels to address the needs of small and medium businesses I think they will continue to bring new product families to market that will develop into substantial recurring revenue streams The total addressable market is rapidly growing and estimated to grow to 271B in 2024 a 12 CAGR from 2020 s estimate of 174B This is a big opportunity for C3 The lock up period ended on June 7 2021 https www nasdaq com market activity ipos overview dealId 907559 94759 and earnings happened on June 2 2021 I believe everyone who wanted to sell has sold at this point I am bullish and think C3 has great potential for a swing trade but more so a long term investment I am not a financial advisor Do your own DD Current position 515 shares 59 87

received a lot of media attention so I m posting an update Allow me to summarize 1 Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones 2 We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles EV The people want it the government wants it and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen 3 The government wants zero emissions Workhorse trucks are already zero emission Gas and diesel powered trucks are not These petroleum based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up 4 Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies 5 Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks see pictures The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there s no going back Zero emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure Think about it Walmart Fed Ex Amazon UPS Postal Services Supermarkets for food delivery etc 6 350 000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times This number is projected to increase 7 Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management who has been very popular lately google her had purchased a few million shares for her fund She has since sold This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted more on that below Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52 week highs a few weeks ago Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting It s a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them I m not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn t find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless 8 In April Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks That s 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars That s an enormous number of trucks and that s only from one wholesaler 9 Workhorse s main problems are with manufacturing and delivery The reasons why 1 They re limited in part due to supply chain constraints There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components This has impacted the entire industry including Ford and GM This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales In addition Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions Inc to supply their batteries This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world 2 Electric trucks are a relatively new industry Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse s capacity to meet this demand has been limited Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve they teamed up with someone who can They re now partnered with J B Poindexter amp Co a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering construction and assembly 10 There are several EV players Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles 11 Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately 521 000 compared to approximately 84 000 in the first quarter of 2020 That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly 12 Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE which Workhorse was invested in 13 The Company had approximately 205 1 million in cash in March 2021 This helps limit the need to acquire debt 14 The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a 6 billion contract with the USPS last February It s now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company This one time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies Furthermore Workhorse may still win this 6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front In addition the USPS Postmaster Louis DeJoy who influences the direction of the contract is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it s assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr DeJoy s decision of granting it to Workhorse s competitor If this contract once again becomes up for grabs there s a good chance Workhorse will win it If that happens watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock Forget the moon I m talking about GN z11 the furthest galaxy from us 15 Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you re seeing This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in 16 There are 8 analysts who have recently ranked WKHS Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy NONE recommend a sell It s unanimous NONE recommend selling Some of the analysts recommend price targets are even 24 20 20 and 17 Cowen amp Co Colliers Securities Oppenheimer Roth Capital R F Lafferty BTIG B Riley Financial and Wolfe Research 17 You re helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future 18 The stock price is about 30 of its 52 week high 19 This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL It s shorted about 40 of its float It is one of the most if not THE MOST shorted stock out there It s very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can t expect it to happen overnight It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you especially now The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens They re accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day They ve learned to process this emotion and not act upon it However they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear They re counting on you selling out of fear the bottom and buying out of greed the top If you wait them out they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares Also the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises So how to deal with fear 1 Accept and expect fear to happen because it will Anticipate it and do not act upon it 2 Do not invest money that you can t afford to lose This way you can let it ride 3 Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC AMC was shorted about 20 on its float it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC Also understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are They don t make their money from making good stock picks They make their money from taking a cut of the money they re investing for other people They make up fancy words algorithms and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can t even beat the Dow Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things Look it up if you don t believe it TLDR 1 WKHS is prime for a short squeeze It is one of the most if not the most shorted stock out there 2 WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced Out of 8 research analysts who follow it all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell Price targets for several were at or above 20 3 Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed 4 Demand for their products has skyrocketed 5 Don t be lazy don t TLDR this one ready the whole thing I am not a financial analyst I am a physician with a love of finance I do not give financial advice This is for educational purposes only and I may very well be completely wrong You can lose all of your money on this stock or any stock for that matter You must do your own homework and research before buying any stock I personally love this stock

greenhouse gas emissions and related risks With this being put into play and the goal of net zero emissions goal by 2050 as well as cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 Antero is in a very good position It is my belief that with AR planning on being net zero by 2025 and being positioned geographically where they are in the U S they will somehow benefit from the Infrastructure Plan if when it goes through According to Forbes prior to the pandemic the economic boom that kicked off in SE Ohio at the Utica Shale around 2011 resulted in 86B in new capital investments and created over 200 000
