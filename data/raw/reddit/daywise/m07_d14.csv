recession it could be really bad To fix recessions the fed usually lowers interest rates which is like turning the economy off and on again It works most of the time The grey bars in this picture are recessions Notice how about halfway through each recession the interest rates decrease and the recession shortly ends Interest rates are already incredibly low so this may not be an option for the

stop Evidence based medicine three words that stringed together have become a sacred concept in modern medicine As a physician evidence based medicine dictates nearly every aspect of my practice As a field the medications we prescribe and the procedures we perform are largely guided by the results of large scale multicenter randomized controlled and super expensive trials In my field of cardiology for example we have literally spent hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars trying to determine which particular blood thinner may have a razor thin advantage over another type for different types of patient My colleagues and I strive to use evidence based practices behind every aspect of our work and try to bring the same practical approach to our lives That is with exception to one key category investing My brightest and most knowledgeable friends including those who have spent years researching the market invest nearly their entire earnings not based on evidence but based on faith That is they KNOW what they re investing in especially at the prices they re investing at cannot be justified by any quasi objective evaluation of the underlying asset They re not buying shares of Doordash or Nio because they expect the company to eventually be pay back their current investment let alone pay it back with an interest They re buying shares based on the FAITH that down the line somebody else will take those shares off their hands for a higher price again based on the faith that they too can find another buyer to do the same My friends are by no means alone at a time where evidence based practices and science have such a stronghold on most aspects of our lives our entire society has adopted faith based investing as a form of financial religion Put aside nerdy physicians and the degenerates of WSB for a minute and look at retail investors as a whole Think of your average investor who knows a thing or two about investing one of the two things likely being time in the market beats timing the market How do they pick a stock Does anybody that you know invest in the market the way investments were intended to work That is buy a share of a business for a share of their potential profit Fewer and fewer of the biggest companies in the market have a path to profitability let alone current profits to share Even the ones that do make relatively little profit compared to their evaluation and often have little to no dividend program for their faithful investors I asked a close friend of mine this one a software engineer why he put a year s worth of his salary in Tesla I love the company their cars are amazing was the gist of his response He likes the stock I agreed with him Tesla is truly an amazing company with great products and has taken a considerable chunk of the auto market Hell it s even profitable it s P E ratio is now only 673 All it has to do is take every single penny of its earnings for 673 years and pay back its investors in dividends until they get their money back That is if you don t account for inflation If you assume an inflation rate gt 0 2 annually then at their current earnings you ll never get your money back Yes I know future earnings are what matter Assume Tesla continues to grow at an exponential rate and soon increases their net profitability by a factor of 10 all the meanwhile their stock price magically remains steady Even at 10 times their earnings and a P E ratio of 67 accounting for real world inflation of gt 2 annually the investor will never get their investment back Another friend loves Doordash Of course this one is a bit cheaper than Tesla the market cap is a bit shy of 60 billion dollars right now This friend is a savvy businessman he agrees with the public stance of the Doordash executives their path to profitability their only real path to sustained profitability is self driving cars that can pick up and drop off your food something that may be on its way in the next 20 years Until then the company can continue to burn cash for as long as it has any cash to burn Until then the investor can feel assured that their investment is safe just as long as there is another investor who shares their faith in the company Until then the fair value for Doordash can be assessed at anywhere between 60 billion dollars to maybe 600 billion dollars If you can justify a 60 billion dollar market cap based on no path to profitability and paying the investors back you sure as hell can justify 600 billion dollars This is the world of faith based investing we live in It s not a Ponzi or a pyramid scheme instead it s a voluntary transparent bubble we re all participating in We don t leave cash in the bank or invest in low yield bonds for little to no interest at least not when the inflation is so high We also take advantage of low interest rates and high inflation by maxing out every dollar of cheap loans we can get our greedy little hands on all to save the cash that could go towards paying off our debts to instead put it in the market We put our unpaid debts retirement savings and our children s college funds in the market Everyday more and more of us know that the market evaluations are ridiculous and that the companies will never be able to pay back the investors Yet it doesn t matter as long as we keep faith Not faith in a technological miracle that improves productivity of these companies we pour our life savings into by two orders of magnitude but instead faith that the next investor we sell our hollow investments to makes the same stupid mistake that we make today

Thailand Please see below my thoughts on the rather niche meme stock Bed Bath amp Beyond which trades on the Nasdaq as BBBY Preface I ll admit it I was initially drawn to this stock by nostalgia I remember roaming these wide fluorescent aisles as a wonderstruck child holding my mother s hand and nibbling on a Pokemon card I remember the smells of the exotic lotions and the textures of the plush towels It was pure opulence But wankery and nostalgia aside it is my not so humble opinion that there are many many reasons why this stock is a compelling gamble The Growth Story Delicious https

efficiency waste recycling and sustainable and responsible sourcing throughout their supply chain They are also investing in diversity equity and inclusion in the workplace This is coming from the top down because 7 out of 13 board directors are women and 5 out of 8 C Suite execs are women and or BIPOC ESG investors lap this kinda shit up Also a McKinsey study found that businesses who outperformed industry peers on racial and ethnic diversity were also statistically likely to outperform financially The recent boom in impact investing combined with social pressures on institutional investors has definitely boosted demand for ESG oriented stocks BBBY is well positioned to benefit from this trend Financials Positive growing EBITDA Extremely healthy cash position of 1 35 Billion Long term debt of 1 19B is lower Free cash flow and operating cash flow are positive and trending upwards Very bullish Net income has been negative in recent years but was finally positive in the trailing twelve months As a result net income margin and operating margin are still relatively low although positive Current ratio of 1 56 is very healthy Management is confident enough to regularly buy back shares They clearly care about their shareholders They used to pay a dividend before COVID as well but it is not clear if when this will be reinstated Potential Catalysts A huge catalyst this summer is college shopping as in person attendance picks up Thanks to COVID essentially 2 years worth of students will be moving out from their parents place and into college for the first time The turnaround may be a 3 year plan but investors will continue to reward the stock as long as management keeps meeting milestones All in all keep an eye out for FY21Q2 earnings in a couple months Could see a major move upward I plan to build out my position by then If inflation is indeed not transitory and we are headed for a market downturn people are still going to buy pillows and blankets and shit Consumer cyclical stocks are good during inflation The Bear Case Unlike certain bag holders on this sub cough cough CLOV CLNE WISH cough cough I can admit that this is definitely a gamble This is not a sure thing Upside could be limited because big money investors are starting to be bullish on the turnaround too And of course the turnaround may fall flat Amazon exists Retail e commerce is a dog fuck dog world and Amazon is bigass dog in a smalls doggy day care Revenue is on a long term downtrend and management is yet to demonstrate that they can surpass the performance from the brick and mortar glory

past 10 years and benchmarked it against S amp P 500 Here are the results , Preamble Every year Fortune publishes the top 100 companies to work for in the world The results are based on an anonymous survey conducted on over half a million employees I wanted to check whether companies where people are the happiest to work produced better returns for their shareholders when compared to the market My hypothesis is based on two assumptions a An employee would create his her best possible output when they truly love the place they work b Companies with excellent culture would create a feedback loop to attract top talent by word of mouth and referrals I feel that both of these factors would contribute to the company innovating over their competitors and creating outsized investor returns Data There are a lot of players that create the best companies to work for list I chose Fortune as they are the most established company and have been doing this over the past 20 years Their survey sample size is also very high more than 5 00 000 anonymous responders which would give us a fair representation and minimize the chances of false positives For this analysis I took companies present in the best places to work for list in the last 10 years 2012 2021 But not all the companies on the list are public and listed So the current analysis will only focus on the companies whose shares are listed All the data used in the analysis is shared in a Google sheet at the end Analysis Methodology Every year Fortune publishes its result on the 2nd week of February I have considered two different ways to invest in the best companies to work a You invest in the company as soon as the list comes out and hold for 1 year and then sell and repeat this every year b You invest in the company and hold This is based on the assumption that company culture does not change year over year and once the company makes it into a list it s a good long term investment Returns from the above strategies are then compared to the S amp P 500 returns 1 over the same period Results https preview redd it fxgwbdq9m6b71 png width 1032 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 2a26a48dd0922c14776c97a6fab8ba706315aadd The companies in the best places to work consistently beat S amp P500 in stock returns There is a noticeable difference in return as you move up the list with the best place to work Rank 1 beating the market comfortably by 9 5 every year 2 https preview redd it uxfqsqebm6b71 png width 1035 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 93e4c7d47160e3accf8fbc845417413ef3e367a4 The difference in returns becomes more noticeable if you buy and hold the company for the long term Here we can see a steady increase in returns as you move up the ranking ladder with the top company returning a whopping 131 5 more than the index over the last 10 years This also validates our assumption that companies having great cultures create superior investor returns over the long term Now that it s out of the way we can dive deeper into the data and find out which stocks made the best returns and how your returns would have faired over the years https preview redd it 4s97sp3dm6b71 png width 1034 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 7f5aa6f005cc1f72f5acb30c5f15180567ac27a0 The best long term return among the top companies to work for was generated by Adobe The stock has returned 1762 over the last 10 years As expected tech companies have generated the most amount of returns with Microsoft Google and Adobe all present multiple times For our final analysis we can check if the returns were consistent throughout the years or was it just a few years that are contributing to the overall positive results https preview redd it tcry8ieem6b71 png width 1045 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 48368f25abadca99ca2f9e7ba0184b10b3b45d13 I think this graph shows one of the most important takeaways from this analysis As we can see best companies to work for have beaten SPY by a considerable margin in 8 out of the 10 years 80 of our analysis timeframe Even in the years that our strategy did not beat the market the difference between the returns was negligible Conclusion No matter how you slice it the above analysis shows that companies that are exceptional places to work create exceptional returns to their shareholders I think this ties in nicely with our initial hypothesis that companies having great culture will have happy employees that create the best possible results and also would attract top talent Both of these in turn would lead to market beating shareholder returns Now you know what to do when the next year s results come out Google Sheet containing the data and my analysis here https docs google com spreadsheets d 1NF48A0p6L4V 79XkJVdOCT jAdP1vKlC3ix5e44xXXM

was caused by lots of things but the biggest issue was mortgage companies were handing out mortgages like beads at Mardi Gras People who had no possible way of actually paying back the mortgage were given one anyway So now lots of people who normally would only afford say a 130k house were getting pre approved for 180k which lead to Bidding wars on houses driving the prices up higher then the actual fair market value Which these same people who shouldn t have been approved for the higher amounts were buying and then Huge numbers of people defaulting on loans that they should have never been given in the first place which lead to all the banks begging for the feds to bail them out and the feds said Fuck yo loans you should have known better which lead to the single biggest drop in

more, Dear Reddit Family enclosed you will find a report in which the following questions are answered among others This is not spam not a free report for the purpose of newsletter acquisition just an unprecedented analysis in which I have aggregated publicly available information with third party data such as search volume and new registration car emission classes 1 With one goal to predict the next stock market crash identify the trigger and back it up with evidence for everyone to understand If you don t open this and read it this could be the moment next year when you think If only I had taken 10 minutes Now before you consider investing your valuable time I have declared all the questions and attributes that will be answered in the report Do not decide until you have reviewed the table of contents You can find the report attached or at www tom illauer de blog Facts amp Evidence Why the central bank will start tapering in October 2021 Why inflation rises to 8 9 in the short term I show you that commodity prices are similar to the oil crisis corporate capitalization values are higher than they were during the DotCom bubble real estate prices are as high as they were during the subcrime crisis and the whole thing is mixed with unprecedented hyperinflation Why the inflation rate is calculated incorrectly Why the ECB must raise key interest rates to save the beacons Why the digital euro will come with a conversion rate Why Corona measures are being extended to avoid hyperinflation Why only Tesla and Deutsche Bank are affected Why the DAX will plummet by 23 Why b t c will rise to 125 000 Why Mortgage Backed Securities Are Not the Bottleneck but Auto Loans Are Why I built a new prediction model And much more Notice I don t expect any feedback nor do I expect you to share this with your networks The only thing I intend is that if you use the data and potentially make a profit you donate a portion of it to your local animal shelter Thank you for your attention Yours sincerely Tom Illauer www tom illauer de Excerpt Even worse Ginnie Mae loans in forbearance decreased 32 basis points to 4 78 while the forbearance share for portfolio loans and private label securities PLS increased 2 basis points to 7 94 Private label mortgage backed securities are securitized mortgages that do not conform to the criteria set by the Government Sponsored Enterprises Freddie Mac Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae The mortgages that make up these securities do not have the backing of the government and as a result carry a significantly greater risk Below is a diagram that represents the types of mortgages that would not classify as GSE conforming loans By stage 10 8 of total loans in forbearance are in the initial forbearance plan stage while 82 7 are in a forbearance extension The remaining 6 5 are forbearance re entries 7 94 But what are forbearance agreements Forbearance broadly stands for concessions on the part of lenders and means negotiating for non repayment or delayed payments Nearly 5 of mortgages Translated from English Forbearance in the context of a mortgage process is a special agreement between the lender and the borrower to delay foreclosure The literal meaning of forbearance is to withhold And if there are so many bankruptcies or let s say payment difficulties then one would attest as a thesis that many homeowners take out a second mortgage on their home in order to be liquid again Let s look at how many new mortgage applications there are in the U S Mortgage Bankers Association MBA Builder Application Survey BAS data for April 2021 shows that mortgage applications for new home purchases increased 30 8 percent compared to the same month last year Why am I writing this analysis An anecdote Michael Burry the star investor from the movie Big Short saw the 2008 financial crisis coming earlier than any analyst before him In an interview he commented Many people have asked me why I didn t warn anyone about the crisis This I am now changing but still no one listens to me You will find my CV and reputation at the end of the analysis What can you expect What inside information will you receive I show you that commodity prices are similar to the oil crisis corporate capitalization values are higher than at the dotcom bubble real estate prices are as high as they were during the subcrime crisis and the whole thing is mixed with unprecedented hyperinflation Before you consider sacrificing 30 minutes of time in today s attention economy to review an analysis from a complete stranger to you please take a look at the table of contents and then decide I am not a crash prophet Why not Because the well known crash prophets foresee the crash every year and if they do this only often enough then they will be already right because it happens statistically every seven years I therefore give a forecast for the time March 2022 Anecdote With hundreds of examples which no one has collected before and summarized in an analysis I show you the future tulip mania because it has never been as bad as it is today Speculative bubbles are not bad on the contrary like short selling they serve a capitalist

Opera was established in 1996 as a browser company and it is one of the few survivors from the Internet Explorer era It was bought by a consortium led by Yahui Zhou in 2016 for 600m It was listed in 2018 as OPRA on Nasdaq But Opera is no longer just the browser company In fact its core browser business contributes about half of its revenue through search monetization The other half of revenue is contributed by its news app s which are top news apps on both android and app store What Opera has done successfully is to take its browser users and then get them to other services like News and wallet and fintech They call it Browser strategy It also used its browser user base to spin off 2 businesses OPay a leading mobile wallet and mobile money operator in Africa where it has 13 stake and Nanobank a micro credit provider in emerging markets of Africa Asia and America where it has 42 stake It also opportunistically invested 30m for 20 stake in starmaker which is social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists and is growing like a wild fire in last one year Business Model Opera s primarily makes money from its user base of 380m users by monetizing search and placing ads in the form of speed dials and bookmark affiliate marketing Last year they acquired 2 small companies Pocosys and Fjord bank and used Pocosys to build a new fintech product called Dify which was pilot launched in Spain in Feb 2021 Initially Dify will provide an integrated wallet Debit Card and Cashback for its users with plans to launch additional services like BNPL Credit and fractionalized share investing to its 50m active users in Europe Early 2021 they acquired leading 2D gaming engine company YoYo Games and launched a Gaming division combining its gaming focused browser Opera GX which is growing quite rapidly to 9M active users since it launch in June 2019 Opera plans to build a gaming community around these 9M users and its thousands of GameMaker developers and could potentially expand into e sports Opera s Valuation Disconnect Opera reported revenue of 163m in 2020 and its search and ad business was impacted by covid just like many other companies But Opera has come out much stronger post covid and raised 2021 guidance to 245m representing 50 growth at top end They still consider this a conservative guidance as they have not baked in the revenue contributions from their fintech Dify and YoYo games Opay where opera holds 13 interest has raised 170m at a valuation of about 500m in external funding from the likes of Softbank Meituan and was doing 300m in TPV per month in 2019 In 2020 Opay TPV grew by 4 5 times to 2B in December and although Opera did not share the exact TPV for March 2021 they confirmed that its TPV increased in March 2021 compared to December 2020 Nanobank was hardest hit by covid Pre covid it was doing 125M revenue per quarter at 30 margin profile but its recovery is slow since its largest market India is still dealing with Covid and Nanobank has prioritized profitable growth over revenue in the short term rightfully so In Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 it has done about 46M and 50M in revenue at 30 and 10 margin profile However Opera has stated that they do expect Nanabank to reach pre covid level of 125m quarter run rate in late 2021 Starmaker has been on hockey stick growth path since 2020 Starmaker had a 2018 exit run rate of 17m when opera invested 30m for 20 stake Starmaker exited 2020 with 130m run rate and in Q1 2021 it has about 38 sequential growth with a run rate of 180m OPRA SUM OF PART VALUATION Since Starmaker announced 3x growth in 2020 and 130m run rate I used 43 33m 130m 3 as the Q1 exit run rate and then used arithmetic series sum over revenue of 11M in Q1 and 32 5M in Q4 to give total revenue of 87m 4 11 32 5 2 in 2020 I am assuming 25 15 and 5 sequential quarterly revenue growth in 2021 from the base of 180m run rate as reported in Q1 earnings resulting in Q1 revenue of 45M and Q4 revenue of 68M and arithmetic sum giving 2021 revenue of 226m 4 45 68 2 Opay does not report revenue run rate but TPV Since Opay report 4 5x TPV growth in 2020 TPV grew from 445M in January 2020 to 2B in December 2020 I am taking arithmetic series sum to get the total TPV of 14 7B for 2020 12 445 2000 2 Although Opera did not reveal the TPV for March 2021 they stated that the TPV is growing nicely Along with additional products and launch in additional countries I am projecting 2x growth in TPV in 2021 a deceleration from 4 5x growth in 2020 with a TPV of 2B for Jan 2021 and 4B for Dec 2021 Taking the arithmetic series sum gives expected 2021 TPV of 36B I have looked at airtel Mobile Money and M pesa revenue to TPV ratio 0 008 for airtel and 0 006 for M pesa Applying the average of 0 007 revenue to TPV ratio gives Opay 2020 revenue of 103M and 2021 revenue of 252M Using this the sum of the part valuation of Opera is as follows Keep in mind that Upstart holding UPST is trading at 20x revenue multiple though it has lower margin profile than Nanobank However I am using only 8x multiple for Nanobank since it is projected to grow revenue at 29 compared to 100 for UPST Pinterest and Snap commanded a 50 70x revenue multiple during their 150 growth phase I am using 40x multiple for starmaker Klarna AfterPay Square commanded 30 40x revenue multiple during 200 revenue growth I am using 20x revenue multiple for Opay Update Per techcrunch Opay is in the middle of raising 400m at more than 1 5B valuation I think it will be more towards 2B than 1 5B I believe this undervalues Opay though but we have to wait and see who the investors are in this round and is there any strategic partnership involved to accelerate the expansion and growth in 2021 22 The Total Sum of the part valuation of Opera is 5 8B as bull case and 3 5B as base case massive disconnect from 1 2B Opera is trading after Q1 2021 results New Growth Initiatives As if Opera is not undervalued enough Opera also has 2 new growth initiatives which could offer significant additional upside Opera has ambitious growth plans with a new fintech initiative called Dify in Europe What I like is the tight coupling of Cashback Coupons Payment CryptoWallet in the browser Imagine 10 of 50M users of opera browser in Europe use dify and spend average of 500 year Opera could get 2 5B year of transactions payment through them If average cashback is 5 of transaction amount dify s rev can be be 125M year Although too soon if Opera s is successful in getting 10 of its browser users in Europe to use Dify or gain additional browser users due to popularity of Dify one could argue that Dify in itself can grow into billions of dollar of business You can see how Klarna Afterpay are valued in private valuations today For comparison think Honey which paypal bought for 4B dollars and Cashback aspect of Honey is just one part of overall Dify value proposition Opera also recently bought YoYo Games makers of popular indie 2D game engine game maker Time will tell if they can compete against powerhouses like Unity or Roblox but you have to give benefit of doubt to Yahui Zhou the 60 owner of Opera He has knack for identifying boring assets and turning them into growth engine Who would have thought that Opera Browser business which he bought for 600M can launch many new and exiting businesses and also grow its core with differentiated offering We just need to wait and see what future brings for this They also bought a bank in Europe Fjord Bank They have not shared their plans on what they are going to do here but if they have ambition to be neobank like N26 or revolut Opera can quickly scale this neobank given its large user base They can offer investment services once they reach critical mass as part of this fintech offering Assuming Dify and Gaming takes off I do expect significant revenue expansion of Opera Core from 260M 270M in 2021 63 YoY growth to 380 400M in 2022 47 YoY growth and 500 550M in 2023 35 YoY This growth would be at very high margin and I expect OPRA to generate 25 30 margin with that This type of growth commands a revenue multiple of 20 Conclusion I believe Opera is massively undervalued and this disconnect primarily stems from Wall Street Analyst not able to size and value the exponential increase in the valuation of Opera s minority investment in 2021 This makes Opera one of the most undervalued hidden gems to be discovered in the market P S Disclaimer This is not investment advice or recommendation Do your own DD on OPRA and let me know if I am wrong in my analysis I own OPRA shares These are my thoughts on why I think OPRA is massively undervalued by market Appreciate if you do your own DD and research as well and reply comment on my twitter

upside, Company Overview Eloxx Pharmaceuticals is a pre revenue clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that specializes in RNA modulating drugs more specifically eukaryotic ribosomal selective glycosides ERSG aimed at treating rare and ultra rare premature stop codon diseases For those that aren t incredibly familiar in the biopharma space Eloxx runs on the same platform that Pfizer and Moderna does and is also located in the same neighborhood While Moderna has jumped to the roof from the covid release Eloxx has an identical technology platform hinting at some big technological potential alone Major Equity Story Eloxx s major pipeline drug ELX 02 is currently in Stage 2 and the results were scheduled to be released in H1 2021 But due to COVID 19 allegedly management announced that the results would be heading towards H2 2021 If this reading goes well the valuation will increase exponentially So obviously most of the public is waiting on the results of this reading in order to decide whether to invest However what gets really interesting is that there has been quite a bit of signaling as to these results might be positive 1 After announcing the delay of the Stage 2 reading on May 18th Eloxx completed a secondary private offering to avoid the public markets On the surface this may seem like a non material point However is it likely that insiders would want the shares to get out to the public if they knew they had potentially strong phase 2 results incoming The answer is unlikely During this offering institutions purchased 30 of the company If you trace back who were the major purchasers of the aforementioned offering were you find that it was Pontifax Pontifax is an Israeli biopharma venture capital fund who have a strong history of great performance and exits Additionally Pontifax isn t just casting a wide spread with a lot of investments Pontifax put 0 into other public holdings in the past year Elox was the exception not just a drop in the bucket However if you dive further into this Pontifax purchase Pontifax s CEO Tomer Kariv used to be the CEO and Founder of Eloxx Kariv also currently still serves as the chairman of the board at Elox itself So Kariv the former founder of Elox who arguably knows more than anyone about the company just purchased a large ownership in the company prior to the biggest reading in the company s history So putting the above in simple terms Elox delayed their Stage 2 reading Elox insiders who realistically have some idea how the Stage 2 is going prevented Elox from going to the public markets and instead purchased 30 of the company for themselves 2 Enter Roche Finance Roche Finance is a unit of the Swiss pharma giant Roche Holdings 330bn market cap On June 14th Roche Finance disclosed that they have purchased an ownership stake of 5 3 of Eloxx Pharmaceutical If you want to look up Roche further they have incredibly strong performance and a history of investing in winners So take another step back following that 30 purchase from insiders another major pharma player purchased an additional 5 3 of Elox 3 Now if that wasn t enough institutional and insider buying I still have more for you Enter Ernesto Bertarelli and Waypoint Holdings Gurnet Point I am sure hardly anybody has heard of Bertarelli but Bertarelli is a billionaire with a strong biopharma background Bertarelli was the CEO of Serono which was a major producer of MS drug Rebif The details of his specific background is not incredibly important However Bertarelli and his funds Waypoint Gurnet purchased 5 7 of Eloxx Pharma announced on June 29th 4 Lastly I will add one minor additional fact hypotheses I trust this less However some people look into this stuff One major theme amongst some biopharma companies is leakage of results Say Employee A of Elox goes home and tells his family and friends that stuff is going well for Elox You commonly see an increase in search history and search volume of the company Since all of these insider purchases Elox s search volume has spiked drastically Additionally in Massachusetts where Elox is headquartered search volume has increased dramatically amp x200B https preview redd it 6huhsh13o7b71 png width 514 amp format png amp auto webp amp s b7e3b96754c31c538b5584d23827d3dd01990ff8 Drug Pipeline The lead investigative drug in Eloxx s pipeline currently is ELX 02 In the simplest terms ELX 02 is aimed at treating a select population of Cystic Fibrosis CF patients Classification 1 patients which represent 22 of the total CF population However while the total patient universe is relatively small the major benefit for Elox is that ELX 02 has been awarded the orphan drug classification If you are unfamiliar with this classification this designation is huge and provides Elox with major pricing power see valuation discussion below Results of the Phase 1 were strong No severe serious or unexpected adverse events side effects in laymans terms ELX 02 is a drug that is designed as in improvement to the current available treatment aminoglycoside Aminoglycoside can lead to hypersensitivity nephrotoxicity and oto toxicity From the Phase 1 only 1 patient or 1 6 of the population experienced these side effects that are common in the current treatment Therefore in simplest terms if Phase 2 and 3 prove safety and efficacy Elox would have a major market disruptor on their hands Apart from the ELX 02 drug there is not much else noteworthy in the pipeline yes recognize the risk here While the company does have residual cash and technology that would be available for sale in the event of a failure in study results the whole Eloxx story is dependent on ELX 02 receiving favorable clinical readings Competitive Landscape Eloxx s major competitor is Vertex Pharmaceuticals NASDAQ VRTX which has over a 51bn market cap The reason for such a large premium in price is due to their ability to canvas and service a majority of CF patients However ELX 02 is aimed at treating classification 1 of CF patients which is considerably harder and more debilitating than the classifications that Vertex targets From a competitive standpoint Vertex aims to target the 78 of CF population and Elox wants to provide for the remaining 22 So there is ample opportunity for both to succeed or for Elox to be purchased if Vertex wants to provide full service to the entire CF population Valuation Then last but not least valuation Using Vertex s pricing as a good proxy Vertex has 4bn in revenue and its based upon four CF drugs They charge approximately 300k for each treatment I believe that this 300k per treatment is a reasonable price for Eloxx as well due to the orphan drug classification that was mentioned previously this classification gives good pricing power to any drug that dons it Vertex is valued at 51bn 51bn 4bn in sales gives a 12 75x P S ratio for Vertex currently Shifting towards Elox there is a total CF population of 70k 22 of the total population have Classification 1 which is the rarest and Elox is trying to treat Of that 22 40 have the mutation that Elox is trying to treat So the total addressable market is 6k patients Let s be conservative and assume that only 50 of patients have the insurance and ability to pay for the drug So there is 3k projected patients that have insurance that will cover the full cost of the orphan drug 3k patients 300k per year for treatment 925mm in revenue Market comps for P S are usually between 10 15x But let s use the same 13x P S that Vertex has or even discount it a tad due to size premium if you want to be more conservative and you have a 12bn market cap on Elox that is currently trading at 130mm in market cap If you do the quick math there that is approximately a 100x from the current price point Downsides Now it can t go without saying that there are some noteworthy downsides here With any speculative and this is incredibly speculative biopharma company there is a lot of risk associated with the company For one as I mentioned previously there is hardly anything noteworthy in Eloxx s pipeline apart from ELX 02 The ELX 02 treatment is a platform and not a singular treatment which means higher upside but also more downside If the Stage 2 reading were to come back with negative results the dramatic upside to this company is no longer there and the company realistically loses a lot of its value There is some residual cash on the balance sheet and the technology that Elox utilizes has a residual value same tech platform as Moderna and Pfizer So the company s intrinsic value would never be zero regardless of the reading However one must be prepared for loss Secondly if you follow my story above you would assume a dramatic uptick in the stock over the past couple months Since a lot of this news has come out you saw the stock increase quickly However recently management informed the public that the reading of the results would not take place until Q4 of 2021 So taking a step back they have delayed the reading multiple times from H1 2021 to now Q4 2021 technically not a true delay as they initially stated H2 2021 but they made their reading window more specific Additionally they recently canned their CFO who many attribute the delay in the Stage 2 reading to his inability to get results out timely So with so much frustration with the reading delays you have seen the stock give up a majority of the May June gains The downside here is not the recent price movement but rather there has been quite a bit of operational delays in the stage results As always do your own DD From an initial glance at my post I would also take this to be some pie in the sky type valuation and story But look into the points that I have made above for yourself Look at the backgrounds of the insiders and institutions that have been buying Go listen to the most recent earnings call and hear the CEO s voice pick up during the Q amp A when they talk about ELX 02 I think if you look into it all and see the whole collective picture the story becomes less of a coin flip biopharma play and the odds seem more in your favor Summary TLDR Elox is a biopharma company that has seen tremendous insider buying over the last couple months on many occasions from multiple different parties They are awaiting the reading of Stage 2 trial for the ELX 02 drug If this drug were to pass Stage 2 and all remaining stages approvals the company has tremendous upside from their current conservative 130mm market cap with potential to grow into a 10bn market cap player in the space

bought more shares albeit Clearside is already my largest holding The reason for my suicidal confidence is simple but please stop reading if you are not interested in 10x 100x upside potential 10x 100x Clearside has demonstrated potential to prove superior to beat Eleya the world s largest drug for eye disease with estimated 10bn sales next year This news popped out in June 2021 and despite the recent run Clearside s market cap remains at nearly invisible level of 300m As a rule of thumb pharma biotech companies tend to trade at 3x 10x revenues It does not take a rocket scientist to make the math and argue that Clearside might have 30bn market cap one day just taking the lower end of the valuation range applying it to 10bn peak sales potential This still leaves a juicy 100x from where we are today But even taking a conservative approach a simple 10x still seems not far away Let s take a look at another biotech firm without any revenues Kodiak Bioscience In Q4 2019 Kodiak announced solid phase 1b data on roughly 100 patients gt 300 injections that appear promising Since then Kodiak s market cap hovers around 3 8bn I think that Clearside can generate comparable and even better data within the next two years which points to 10 20x upside potential from today s level Value drivers Note that Clearside is much more than a one trick pony There are two pillars for value generation 1 Drug delivery platform Clearside s patent protected SCS Microinjector injects drugs into the suprachoroidal space in the doctor s office as convenient as today s gold standard of intravitreal injections Clearside s technology is far superior for several reasons 6 11x higher efficacy on the same drug volume while offering lower side effects as the drug goes directly to the target region and not through healthy tissue lt also seems that the drug amount stays longer in the target zone which should yield longer duration of the therapy This is very important as no patient is keen to receive injections straight into the eye every month or every other month I estimate that the duration benefit stemming from the Clearside injector exceeds 5x Clearside has several partners Bausch amp Lomb Regenxbio Artic Bioscience Aura Biomedical that have very specific sublicenses and so far progressed very nicely with observations of annoying side effects 2 Proprietary drugs axitinib for wet AMD with excellent first human data Plus two preclinical projects with a lot of promise and close to initiation of human studies Clearside generated preclinical data showing the axitinib is the best in class compound In the first human study the data appeared superior to Eylea Patients on therapy had stable vision with Eylea BCVA 0 2 while vision improved BCVA 4 7 for the very same patients following the suprachoroidal administration of axitinib More data and real head to head comparison will be needed to justify a superiority claim to Eylea but this is tremendous efficacy at a very low dose There are no signs of any side effects so data for higher doses should look even more spectacular I expect this data readout before year end Next steps Based on a unique and broadly patented drug delivery platform Clearside has had a solid IPO five years ago but the first FDA filing did not get approval due to the lacking information from Clearside s contract manufacturer and yielded a partnering deal with Bausch A few weeks ago the FDA accepted the resubmission of Xipere for the treatment of inflammatory eye disease uveitis I expect approval in Sept Oct which should trigger a 19m milestone payment for Clearside I also expect important phase 2 data from Clearside s partners Regenxbio and Auro this year Both partners confirmed that drugs could be safely administered while dose level could be increased and additional centers started recruiting of more patients Clearside plans to provide more insights into its pre clinical program integrin inhibitor before year end It is open what will happen to a pre clinical compound from Biocryst that shows promising pre clinical data with Clearside s data of axitinib using a higher dose in the second cohort of patients This data have the potential to shoot the share one or even two levels higher In 2022 we should see data from several cohorts of own and partnered products that could lead to a paradigm change and ultimate proof that Clearside is in pole position for next generation drugs I also see Clearside s partner Regenxbio with promising data but the rest of the pack far behind If Clearside can show the ultimate proof of concept in man it will capture more and more industry interest M amp A target The pipelines of the big ophthalmology companies are not impressive the inventor of Eylea has nothing else but high dose Eleya in the pipeline Regeneron s partner Bayer lacks ophthalmology drugs in its pipeline while diabetes firms such as J amp J and Boehringer are starting to put more emphasis on eye diseases not surprising given the correlation with diabetes but their pipelines are still thin and very early After its spin off from Novartis the ophthalmology medtech company stated its interest to re enter the space of ophthalmology drugs in a meaningful way On the same time Acon s direct competitor Bausch continues with its dual drug medtech approach and should already be very familiar with the benefit of suprachoroidal injections give the Xipere license deal with Clearside for the US Big pharma companies such as Novartis and Abbvie just digested headwinds from drugs with inadequate side effects Roche is the only company with a full ophthalmology pipeline but benefits are only modest compared to current standard of care Conclusion 10x in two years realistic in my view

Hope all is well with you on this wild trading day I came across a stock I would like to share called BODY known as Beach Body They just completed a 3 way merger between Beach body FRX Spac and MYX fitness about 2 weeks ago A little info on this stock The 3 way merger included FRX which was a SPAC MYX fitness which is a cycle bike company and Beach Body that is a connected fitness company who has over 20 years of growth under their belt Beach body acquired Openfit in December of 202 Started by Lebron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger This acquisition gave Lebron and Arnold a stake in the new BODY company They are both going to be making their own content in the future for this company Beach Body company is known for its exercises Insanity and P90X which helped countless people lose weight and change their lives for the better Sean T is also a super trainer and he has been massive in fitness for as long as i can remember The FRX team Forest Road Acquisitions is phenomenal Here is a list of a few of the people involved in the deal You will probably recognize Shaq and MLK the 3rd are apart of this company which I think is huge IMO anything Shaq joins always seems to make waves The ring company and Papa Johns Pizza just to name a few The Forest Road Acquisition Corp team includes three former Disney senior executives Tom Staggs director and Chairperson of the Strategic Advisory Committee Kevin Mayer strategic advisor and Salil Mehta Chief Financial Officer and is strengthened by the strategic connectivity and deal making expertise of directors officers and strategic advisors like Shaquille O Neal Peter Schlessel Keith Horn Mark Burg Sheila Stamps Teresa Miles Walsh and Martin Luther King III On top of this All Star cast of people is the short interest Yesterday I saw that it was over 40 Today the stock hit its 52 week low do to the shorting that has been happening This is the current Short interest on the stock according to Fintel around 38 09 https fintel io ss us body https fintel io ss us body The BODY company is now flush with cash around 420 000 000 coming from the closing of the SPAC merger They are planning to do an advertising campaign in the coming weeks for around 75 000 000 I am not sure of the specifics but if they include Lebron Arnold Shaq or the Cycle bikes that should really send this stock in the right direction Here is some info on the combined company A diverse portfolio that appeals to a broad consumer base through a holistic approach that brings together at home digitally enabled fitness nutrition and community Generated 2020 pro forma revenue of 880 million across BOD Openfit and Myx which achieved 30 million of revenue in its first year of operations 2 6 million paid digital fitness subscribers with 96 month over month retention Industry leading 89 gross margins on digital subscription revenue across all three brands The deepest library of premium fitness content in the industry that generates more than 180 million

experience Scalable platform that enables synergies across distribution marketing and content creation Management team with over 22 years of experience creating content acquiring customers and delivering substantial revenue and EBITDA Well positioned to unlock accelerated growth and expects to achieve compound annual revenue growth of 30 over the next 5 years As you can see this company is already profitable The CEO called it the bargained price Peleton This is the most cash they have had on their balance sheets and they were up to 880 000 000 without this added capital The brand awareness should sky rocket after they start broadcasting the new commercials The biggest catalyst for the stock besides the short interest is the addiction of BODI live interactive Beta testing in August and rollout in September Most likely they are trying to drive this thing down to get in cheap for this huge event They are using the technology seen in the NBA and WWE to stream users live into a class setting and have them on a TV where the instructor can interact with them and help them with their form and encourage them This should be a big deal as it bring interaction that has never been seen besides what the cycling classes are doing https www youtube com watch v rkHCh0EEiQw https www youtube com watch v rkHCh0EEiQw This is revolutionary for online fitness It will bring the gym

their life and they spend money every month on nothing Beach Body has 2 6 million paid subscribers at this time It should continue to grow Needless to say the companies that have been invested in lately for short squeezes haven t been profitable or sustainable This one seems to fit the bill of Short Squeeze candidate and a good investment for the future When I first came across Peleton it was at 17 50 The 52 week high within a year of this low was a high of 171 09 They don t nearly have the library of workouts that BODY has They don t have the star power of the people I mentioned above Their exposure started with a controversial commercial that got people talking about the company This went almost 10x without a short squeeze and any real spokesperson for the stock Needless to say it seems that BODY could moon Peleton commercial below https www youtube com watch v M9Hu3 mJI9c https www youtube com watch v M9Hu3 mJI9c I apologize for the long DD but this company is so low right now I feel I have to share everything that I have learned about them This isn t financial advice just someone trying to be on the cutting edge of a new public company I think has some great promise There is a ton of room to grow in all segments of this business I believe the cycle bike is the best Peleton alternative and it is much cheaper compared to the Peleton bike Peleton recently had issues with their treadmill sucking kids pets and other objects underneath them This leaves some people that would rather find a nice alternative The swiveling screen on the bike connects to other fitness classes

trading day I came across a stock I would like to share called BODY known as Beach Body They just completed a 3 way merger between Beach body Forest Road and MYX fitness about 2 weeks ago A little info on this stock The 3 way merger included Forest Road MYX fitness which is a cycle bike company and Beach Body that is a connected fitness company who has over 20 years of growth under their belt Beach body acquired Openfit in December of 202 Started by Lebron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger This acquisition gave Lebron and Arnold a stake in the new BODY company They are both going to be making their own content in the future for this company Beach Body company is known for its exercises Insanity and P90X which helped countless people lose weight and change their lives for the better Sean T is also a super trainer and he has been massive in fitness for as long as i can remember The Forest Road Acquisitions is phenomenal Here is a list of a few of the people involved in the deal You will probably recognize Shaq and MLK the 3rd are apart of this company which I think is huge IMO anything Shaq joins always seems to make waves The ring company and Papa Johns Pizza just to name a few The Forest Road Acquisition Corp team includes three former Disney senior executives Tom Staggs director and Chairperson of the Strategic Advisory Committee Kevin Mayer strategic advisor and Salil Mehta Chief Financial Officer and is strengthened by the strategic connectivity and deal making expertise of directors officers and strategic advisors like Shaquille O Neal Peter Schlessel Keith Horn Mark Burg Sheila Stamps Teresa Miles Walsh and Martin Luther King III On top of this All Star cast of people is the short interest Yesterday I saw that it was over 40 Today the stock hit its 52 week low do to the shorting that has been happening This is the current Short interest around 38 09 The BODY company is now flush with cash around 420 000 000 coming from the closing of the merger They are planning to do an advertising campaign in the coming weeks for around 75 000 000 I am not sure of the specifics but if they include Lebron Arnold Shaq or the Cycle bikes that should really send this stock in the right direction Here is some info on the combined company A diverse portfolio that appeals to a broad consumer base through a holistic approach that brings together at home digitally enabled fitness nutrition and community Generated 2020 pro forma revenue of 880 million across BOD Openfit and Myx which achieved 30 million of revenue in its first year of operations 2 6 million paid digital fitness subscribers with 96 month over month retention Industry leading 89 gross margins on digital subscription revenue across all three brands The deepest library of premium fitness content in the industry that generates more than 180 million views annually A premium portfolio of branded nutrition products that are scientifically developed clinically tested and strategically paired with fitness content for a holistic health and wellness experience Scalable platform that enables synergies across distribution marketing and content creation Management team with over 22 years of experience creating content acquiring customers and delivering substantial revenue and EBITDA Well positioned to unlock accelerated growth and expects to achieve compound annual revenue growth of 30 over the next 5 years As you can see this company is already profitable The CEO called it the bargained price Peleton This is the most cash they have had on their balance sheets and they were up to 880 000 000 without this added capital The brand awareness should sky rocket after they start broadcasting the new commercials The biggest catalyst for the stock besides the short interest is the addiction of BODI live interactive Beta testing in August and rollout in September Most likely they are trying to drive this thing down to get in cheap for this huge event They are using the technology seen in the NBA and WWE to stream users live into a class setting and have them on a TV where the instructor can interact with them and help them with their form and encourage them This should be a big deal as it bring interaction that has never been seen besides what the cycling classes are doing https www youtube com watch v rkHCh0EEiQw https www youtube com watch v rkHCh0EEiQw This is revolutionary for online fitness It will bring the gym straight into your home and is a very exciting Segway into the future of fitness I know most people who have tried to get in shape have bought gym memberships that they barely use at some point in their life and they spend money every month on nothing Beach Body has 2 6 million paid subscribers at this time It should continue to grow Needless to say the companies that have been invested in lately for short squeezes haven t been profitable or sustainable This one seems to fit the bill of Short Squeeze candidate and a good investment for the future When I first came across Peleton it was at 17 50 The 52 week high within a year of this low was a high of 171 09 They don t nearly have the library of workouts that BODY has They don t have the star power of the people I mentioned above Their exposure started with a controversial commercial that got people talking about the company This went almost 10x without a short squeeze and any real spokesperson for the stock Needless to say it seems that BODY could moon Peleton commercial below https www youtube com watch v M9Hu3 mJI9c https www youtube com watch v M9Hu3 mJI9c I apologize for the long DD but this company is so low right now I feel I have to share everything that I have learned about them This isn t financial advice just someone trying to be on the cutting edge of a new public company I think has some great promise There is a ton of room to grow in all segments of this business I believe the cycle bike is the best Peleton alternative and it is much cheaper compared to the Peleton bike Peleton recently had issues with their treadmill sucking kids pets and other objects underneath them This leaves some people that would rather find a nice alternative The swiveling screen on the bike connects to other fitness classes and you can use that screen to get other workouts in as well at cycling classes https www myxfitness com https www myxfitness com I am now a shareholder in the company and very excited to see what the future brings Happy investing and hope you guys learned something from this DD

retards this is kinda long so you might wanna grab a juice box and a handful of crayons to munch on in case you need a snack amp x200B amp x200B No links pretty charts or colors One pic of a bunch of numbers that didn t format out well as text we ll see what happens I added a rocket emoji to this yesterday and got banned for 24 hours As I don t know what s gonna set off The Powers That Be I decided to go with a wall of text So apologies in advance If you want pretty colors save some of your snack crayons to draw on your own screens amp x200B amp x200B I ve written about Himax HIMX before Other folks as well have posted some DD on them and I won t repeat it all here as there s a lot of info amp x200B That said a tiny sampling of background amp x200B One of their biggest revenue sources is from ICs for flat panel screens amp x200B amp x200B They also make LCoS displays famously used in Google Glass a technology which also has the added benefit of being a main component in up and coming LiDAR systems for autonomous vehicles and they also look to be poised to take off with their flat panel tech for the automotive and trucking industry amp x200B amp x200B Suffice to say they make stuff that makes your tech toys more fun amp x200B amp x200B Lots of things in their favor but two that stand out are their negligible debt and the fact that the brothers Jordan and Biing Seng Wu secured fab time before COVID so they can make their goodies Hence they re gonna make money amp x200B amp x200B Which leads me to amp x200B amp x200B Dividend Yup they pay out a dividend Now that usually doesn t indicate rockets that will take us to the moon quickly but bear with me amp x200B amp x200B They paid out their dividend on Monday July 12 2021 based on their income from 2020 It came out to around 26 USA per share which closed on July 12 2021 at 15 39 USA each amp x200B amp x200B Here is why this is relevant amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B 26 is approximately 1 7 of 15 39 This gives us numbers we can work with amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Maffs is hard but I ve tried to write this in Apeish so everyone can read and enjoy amp x200B So let s dive in amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Now let s talk about the divvy for next year amp x200B Scenario I amp x200B Let s assume HIMX pays out a divvy at 100 next year as they did this year amp x200B Let s also assume they re on target for their second quarter projected estimate but let s go with the figure in the lowest possible range given so that s gonna be 54 amp x200B Now let s also assume they have a shitty rest of the year and make absolutely no more money amp x200B So the total amount made for 2021 Quarter 1 2021 plus Quarter 2 2021 is approximately 92 amp x200B amp x200B This is the absolute minimum they can make for the year 2021 as of this writing and for the sake of our little exercise in Scenario I it s also gonna be the maximum amp x200B Let s project forward to dividend payout date in 2022 amp x200B If the percentage remains the same 1 7 of the share value then the price per share on the dividend payout date in 2022 which is typically in late June early July calculated from a dividend payout of 92 per share would give us a share price of around 54 12 USA amp x200B amp x200B Take a moment and let your smooth brain work on that one amp x200B amp x200B 15 39 USA to 54 12 USA in about one year s time amp x200B amp x200B An increase of approximately 352 amp x200B amp x200B Now a share price less than 54 12 would mean our percentage goes up because remember 92 dividend payout is for the sake of this exercise both the minimum and a constant amp x200B So let s say the share price stays completely flat and is 15 39 USA on Divvy Payout Day 2022 That would mean the percentage on the payout of 92 would be approximately 6 amp x200B To reiterate if one were to purchase HIMX at 15 39 around now and the price never moves up for a year in a year s time one would earn a minimum of 6 ROI with no downside it does not go tits up amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B If the share price goes up our percentage return on the divvy goes down 92 being the constant but our shares are worth more AND we get a divvy payout Again no downside no tits up amp x200B amp x200B If the share price goes DOWN potential investors keeping tabs on HIMX have an OhShit Moment realizing they can get in on some sweet sweet divvy action and start buying driving the price back up to our purchase price and quite probably above it Again no downside no tits up amp x200B amp x200B As previously mentioned the heads of this joint secured fab time before COVID so they can make their goodies That means they re gonna make money for Quarters 3 and Quarters 4 of 2021 so the dollar figures for Scenario I are unlikely So onward to amp x200B amp x200B Scenario II amp x200B amp x200B Just for shits and giggles as they are gonna make more money than in Scenario I let s say they clear 78 combined for both Quarters 3 and 4 average of 39 USA per share for each quarter amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B That puts our total profit for the year 2021 at 1 70 per share amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Again let s assume HIMX pays out a divvy at 100 next year as they did this year amp x200B amp x200B If the dividend percentage remains the same 1 7 of the share value then the price per share on the dividend payout date in 2022 again which is typically in late June early July would be 100 USA amp x200B Sip on your juice box eat a crayon and contemplate that for a moment amp x200B Scenario III amp x200B amp x200B Okay we ve been using data based on this most recent payout while also looking at some extreme examples of data Let s expand our data set and also start working with some reasonable numbers for next year to get what I feel will be much closer to reality when the divvy pays out in 2022 amp x200B amp x200B https preview redd it dace3inxf9b71 png width 1450 amp format png amp auto webp amp s 87ed5de2a601d55d296b2c7efd76bfefc979bfd8 amp x200B All reported profit data amp x200B amp x200B 2005 0 2006 39 2007 57 2008 49 2009 21 2010 19 2011 06 2012 30 2013 36 2014 39 2015 15 2016 30 2017 16 2018 05 2019 08 2020 27 amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Since I ve calculated from 2008 through 2020 and we ve got cash amounts for each year let s calculate the percentage of the payout based on the previous year s EPS amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B 2021 100 2018 62 5 2017 80 2016 86 6 2015 76 9 2014 75 2013 83 3 2012 100 2011 63 2010 114 dunno about this perhaps a special dividend payout 2009 57 2008 57 8 2007 51 amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Now here s some data I do not have in front of me the minimum percentage a publicly traded Taiwanese company must pay out for a dividend There are requirements for them to do a payout with some exceptions meeting some requirements Capex for example which is why HIMX did not pay out a divvy in 2019 and 2020 as they had Capex and met other requirements in both of those years but I don t think it has to be 100 As can be seen above it s been all over the map over the years As I don t know what the minimum would be and the laws did change in 2018 for Scenario III I m going to use 75 This allows HIMX to use 25 of their profits for Capex which I feel is reasonable amp x200B Also instead of 1 7 for our divvy as a percentage of the share price ending on the payout date based on the Average Percentage after removing top and bottom outliers over the years we re going to use 4 07 amp x200B amp x200B Finally we ll use Nasdaq s Quarterly Earnings Forecasts to fill in the blanks for the rest of the year using the low EPS forecasts For Quarters 3 and 4 I feel their projections are way too low but as they re conservative and we re bound to hit them we ll go with them The Brothers Wu will be giving us better estimates for at least Quarter 3 come August 5 2021 Those numbers give us a total EPS for the year of 2021 at 1 31 per share amp x200B Okay Based on this data which I feel is in a completely reasonable and realistic range we have the following amp x200B amp x200B Projecting forward to dividend payout date in 2022 if HIMX pays out a divvy at 75 next year on a percentage which is 4 07 of the share value then the price per share on the dividend payout date in 2022 which is typically in late June early July calculated from a dividend payout of 1 31 per share 75 of which is 9825 would give us a share price of approximately 24 14 amp x200B Based off of the recent closing price of 15 39 this represents an upside of approximately 56 8 amp x200B I feel this is an extremely realistic share price for the Dividend Payout Date in 2022 approximately one year from now as the absolute minimum it should be based on the data provided amp x200B amp x200B Additional thoughts amp x200B Most people as well as institutions might not be interested in a stock for a 1 7 divvy payout but some might That return is far better than what a bank is giving on CDs these days amp x200B amp x200B That said at around a 4 return calculated from our historical data above institutional investors may start to sit up and take notice I feel based on the past performance 3 4 is probably the sweet spot for the return and as a result will entice more institutional investment This will also stabilize the share price historically HIMX has been owned largely by individual investors with a fairly low percentage of institutional investment amp x200B This is actually why the divvy is so important not as a dividend but as a way to help stabilize the share price Reason as I wrote if the share price stays completely flat and is 15 39 USA on divvy payout date 2022 that would mean the percentage on the payout of 92 would be approximately 6 Again a share price less than that would mean our percentage goes up above 6 because remember 92 is for the sake of this exercise both the minimum and a constant So if you re an institution and you want need a place to park large amounts of cash something that s giving a a return on investment of 6 is fantastic Ergo institutions will be most interested in buying up HIMX thus driving the price back upwards and overall keeping it afloat and quite possibly preventing it from taking the massive dips it has in the past not to say it won t whipsaw again in the future but it may just not be quite as violent as it has in the past amp x200B amp x200B While I feel the price per share will reach approximately 24 by dividend payout date in 2022 it by no means is relegated to reaching that price or higher by next year In fact if history is any indication even with more institutional investment I suspect we may see wild price swings for the share price of HIMX between now and next year s dividend payout Now as indicated these might be tempered somewhat by the institutional purchases or individuals buying really large blocks of HIMX as described previously said purchases essentially stabilizing the price and preventing it from dropping significantly below its current price point That said an example of the possible upcoming action might be to see it run up to say 30 then drop back down to around 17 and finally stabilizing at 24 by Divvy Payout Day 2022 amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B We haven t even begun to look at options yet If you re interested in options when they become available I d recommend looking at June July LEAPS buying calls or possibly selling puts amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Finally that s only for the next year As HIMX has more design wins and their newest bleeding edge technologies are adopted by more and more companies coupled with the current chip shortage that will last probably into at least 2023 they are poised to print for quite a few years to come amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B Easiest thing to do right now is simply buy shares and hodl Get your divvy next year and if you want to sell do so and pay long term capital gains instead of short term Tendietown my fellow apes amp x200B amp x200B amp x200B TL DR amp x200B amp x200B Maffs is hard so let s just say HIMX is gonna go to the moon and beyond over the next few years and pay you a divvy while it does so Buy and hodl and get a bucket of tendies either in the form of 4 divvy or a stock price that provides ROI at the very least 56 8 or greater probably much much more AND gives you a divvy amp x200B amp x200B Buckets of tendies for everyone on Mars
