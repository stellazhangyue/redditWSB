## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

```


```{r quantmod}
tickers <- c("GME","MRNA","JNJ","SVA","^GSPC","AAPL","AMZN","FB","GS","JPM")

tickerPrices <- NULL
for (ticker in tickers)
  tickerPrices <- cbind(tickerPrices,getSymbols.yahoo(ticker,from = "2015-01-01",auto.assign=FALSE)[,4])

tickerPrices <- tickerPrices[apply(tickerPrices,1,function(x) all(!is.na(x))),]
colnames(tickerPrices) <- tickers

tickerPrices
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
