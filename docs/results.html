<p>From the above 2 graphs, we can clearly see that there are 2 waves of the WSB stocks, which are indicated by the sudden spike of the stock price as well as the sudden increase of the volume. These 2 waves are around January - Feburary and May - June period respectively. These 2 graphs actually double confirm with our previous claims.</p>
<p>Also, the gray and red line in the price graph is the Bollinger Bands, which is the price level at 1 standard deviation level above and below the sample moving average of the price, which is able to capture the volatility of the stock. Generally, Bollinger bands is used to check whether prices are relatively high or low as comparing to the historical price. Here, we can see that for the beginning of the 2 waves, the price of both <code>GME</code> and <code>AMC</code> break the Bollinger upper bands, which suggests that the price of these 2 stocks are extremely high as comparing to the historical data. However, the Bollinger bands also adjusted themselves quickly to accommodate the sudden price change, so we can see that the price of these 2 stocks fall back within the Bollinger bands after a short period of time.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.2.3.2</span> Stock Risk Assessment</h4>
<p>While the previous 2 graphs mainly focus on the price and volume aspects, there is one more aspect that are very important to the stock, which is risk. Risk can be measured by the standard deviation. Here, we would like to explore how the risk of the 2 stocks change before and after the 2 waves, which are <code>GME</code> and <code>AMC</code> respectively. Thus, we need to calculate the moving standard deviation of the 2 stocks over time.</p>
<p>Here, we take the closing price to be the one calculating the moving standard deviation since closing price is the most representative price among all the 5 prices. For each month, it is about 4 weeks and the stock market only opens in weekdays, thus, there are about 4*5 = 20 days with stock data every month. Therefore, we set the moving window to be 20, which is roughly about 1 month time.</p>
<p>Also, we take the data since the start of last year because we want to see whether there is any difference in terms of the risk of <code>GME</code> and <code>AMC</code> by comparing the moving standard deviation before and after the 2 waves.</p>

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;AMC&quot;</code></pre>
<p><img src="finalproj_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From the 2 graphs above, we have following observations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Around Jan/Feb and May/June period, there are huge changes for both <code>GME</code> and <code>AMC</code> in terms of risk.</p></li>
<li><p><code>GME</code> has relatively higher risk than <code>AMC</code> as <code>GME</code>’s moving standard deviation reached more than 100 while the highest moving standard deviation of <code>AMC</code> is about 13.</p></li>
<li><p>The risk of <code>GME</code> is highest in the first wave during Jan/Feb period while the risk of <code>AMC</code> is highest in the second wave during May/Jun period. This can be supported by the general knowledge that <code>GME</code> is the leading stock in the 1st wave while <code>AMC</code> is the leading stock in the 2nd wave.</p></li>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.2.3.3</span> Most Popular Stocks</h4>
<p>Besides studying about the 2 most representative stocks in WSBs, which are <code>GME</code> and <code>AMC</code> respectively, we could also study some other WSB stocks, which are not as popular as <code>GME</code> and <code>AMC</code> but they are still very representative and have received a lot of public attention.</p>
<p>Therefore, we extend our study to the top 10 mentioned stocks in the posts of WallStreetBets sub-reddit group. These 10 stocks has been identified in the Chapter 3 - Cleaning, which are: <code>GME</code>, <code>AMC</code>, <code>BB</code>, <code>NOK</code>, <code>SND</code>, <code>NAKD</code>, <code>PLTR</code>, <code>CLOV</code>, <code>RETA</code>, <code>MAR</code>, respectively.</p>
