Yahoo Finance provides financial news, data and commentary including stock quotes, press releases, financial reports, and original content. Reddit API is the official portal Reddit created to facilitate developers in their app-building endeavors, where developers can retrieve the constantly updating feeds of Reddit posts. Google Trends is a website by Google that analyzes the popularity of top search queries in Google Search across various regions and languages. From the above data sources we collected and used three major datasets: Stock dataset from Yahoo Finance, Reddit posts dataset from Reddit API and Google search score dataset from Google Trends. Each member in our team was responsible for downloading one dataset from corresponding data sources. More details of the datasets are as following: 2.1 Stock dataset This data mainly contains the prices and volume of the stocks that are discussed in r/wallstreetbets subreddit, which help to indicate the stock performance. We uses the R package quantmod to download the data, which is sourced from Yahoo Finance.

Since r/wallstreetbets subreddit, the heavily shorted stocks as well as the disagreement between retailer traders and professional traders were relatively new to the general public, we assume that they would actively search in Google to follow this event. Therefore, using Google search data can also serve as another indicator to show the public attention. This data can be found from Google Trends.
