Previously, there are not much redditers discussing in this subreddit group. Only until January 2021, there was one person started to share his investment in GameStop, with the ticker to be GME, and explained his rationale. This posts started to get the public attention and also, the redditers discovered that GME has been over short by some major financial institute, i.e. short interest is greater than 100%. This attracted more and more people into the r/wallstreetbets. The newly joined people are mainly young retailer traders who have little background in investment knowledge and risk management. They were not satisfied with the over short on some stocks by major Wall Street companies, so they started to buy those stocks, mostly GME. They were especially angered by the Citron Research’s comment, which predicted the GME’s stock price would decrease continuously. This actually initiated a short squeeze on GME, pushing their stock prices up significantly. After a few days, Elon Musk also tweeted out a link to the r/wallstreetbets subreddit, which further enlightened the redditers and broadcasted to even more people all over the world. Later on, the official r/wallstreetbets Discord server was banned due to the “hateful and discriminatory content” and Robinhood started to restricted the trade of heavily shorted stocks such as GME, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC), BlackBerry Limited (BB), Nokia (NOK), and etc. Other trading platform also followed Robinhood to restrict the trade of those stocks, which were TD Ameritrade, E-Trade, and Webull respectively. There were 2 waves of major short squeeze led by the participants in this subreddit, which were around January/Feburary and May/June period. Also, the focus of the 2 waves were different, while for the 1st wave, GME is the focus stock, AMC overtaken GME became the focus stock in the 2nd wave. In this project, we would like to collect stock related data, Reddit related data (mainly posts) as well as the Google search related data to generate visualization and get some useful insights. We’ll be trying to answer following questions through this study: How big is the impact of reddit wallstreetbet? I.e. no. of news, downloads of Robinhood and other trading apps, For each targeted stock, what’s the relationship between reddit posts and stock price/volume etc. Why does Wallstreetbet choose these target stocks? What’re their similarities? How do their choices change as time evolves? Gamestop, AMC, Blueberry, Nokia, SPCE, PLTR, TSLA. In the following chapters, we will use data source to plot graphs, trying to answer the above questions. Also, we would like to explore other aspects from the graphs and come up with more conclusions.

"],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Stock dataset 2.2 Reddit posts dataset 2.3 Google search score dataset", " Chapter 2 Data sources The primary data sources for this project are Yahoo Finance, Pushshift Reddit API and Google Trends. Yahoo Finance provides financial news, data and commentary including stock quotes, press releases, financial reports, and original content. The pushshift.io Reddit API was designed and created by the /r/datasets mod team to help provide enhanced functionality and search capabilities for searching Reddit comments and submissions. Google Trends is a website by Google that analyzes the popularity of top search queries in Google Search across various regions and languages. From the above data sources we collected and used three major datasets: Stock dataset from Yahoo Finance, Reddit posts dataset from Reddit API and Google search score dataset from Google Trends. Each member in our team was responsible for downloading one dataset from corresponding data sources. More details of the datasets are as following: 2.1 Stock dataset This dataset mainly contains the prices and volume of the stocks that are discussed in r/wallstreetbets subreddit, which help to indicate the stock performance. We used the R package quantmod to download the data, which is sourced from Yahoo Finance. Table 2.1: Major columns used Column Name Type Description Date Date Date of the prices and volume Open numeric Open price High numeric Highest price of the day Low numeric Lowest price of the day Close numeric Close price adjusted for splits Volume numeric Number of shares traded Adjusted numeric Adjusted close price adjusted for splits and dividend and/or capital gain distributions. 2.2 Reddit posts dataset This dataset contains the posts in r/wallstreetbets subreddit, which we used to extract out the information about the stocks discussed and the post attitude. We created a python script to pull the data we need from Pushshift Reddit API and write to the csv files. Due to Github’s limit on file size, we slice the data by day to create one file for each day. The Pushshift Reddit API has the advantage over the official Reddit API that it gives full functionality for searching Reddit data, which is very helpful for us to only download the data we need. Table 2.2: Major columns used Column Name Type Description postid character unique identifier for post author character post creator created_utc integer post created time in utc timezone permalink character URL to the post score integer number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes title character post title selftext character post content Issues with this dataset: 1. Only the current state of the posts can be downloaded. Because the majority of the discussions on r/wallsteetbets we are interested in happened earlier this year, many of the posts are either deleted by the author or removed by the administrator. As a result, we can no longer access those posts’ content and perform analysis on top it. See [Section header text] for more details. 2. Because of the big volume of the posts and the large size of the data, we are unable to download all posts over the complete time period. Instead, we only download the posts created in Jan, Feb, May, Jun and Jul, which are the months most of the discussions that we care about happened in. 2.3 Google search score dataset Dataset: combined_news.csv and combined_web.csv This dataset mainly contains the website search and news search information in Google. Since r/wallstreetbets subreddit, the heavily shorted stocks as well as the disagreement between retailer traders and professional traders were relatively new to the general public, we assume that they would actively search in Google to follow this event. Therefore, using Google search data can also serve as another indicator to show the public attention. Both csv files are downloaded from Google Trends. Google assigns a search score for each keyword each work. The scores represent search interest relative to the highest point for the given region and time. We are focusing on United State for the time period starting from 2021-01-01. Table 2.3: Major columns used Column Name Type Description postid character unique identifier for post author character post creator created_utc integer post created time in utc timezone permalink character URL to the post score integer number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes title character post title selftext character post content "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Google Trends Data Transformation 3.2 Reddit Data Transformation 3.3 Stock Data Transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Google Trends Data Transformation In the Google Trends source data, it assigns a number to each keyword for each period(week). The numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term. A score of &lt;1 means there is some search interest but it’s extremely low. We are replacing all &lt;1’s with 0.5, so that we can keep the data frame consistent with all scores as numeric data. We also need to tidy the dataset because some of the column names are not names of variables, but values of a variable: the original column names represent the values of the keyword variable and the values in the columns represents the values of score, and each row represents 5 observations, not one. To tidy the dataset, we make the offending columns into a new pair of variables using pivot_longer. After cleaning, it contains 3 rows and 260 records. Column Type Description week date Which week? keyword string Search keyword score numeric Search interest score 3.2 Reddit Data Transformation 3.2.1 Parse Stock tickers from Reddit posts These 2 waves are mainly caused by the discussion in the sub-Reddit group, WallStreetBets. Therefore, we have downloaded the Reddit posts that have been posted during these 2 periods and also extend some time before and after the wave. This is because we believe it takes some time for the initial posts to get public attention and then the posts starts to influence the stock price. Also, by including the posts that are slightly after the wave, we can do a comparison during and after the wave to check how big the effects of the posts in the sub-Reddit group on the stock price. Therefore, we have downloaded the data for the whole January, February, May, June and July, which have completely cover the 2 waves and also cover some extension. Also, we have parsed the posts on daily basis, which also helps to show the change over time. Before starting to do the analysis, we need to find the list of WSB stocks first. the Generally speaking, all the stocks that have been discussed in the WallStreetBets sub-Reddit group should be considered as WSB stock. However, given the time frame that we considered is relatively long, which is 5 months, also, the WSBs has caught huge public attention, which also attracted a lot of new redditers. Therefore, there are many people participate in the discussion and the stocks mentioned are quite diversified. In this project, we will only focus on the top 10 stocks that have been mentioned in the posts. In the source data, which are the daily posts csv files, there are 2 columns that may contains the stock information, which are title and selftext respectively. Therefore, we need to first find the stock ticker from these 2 columns. Generally, the stock ticker should start with $ and followed by 2 to 4 consecutive upper case letters. However, in the source data, there is no $ exists, we cannot get the exact stock data but rather, we can extract out the list of possible stock tickers by extracting all the sub-strings which are consists of 2 to 4 consecutive upper case letters. We have used regex in python to extract out the list of possible stock tickers from title and selftext respectively for each of the daily reddit csv and then we combine these 2 lists together. However, there might be the case that the possible stock tickers are mentioned by the redditers both in title and selftext. In this case, we define that the possible stock ticker should be considered only once. Therefore, after combining the 2 lists together, we also need to drop duplicates to make sure there is no double count of possible stock ticker from both title and selftext. With that, we can make sure that the count of every possible stock ticker in 1 row is at most 1. Then, we start to count the possible stock ticker and summarize the count information into a dictionary. For every daily reddit csv, we will get a possible stock ticker count dictionary and combine them together to get the final count dictionary and stored it into the clean data folder. Now, in r, we can read the file which contains the information of the final possible stock ticker count. Since we are only interested in the top 10 WSB stocks, we need to re-order the data frame according to the word count in descending order. We noticed that there are some invalid tickers exists in the data frame, but that is expected since there is no perfect way to extract out the stock ticker due to the lack of $ in the data source, so we manually go through the data frame and select out the top 10 tickers, which are: GME, AMC, BB,NOK, SND, NAKD, PLTR, CLOV, RETA, MAR, respectively. 3.2.2 Subreddit overview 3.2.3 Frequent keywords in Reddit posts 3.2.4 Sentiment Analysis on Reddit Posts regarding GME 3.3 Stock Data Transformation "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Reddit post dataset 4.2 Google Trend dataset", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Reddit post dataset We first create the missing values plots, both count and percent, for the reddit post dataset. We can observe from the missing value plots that there are 4 different missing patterns, which are complete cases (47.19%), missing selftext (45.08%), missing both selftext and author (4.77%), and missing author only (2.95%). Therefore, out of the 7 variables in the dataset, only 2 variables might be missing, which are selftext and author respectively. Among the 2 variables, 49.85% of the selftext is missing while only 7.72% of the author is missing. Looking into the selftext column in the original dataset, we noticed that there are 3 major levels that account for ~90% of the data, which are “removed”, \"\" and “deleted”. Consulted the reddit documents, we found that “removed” means the post is either removed by the moderators of the subreddit group or the administrator; “deleted” means the post is deleted by the content author; \"\" appears when a post doesn’t have body text or a post’s body contains pictures only. In this regard, we are only considering “removed” and “deleted” as NA, \"“s are considered as valid inputs. About 45% of the posts are”removed\", which means the level of censorship is relatively high. ## # A tibble: 95,599 × 3 ## selftext count percent ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 &quot;removed&quot; 444923 44.5 ## 2 &quot;&quot; 408961 40.9 ## 3 &quot;deleted&quot; 46214 4.62 ## 4 &quot;Your daily trading discussion thread Please keep the shitpostin… 87 0.01 ## 5 &quot;Title&quot; 72 0.01 ## 6 &quot;To the moon&quot; 51 0.01 ## 7 &quot;Your daily hype thread Please keep the shitposting to a maximum… 39 0 ## 8 &quot;Your daily trading discussion thread Please keep the shitpostin… 39 0 ## 9 &quot;AMC&quot; 37 0 ## 10 &quot;That is all&quot; 37 0 ## # … with 95,589 more rows Looking at the author column, 7.72% of the posts are missing author. We noticed that 61.76% of the posts that don’t have an author are also missing selftext. ## # A tibble: 7 × 3 ## selftext count percent ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 &lt;NA&gt; 46213 61.7 ## 2 &quot;&quot; 28631 38.2 ## 3 &quot;CROX are the official footwear of going to the moon nothing else … 1 0 ## 4 &quot;I think he s gone and I think he has soled all of this stocks and… 1 0 ## 5 &quot;taken from r investing full credit to OP u MasterCookSwag wanted … 1 0 ## 6 &quot;Welp down 354 today could be worse for sure Just here to say I ha… 1 0 ## 7 &quot;you should absolutely care about it and learn from it Figure out … 1 0 These missing values wouldn’t impact our analysis, because we are looking at the data at the aggregate level. Our analysis only cares about the change of the count of the posts in particular period of time. Even though those posts are deleted or removed in a later time, we should still include them in our analysis. 4.2 Google Trend dataset We created the missing values plots, both count and percent, for two Google trend datasets and found there’s no missing value in both datasets "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Stock Data and Information 5.2 r/WallStreetBets Reddit Post Data 5.3 What’s the impact of r/wallstreetbet?", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Stock Data and Information 5.1.1 Stock Candlestick Plot The most representative WSB stocks are GME and AMC. Also, these 2 stocks are the top 2 most widely discussed stocks in WallStreetBet sub-reddit analysed in Chapter 3 - cleaning. Therefore, we choose these 2 stocks and show the stock price and volume change in the past one year. The graph is interactive, where we can choose select the period of time that we want to focus on by dragging on the bottom graph. This allows us to zoom in and see the graph clearly. Also, we can choose the specific period, i.e. the past 1 year or past 6 months data by pressing the corresponding buttons above and we can easily go back to the main graph by pressing the “RESET” botton. ## [1] &quot;GME&quot; ## [1] &quot;AMC&quot; From the above 2 graphs, we can clearly see that there are 2 waves of the WSB stocks, which are indicated by the sudden spike of the stock price as well as the sudden increase of the volume. These 2 waves are around January - Feburary and May - June period respectively. These 2 graphs actually double confirm with our previous claims. Also, the gray and red line in the price graph is the Bollinger Bands, which is the price level at 1 standard deviation level above and below the sample moving average of the price, which is able to capture the volatility of the stock. Generally, Bollinger bands is used to check whether prices are relatively high or low as comparing to the historical price. Here, we can see that for the beginning of the 2 waves, the price of both GME and AMC break the Bollinger upper bands, which suggests that the price of these 2 stocks are extremely high as comparing to the historical data. However, the Bollinger bands also adjusted themselves quickly to accommodate the sudden price change, so we can see that the price of these 2 stocks fall back within the Bollinger bands after a short period of time. 5.1.2 Stock Risk Assessment While the previous 2 graphs mainly focus on the price and volume aspects, there is one more aspect that are very important to the stock, which is risk. Risk can be measured by the standard deviation. Here, we would like to explore how the risk of the 2 stocks change before and after the 2 waves, which are GME and AMC respectively. Thus, we need to calculate the moving standard deviation of the 2 stocks over time. Here, we take the closing price to be the one calculating the moving standard deviation since closing price is the most representative price among all the 5 prices. For each month, it is about 4 weeks and the stock market only opens in weekdays, thus, there are about 4*5 = 20 days with stock data every month. Therefore, we set the moving window to be 20, which is roughly about 1 month time. Also, we take the data since the start of last year because we want to see whether there is any difference in terms of the risk of GME and AMC by comparing the moving standard deviation before and after the 2 waves. ## [1] &quot;GME&quot; ## [1] &quot;AMC&quot; From the 2 graphs above, we have following observations: Around Jan/Feb and May/June period, there are huge changes for both GME and AMC in terms of risk. GME has relatively higher risk than AMC as GME’s moving standard deviation reached more than 100 while the highest moving standard deviation of AMC is about 13. The risk of GME is highest in the first wave during Jan/Feb period while the risk of AMC is highest in the second wave during May/Jun period. This can be supported by the general knowledge that GME is the leading stock in the 1st wave while AMC is the leading stock in the 2nd wave. 5.1.3 Most Popular Stocks Besides studying about the 2 most representative stocks in WSBs, which are GME and AMC respectively, we could also study some other WSB stocks, which are not as popular as GME and AMC but they are still very representative and have received a lot of public attention. Therefore, we extend our study to the top 10 mentioned stocks in the posts of WallStreetBets sub-reddit group. These 10 stocks has been identified in the Chapter 3 - Cleaning, which are: GME, AMC, BB, NOK, SND, NAKD, PLTR, CLOV, RETA, MAR, respectively. Now, we can plot bar chart to show the count of posts that have mentioned about the stock for each stock. From the graph above, we can see that GME and AMC are the dominant 2 dominant stocks that were discussed in WallStreeBets sub-reddit, which appears in around 45.79% and 25.41% of the total posts respectively. However, `BB, NOK, SND and the other stocks have also received some public attention, which are worthwhile to include them in the future analysis to get a bigger and clearer picture regarding the WSB stocks. 5.1.4 Time Series of the Top 10 Stocks Now, we want to study how the top 10 stocks’ prices move over the past one year. Again, since the closing price is the most representative price among all the 5 prices, we just use closing price to calculate the daily return change over time. The equation used to calculate the daily stock return is that: (current closing price - previous closing price) / previous closing price * 100%. From the above graph, we can have the following observation: AMC has the highest daily return in the end of January 2021, which was around 300% increase as comparing to the previous day price. GME and AMC’s price change start to fluctuate a lot since the mid of the January, which marks the beginning of the WSB 1st wave. During this period, they started to get public attention. In 27th Jan, the 1st wave of WSB reaches the peak, where GME, AMC, BB, NOK, NAKD achieved their highest daily return change on the same day. Generally, the change in daily return in the 1st WSB wave is higher than the change in daily return in the 2nd WSB wave. This occurs since the price of the stocks has increases a lot in the first wave already, so in terms of the return (%), it is very hard to have as big change as that in 1st wave. The stocks are included in different waves, whilePLTR is the stock that is only active in 1st wave, there are other stocks that are active only in the 2nd wave, which are CLOV, SND, RETA respectively. For GME, AMC, BB, NOK, NAKD, they are active in both of the waves. However, for MAR, its stock price does not change much through out the 2 waves. 5.1.5 Correlations between top 10 mentioned stocks We removed CLOV from the ticker for 2020, because it went public in 2021. 5.2 r/WallStreetBets Reddit Post Data In this section, we mainly explore the posts in r/WallStreetBets sub-reddit. We would like to explore how this event affects the r/WallStreetBets sub-reddit group and how the posts affect the stock price. Also, we also want to conduct the sentiment analysis on the posts to get the general information about the massive post. 5.2.1 r/WallStreetBets metrics We would like to access how this event affects the r/WallStreetBets sub-reddit group from the following 3 aspects, which are: subscriber growth and daily active users and posts count. Subscriber growth can show how many new users are attracted to the sub-reddit group by this event. The definition of daily active users is that the user has posted at least 1 post on that day and it can show how many people are actively contributing to the community and event and posts counts can directly reflect the popularity of the sub-reddit group. Also, since we want to compare the popularity of the sub-reddit group before and after the events in order to show how big the effect of the event on the sub-reddit group, we choose to display the data in the past 2 year. From the above 3 graphs, we have the following observations: There are very few joiners to the r/WallStreetBets sub-reddit group before and after the 1st wave of WSB. However, there are huge amount of new users joining to the sub-reddit group daily at the end of the January, peaked at 27th Jan, 2021 with 4443 new joiners. Even there are 2nd WSB wave, not much new joiners are attracted to the sub-reddit group, which means that it is the same group of people who participated in the 1st WSB wave initiate and participate the 2nd WSB wave again. The daily active users spiked at 28th Jan, 2021 with 117426 distinct users have posted at least 1 post. We can see that during the 1st and 2nd WSB wave, the daily active users increased a lot as comparing to the before and after the wave. The daily active users and the post counts spiked 1 day after the new joiner’s peak, which means that the new joiners are very active in the begin and they gradually loss the interest in this topic over time. The effect of the WSB wave lasts for quite some time, since it is only around early March, 2021, the daily active user are back to the normal level. The posts created during the 1st WSB wave are much higher than that during the 2nd WSB wave, therefore, the 1st WSB wave attract more public attention as comparing to the 2nd WSB wave. From the posts count graph, we can see that there are 2 sub-waves in both 1st and 2nd WSB wave, indicating that the redditers are continuously follow the event and it is not one time thing. The posts count of GME is much higher than that of AMC during the 1st wave, therefore, GME is the primary stock in the 1st wave. While GME and AMC are widely discussed during that period, there are still many other stocks and topics that posts discussed. 5.2.2 What are the most popular keywords? Now, we would like to take a closer look at the posts in r/WallStreetBets sub-reddit group and we want to get the board picture about the vast majority of the posts. The above word cloud shows the most mentioned words across all the posts created in Jan, Feb, May, Jun, July 2021. We can see that gme, amc, buy, hold, short are some words that are most commonly mentioned in the high influencing posts. 5.3 What’s the impact of r/wallstreetbet? 5.3.1 Reddit metrics vs. stock price and volume Now, we want to examine how the posts counts in r/WallStreetBets sub-reddit group affect the stock price as well as the stock trading volume. Since GME and AMC are the 2 most representative stocks in the 2 WSB waves,we choose these 2 stocks as the study object. From the graphs above, we have the following observations: Generally there is no relationship between the posts count and daily price change for both AMC and GME. Only for some dates in the 1st and 2nd WSB wave, i.e. 2021-01-27, when there are huge post counts, the price change also very high. GME generally has higher daily price change than AMC. The maximum daily change of GME is around 200% while the maximum daily change of AMC is only around 30% The association between the posts counts and volume is tighter than the association between the posts counts and price change. There is some weak correlation between posts counts and volume, which is the bigger the post count is, the higher the volume is. AMC generally has much higher volume than GME, this is because that the price of AMC is much lower than GME, therefore, people can afford to buy more AMC stocks. 5.3.2 Sentiment analysis on Reddit posts regarding GME Since there are 2 WSB waves, we would like to study the posts in these 2 periods separately to compare whether there is any change in terms of the sentiments. Also, for the 10 different sentiment, we manually assign them into 2 categories, which are positive and negative sentiments respectively. The positive sentiments includes: positive, trust, anticipation, joy and surprise while the negative sentiments includes: negative, anger, fear, sadness and disgust. From the graphs above, we have the following observations: The sentiments of the posts are dominated by positive related sentiment, i.e. positive, trust and anticipation. We can see the 2 most popular sentiment among all posts in both 1st and 2nd WSB waves are positive and trust. The overall sentiments of posts in the 1st WSB wave is slightly more negative than that in the 2nd WSB wave as we can see that the percentage posts with negative sentiment is higher in 1st WSB wave than that in the 2nd WSB wave and also in the top 6 sentiments in 1st WSB wave, there are the 3 negative related sentiments while there are only 2 negative related sentiments in the top 6 sentiments in 2nd WSB wave. There are much more posts created during the 1st WSB wave as comparing to that created during the 2nd WSB wave since more word count means more posts created. Also, we would like to explore whether there is any relationship between the sentiment of the posts and the stock price, so we use GEM as a case to study the relationship. Also, we introduce a new parameter, called positive percentage, which is calculated by total positive word counts / total word counts the on daily basis. Above plot analyzes if the sentiments on r/WallStreetBets had any impact on GME’s stock price. 5.3.3 General Public’s interests on Google In this section, we mainly explore the posts in r/WallStreetBets Reddit. We believe that the whole event , i.e. r/wallstreetbets subreddit, short squeeze and the associated stocks are relatively new to the public, therefore, they are very likely to search some of the related keywords in Google to understand the whole event. Therefore, in this section, we would like to use the Google search related data to explore the general public attention towards this event. 5.3.3.1 Interest over time In Google, people can search in the website and if they already know the basic information about the event and they follow the event closely and only interested in the most recent news, therefore, we would like to zoom one level down into Google News to understand the topics that the close followers are interested in. We have identified some keywords from the word cloud based on the size of the words there. However, there are some commonly searched word in our daily life, i.e. stock, market, buy and etc, so we need to exclude them from the list. Therefore, we choose GME, AMC, wallStreetBet, reddit, robinhood to be the key words. However, in the source data, there are misalignment in the word format, i.e. Google data source use GameStop to represent GME, so we choose the closest word form, which are: AMC,GameStop, r/WallStreetBets,Reddit,Robinhood respectively. Also, since we want to compare the public interest towards these key words before and after the events in order to show how big the effect of the event on the public interest, we choose to display the data during the time period 2020-11-15 to 2021-11-15. In the above 2 graphs, the x-axis is the date. For the y-aixs score, it represents search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term. From the above 2 graphs, we have the following observations: This event has attract huge public attention around the end of Jan, 2021 and start of Feb, 2021 period of time. GME caught the highest attention during the 1st wave of the WSB, while AMC caught the highest attention during the 2nd wave of the WSB. Generally, the 1st wave of WSB caught more public attention than the 2nd wave of WSB. For the professionals and the closely followed people, more news reported the GME and Robinhood related topics, since they are the one using Robinhood to trade GME. While for the general public, they are more care about the different stocks, i.e. GME and AMC. Reddit always has relatively high search interest, which indicates that there are constant active users in Reddit, while for r/WallStreetBets, before and after the event, only very few people use it. Therefore, the active users in this sub-reddit is not very high, which coincident with our previous conclusion from the daily active user graph.

You can also find code here in our github repo. The interactive plot shows the selected 10 stock price related to a highlighted date. Our data source for the plot is yahoo finance. You can also find the data here under the data folder of our repo. 7.3 Instructions for using the map The plot is initialized with 10 lines showing the stock price aligned with date Dec 31, 2020. We provide the following interactive options: Users can hover the mouse over the plot to align the price with any date. The y value will become price in a day divided by the price in the highlighted day. Users can click the legends to select the stocks they want to view. Click twice to bring the stock back.
