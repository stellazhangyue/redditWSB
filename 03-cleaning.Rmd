## Google Trends Data Transformation
In the Google Trends source data, it assigns a number to each keyword for each period(week). The numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term. A score of <1 means there is some search interest but it's extremely low. We are replacing all <1's with 0.5, so that we can keep the data frame consistent with all scores as numeric data. 

We also need to tidy the dataset because some of the column names are not names of variables, but values of a variable: the original column names represent the values of the `keyword` variable and the values in the columns represents the values of `score`, and each row represents 5 observations, not one. To tidy the dataset, we make the offending columns into a new pair of variables using `pivot_longer`. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
combined_web <- readr::read_csv("data/gtrends/combined_web.csv")

combined_web_clean <- combined_web %>%
  mutate(`r/WallStreetBets` = replace(`r/WallStreetBets`, `r/WallStreetBets` == "<1", 0.5)) %>%
  mutate(`r/WallStreetBets` = as.numeric(`r/WallStreetBets`)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = !Week,
             names_to = "keyword",
             values_to = "score"
             )
  
combined_news <- readr::read_csv("data/gtrends/combined_news.csv")
combined_news_clean <- combined_news %>%
  mutate(`r/WallStreetBets` = replace(`r/WallStreetBets`, `r/WallStreetBets` == "<1", 0.5),
         `GameStop` = replace(`GameStop`, `GameStop` == "<1", 0.5)) %>%
  mutate(`r/WallStreetBets` = as.numeric(`r/WallStreetBets`),
         `GameStop` = as.numeric(`GameStop`)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = !Week,
             names_to = "keyword",
             values_to = "score"
             )
